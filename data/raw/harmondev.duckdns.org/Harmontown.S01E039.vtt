00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
Hello Denver, Colorado, you lucky, lucky sons of bitches, Parment Town is in session.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm sorry about that sons of bitches thing, you guys seem pretty nice.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
Welcome to the stage, won't you please, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:39.000 --> 00:55.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, Denver Town, City on a mountain, Pussies blowing, sorry, Pussies like found, sorry.

00:55.000 --> 01:08.000
Pussies like a river, I'm an orgasm giver, sorry, I've already been getting pretty gross, sorry about that Denver, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, pussy, sorry, alright.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I fucked your mama.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Wow, you came right out the gate.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I said, I said, I said city on a mountain because I was thinking about the elevation here.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Right.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
And then it was like fountain, rhymes with mountain.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Right.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
And then, and then it was like, but the unfortunate dot connection between pussy and fountain and that makes you think of all kinds of weird stuff.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I don't want, I don't want it to be that kind of show.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm worried about you, if you could do a lot of rap, I mean, I want you to do a lot of rapping tonight, I want you to do your little toddler dance, but at this elevation.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
It is, yeah, I wonder if there's a thing here, I want to, you know, we're exactly a mile above sea level.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Exactly.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Exactly a mile above sea level.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
5,280 feet, or your money back.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
And I swear, last time I was in Denver, yeah, I could feel the effects of it, being at this altitude.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I think I'm going to die because I'm going to be dancing around.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
You're not going to die, you're just going to pass out.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
And the audience will be concerned.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
You're not, are you here by yourself?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh, what's your name?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I don't want to pick on you.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
My name's Ryan.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Is anybody else alone?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
You are?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
We got three down front.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Oh, really?

02:25.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, that seems like a shitty seat, do you want to sit at Ryan's table?

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Hey, it's called Harvintown, not Denver Improv Town.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
They can absolutely suck it.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, they can't really, yeah.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
What's your name, sir?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I'll pay them a lot of money, I'll write them a check for you.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
You want to sit there or sit there?

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
I said we got Drew, Drew just moved down from, we're rearranging, so now Drew and Ryan are sitting together.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
All right, and then that guy that looks exactly like Stephen Schraub, that's his brother.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Okay, wow, Ryan, I hope you wanted the company because now...

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
A table of one is a table for four now, I love that.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
And a finder's fee?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Cheese stick snuffer.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh, he's a cheese stick snuffer.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
He's a cheese, a cheese stick snuffer.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
You grab a hold of your cheese sticks.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
He's like no other.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
He'll sit for people down to eat their cheese.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
He's the kind of guy that loves cheese.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Loves it right between knees.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It's dumb, stupid.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And not legally clearable, neither.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
No, I don't think anybody would sue you for doing that to that song.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
All right, what are the names here we got?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm Stephen.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Stephen.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Drew.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Drew.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Adam.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Adam.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Try to remember that.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Could one of you be named Dan Thoreau or something?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Stephen, Drew, Ryan, Adam, right?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
All right, the Council of Doom.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
That is going to make it hard for me to get out there and work the crowd.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
And if there's a fire, we're all going to die.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
Stephen, you sitting this close to the stage is going to be some hot beard on beard action

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
when Spencer comes out.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Let's get these beards together right now.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
All right.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Beard on beard.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
What's his name?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
God damn it.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Stephen.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Drew.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Andrew.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
John.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Steve.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Ryan.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
John.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Jason.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Adam.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Bob.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
And Tim.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Jess, we need more creative parents in this world.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Speaking as a Dan, we got to...

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
How about Jeffrey Brian Davis?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
That's pretty white.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
God damn it.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I wish people's names were like...

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, I mean, I've said this before.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I want...

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
You should have...

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
For the first 11 years of your life, you should just be called kid.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Because who gives a shit about you?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Like, what do you know?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
You don't know nothing.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
It's just kid.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
It's kid number eight, kid number nine.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
And then on your 12th birthday, you should either pick your name

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
or have everybody give you a name.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
It's like, if you're an asshole, your name should be asshole.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Or if you're like, in the eagles, they could call you eagle, you know?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I care.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I just wanted to be specific.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
What if you're in the eagles' assholes?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah, exactly.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Then you're in the asshole.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
That's exactly...

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I want to...

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
We got to fix society, Jeff.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
We got to go to the moon and we got to call it.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
I think your natural instinct, there was a man sitting here alone

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
and we found out that there's lots of singles here tonight.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
But it's not a surprise with my crowd.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
It's not a couple's show.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
I guess I'd be more surprised if there was lots of single ladies here.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, that would be a weird thing.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Woo!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Bachelorette party!

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
My beard is getting really long on the road

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
and so it's absorbing a lot of vodka.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I don't know what to talk about and what not to talk about.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We'll edit it out if it's not fruitful.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
But really, save it for later.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
You mean the topic or the vodka?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
You mean the vodka.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
It's one of the ladies that came here to hook up.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Okay, so John, Jake, Ryan, Tim, Steve.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
You got Steve right through.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Andrew and Bob.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Okay.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Adam.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Alright, we'll have you guys up later.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Jeff, you're back.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
You were gone for two episodes.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Thank you very much.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I had to leave Harmontown sadly.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
It was weird to be away from you guys for two days.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I went and joined Ryan Stiles and Greg Proups and Joel Murray in the Northwest

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
and we did three shows.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
You guys had a day off.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
You guys went to the shittiest places in the world.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
I leave the group for two days and they are at Dave and Buster's.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
It's possible that you may be the force that brings us to more exquisite places,

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
but it's also possible that in Kansas City, the hotel was next to one of these malls

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
where there's just like a dinosaur restaurant and the stand-up club we're performing at.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
And it was like Dave Coulier's there on Wednesday and J.J. Walker's there on Friday.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
And then it said like John Davis and Dan Harmon in their nationally televised podcast,

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
you could be in the show. That's what it said.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I didn't know that we were televised this.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
We are safely away from Kansas City and the people that came to that show,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
the 60 Harmonians in that audience, I want to say I love you very much,

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
but that club sucks.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
That was bad news.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
It was like being in a driver's ed class like in the back of a mall.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It was not made for us.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It was not made for our people.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
It did show up or bummed out.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
I think it affects me.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
I don't know.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Do you think I'm having a good show right now?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
We're not talking about anything.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
What am I doing?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Let's make with the entertainment.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Entertainment section.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Entertainment section.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Entertainment section.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
She's about to entertain your balls off right now.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Welcome to the entertainment section.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I booked your mama obvious right of erection.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I booked her instant a day in last week.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I booked her mama so hard.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I went to Widow's Peak.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
It's a special place.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Nick Nolte lives there.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
It's named after him because of his hair.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
His hair is a Widow's Peak.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I don't need to explain myself.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
See you next week.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I booked your mama in a hill in a valley.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I booked your mama until her name was Sally.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Fourth right.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Wasn't that a comic?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I booked your mama on a comic.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I booked your mama in Denver.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I booked your mama and she doesn't remember.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
It's not my fault.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
That wasn't great.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I didn't put anything in her drink.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
It was great.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
She had a good time.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Her damn ninja was brought on by my dick.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Whoa, my dick.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
The altitude, Jeff, is...

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I can't rap at this altitude.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Don't blame the altitude.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I can't rap at this altitude.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Don't blame the cheese dick.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
We're going to be a mile above sea level right now.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
We are exactly, exactly one mile above sea level.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
This is the place to be when the polar ice caps melt.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
This is going to be the last place.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
This is dry land, right?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
This is where the...

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Oh, fuck, this altitude.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
You know who's really good at rapping?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
I mean, a lot of people.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
A lot of professional people.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Dr. Dre.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Spencer.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
We found out on the bus last night.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Do we get Spencer up here?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Spencer.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
He's very concerned about being put on the spot

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
about his rapping.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
But the truth is, in...

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Spencer, everybody.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Spencer Clinton.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
The dungeon master.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
I don't know if you guys are avid podcast listeners.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I assume you bought tickets on that side.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
You may recall that back in Los Angeles,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
when we decided to bring...

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
That's Raquel.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Make sure you tip her.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And I don't know everyone's name,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
but I thought that would be impressive if I did that.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
What's your name right there?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
What's your name?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Maria.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Maria.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Yeah, don't tip her.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, don't.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
She's working...

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
No, she's working the same tables as Raquel.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Raquel doesn't know why she's here.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Never met her in her life.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
She's just following Raquel around.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Taking drinks away that Raquel puts down.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Maria was fired from this place 15 years ago.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah, Maria.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Some say she died here.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
From a certain angle,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
you can still see her haunting other waitresses.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah, there's a photo of Damarera on the wall

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
and Maria's in the background,

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
which is weird because Damarera was famous in the 20s.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Shining.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
So Dan...

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Wait, what was I talking about?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, I'll get you back on check.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I went away for a while.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I haven't heard Minneapolis,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
because I didn't get a chance to listen to it.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
And Kansas City hasn't dropped yet,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
so I haven't heard that one either.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So I don't really know what went on.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
I heard that you had the basic upshot with the shows

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
where Spencer filled me in on the D&D campaign.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But story structure-wise,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
there's a thing that you put on Tumblr

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
about the fact that you felt like,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
if you're the hero of the story,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
the fact that you haven't changed at all.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Did you discuss this in the show?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I talked about it a little bit.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
It was Kansas City, kind of, right over their heads.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
This isn't the time to talk about it.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Nothing gets over the heads in Denver.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
They're a mile above sea level.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
You did this really fascinating little video on Tumblr.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
It was amazing, because you didn't edit it.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
You didn't stutter once.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
It was really good.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Second take.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
That's nice of you to be honest about that.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
The altitude.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
What is that?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Are you like John Herd and Alien?

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
How are your two days off-planet?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
It was great. Let's have some more breakfast.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Let's have some more breakfast.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
So, you're saying story structure-wise,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
if you're the hero of this tour that you're going on,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
the fact that you haven't changed

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
probably makes you the villain.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Possibly, yeah.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Possibly makes you the villain.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
It certainly makes me at least an extra,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
or a horse.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
But Spencer released this beautifully written blog

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
about his awakening,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
or his really self-examination.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
He's on a journey.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
He's meeting the outside world.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
He's coming to grips with other people

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
and what that means about him.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Spencer learned on this journey

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
that everyone in the world could be into him.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
No one would ever understand him.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I'm not putting words into it.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
That sounds pretentious, putting words into his mouth like that.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
But that's, like, learned.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Is that about right, Spencer?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I wouldn't phrase it that way.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
No, it would make you sound like a dick, yeah.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
But you got to a point where it's like,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
people were throwing the equivalent of panties at you.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
That was a wool cap.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
There were dudes throwing wool caps at you.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
That's as close as this crowd's going to get to throwing panties.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
This crowd is a practical crowd.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
If they have panties, they're using them.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
A hipster threw his wool cap at you and said,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I don't need this anymore.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
You take it.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
And then, even though that seems like a thing,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
it's like, oh, I would like that.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I would like to be able to push a button

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
and feel what it's like to feel everyone liking me,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
everyone appreciating me, everyone accepting me.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
And you said in your blog entry to paraphrase you,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
to extrapolate what you were saying,

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
that the rival at that goal actually led you to the realization

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
that there will still never be a certain connection

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
between you and other people.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
You could be alone for the rest of your life, Spencer.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I will be. I mean, that's a given.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
So this motherfuckers on a journey.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I'm just a fat guy on a bus.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
So we're going to find out that he's the hero of this.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
And that makes me like Jafar.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
I didn't mean to say it like Christopher Walken, but...

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
It's Jafar.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
That makes me like Jafar.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
To his Aladdin.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
My story circle is crystal ball.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
But now you're doing Jimmy Stewart.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
Well, I'm also Bane from Batman.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Many people talk like this.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Jafar.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Jimmy Stewart.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Garrison Keeler.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Bane.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
So while I was away...

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Christopher Walken.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Bill Clinton.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Don Knuts.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Can we hear...

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Look at the Popeye.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Can we hear your Don Knuts?

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
Well, Michael...

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
No, Bill Clinton.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
I think you should run for president.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
No, thank you.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I don't have relations with a woman.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I'm Don Knuts.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
No, Bill Clinton.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Bill Clinton, please.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Can you get a little Bill Cosby in there?

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
Oh, what are you two talking about over here?

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
Why got Don Knuts and Bill Clinton talking to me?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Well, I'm not talking to you, man.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm talking to Bill Clinton.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I'm not talking to you either.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I'm talking to Bill Clinton.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Can we get him a kiss?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Oh, Gabby Hayes just walked in.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
Well, Michael, I'm Bill Clinton.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I'm Gabby Hayes.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
I'm Don Knuts.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
I'm Bill Cosby.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
No, no, no, no.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Don't embarrass yourselves.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It was not full applause.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
There's giant pockets of no applause.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
And those people are heroes.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
There's people who are like, no, no.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Swing it amiss.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
There will be times when I will appreciate effort from you,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
when I will need it.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
But there are also times when I need to be punished.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
So if you feel like story structure-wise,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
because we obsessed over this,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
that last night was some sort of death

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
because of the room you're in and the whole thing,

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
because you also found out on the tour bus

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
driving here overnight that...

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Spencer can rap better than you.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
That's not true.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Well, that's spoken like a hero.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Don't turn around.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Don't turn around.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Just behind you, always behind you.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
No matter where you look,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm always gonna be behind you.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
He just took his dick out.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
He just bit his ass right there.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I'm gonna find you flicking in the trees.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I'm gonna find you.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
What's your name?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Jason.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
I fucked your mama so hard, her pussy started to hasten.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Say, it got really fast.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I fucked your mama so hard,

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
the pussy started to blast out from the tarmac in space.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I fucked your mama regardless of her race.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
She's bi-racial.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
I fucked your mama.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
It was spatial relations that I needed.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I put my dick down and she heated the call

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
to adventure of my wiener.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
She came to it and said,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
this looks cleaner than bacon.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I put it on her plate.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
I fucked your mama hard because I'm not about hate.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
Yo, come on down to Harmontown.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Turn that frown upside down.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Diversity.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
He is yellow poop is brown.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Yo, I'm gonna do another verse so that Spencer can do one

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
that couldn't be worse.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Lower the bar and talk to my people.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
What's your name?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Andy.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Steeple.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
See how that works?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Didn't matter what his name was.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
I'm a fucking jerk.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
I just wrapped a work in the crowd.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Gonna eat your fry.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Gonna tan out loud.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Turn that frown upside down.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
He is yellow poop is brown.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Denver.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
You know, I'm Spencer.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
I'm the Dungeon Master.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
If you mess with me, it's gonna be a huge disaster

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
because I'm six foot four and I pack a bunch.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
But bitch, don't be asking what I had for lunch

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
because I'll tie you up with ropes and chains.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
And when we play in D&D, you know I hold the reins

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
because with a lightning bolt or a fireball,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
you best roll a climb check before you climb that wall.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Oh shit.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Turn that frown upside down.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Hero.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
He is yellow poop is brown.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Death.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
As I get older, my brain starts to sag.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I look over at Spencer and turn into a dish rag.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
I'm melting to the earth and my brain doesn't work.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I trimmer the thing with the steeple

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
and then I said I was a jerk.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
It doesn't matter if you have to say it.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It doesn't matter how much you admit.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
It doesn't change it.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
I'm weak.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
My synapses get farther apart

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
and every time I open my lips,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
what comes out is a mental fart.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Turn that frown upside down.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Old.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
He is yellow poop is brown.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Death.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
I'll take the mic.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
I'll get the mic bow.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Wait, let me see if I can put things back on track.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I said I'm Spencer.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I'm a dungeon master

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
and you can hear me preach.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
But man, I ain't no pastor.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
If you try and keep up, man, I will run faster.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
It comes along last and I'm the long laster.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I can't get it all with my master plaster.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
I can't think of another thing that rhymes with Aster.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Spencer, turn that frown upside down.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Roll.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
He is yellow poop is brown.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Hit point.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm a class in the skies from the sky.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I wanna swing my sword,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
but I don't know why.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
I got a beard the length of the whole Mississippi.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Fuck your mama so hard that her pussy got drippy.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I'm sorry.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I'm so sorry about my shit.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I'm misogynist and I go to weird places

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
when I start to throw up it.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I can't do anything else.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
I'm infantile and I just put the long on a really old shelf.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Got fired from NBC.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Came out on the road said,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
hey, look at me.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
It's $20 a ticket.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Don't know why.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Don't have an attitude.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
I'm just a guy.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I'm just a big fat asshole.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Taking your cheese sticks.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Talking about your mama loving my dick.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Come down to Harmontown.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Turn that frown upside down.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Rap.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
He is yellow poop is brown.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Raymond.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Come down to Harmontown.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Shit.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Oh yeah, shit.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I didn't know I was gonna have to rap now,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
but I will because I was on the road

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
and I tried to kill the audience

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
and I was away in Seattle.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
But now there's a rap battle.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
And I know that Spencer is the man

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
who cries the taller in the saddle.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
He sits high, his beard's a little hanging low.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Dan's up there.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
How long you last?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I don't know.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
The altitude's so high.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
He's a kind of overweight guy.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
He had so much cattle's bark in last days.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I think he might die.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Oh, come on down to Harmontown.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Pink pop.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Shit.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Shit.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Chipped up.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Down to Harmontown.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Slip slop down to Harmontown.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah, that's fucking how you do it.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
That was nice.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Good job, Spencer.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Thanks, guys.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Thanks.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
You broke your cherry, Spencer.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
You broke your cherry.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
You did good.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
That's a reference over my head.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
We're just...

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
It's not really a reference.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
We're just...

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I had a good fella say,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
you broke your cherry.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
It was $500.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
You got pinched and you didn't have shimla boots.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
You didn't shimla boots.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
You didn't shimla boots.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yes.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
You didn't have shimla boots.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, shit.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
No, no, no, sorry.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Wow.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I don't know what it is about this.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
It's the altitude.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Is that the altitude?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
It is the altitude.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It's your elation that I'm back with you.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
That's true.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I'm very glad to have you back.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I thought Aaron did a great job.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And like Minneapolis, I put up and edited it

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
because it was a very fun show.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Morton all...

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
There was some asshole in the crowd that was like,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I hate your relationship.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
It's boring.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And then we attacked him.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Like, I found myself...

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I listened to the recording.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I was like, okay, here's the mistakes I made.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
This guy piped up in the audience

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and instead of saying what I always say,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
which is, oh, hey, you have something to say.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Do you want to come up and talk to us?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Would you be willing to come up and talk to us

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
if we don't bully anybody?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
You hear in that recording,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I'm just like, get up here, you fucking asshole.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It just turned into this thing.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
We hit this weird rock bottom thing

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
where it was like, and then people were just yelling out,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
like, fuck you, fuck potatoes.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
And we go, what'd you say?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I said, fuck potatoes.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
All right, fuck potatoes, come up here.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Why'd you say fuck potatoes?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Because I wanted to be on stage.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And then I just got mad.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
And I fucking...

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I shut the whole thing down.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I fucking...

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Axl, Axl, Axl rose it.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
I threw a camera and I put my wiener in a shoe

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
and then I took the shoe and I...

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
It weren't like a hat, but my wiener was still in it.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
So it wasn't disconnected.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
It was like stretched.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
And then I...

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
You Axl rose it.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And I held the top of the hat

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
and I played my own thread-stretched penis

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
like a banjo.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Like a gun bucket.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
A lot of people certainly don't know what I mean

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
when I say Axl rose.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
I just need to clarify.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
That's what I did.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
I made a cigar box guitar out of my own dick.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
You're describing an Axl rose.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
No, I know, but there's a lot good

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
40% of the people here don't know what that means.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
I made a weird southern instrument

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
out of my mutilated penis.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
And blamed security.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
We're in the home stretch.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
I feel weird, Jeff.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I don't know what to...

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
It's the altitude.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
It's the altitude.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
I understand.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
All right.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Well, should we...

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Jeff, can you...

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Energy...

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Can you control me?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I'll try, man.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Just help me out.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
I can't look at them.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
I can't look at them.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Well, I think, you know,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
there's a moment like...

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I left for a while

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
and it was very strange

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
and now I came back

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
and I was like, I missed you guys

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
and something happened to us.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
We only have a few days left

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
and we're going back

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
to some of my favorite cities.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I'm like, well, not Salt Lake.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
You know, Salt Lake.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
It's the Paris of salty lakes.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I mean, honestly,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
if you're going to have salt,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
like, don't put a lake there

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
and vice versa.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Like, you know, we've heard it before.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
It just seems like a dumb place

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
to have salt.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
It's a lake.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
It's going to be cold as hell there, right?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Really.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I want to go out to the Salt Lake Flats

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
and reenact every Playboy video

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I've ever seen growing up.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
It seemed like they were always out in this,

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
like, these flats.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Like, every Playboy,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Playmate, like, video,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
like, centerfold would involve,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
like, they'd just be naked out

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
in the salt flats.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
No?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
I'm not familiar with that one.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
All right.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Well, then I'm eating another one

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
of Toby's Cheessticks.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
His name's Adam.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
We should have thought of that

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
before we were going to Cheessticks.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
So, probably a few days ago,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
certainly, as of Denver, Colorado,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
the diet is just out the goddamn window.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Oh, yeah, for sure.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Let's go.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Do you think you've gained

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
this significant amount of weight

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
in this trip?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Yeah, I'm Vince Morning.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
I can't stop myself, Joe.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I came back to the hotel

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
and I ran into Dustin Marshall.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Also, Dustin Marshall,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
our podcast producer is back there.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
He's a good kid.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
He's a good kid.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Largely unsung, I think.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
He dwells in the shadows,

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
but he's the reason why

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
you guys get to hear this

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
almost every night,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
and it's his hard work.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
So, thank you, Dustin.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Yeah, he's a good dude.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
He's just been smashing pussy on this trip.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I'm kidding, I'm joking.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
He's into dudes.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
But I ran into him.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
He's like, oh, I'm going to Dan and Aaron's

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
hotel room right now

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
and they're going to do

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
this feels terrible podcast.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
We want to stop by and say,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
hey, I'm going to pop in there.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
You guys have been there just today, right?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Yeah.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
It looked like a fucking city dump

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
in there, man.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
There was shit everywhere.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
There was just food.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
You guys really got it on today.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Well, it's just, you know,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I was recuperating from this

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
like late night party bus thing

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
that we did.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
It doesn't matter.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Whatever.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
We're ayahuasca, right?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Oh, God, yeah.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Dustin's uploading videos

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
where I'm like doing rape raps

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
and stuff like...

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
You guys didn't ayahuasca last night?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
No, no.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
So, a guy gave us a jar

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
if you're listening in customs.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
A guy gave us a jar of...

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Or just the police.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Just the regular police also.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Okay.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Or just like an Amazon tribe

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
if you want to murder us.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Any number of criminals?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
If you're a talking jaguar,

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
you might be interested in this.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Oh, now they're all

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
be able to talk to us.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
A fan of ours in...

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Where were we?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
I don't know.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Wasn't there?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
It was Madison.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Madison.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
No, it was...

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
It wasn't...

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
It was Madison.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Okay, thank you.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
We were in Madison

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
and a fan of ours

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
who had come all the way up from

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
somewhere south of the Chattahoochee.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Iowa, I think.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
Right.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
He brought a jar of...

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
He just went up to the boom mic operator,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
the sound guy on the documentary.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
He didn't give it to me.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
He didn't give it to...

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
He just gave him a jar of black tar

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
and said, that's ayahuasca.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
It's not really ayahuasca, though.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
It might just be coke.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Like the beverage.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
It's dark brown.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Well, it looks like it could be, yeah.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Wait, so he gave you a jar of hallucinogens?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Supposedly.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
I mean, Brandon, our sound guy,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
is the stony-as-looking member of our group.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Brandon, where are you at?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Show yourself, Brandon.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
I don't know if you guys saw the photo

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
of him doing karaoke wherever we were

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
and he had to hit his whole

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
all of his mic.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
He can do it.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
He does a mean beatbox.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
Brandon, get up here, beatbox time.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
The audience is lukewarm.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Okay, so just more rapping.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
All right.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
I thought you would talk about masturbating more.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Brandon Lilius.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
For his debut on stage,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
I'm not mistaken, right?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
This sounds made up,

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
but this sounds absolutely made up.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Brandon is a fourth-generation sound engineer.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Wait, doesn't that predate sound?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Well, that's the thing.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
This sounds absolutely made up.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
His great-grandfather did sound

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
on the jazz singer.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Was that him?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And not the Neil Diamond one.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But there was actually a movie

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
before the Jazz Singer.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Jazz Singer was the first talking,

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
but there was sound in a movie

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
previous to that that you're doing.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Don Juan, yeah.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Basically, they had sound.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
They recorded the soundtrack for Don Juan,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
which is music, which at the time,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
having actor talk was very controversial.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
So, yeah.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
It sounds made up, right?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Like it's a sociopath.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Oh, yeah.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
I'm not just a boom operator.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
I'm actually part of a low lineage of people who...

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Oh, my old...

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Biff Tannen started holding a boom mic

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
when it was just a stick and a rock

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
that you caveman talked into.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Yeah, it was a shell and a pelican over there.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
It's a living, but...

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
If he's lying, he's busted now.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
When did you find this out when I was away?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah, man.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Dude, we grew together.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Fucking hell.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
I'm so jealous.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
All that time you spend taking us to places

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
that aren't dinosaur bars...

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
You can use that to grow as a human being.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I'm shallow.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
I don't deny that,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
but you've got to be really connecting out there.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
You're a foodie.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
We became a humanie.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Not a foodie.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
We're a peopleie.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I'm not a foodie because I hate that word.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
I'm more of a wordie.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
I'm not a foodie because I hate that word.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
A beatboxin' like his mouth is a turd.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
It's got a big sound coming out of his mouth.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
I got a random on the beatbox going down south.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Got a mountaintop on Denver.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Got a beatbox...

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Sorry, I'm listening to him.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Okay, hold on.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
It's meant to take it.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Beatbox, beatbox, beatbox.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Go.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I'm talking into the mic stand.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Now I got on mic, so let's see how this will land.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
I don't even know what else I could say.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
You just kinda gave it to me in a half-assed way

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
and expected me to start rapping for all of y'all.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
I don't even know what I'm havin' a ball.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
It's a really great time on Harmontown,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
and everybody knows I'm standin' here

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
throwin' it down while I'm sittin'.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Dice roll, it's Spencer.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
Yo, pushy roll, it's Spencer.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Got the Spencer on the mic.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Got the Spencer on the rug.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Fucked your mama so hard that she thought I was a bug.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
She said, my pussy's so big, you're so small.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Fucked your mama so hard she looked like she had a ball.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
She was in a room with a chandelier.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
I gave her two balls and a dick and said, here.

32:00.000 --> 32:08.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Guy with a beard's gonna do a little rap now.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yo, no, dance break.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
No.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
All right.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Brandon Williams.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
It's an all.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Thank you, sir.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Thank you, Brandon.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
It's fantastic.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
It's funny, because his job is to capture sound,

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
and he's a giant with a booming voice that has a great beatbox.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
He really is enormous.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Yeah.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
And loud.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
He's supposed to capture sound, but he creates so much more than he captures.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Even more than he captures.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It makes him sound like a bad sound guy.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
The ghost of his great-grandfather's gonna haunt him,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and it's gonna say, crisp, clean,

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
like, no, there will be no clipping.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
There will be no plosives.

33:14.000 --> 33:22.000
It's my grandpa, the guy that invented the Dixie Cup and the string.

33:22.000 --> 33:31.000
Jeff, how do we make people love each other?

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
Turn the lights down real low.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I think what you do is be honest.

33:37.000 --> 33:43.000
You expose yourself, and that allows other people to release themselves out there, too.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Alternate pitch.

33:45.000 --> 34:02.000
Sports Corner!

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Hello, Denver Colorado Sports Corner.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Kevin Asher with your host, Dan Harmon.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
He loves sports, especially local team.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
His knowledge of local sports teams and statistics will blow your mind.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Drop to your lives, Fat Tire.

34:17.000 --> 34:27.000
Fat Tire Bear, get your club done.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
That's it for Sports Corner. Thanks for being with us.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
Hey, Dan.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Yeah, Jeff.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Denver, Colorado.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Holy shit, what a season.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Yeah, what a season.

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
You said it was your first time at Mile High Stadium. What did you take away from that experience?

34:44.000 --> 34:53.000
If there's ever been an alter to the grace that is the America's favorite sport, it is Mile High Stadium.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
You can feel the fans there. You can feel that they're getting what they want and wanting what they get.

34:57.000 --> 35:04.000
You can sense just even when the place is empty, I go down there with my daughter every fall.

35:04.000 --> 35:13.000
This is the stadium that God built for this sport and this sport alone.

35:13.000 --> 35:21.000
I don't mean to change sports, but what do you think is the most important role on the Colorado Rockies?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
The most important position on the Rockies?

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Definitely the top position.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
The most significant player and role position.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Yeah, the highest one.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
The most significant on the field.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
Tyler who plays Perry.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
Tyler who plays Perry.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
He'll be playing Perry next season, but Tyler is on top now.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Do you think the Rockies can be built after the last season?

35:53.000 --> 36:00.000
I think the Rockies are in the down slide, but that can be a precursor to an upswing.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
I believe that as my grandpa used to say in Uncle Homo back when we used to watch the Nuggets.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Uncle Homo?

36:07.000 --> 36:13.000
I thought you called your grandpa Uncle Homo.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
I'm from Wisconsin, Jeff, where grandpa's are known as Uncle Homo's.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
It's like a Mima or a Pop Pop.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
In Wisconsin we called our grandpa's Uncle Homo's.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
I understand that's an offensive phrase, but hey.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
I guess what I'm trying to say is what sport do the Rockies play?

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
The America's favorite?

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Which is?

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
They play football, man. They play football.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
They play football.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Basketball.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Yeah, you're right.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
They play basketball.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
Who are you quizzing me? I'm the sports guy.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
Those Nuggets got to get out there, like front and center, or the Rockies are going to take it.

37:00.000 --> 37:07.000
Are you saying that the Denver Nuggets are doing so poorly that the Colorado Rockies might move in on their actions?

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
Stranger things have happened, Jeff, with the wild card system and going into second procedurals.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
We've got a second tertiary format here, a 7-10 split, veritably speaking.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
In the all conference, if you go to all stars and then you come down to the single individuals,

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
then what we're talking about is a potential Nuggets coup over the Rockies in the spring semester,

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
or it's not a 40-point spread.

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
They agree. They seem to agree.

37:37.000 --> 37:45.000
I mean, the sports news cycle, we've heard so much about it, but you know more than anybody.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
When do you think that this NHL lockout is going to end?

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
I've got Jeff, if I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times. Yardage.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
What's going on?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
That's pretty good.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
I can't tell the difference between Grey Goose and Kettle One, but I can tell the difference between Sirach,

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
Snap Frost, the venue doesn't have it.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Kettle One had a chance to be our sponsor.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
They have Grey Goose. Grey Goose is great.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Goose.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
But it's fine. Vodka's vodka, honestly, kids.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
You know what breaks my heart, Jeff, is when the kids don't know they're vodka?

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Yeah.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
We play these venues under 21-plus or 18-plus, 21 or whatever they are,

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
and they're signing things after the show.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
Every once in a while, like two people my age will come up to me and go,

38:39.000 --> 38:47.000
Eric, can you sign us for our daughter, Ariel? She's 16, she's now allowed to come to the show.

38:47.000 --> 38:58.000
And I go, well, are you, Jesus Christ, you guys, do you want to cause another fight?

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Yes.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
I'm sorry I picked that name, but they go, she can't come tonight.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
Because her ponytails are too red and bouncy.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
She had volleyball practice.

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
My point, Jeff, is that sometimes, every third city, like a set of parents will come up to me,

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
one or more parents who aren't even fans of the show, don't even care,

39:24.000 --> 39:30.000
so who sit for two hours and listen to me talk about Dexon Balls and rapping and Dungeons and Dragons,

39:30.000 --> 39:37.000
and they're only here just to get a signature for their underage child.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
It really, like, pumps me out.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
And I'm like, did you have a good time? And they're like, you're great, you're great.

39:44.000 --> 39:50.000
Just, her name's Rachel and can't wait to drive this back to Omaha.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Like, that's fucked up.

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
Best parents, first of all, they deserve better than two hours of me.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
Best kid in the world, I don't know. What do you do there, Jeff? What do you do?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Do you sing a song?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
No, no, I'm kidding.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I think you sing a song.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Let's meet some people from our audience, Jeff.

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
I'm spraying, my mustache is, I'm spraying vodka all over everyone.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
You've eaten all the cheese sticks, so that doesn't matter.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
There's one left. You want to get that?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
There's two left.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Thank you, Ariel.

40:24.000 --> 40:30.000
Jeff, I'm going to die.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
You're not putting up much of a fight.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I'm going to die, Jeff.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
There was 18 pizza boxes in that room today.

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
Dan, you're beautiful. You're beautiful.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
People like you.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
They deserve to be loved.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Dan, Kansas City was a fluke.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
The guy wasn't there. The room was bad.

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
They had so many nachos.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
I got to get back on my diet, Jeff.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
I'm verging on acryte.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
I'm going to be acryte by Portland.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
He got pretty large.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Acryte got inexplicably large.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
He'd be into how weird it is, how large he got.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
He'd be like, oh, it's a mystery.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Crystal Skull made me so fat.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I told you once that I somehow,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
after an after-after-after party,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
ended up at Dan Ackroyd's house,

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
and he was as big as a poor person's house.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
But fortunately, he had a huge mansion,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
where houses fit inside it.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
There were poor people living in him.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Hey, keep it down out there.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
We're trying to write our version of Ghostbusters.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
But it was like 3 or 4 a.m.,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
and he just made a pizza.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
He took a Dijonno out of the freezer and put it in the oven.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
He just shook his shirt out.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
Balladone came out.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
He put the ear in his fucking sauce.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Like a golden retriever getting out of a river.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
He shook his body, and a pizza came out.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
But I said, I'd be a bad friend if I didn't tell you,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
that my best friends and I,

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
we think Ghostbusters is one of the best movies of all time.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
Hey, you know what? He wanted to talk about Ghostbusters

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
all night long, and it was pretty cool.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Well, I'm sorry we made fun of how fat he is.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
If he's listening.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
He almost certainly is listening.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Big trouble? I didn't see big trouble.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Big trouble was, oh, that was a 2Z.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
Was he just big in that one?

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
Well, no, I didn't see that movie,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
but he looked like he could have had a fat suit on.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I mean, he was very, very big.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I think he's lost weight since then, right?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I don't know. These people don't even know who he is.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Oh, yeah, they're like, what? Dan Ackroyd.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
What do you mean? Is he in the in-sync?

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
Yeah, he's Canadian. He's the in-sync.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Way to go, Harmon.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
That was a real attempt to grab a current reference.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
Who do you think is on the top of the charts like pop charts?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Who's on the top of the charts?

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Nora Jones.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I don't know.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
Tyler Perry.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
Tyler Perry's revolver.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
There's got to be a band that Tyler Perry owns, right?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Tyler Perry's...

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Tyler Perry...

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Flood Bunch?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And the...

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Tyler Perry and the Funky Bunch.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
I want to bring up a special guest.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
I met her in the bar before we came up.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Here.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Have a drink.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Yeah. It's the cheese sticks and the altitude.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I'm sorry.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Certainly not the gallon of vodka.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Is JJ from Vienna here?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Slovenia.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Wait, she said she was from...

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
She came to Vienna?

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
She was in Vienna at some point.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Where is JJ?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
JJ, can you make it to the stage?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
She's got to be the one that drove the furthest.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
She's from Europe.

44:18.000 --> 44:36.000
She drove from Europe in a special ski car.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
She's never been this high on a mountain.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Hello, JJ.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Good to see you again.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
She's come to show us...

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Are you independently wealthy?

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
How can you afford to keep flying out here from Europe to see these shows?

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
I think every time I was saved to go somewhere else to South America,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I wanted to go to Peru for a while.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Every time it ends up being one of your shows.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Well, we're like Peru. We're like Peru.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
We have ayahuasca.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
We'll get you high like Peru.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
And you brought us lovely cookies backstage.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
Those are awesome German little wafers and cookies and stuff.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Something else waiting for you, but that's after the show.

45:12.000 --> 45:20.000
Everyone gets laid tonight.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
It's a swinger show.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
Leave your keys in the cheese basket.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
We just put our keys in a deep fried cheese basket.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
I'm with Dave.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I'm with Tony.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
There's three women here.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.000
Jay-Jay, what do you do?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I work at the British Embassy in Vienna.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
The British Embassy in Vienna?

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
And you have that much free time to come see stupid comedy shows like ours?

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
No, I just took three days off in the weekend.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And you're with a friend too, right?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
No, my friend couldn't make it.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
She wanted to go down.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Sensory guards.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
How many languages do you speak?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Four.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
German.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
Slovenian and French.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
There was a French audience member here as well.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Oh, yeah?

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Were you a parley herring?

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Give us some Slovenian.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
I don't know that I've ever heard Slovenian.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Say, come on down to Harmontown.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Turn that frown upside down.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
P is yellow poop.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Could you sing our little hook in Slovenian?

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Is that possible?

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Is that possible?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Oh, my God.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Alright.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
International UK power mix.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Lady Gaga style.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I don't know what that means.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Just grabbing.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Okay, Dan, you want to lead her in?

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Yo, yo, yo.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
International, I'm irrational.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I'm international, national, international.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Motherfucker, gonna rap so hard.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Gonna drop the mic.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
That's my style.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Chris Rock drops the mic.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Chris Tucker's another person.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
The races are alike.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
That makes me racist.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I didn't confuse them.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I love black people.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Take it, DJ.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
We didn't ever Harmontown.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
It's where he gives us mail.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
We didn't ever Harmontown.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Yo.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
It's foreign language.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I'm going on the anguish.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I'm gonna go out in the crowd.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I'm international now.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
So I'm rapping twice as loud.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Got the whole planet going full global.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Got your mama's cell phone

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
and her titties are mobile.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Got your AT&T

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
and your TT's on my sprint.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
I'm gonna put it in her PP.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Wrapping more.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Just gonna wrap some more.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
We didn't ever Harmontown.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
It's where he gives us mail.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Yo.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
We didn't ever Harmontown.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
We didn't ever Harmontown.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Yo, it's like fancy shit.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
You're out on a patio

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
and Amsterdam and shit.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
You've got sip and coffee

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
and you're held in funny money.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
But it has pictures of people

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
you've never seen.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
It's ridiculous.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
We didn't ever Harmontown.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
On your lost life.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
And dope is never coming out.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Broke the roof.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
You're out.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Make it sober.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Okay so now,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
uh,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
That ran some dammel.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Then I said

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
to my wife,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
subscribe to her country.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I moaned about it.

48:54.000 --> 49:07.000
I'm feeling tense. I need a massage. I fucked your mama in the house in her garage. Spencer's gonna come to the mic. I'm gonna hand it off cause he's who you like.

49:07.000 --> 49:18.000
Yo, I got monsters in a cage and everybody sees me cause I'm all the rage and I don't mean rage like a barbarian rage. Let me get off this rhyme. Let me turn the page.

49:18.000 --> 49:29.000
It's all I got. Let me see if I can try some more. Maybe I'll just sit up here and fry. I think that's all I got right now so we'll go to the chorus.

49:48.000 --> 50:09.000
I fucked your mama so hard she said fabbless. Language is piss. It just comes out and runs that way in this. Nobody knows what any words mean. We all say what we say and then we see what we mean.

50:09.000 --> 50:23.000
I ride with me with me. I'm doing a bad scene. I'm a bad person. I'm 40 years old and I'm a bleak cuisine. I don't want to be fat. I don't want to be an anchor. I don't want to get as big as that. I just want to ghost bust.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.380
Who are you gonna call? I'm gonna call Ginny C Brynton. Where I take a diabetes fault and I look now at an eastbound woman. I'm Spock

50:24.380 --> 50:26.380
I'm gonna call Chitty Crick too

50:26.380 --> 50:28.380
Before I take a diabetes ball

50:28.380 --> 50:30.380
I'm gonna run down to Eastbound

50:30.380 --> 50:32.380
I'm gonna hide in a hide-and-seek

50:32.380 --> 50:34.380
I'm gonna smug it

50:34.380 --> 50:36.380
I'm gonna smug it

50:36.380 --> 50:38.380
I'm gonna smug it

50:38.380 --> 50:40.380
I'm gonna smug it

50:40.380 --> 50:42.380
Thank you JJ

50:48.380 --> 50:50.380
Thank you, Slovenian JJ

50:50.380 --> 50:52.380
Slovenian JJ

50:54.380 --> 50:56.380
Slovenian JJ

50:56.380 --> 50:58.380
Get away from me

50:58.380 --> 51:00.380
Slovenian JJ

51:00.380 --> 51:02.380
Run and pull with pee

51:02.380 --> 51:04.380
But is it D&D time I believe?

51:04.380 --> 51:06.380
D&D time, I believe, yeah, let's do this thing

51:06.380 --> 51:08.380
Alright, are you guys ready for some D&D?

51:10.380 --> 51:12.380
Erin McGathy, join us on stage please

51:12.380 --> 51:20.380
Erin McGathy

51:24.380 --> 51:26.380
I think we're sharing a mic

51:26.380 --> 51:28.380
Denver style

51:28.380 --> 51:30.380
It's the altitude

51:30.380 --> 51:32.380
The electricity doesn't get through

51:32.380 --> 51:34.380
The cords is fast

51:36.380 --> 51:38.380
Oh, thanks

51:38.380 --> 51:42.380
You guys are great

51:42.380 --> 51:44.380
I'm not pandering

51:46.380 --> 51:48.380
You're backstage watching Gator Boys, right?

51:48.380 --> 51:50.380
Yeah, you watching Gator Boys right there?

51:50.380 --> 51:52.380
They sent me up in a nice little booth

51:52.380 --> 51:54.380
And brought me tacos and drinks

51:54.380 --> 51:56.380
And I've just been sitting back there like a king

51:56.380 --> 51:58.380
My feet up on the chairs

52:00.380 --> 52:02.380
They asked me to leave

52:02.380 --> 52:04.380
But it's been a lot of fun

52:04.380 --> 52:06.380
They asked you to leave?

52:06.380 --> 52:08.380
I put my feet up on

52:08.380 --> 52:10.380
Oh, got it

52:10.380 --> 52:12.380
It's okay everybody

52:12.380 --> 52:14.380
We should find you a stool

52:14.380 --> 52:16.380
Or, here, you sit on this one

52:16.380 --> 52:18.380
I feel weird

52:18.380 --> 52:20.380
Well, we have to share a mic

52:20.380 --> 52:22.380
We'll edit this part out where I'm talking about

52:22.380 --> 52:24.380
The mic that we have to share

52:24.380 --> 52:26.380
But then I won't edit it out

52:28.380 --> 52:30.380
Because it'll have charm

52:30.380 --> 52:32.380
How do you feel about us sharing a mic?

52:32.380 --> 52:34.380
Great

52:34.380 --> 52:36.380
Thanks for the day because I missed a bit

52:36.380 --> 52:38.380
So, catch me up if you would

52:38.380 --> 52:40.380
Last time we met

52:40.380 --> 52:42.380
Our heroes had been journeying

52:42.380 --> 52:44.380
In the belly of the beast

52:44.380 --> 52:46.380
The mysterious and mythical

52:46.380 --> 52:48.380
And finifish

52:48.380 --> 52:50.380
After Sharpie found what looked like a lung

52:50.380 --> 52:52.380
The group rejoined and entered through a large cavity

52:52.380 --> 52:54.380
That quark had slashed in the side of the great organ

52:54.380 --> 52:56.380
Entering the lung

52:56.380 --> 52:58.380
A slimy creature had dropped in

52:58.380 --> 53:00.380
From the ceiling onto the bottom of this chamber

53:00.380 --> 53:02.380
Followed by several electrical spidery minions

53:02.380 --> 53:04.380
After the dust of combat had settled

53:04.380 --> 53:06.380
Sharpie, quark, and Mulraine were victorious

53:06.380 --> 53:08.380
Hoping to damage the lung

53:08.380 --> 53:10.380
With the smoke from their smoke sticks

53:10.380 --> 53:12.380
Sharpie and Mulraine ignited them

53:12.380 --> 53:14.380
As well as all their torches

53:14.380 --> 53:16.380
And as the damage was being dealt

53:16.380 --> 53:18.380
To the vicious lung

53:18.380 --> 53:20.380
Quark destroyed the remnants

53:20.380 --> 53:22.380
With his flaming sword

53:22.380 --> 53:24.380
And together they all fell below

53:24.380 --> 53:26.380
Back into the chamber before they had left

53:26.380 --> 53:28.380
Ah, yeah

53:28.380 --> 53:30.380
They had made some progress

53:30.380 --> 53:32.380
But they proceed from here

53:32.380 --> 53:34.380
Thank you, Spencer

53:34.380 --> 53:36.380
Yeah, alright

53:36.380 --> 53:38.380
Seems like now there's a big wrap start

53:38.380 --> 53:40.380
Now he's phoning in his DMing

53:40.380 --> 53:42.380
No, I just lost my place

53:42.380 --> 53:44.380
In the writing, reading

53:44.380 --> 53:46.380
He sounds like Don LaFontaine now

53:46.380 --> 53:48.380
In a world

53:48.380 --> 53:50.380
He's kicking back, he's Snoop-style now

53:50.380 --> 53:52.380
I don't know

53:52.380 --> 53:54.380
In a world, Louis

53:54.380 --> 53:56.380
In a world

53:56.380 --> 53:58.380
Don't try to pick a fight with Spencer

53:58.380 --> 54:00.380
I need for my documentary

54:00.380 --> 54:02.380
That I'm producing about myself

54:02.380 --> 54:04.380
I need a death to happen

54:04.380 --> 54:06.380
I need a conflict

54:06.380 --> 54:08.380
Maybe you'll die in this

54:08.380 --> 54:10.380
Round of D&D

54:10.380 --> 54:12.380
Take some chances out there, miss

54:12.380 --> 54:14.380
Yeah, have another cheese stick

54:16.380 --> 54:18.380
Oh, shit

54:18.380 --> 54:20.380
I was joking, honey

54:20.380 --> 54:22.380
Baby, no

54:22.380 --> 54:24.380
Baby

54:24.380 --> 54:28.380
I'm at the ranch

54:28.380 --> 54:30.380
Damn

54:30.380 --> 54:32.380
See, I just put the cheese stick

54:32.380 --> 54:34.380
On his face

54:34.380 --> 54:36.380
Put the mozzarella

54:36.380 --> 54:38.380
He's crying ranch tears right now

54:38.380 --> 54:40.380
That is truly horrifying

54:44.380 --> 54:46.380
You better, your eyelashes

54:46.380 --> 54:56.380
Don't Instagram me!

55:00.380 --> 55:02.380
That is fucked up

55:02.380 --> 55:04.380
Wow, we

55:04.380 --> 55:06.380
You have a problem, sir

55:06.380 --> 55:08.380
No, don't, no!

55:08.380 --> 55:10.380
No!

55:10.380 --> 55:12.380
He just drank the ranch

55:12.380 --> 55:14.380
Like a Yeager bomb

55:14.380 --> 55:16.380
Here, table of enablers

55:18.380 --> 55:20.380
Fuckin' hell

55:20.380 --> 55:22.380
Can't say no

55:22.380 --> 55:24.380
Anybody have one of those?

55:24.380 --> 55:26.380
Thank you

55:26.380 --> 55:28.380
Anybody have one of those Pulp Fiction

55:28.380 --> 55:30.380
Adrenaline syringes that we can plunge into

55:30.380 --> 55:32.380
later on?

55:32.380 --> 55:34.380
Has anyone else gone so off a diet

55:34.380 --> 55:36.380
that you start putting food

55:36.380 --> 55:38.380
in places that doesn't go

55:38.380 --> 55:40.380
to just ranch in your ears

55:40.380 --> 55:42.380
You had ranch mascara on for a moment

55:42.380 --> 55:44.380
That was wild

55:44.380 --> 55:46.380
Oh boy

55:46.380 --> 55:48.380
By the way, the shame of Jeff walking

55:48.380 --> 55:50.380
into our hotel room earlier today

55:50.380 --> 55:52.380
was palpable

55:52.380 --> 55:54.380
When we opened the door

55:54.380 --> 55:56.380
and you were standing there

55:56.380 --> 55:58.380
I was scared because I knew it was

55:58.380 --> 56:00.380
inside that room

56:00.380 --> 56:02.380
Yeah, it looked like a city fucking dump

56:02.380 --> 56:04.380
No, it did look like a city dump

56:04.380 --> 56:06.380
I mean, there was a large collection of plates

56:06.380 --> 56:08.380
There was plates and there was pizza boxes

56:08.380 --> 56:10.380
and there was a

56:10.380 --> 56:12.380
There's a lot of left

56:12.380 --> 56:14.380
A skeletized lamb

56:18.380 --> 56:20.380
There wasn't any ranch because it

56:20.380 --> 56:22.380
certainly had drunk it all

56:22.380 --> 56:24.380
Yeah

56:24.380 --> 56:26.380
Don't let him hurt you

56:26.380 --> 56:28.380
Don't let him hurt you

56:30.380 --> 56:32.380
Don't make your

56:32.380 --> 56:34.380
movie arc death an actual

56:34.380 --> 56:36.380
death argument

56:36.380 --> 56:40.380
Bad movie

56:40.380 --> 56:42.380
This is going to be a long ride

56:42.380 --> 56:44.380
on the bus today

56:44.380 --> 56:46.380
Only one thing is going to make me feel better

56:46.380 --> 56:48.380
Ice cream

56:48.380 --> 56:50.380
What if we had ice cream

56:50.380 --> 56:52.380
dancers come out

56:52.380 --> 56:54.380
The show would stop

56:54.380 --> 56:56.380
and you would eat ice cream

56:56.380 --> 56:58.380
Okay, it's a show

56:58.380 --> 57:00.380
Watching me eat ice cream could be the show

57:00.380 --> 57:02.380
These people love me no matter what I do

57:02.380 --> 57:04.380
They love me

57:04.380 --> 57:06.380
I'm going to eat myself to death

57:06.380 --> 57:08.380
in front of you

57:08.380 --> 57:10.380
Wow

57:10.380 --> 57:12.380
Somebody stop him

57:12.380 --> 57:14.380
Fucking, we're going to go back to LA

57:14.380 --> 57:16.380
and you're going to be just a big fat cunt

57:16.380 --> 57:18.380
when you get out of there

57:18.380 --> 57:20.380
It has

57:20.380 --> 57:22.380
It has become a thing

57:22.380 --> 57:24.380
I'm off my diet for seven days

57:24.380 --> 57:26.380
That rebellion has become

57:26.380 --> 57:28.380
a really aggressive violent thing

57:28.380 --> 57:30.380
against your health and our children

57:30.380 --> 57:32.380
I saw you putting some cheese sticks down

57:32.380 --> 57:34.380
at Tobi Keith's

57:34.380 --> 57:36.380
I love this barbecue across the way

57:36.380 --> 57:38.380
Those are potato skins

57:38.380 --> 57:40.380
That was zucchini

57:40.380 --> 57:42.380
I ate the zucchini out of the fried

57:42.380 --> 57:44.380
The healthy zucchini

57:44.380 --> 57:46.380
with the fried in the wrench

57:46.380 --> 57:48.380
Tobi Keith's

57:48.380 --> 57:50.380
By the way, there's room over there

57:50.380 --> 57:52.380
If you guys want to go to Tobi Keith's

57:52.380 --> 57:54.380
What's the name of his bar?

57:54.380 --> 57:56.380
Tobi Keith's

57:56.380 --> 57:58.380
Fade in on me loving something

57:58.380 --> 58:00.380
Cut to smash cut

58:00.380 --> 58:02.380
Car chase

58:02.380 --> 58:04.380
Dragon comes down from the sky

58:04.380 --> 58:06.380
I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

58:06.380 --> 58:08.380
Let's go to a bar tonight

58:08.380 --> 58:10.380
Tobi Keith's a hubris bar in LA

58:10.380 --> 58:12.380
Tobi Keith's I can't lose

58:12.380 --> 58:14.380
Tobi Keith's 20 page name

58:14.380 --> 58:16.380
for a bar

58:16.380 --> 58:18.380
There's room for 4,000 people at that bar

58:18.380 --> 58:20.380
We were the only three people in there

58:20.380 --> 58:22.380
And the laminate sticker

58:22.380 --> 58:24.380
that they used to make the drywall

58:24.380 --> 58:26.380
that the bars made out of

58:26.380 --> 58:28.380
look like wood

58:28.380 --> 58:30.380
We were trying to figure out

58:30.380 --> 58:32.380
Do people dance on the bars

58:32.380 --> 58:34.380
That way people feel that

58:34.380 --> 58:36.380
Boogieing up there and that's why all the laminates

58:36.380 --> 58:38.380
That would be a cool reason

58:38.380 --> 58:40.380
It's a honky tonk

58:40.380 --> 58:42.380
We honkyed the tonk off the top of the bar

58:42.380 --> 58:44.380
I asked the bartender

58:44.380 --> 58:46.380
How does this happen?

58:46.380 --> 58:48.380
She goes, I don't know, they just pick at it

58:48.380 --> 58:50.380
They? The animals

58:50.380 --> 58:52.380
That you are a zookeeper

58:52.380 --> 58:54.380
They just pick at it

58:54.380 --> 58:56.380
It's like something you'd hear to zoo

58:56.380 --> 58:58.380
They just pick at it, I don't know

58:58.380 --> 59:00.380
They think the tire is a swing

59:00.380 --> 59:02.380
The giraffe's mistake

59:02.380 --> 59:04.380
The rusty Jones sticker for a berry

59:04.380 --> 59:06.380
That's why they're breaking the windows on your cars

59:10.380 --> 59:12.380
Let's all go over there and see if we can pick off

59:12.380 --> 59:14.380
like a great Harmontown

59:14.380 --> 59:16.380
Does anybody have a chisel?

59:16.380 --> 59:18.380
It's grody over there

59:18.380 --> 59:20.380
It's a bummer

59:20.380 --> 59:22.380
I expected more out of Tobi Keith

59:22.380 --> 59:24.380
Really?

59:24.380 --> 59:26.380
That name screams class

59:26.380 --> 59:28.380
That guy's made a living out of supporting troops

59:28.380 --> 59:30.380
Nothing more, there's a lobby

59:30.380 --> 59:32.380
It's filled with pictures of him

59:32.380 --> 59:34.380
supporting the troops, that's it

59:34.380 --> 59:36.380
He's playing guitar in all these different forms of camouflage

59:36.380 --> 59:38.380
In all these different cockadoodle douche bags

59:38.380 --> 59:40.380
The fucking hate bag

59:40.380 --> 59:42.380
He's so fucking full of his own shit

59:42.380 --> 59:44.380
The fucking boo

59:44.380 --> 59:46.380
Fuck you Tobi Keith, you're bigger than me

59:46.380 --> 59:48.380
You can kick my ass but I will fucking

59:48.380 --> 59:50.380
control your fucking shit

59:50.380 --> 59:52.380
Hate it

59:52.380 --> 59:54.380
Your real country music, that stuff is so fucking retarded

59:54.380 --> 59:56.380
It's not good

59:56.380 --> 59:58.380
Hate Tobi

59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.380
Tobi

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.380
Who needs Tobi Keith?

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.380
What's your last name?

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.380
Jeff, I think you know more about Tobi Keith

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.380
than I do

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.380
If he was to walk into that bar

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.380
the same way that we walk into the bar

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.380
I know he would love it

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.380
With an empty, would he be like, well that's a Tuesday

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.380
Or like what would

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.380
his reaction be

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.380
I don't think he would walk into it

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.380
but I don't think he has any connection to this thing

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.380
I think it's a stupid corporate adventure

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.380
I would really like to hear Jeff's Tobi Keith

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.380
song, isn't there a country song on the iPad

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.380
Can you sing a song about Tobi Keith

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.380
Do Tobi Keith's commercial for

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.380
Jeff never sings an episode

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.380
Well I'm a big old badass dickhead

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.380
Kissing on the graves of Hank

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.380
and all the people that

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.380
sing country before

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.380
And I support the troops

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.380
What a bold fucking stance that is

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.380
I am a modern hero

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.380
Gonna put a flag on everything

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.380
Fuck you, iPad

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.380
Put a flag on everything

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.380
You can't just come out and go

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.380
I've been out there in Iraq

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.380
and going down to U.S. soot tours

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.380
and there's the troops, come on troops

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.380
Come on, troops everybody, troops

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.380
Tobi, Tobi, Tobi

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.380
No, troops?

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.380
Now you have agreed

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.380
You have agreed

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:32.380
I love this podcast

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.380
Tobi, someone calm Tobi

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.380
Tobi, you have agreed

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.380
to be the name behind

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.380
this bar and we have

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.380
asked you for months and months

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.380
what shall we name

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.380
this bar and grill

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.380
Tobi Keith's, I love this grill

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.380
Okay

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.380
I love it

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.380
I love troops and grills

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:56.380
Okay, but Tobi

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.380
Tobi keeps troops and grills

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.380
Tobi, that's not

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.380
so much a name

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.380
Grilled troops are half off

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.380
Okay, alright

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.380
Jared, his eyes are bleeding

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.380
We're just gonna call it back

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:12.380
The grilled troops

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.380
Grilled troops are delicious

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.380
because I love them, you have to support

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.380
a basket of delicious buffalo troops

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.380
It's hard to love a troop

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.380
Because

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.380
it's really, really hard

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.380
because there are people that might die

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.380
Yeah

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.380
It's not a bold stance, it doesn't mean

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:34.380
Who doesn't support the fucking troops?

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.380
Everybody supports the fucking troops

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.380
We love the troops, they're doing the greatest

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.380
shittiest, hardest job in the world

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.380
I'm not talking shit about the troops

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.380
You can't go on a cold beer and go

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.380
It's not interesting

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.380
conversation, Tobi, and your music stinks

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.380
and I'll fucking fight you right after this show

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.380
He's a great guy

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.380
He's a lovely gentleman

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:02.380
I'm just kidding, Tobi, we're old pals

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.380
While my friend is fighting you, could I just

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.380
one more order of potato skins?

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.380
They're really good, one more order of potato skins

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.380
Coming right up

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.380
A dupe, a dupe, a troop

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.380
A troop, a troop, a troop

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.380
Potato skins

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.380
Star-spangled french fries

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.380
Shitty hill

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.380
Billy music

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.380
I'll take a little potato skin

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.380
and I'll load him up with troops

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.380
I shit on Wayland's ending grave

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.380
yesterday just to prove a point

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.380
Come on down

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:34.380
Occupy your appetite

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.380
with a

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.380
with a

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.380
AK-47 up

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.380
Occupy your appetite

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:44.380
as a Muslim

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.380
Got an Apache full of

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.380
french fries

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.380
Half-priced appetizers

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.380
Tobi, I love the troops

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.380
and I fucked your mom

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.380
And his bar is absolutely

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:58.380
empty across the street and that gives me

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.380
a fucking thrill to see that

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.380
Also, and while I'm saying this

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.380
yes, it's not a bold statement to go

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.380
all the time, yes, of course

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.380
Of course God bless America

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.380
What else is God going to bless? The Irish?

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.380
Where are they?

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.380
But also, I

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.380
Oh shit, there's an Irish guy?

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.380
We'll get to Jeremy Seinfeld, but I was going to say

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:22.380
it's not really in this audience

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.380
I'm also being a hypocrite, it's not a bold stance

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.380
to say fuck you Tobi Keith there

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.380
That's true too

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.380
I'm not Bill Hicks up here

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.380
You're the shadow that Tobi Keith casts

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.380
Tobi Keith is kind of a dick, right?

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.380
He writes songs about giving people

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.380
swirly's

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.380
You gotta write what you know

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.380
Tobi Keith

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:50.380
writes what he knows, we write what we know

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.380
I'm sure he's a great person

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.380
Alright, let's

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.380
proceed back

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:02.380
I like big and muscular at St. Country

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.380
There's something wrong, it's like Joe Piscopo

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.380
when he got big and muscular

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.380
You're not funny with giant biceps

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.380
I like Garth Brooks swinging around in a wire

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.380
I thought that was cool

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.380
He takes his job seriously

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.380
He's swinging around in a wire

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.380
Alright Spencer, I examine my surroundings

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.380
You're in a large circular room

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.380
The walls drip with a green mucus

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.380
Wait, this is Tobi Keith's place

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.380
The laminate is picked off the walls

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.380
The appetizers are

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.380
supportive of the troops

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.380
An air of silence in misery

01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.380
Hays over this area

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.380
The salt and pepper shakers

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.380
are hand grenades

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.380
Jamouflage

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.380
Lines the bathrooms

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.380
French fries are called freedom freedoms

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.380
They say really quickly before I forget

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.380
that Dungeon Master Spencer and I

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.380
will be selling merch in that corner

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.380
after the show

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.380
T-shirts $15 or two for $25

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.380
And if you buy anything

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.380
I'll sign it, also I'll sign anything

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:04.380
if you don't buy anything

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:06.380
I'll sign a napkin, that's the Tobi Keith guarantee

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.380
I'm not gonna say

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.380
I'll sign a Tobi Keith, if you bring me a

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.380
kidnapped baby I'll sign it

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:16.380
Tobi Keith as a way of getting back at him

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.380
for holding the nation hostage

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.380
I would know a song of his

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:22.380
What song did he sign?

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.380
Anybody know Tobi Keith's song?

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.380
Red Solo Cup?

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.380
What a fucking cock

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.380
Yeah, wow, clever

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.380
Let me guess, can I guess?

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:38.380
I don't know

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.380
It's a guy that, because

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.380
the Red Party Cup is a solo

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.380
but he's solo tonight, the girl left him

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.380
so he's got the better song than he wrote

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.380
It's not even that complex

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.380
It's literally like, hey we're all at a party

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.380
and we're all at Red Solo Cups

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.380
So much, let's all drink

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.380
for my Red Solo Cups

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.380
Fucking Red Solo Cuppage

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.380
Sorry, I thought you were

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.380
Yeah, that is

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.380
heartbreaking

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:06.380
Anyway, I got a thin plastic

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.380
red vessel

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.380
holding on the beer

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.380
and I'm catering to

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.380
frat boys, the end

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.380
Let's shoot some deer

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.380
Alright, so let's play some

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.380
D&D for pity's sake

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.380
I could just leave, I mean

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.380
No, no, Spencer

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.380
Oh, Spencer

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.380
Maybe, Spencer

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.380
I mean, I don't mind, it's fine

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.380
Alright, well, I described

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.380
the room you were in

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.380
They're turning it up, the sound of this

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.380
It's like a Tobi Keith Houston song playing

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.380
Tobi Keith's upstairs

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.380
This is what I mean when I said I could leave

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.380
It's fine

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.380
No one can

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.380
The podcast won't be able to hear that

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.380
though, they won't know what we're talking about

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.380
There's like a slight, it's like

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.380
someone's iPhone is in the rafters

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.380
playing on speaker

01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:58.380
Yeah

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.380
Right

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.380
I mean, they've been doing it for

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.380
80 minutes

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.380
That's how passive it is

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.380
It's a slow trickle

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.380
It's a trickle playoff

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.380
Now it's the sound of being

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.380
finifish

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.380
It's been a decomposer

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.380
You guys basically beat up the lungs, right?

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.380
You beat up some lungs

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.380
Are we in the stomach now?

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.380
You were in that room you were in before

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.380
with the three different passways

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.380
Sharpie took the left, you took the middle

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.380
and Mulrainee took the right

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.380
and then you magically decided to go back

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:34.380
to where Sharpie was

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.380
So you're in that room, obvious exits

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.380
north, south and east

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.380
and west will take you back to the village

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.380
Where have we not been before?

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.380
You've been through all of them

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.380
but you guys just caught back

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.380
up with Sharpie when you thought he was the lung

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.380
Are we still with that far sword guy

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.380
or he go away? He's still around

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.380
Yeah, he's hanging out

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.380
What's up guys, I'm Valicent the sword guy

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.380
You're Valicent

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.380
Alright, well let's go back to

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.380
We came through a lung door

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.380
so let's not go through that one

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.380
The one you were through had a hanging kidney

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.380
being shaped to organ if you'll recall

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.380
Right

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.380
I guess the kidneys, right?

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.380
I can't tell you

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.380
I rush headlong barbarian style

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.380
into the kidney

01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:20.380
Rushing headlong through the passageway

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.380
you find yourself in a large pinkish room

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.380
which I'm about to explain

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.380
This passage has

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.380
a high ceiling from which is hanging

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.380
a large shiny veined looking

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.380
sack of flesh in the shape of a kidney bean

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.380
and several arteries run from

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.380
various walls into the dangling organ

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.380
and a huge central cord seems to be

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:40.380
its main support coming in from the ceiling

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.380
You can see what appear to be large

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.380
white blue sparks with multiple limbs

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.380
slowly crawling around the surface of the organ

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.380
A greenish tangle of cords

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.380
appears to be blocking the only other exit

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.380
Dun dun dun

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.380
These spark things usually spider things

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.380
that repair everything and also will attack us

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:00.380
when we start fucking around

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:02.380
Alright, so we want to attack that main cord

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.380
that's holding it up there, right?

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.380
Probably

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.380
Okay, Valisette, use your far sword

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:10.380
and take a swipe with that cord

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.380
I don't know if you remember, but my far sword's all used up

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.380
I wasn't there, man

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:16.380
You were there, you just forgot

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.380
Oh

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.380
Sorry

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.380
I unsheathed my arrows

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.380
I showed them to Quark as they were like, hey

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.380
Remember? I got it

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.380
How could I forget?

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.380
I fire a single

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.380
good arrow

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:34.380
At the thing

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.380
At the kidney bean?

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.380
Yup

01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:40.380
You miss

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.380
By the way, there was a dude, did you talk to the dude

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.380
who made props?

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:46.380
He made a mole rain arrow

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.380
It's a double arrow

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.380
I'm gonna be holding it

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.380
Maybe it will make me better

01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.380
He's coming up

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.380
He made a thing

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:02.380
What's your name, sir?

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.380
Luke

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.380
Luke likes to make little props

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:08.380
This is

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:10.380
She fires two arrows

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.380
I made two arrows

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.380
On the heads of the arrows are four-sided dice

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.380
The most dangerous of all dice

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.380
And you also made

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.380
what I thought was a joke about

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.380
putting a Sharpie in my butt

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.380
It's a wand

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.380
Made out of Sharpies

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.380
That does

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.380
Ray of Frost way better than Ray of Frost

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.380
Alright, great

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.380
Thank you, was it Luke?

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.380
Thank you, Luke

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.380
I cast a spell of

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:44.380
thanking him

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.380
How far above the ground is this

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.380
kidney thing hanging?

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:50.380
I'd say it's about ten feet above your heads

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:52.380
I jump onto

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.380
Sharpie's shoulders and take out my flaming sword

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.380
and take a swipe at the underbelly of the kidney

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.380
Slashing at the underbelly

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.380
you score a flaming hit

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.380
Fuck yeah

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.380
Just as soon as the gash

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.380
has been made, however, the spidery creatures

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.380
I was mentioning earlier

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.380
crawl over the surface of the organ

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.380
So we gotta kill those things first, then, right?

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.380
Probably

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.380
Yeah, like AIDS

01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:22.380
You want us to give you beneficial AIDS?

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.380
Um, I

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.380
Fuck it

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.380
I don't have AIDS

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.380
Me fucking it doesn't give an AIDS

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.380
That's not how AIDS works

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.380
Spencer, do I have AIDS? No

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.380
Do I have a spell that would work

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:38.380
on organisms like that?

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.380
Like these sparky things?

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.380
Sharp person wouldn't work on that

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:44.380
Definitely not, sharp person

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.380
You could probably rule out illusions

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.380
Hypnotism will work on them

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.380
That'd be an illusion

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.380
I don't have the power to summon animals

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.380
Can I summon an AIDS monkey?

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.380
An AIDS monkey?

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.380
Can I summon some sort of like

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.380
I should clarify, you don't have the power

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:02.380
to summon things, just talk to them

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.380
So if there's a squirrel around and you're like

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.380
Yo, is there a squirrel around?

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.380
I look around for AIDS ridden animals

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.380
Suspiciously, all AIDS

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.380
ridden animals are absent

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:16.380
How convenient

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.380
Can I shoot two arrows

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.380
at the kidney?

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.380
You definitely could

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.380
Wait, is that what I want to do?

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.380
I'm sorry?

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.380
Oh, that's okay

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.380
Thanks hat brothers

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:34.380
I would like to shoot two arrows

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.380
at the stem connecting the kidney

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:38.380
What kind of arrows?

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.380
I mean, the smart

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:42.380
Yeah, the arrows, thank you Stephen

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.380
The V arrows

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.380
One of your arrows misses

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.380
its mark planting itself right in the wall

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.380
to your left and the other one strikes

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.380
in a critical fashion

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.380
Alright

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.380
Scoot

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.380
This is really cool

01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.380
Dealing 20 damage

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:04.380
Alright, that's like a million

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.380
in Dungeons & Dragons

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.380
You notice one of the sparks

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.380
goes to begin repairing the organ

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.380
The other three drop to the ground

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.380
and begin hovering towards you with menace

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.380
I throw

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.380
a throwing knife

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.380
at the spark

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.380
trying to repair the wound

01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:24.380
As you throw your throwing knife

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.380
you feel a great shock of electricity

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.380
flowing through your body

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.380
Let's see if you can still hit under this increased

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.380
I should have attacked the immediate bridge

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.380
Perhaps

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.380
Your knife plants itself

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.380
right in the back of the spidery creature

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.380
and it takes

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:42.380
how many damage

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:44.380
to pull five damage

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:48.380
That's a lot for a spider, right?

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.380
At the same time

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.380
It's not bad for a spider, but we're talking

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.380
lightning spiders, bro

01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:56.380
At the same time

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.380
the electric bolt I mentioned earlier

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.380
coursing through your system deals

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.380
eight damage to you

01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.380
That's nothing

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.380
You feel quite a jolted

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.380
by that

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.380
There you go

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.380
At

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.380
At what?

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.380
Scorching rate

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.380
At the stem

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.380
connected to the kidney

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.380
At the damaged stem

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:24.380
you miss

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.380
The scorching ray

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.380
flies into the wall and immediately

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:32.380
blackens the surface

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.380
but quickly gory generates back to its

01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.380
former glory

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:38.380
I climb back up on Sharpie's shoulders

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.380
I grab my emerald dagger and just jam it

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.380
right up in the thing

01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:44.380
Right up in the

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.380
Do kidneys have butts?

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:48.380
There's a crease somewhere

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.380
I put it in the kidney crease

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.380
Sliding your dagger

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.380
directly into the crease

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.380
of what we're considering a kidney

01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:58.380
for the purposes of this exercise

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.380
A burst of brilliant green light

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.380
flows out

01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:06.380
The kidney starts glowing with an intense

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:08.380
bright light and it's not long before

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.380
shimmering rays of light

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.380
are blasting out of the surface of the kidney

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.380
You can see all the spiders

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.380
are frantically trying to heal

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.380
what damage is being done

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.380
but at the same time they can't keep up

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:22.380
Soon you're covered in a shower of giblets

01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.380
as this kidney explodes

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.380
Ghiblet shower

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.380
Ghiblet shower

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.380
Ghiblet shower

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.380
Ghiblet shower

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.380
For the next half hour

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.380
Ghiblet showers

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.380
25 cents

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.380
Thanks for coming to Tobi Keys

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.380
I love Ghiblet showers and grill

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.380
Two for one

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:46.380
Ghiblet showers are happening at the back of the bar

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.380
You can peel off the lacquer and eat it

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.380
Lion dancing is coming up

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.380
Hoochie-goochie till you spoochie-doochie

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:56.380
We're going to play

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.380
footage of weapons tests

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.380
on the video wall

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.380
Alright

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.380
Did we kill this thing?

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.380
Just pray for another war

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:08.380
We're just going to get down on our knees

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.380
and just pray for war

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.380
The organ is exploded

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.380
but your actions have pissed off

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.380
those things I was talking about

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:18.380
and they shoot lightning towards you

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.380
The giblets aren't harmful

01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:22.380
The giblets are just embarrassing

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.380
and gross

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.380
I shoot two sleep arrows

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:28.380
But not before taking

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:30.380
12 lightning damage

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.380
Everyone

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.380
Spencer, are we okay?

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:36.380
I don't know, how much HP do you have?

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:38.380
How much more do I have?

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.380
HP, that thing that tracks how dead you are

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.380
I shouldn't really teach you guys

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.380
how to play this at some point

01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.380
I didn't know hit points were called HP

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.380
I thought that was a sauce you put on French fries

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.380
and a pub

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.380
Well, you do that too

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:54.380
I have 27 HP

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:56.380
Damn, what?

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.380
I have 27 HP

01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.380
Damn, well now you have 15

01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:02.380
Hi, Spencer, I thought we were friends

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.380
You can get hurt and be friends

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.380
No, it's okay, it really seems like

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:08.380
we're not friends right now

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:10.380
I go into a rage

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:12.380
a barbarian rage

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.380
and I start spinning

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.380
faster and faster and faster

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:18.380
and I punch myself with my sword attack

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.380
into the thing and try to take out as many

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:22.380
lightning spiders as I can

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.380
Alright, let's see here

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.380
I'm going to call that an advanced

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:28.380
cleave action

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:30.380
Yeah, that's what I call it

01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.380
You mean an ACA?

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.380
Yeah, I could have said

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.380
I could have told you I want to do an ACA

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.380
but these fuckers, they wouldn't have known

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:46.380
Man, I like your pollen head shake

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:50.380
Thanks, Aaron

01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.380
Swinging your sword

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:54.380
in a circular fashion

01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.380
You strike the first spider

01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:00.380
Spiders everywhere

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:02.380
Jeff, you're millering, you're millering

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:04.380
Sorry cha-cha

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:06.380
You only

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:08.380
managed to deal 8 to the spider

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:10.380
but as it was already wounded

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:12.380
from your earlier dagger it falls

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.380
to the ground and dissipates into white energy

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:16.380
What the kidney does?

01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.380
The kidney?

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:20.380
Now the kidneys are exploded

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.380
Yeah

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.380
I feel bad for killing a spider

01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.380
I was in Charlotte's web, you know

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:30.380
It says crunchy

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.380
I'd put it at Mulraine's turn

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.380
Mulraine, you're up

01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.380
Do a thing

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:42.380
I like vagueness

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.380
I'm going to take two of my V arrows

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.380
Nice

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.380
I'm going to shoot them

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.380
The best to shoot at

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.380
You picked the best of three identical enemies

01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:56.380
to fire at

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.380
and firing two arrows

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.380
I see some of that lightning creatures

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.380
Yeah, those are the ones who are fighting

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.380
Firing them directly at the lightning creatures

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:06.380
both of your arrows make their mark

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.380
dealing

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.380
and

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:12.380
11 damage apiece

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:16.380
The spiders are wounded

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:18.380
They scuttle up the ceiling

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.380
and dissipate in the ceiling

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.380
Yay

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.380
They dissipate

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.380
Kidney beaters

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.380
Who wants giblets?

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:32.380
Vellison pipes up

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:34.380
He's like, yeah, I make sandwiches out of this shit, man

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:36.380
I'll take a giblet sandwich

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.380
Hell yeah, let me get my bread of holding

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.380
It's just regular bread

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.380
Yeah

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:46.380
Last delicious mustard

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.380
Nice

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.380
It's spicily effective

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.380
Alright, well, that seems like a

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:56.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it's a good place

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:58.380
to stop

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.380
We're two thirds through

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.380
the infinite fish

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.380
Come see us at the merch table

01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.380
We have a limited amount of time

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:10.380
Erin McGathy, everybody

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:12.380
Spencer Crinton

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.380
Just in case

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.380
Thank you, Luke, for my sharpie wand

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.380
Do you see it fits snugly into the mic stand?

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.380
Yeah, it would work perfectly

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.380
for, you know

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.380
There's another

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.380
Jeff, I think before everyone

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:30.380
dies, everyone needs to have a podcast where they

01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:32.380
tell people they put something in their butt

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.380
and then have people come to the show

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.380
with things that they put in their butt

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:38.380
and give up to them

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:40.380
Yeah, you make that thing vibrate

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:42.380
I don't have sex to either

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:44.380
It's just a wonderful,

01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:46.380
goddamn dream that I'm living

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:48.380
Turn 40, I came across the country

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.380
I crowdsurfed in Brooklyn

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.380
And now we're at the top of the country

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.380
The top of it, a mile above sea level

01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.380
looking down through the clouds

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.380
Are we the highest point in the country?

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.380
No

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.380
Highest capital

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.380
Stretching for a record

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:06.380
You know what I like though?

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.380
It's a relief to be in a city where

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:10.380
there's so many states where you go

01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:12.380
It's not the capital, but

01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.380
it's the biggest city

01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.380
I feel like we didn't want to get to know Denver

01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.380
all that well tonight, we were kind of doing our own thing up here

01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.380
We're going to fix that right now

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:22.380
It's time to...

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.380
I want to know who's hurting the most

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.380
I really mean that, who had the worst day?

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.380
Okay

01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.380
He's kind of uncertain about it

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.380
What's your name? My name is Keller

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.380
Keller? Okay, is that why?

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.380
Dan

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.380
He's hurting, I'm sorry

01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:40.380
It was an easy joke

01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.380
There's a funny story about that

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.380
I was at a party with someone from

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:46.380
Switzerland

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.380
And she asked me

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.380
Is your name really Keller?

01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:52.380
Yeah, she's like

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.380
You know that means basement, right?

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:56.380
Basement?

01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:58.380
Like cellar? Exactly

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.380
Dirty, underground, shameful

01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:04.380
It's a sad name

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.380
Sad, creepy, skeevy

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:08.380
name

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.380
So what happened?

01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.380
What happened? What happened?

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:14.380
Why are you having a bad day?

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:16.380
It's kind of just the

01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.380
Well for one it's been

01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.380
like 65 years

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:22.380
which is a

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:24.380
strange thing to bitch about

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.380
It's really nice weather

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.380
It's the end of January

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.380
I don't understand

01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.380
You're worried about global warming

01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.380
The weather's weird, that's why

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.380
Are you a scientist?

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.380
Yeah, I was an English major

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.380
Okay, so what's depressing about it being

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.380
65?

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:46.380
It's not typical

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:48.380
Forget that, it was a lame thing to be upset about

01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:52.380
What's the deeper trouble though

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.380
of little things like that

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.380
I'm not joking, if little things like that bother you

01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:58.380
like what's

01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.380
Please

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.380
Please, we checked this lady over here

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:04.380
because she's been very vocal

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.380
What is your name miss?

01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:08.380
Lexie

01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:10.380
What does that mean in Swiss?

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.380
It means worst friend ever, you've been really

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.380
You're really heckling your friend

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.380
We show up the same

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.380
We dress the same at parties

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.380
We show up at parties wearing the same outfit

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.380
And that's why I'm upset

01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.380
Alright, come on guys

01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:32.380
Okay, you're a poetry major

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.380
You got a degree in poetry

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.380
Your name is

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:38.380
Lex Luthor

01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.380
What's it?

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.380
Keller Keller

01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.380
And it's warm outside

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:48.380
Today was a bad day because

01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:52.380
Lexie

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:54.380
Pipe it

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.380
So it's basically

01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.380
My issue is

01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:00.380
I

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:02.380
Not that I lack direction in life

01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.380
Everybody, I'm sorry

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.380
I'm sorry audience

01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:10.380
I

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:12.380
It's okay, I do the same thing you're doing

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:14.380
for 90 minutes

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:16.380
And I charge them

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.380
20 dollars

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:20.380
So I was a creative writing major

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.380
not a poetry major

01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.380
Please

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:30.380
I want to tell stories to people for a living

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:32.380
but I have no idea how to go about that

01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.380
We're going to help you with that right now

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.380
Fuck me, awesome

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.380
Alright, Keller to the stage

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.380
We're going to give you the gift of storytelling

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:46.380
We're going to make a story

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.380
We're going pretty long here

01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:50.380
We're going to make this very quick

01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:52.380
This is how we're going to end

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.380
I didn't ask him to come up

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:56.380
I said we're going to help you with that right now

01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:58.380
Then you said come up

01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:00.380
I just think it's better to have an episode

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.380
We can all get a look at them

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:04.380
Yeah, yeah, well look at them folks

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:12.380
Alright, Keller

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.380
Let's see here

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.380
You're struggling with how to tell a story

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:18.380
In like what?

01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.380
What's your work that you're supposed to produce

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.380
for your class

01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:24.380
You want to be a writer

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.380
A novelist, a screenwriter

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.380
What do you want to be?

01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:30.380
My aspiration is to write comics

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.380
First of all

01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.380
I'm a shitty fucking artist

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:36.380
Second, no

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.380
It's just the truth

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:40.380
More people need to admit that really

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.380
Coming from the world of comics

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.380
It's a heroic of you to say

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.380
I draw badly

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:48.380
So I want to do that

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.380
Denver isn't a good publishing

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.380
place

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:54.380
I'm from Fort Collins

01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:58.380
Does someone say fuck Fort Collins?

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:02.380
Lexie calm the fuck down

01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:04.380
Holy shit

01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:06.380
Take it easy baby

01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:16.380
Take it easy Lexie

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:18.380
We said who had a terrible day

01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.380
Keller raised his hand

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.380
I think Lexie had a worse one

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:24.380
I think the reason for Keller's bad day

01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.380
is Lexie

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:28.380
Where did you drive here from?

01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:30.380
From Fort Collins

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.380
With Lexie in the backseat?

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.380
She's like

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.380
That's a dumb gas station girl

01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:38.380
Everyone tears on fire

01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:40.380
Just kidding

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:42.380
Don't you intend to free mine?

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:48.380
I'm desperately trying to figure out

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:50.380
how to turn a conversation with you

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.380
into a hilarious improvised bit

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.380
That's my math on the table

01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:56.380
So you write comics

01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.380
You're from Fort Collins

01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:00.380
You're in Denver

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:02.380
You write comics

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.380
You're bad at drawing

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:06.380
And you're looking for a story so good

01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.380
that it would make a great comic book

01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:10.380
I always

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:12.380
So what's your favorite

01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.380
thing ever?

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.380
Bananas

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.380
What was your mom's name?

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.380
Samantha?

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.380
Alias Bun made up name

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.380
What's your mom's name?

01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.380
Ellen

01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:30.380
That means attic

01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.380
And you

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:34.380
And your favorite movie?

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.380
Ah, fuck

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.380
Just a favorite movie

01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.380
American Astronaut

01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.380
What? Okay

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.380
Alright, tell her everybody

01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:46.380
American Astronaut is his favorite movie

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.380
He's a comic artist

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:52.380
He's looking for the perfect story

01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:54.380
His name means seller

01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:56.380
And here is his biopic

01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.380
Bananas

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.380
Catch your bananas

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:04.380
I really like one of those bananas

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.380
Alright

01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:08.380
These aren't regular bananas

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.380
These bananas will give you everything

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.380
you possibly could want

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.380
But it comes at a terrible, terrible price

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.380
I just want to have the banana

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.380
Can I explain something to you?

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:22.380
I'm a writer

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:24.380
I don't

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.380
I'm a banana salesman

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:28.380
I still mythical bananas

01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:30.380
I don't have all day to talk with people like this

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:32.380
I'll take three of them

01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:34.380
Okay

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.380
That'll be four dollars

01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:38.380
There you go

01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:40.380
I'm going back to my basement

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.380
where I live

01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:44.380
Remember, Keller

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:46.380
I named you basement

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:48.380
So you would never get ahead in life

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.380
Oh

01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:52.380
Oh you bitch

01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:54.380
Ellen

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:56.380
Alright

01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:58.380
I gotta try to draw this comic book

01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:00.380
Stupid

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.380
Holy stupid

01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:08.380
Lexi

01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:10.380
I didn't know you were down here

01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.380
I'm trying to draw a comic book

01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:14.380
Oh Lexi, honestly

01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:18.380
You insinuate yourself into my life

01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.380
Oh god

01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:22.380
She's dead

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:24.380
Oh god, there's a dart in her neck

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:26.380
Oh god, it's a ninja dart

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.380
Yes, a banana man came back

01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:30.380
Yes, I told you those were cursed

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:32.380
Everyone that you love will die

01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:34.380
within 35 seconds of meeting them

01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:36.380
Because you shot her with a banana dart

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:38.380
Right

01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:40.380
Is it a curse or do you just kill people

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:42.380
that are your customers

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:44.380
It's my curse, I'm a murderer

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:48.380
It's a good story material, buh-bye

01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:50.380
It is good story material

01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:52.380
I hate to be ghoulish

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:54.380
but I've never had a better idea

01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:56.380
Oh, maybe I could stop trying

01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:58.380
to draw things and just write an idea

01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:00.380
I'm a ghost of Lexi

01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:02.380
Lexi, you dying is the best thing

01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:04.380
that's ever happened to you

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:06.380
I'm going to Comic Con

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:08.380
No, you can't

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.380
That's stupid, it's stupid, you can't do it

01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:12.380
It's not about everything

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:14.380
It doesn't matter

01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:16.380
She got killed by a ghost

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:18.380
Even they hated a ghost world

01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:20.380
Banana man could kill ghosts too

01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.380
Three months later

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:24.380
at Comic Con

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.380
So you see, my idea is about a girl

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.380
who gets shot by a ghost dart

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.380
and I have

01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:32.380
an indistinguishable accent

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.380
It's part Austrian

01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.380
part Asperger's

01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:38.380
I put it all

01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:40.380
into my work and it's crazy

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:42.380
It's just 65 degrees today

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:44.380
and it just drove me nuts

01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:48.380
So I'm hoping that you will buy this

01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:50.380
a Stan Lee

01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:54.380
I like it, kid

01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:56.380
Excelsior

01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.380
It's in the way

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:00.380
that she uses

01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:02.380
credits

01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:04.380
What did she do

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:08.380
Next to the credits

01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.380
No, a dart went in your neck

01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:12.380
I don't know what I'm going to fool

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:14.380
Fool, I mean do

01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:16.380
Let's poop it

01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:18.380
Lexi, okay

01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:20.380
Thank you everybody

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.380
That was Keller's Movie

01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:24.380
Keller's Story

01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.380
Keller's Biopic

01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:30.380
That was entitled

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:32.380
The Final Panel

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.380
There's a deleted scene

01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:36.380
that involves an astronaut man

01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:38.380
or whatever his favorite movie

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:40.380
is some fucked up Swedish film

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:42.380
No one gives a shit about it

01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:44.380
Alright, why don't you watch Die Hard

01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:46.380
for once in your life

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.380
Harry Potter 3, look it up

01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:50.380
I like the American Astronaut

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:52.380
That's my weather fucks with you because it's normal

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.380
You're separating yourself

01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:58.380
from everything normal

01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:00.380
It's 65 degrees, it makes my skin itch

01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.380
It's normal

01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.380
I hate when it gets hot again in a lake

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:06.380
I like to wear suits and I like the chilly weather

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.380
I like sweater weather, now it's getting hot again

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:10.380
so you're screwed, right?

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:12.380
That's what you're saying

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:24.380
Please tell me you all live together

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.380
in one apartment

01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:28.380
It's kind of like Shallow Grave

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:30.380
It's like some indie movie

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.380
They all find a case of heroin

01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.380
and they're all poetry majors

01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.380
and they just end up all dead at the end

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.380
I think Mission Accomplished

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.380
we dove that in the audience

01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:42.380
I think we really get the real taste

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:44.380
of Denver from that

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:46.380
A little bell pepper, a little ham

01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.380
Yeah, I think

01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:50.380
everyone else in the audience is like

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:52.380
yeah, I'm glad you talked to Keller and Lexi

01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.380
I wish

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:56.380
I was hoping you would talk to me

01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.380
but that's pretty much part of the course

01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.380
Denver, it's the altitude

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.380
It'll get you

01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:04.380
You played the guitar in Nashville and you talked to Keller

01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.380
and Lexi

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:10.380
Alright Harmon, I think it's time to bring this train

01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:12.380
right into the stage and talk about what we learned

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.380
It's so sad

01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.380
Sad? I don't want to leave Denver

01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.380
I don't want to leave here either

01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:20.380
We have to get on the bus right after we leave

01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:22.380
We can stay and drink for a little bit

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:24.380
I don't get to see the town at all

01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:26.380
Believe me, we'd stay here forever

01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:28.380
But you know we can't

01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:30.380
Hide your cheese sticks everybody

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:54.380
When your city is high, you just roll downtown to go to Harvett town

01:34:54.380 --> 01:35:00.380
And Tato's kids make me fart

01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:02.380
So I'm walking it around the room

01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:04.380
Crap, dusting it like baby from a wolf

01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:06.380
And Harvett town

01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:08.380
I'm hoping that if I keep walking

01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:10.380
The little trail behind

01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:14.380
And I'm sorry if it gets in your nose

01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:16.380
But in Denver that's how it goes

01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:18.380
And I hope the altitude

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.380
Makes the dudes not smell it

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:24.380
But I'm sorry that I'm singing about hearts

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:26.380
I should be singing about hearts

01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.380
I should be singing about omelets

01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:32.380
And lexer and schooly

01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:34.380
Whatever your names were

01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:36.380
Weird hipsters

01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:38.380
I don't know about Dave and his cheese sticks

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:42.380
And Kelsey and her kite

01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:44.380
I'm now making shit up

01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:46.380
You're a great city

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:48.380
You're the best city in the entire country

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.380
You're so good

01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:52.380
I'm gonna change your name to Harvett town

01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:54.380
And we're gonna go to the mountains

01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:56.380
We're gonna secede from the union soon

01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:58.380
We're gonna fuck this country

01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:02.380
And fuck Toby Keith in the eye

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:06.380
Fuck that guy

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.380
His drinks are overpriced

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.380
Margaritas don't even taste that nice

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:14.380
He puts too much salt on the rim

01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.380
That drives me nuts

01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.380
Fuck you, Toby Keith

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.380
In your butts

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:29.380
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:32.380
This fuck confuses structural tweak or two

01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:35.380
Harvett town

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:38.380
Where he is yellow and the poop is brown

01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:40.380
I butt you in my mind

01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:42.380
Harvett town

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.380
Look at Raquel tip her ass

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:46.380
as she's got nice hair.

01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:48.380
Thank you so much, Jen for improv.

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:50.380
Thank you.

01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:54.380
Come on, sir. Come on, sir.

01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:56.380
Thank you, Ryan, Adam, Jude, Stephen, I'm proud.

01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:57.380
Come on, sir.

01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.380
Oh, shit.

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.380
You had too many cheese sticks, man.

01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:01.380
Come on, sir.

01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:02.380
God damn it.

01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:03.380
It's the altitude.

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:04.380
Oh, shit.

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:05.380
It touched me.

01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:06.380
It touched me.

01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:07.380
Actually, get on here.

01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.380
Come on, Alex.

01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:10.380
Bend your hand.

01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:12.380
Come on, come on, sir.

01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:13.380
Here we go.

01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:20.380
I'm over one mile above sea level.

01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:24.380
I'm 5,283 feet up.

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.380
God, sir, thank you.

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:28.380
God, sir, thank you for coming here.

01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:29.380
Oh, God.

01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:30.380
Oh, God.

01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:32.380
My ass is in a plate of calamari.

01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:33.380
Oh, God.

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.380
Oh, shit.

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:35.380
Oh, fuck.

01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:37.380
Rob Schneider's here next week, folks.

01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:40.380
Thank you, JJ, for coming up and bringing us back in.

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:42.380
Thank you, Luke, for the air.

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.380
Thank you.

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:44.380
Thank you, guys.

01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:45.380
It was coloring.

01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:46.380
Coloring Lexi.

01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:47.380
Whoa.

01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:48.380
Dan Murray.

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:49.380
One more time for Spencer, everybody.

01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:50.380
Here at the Cafe, I'm Jeff Davis.

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:51.380
One more time in the mayor of Harmontown.

01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:52.380
He made it through.

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.380
He did this elevation.

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.380
Dan Harmon.

01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.380
Jeff Davis returns as Comptroller.

01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.380
I'm sure he ate so much this month.

01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.380
Thank you.

01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:58.380
Thank you.

01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.380
Thank you.

01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:00.380
Thank you.

01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:01.380
Thank you.

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:02.380
Thank you.

01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:03.380
Thank you.

01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.380
Thank you.

01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.380
Thank you.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.380
Thank you.

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.380
Thank you.

01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.380
Thank you.

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:09.380
Thank you.

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:10.380
Thank you.

01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:11.380
Thank you.

01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.380
Thank you.

01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:15.380
Thank you so much.

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:17.380
Thank you.

01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.300
Thank you.

01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:28.500
Thank you.

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.500
Thank you.

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:31.880
Thank you.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.380
Thank you.

01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:34.660
Thank you.

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:35.660
Hello.

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:36.660
Really?

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.380
Yes.

01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:10.440
you

01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:40.440
you

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.440
you

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.440
you

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:41.380
you

01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:45.380
secret track, the secret hidden track

01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:49.380
secret hidden track

01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:55.380
it faded down and now if you're listening to night tunes and you left it playing maybe you'll hear this

01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:59.380
I am so racist

01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:04.380
just hate, I hate all races

01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:06.380
white people included

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:11.380
and I hate, I hate, I hate all children

01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:14.380
especially racial children

01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:18.380
and what'd you say lady?

01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.380
what'd you say?

01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:27.380
nothing ever sounds cool when you have to say it the third time but what

01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:33.380
what? all retail customers

01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:40.380
P.J. Augustus first

01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:44.380
that's a secret password

01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:50.380
if you repeat it and throw the keys you get a free flag and a grenade shaped pencil holder

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:54.380
that was the secret track

01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:56.380
secret track

01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.380
secret track

01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:06.380
the value is in its secrecy

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:09.380
there is no value beyond its own secrecy

01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:13.380
you just listen to it and you just go oh I'm listening to something that's secret

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.380
you don't get anything more than that

01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:17.380
okay one more thing

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:20.380
I have buried a million dollars somewhere in North America

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:27.380
it's beneath three palm trees there's a QR code in the next commercial for the third season

01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:32.380
of NBC's Kate and Ben

01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:37.380
I think that's a fox show and I think it's called Ben and Kate

01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:42.380
during one of the commercials you'll see a QR code a rabbit will be fucking a balloon

01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:46.380
and there's a QR, if you take a QR scanner and scan it in

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:50.380
you'll be able to follow, there's a treasure, there's a million dollars

01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:52.380
I swear to God you can sue me if I'm lying

01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:57.380
someone in this room will win a million dollars in cash, tax-free

01:44:57.380 --> 01:44:59.380
there's blood on it

01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:08.380
