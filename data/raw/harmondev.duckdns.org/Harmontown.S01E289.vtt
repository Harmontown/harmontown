00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
Hello, how's it going everybody?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
It's June 4th, 2018, Harmontown is in a new venue at the beautiful

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
dynasty typewriter at the Hayworth Theater.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Right here in MacArthur Park and the prestigious prostitution districts.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm very, very proud to be back and I'm more proud to say out loud to all y'all

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah, this place is groovy.

01:02.000 --> 01:20.000
Speaking of groovy, let's bring out the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And just to keep things consistent, how about a mayor up in this piece?

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
Let's welcome your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.960
South, in the east of the west, under breast.

02:03.960 --> 02:09.520
Wrapping is pretty easy, just like George LePuisie.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.120
You just rhyme certain words that tend to come up

02:12.120 --> 02:14.880
like little turds.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.040
The same words arrive.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.920
When you're rapping live, you get some energy from the crowd.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.760
Then you rap.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.600
Don't be loud!

02:23.600 --> 02:31.080
Good. Thank you for setting me up for that.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.240
There's a lower bar for what's funny now.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.920
Thank God we were eight months in a dark cave.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.200
I didn't cut my hair or shave.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.680
I was a lonely, sad, curmudgeonly kknave.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.000
I rapped a lot about sadness.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.040
Now I'm back and talking about madness.

02:50.040 --> 02:54.240
I'm here, a dynasty type writer rapping about peace.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.600
All right, let's...

02:58.600 --> 03:00.200
Hello, Los Angeles.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.840
I can't make eye contact with you yet.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.400
You notice I haven't made eye contact with you?

03:08.400 --> 03:09.360
This feels right.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.440
This feels like an old timey vaudeville house

03:12.440 --> 03:14.120
meets movie theater, meets...

03:14.120 --> 03:15.720
Like, it's sexy in here.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.200
It smells like popcorn.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.520
That's me. That's me.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.320
And I spent so long picking this shirt,

03:21.320 --> 03:24.720
and then it was like, oh, did the shirt go with the pant?

03:24.720 --> 03:26.360
And then there was pizza backstage,

03:26.360 --> 03:29.600
and there's just grease.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.480
Just spots all over.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.480
Is this your way of subtly pointing out

03:33.480 --> 03:35.560
that you've lost quite a bit of weight, Dan, huh?

03:35.560 --> 03:36.440
I...

03:40.440 --> 03:45.240
Yeah, pizza stains is my way of...

03:45.240 --> 03:47.480
Yeah, well, I mean, that's about it.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.160
I can't really...

03:49.160 --> 03:52.160
There's nothing to talk about.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.160
Let's see.

03:53.160 --> 03:59.160
I guess, I mean, here's a segment.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.320
A new segment. It's called...

04:00.320 --> 04:05.680
Oh, yeah, our new promise here at the new theater, segments.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.080
We're gonna bring the segments.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.080
Our research shows people like segments.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.960
You're gonna be tired of segments before the show is over.

04:13.960 --> 04:14.760
Yeah.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.320
I watched the human centipede trilogy.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.320
I know, people love segments.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.160
Uh...

04:23.160 --> 04:25.280
They're gonna sew his ass to mouth!

04:25.280 --> 04:26.840
Oh!

04:26.840 --> 04:28.160
Uh...

04:28.160 --> 04:30.760
Uh...

04:30.760 --> 04:32.360
This segment is called...

04:32.360 --> 04:34.680
Who Are You Kidding?

04:34.680 --> 04:38.160
With Dan Harmon.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.040
Who Are You Kidding?

04:40.040 --> 04:42.360
This segment's about...

04:42.360 --> 04:44.080
Who Are You Kidding?

04:44.080 --> 04:46.120
Do you think you're kidding someone

04:46.120 --> 04:47.640
when you say these things?

04:47.640 --> 04:48.720
There's two things.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.960
They belong in the same category.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.600
Who Are You Kidding?

04:52.600 --> 04:57.320
Wait, not to take away from how good that intro song was.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.360
You couldn't see it.

04:58.360 --> 05:03.760
But Brandon Johnson just ran from backstage

05:03.760 --> 05:07.320
up through the house with a piece of pizza in his hands.

05:07.320 --> 05:10.960
Like one of the boogins in a quiet place.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.840
He just fucking...

05:12.840 --> 05:17.040
He heard somebody yelling outside and eating a baby.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.240
What did he... Why?

05:18.240 --> 05:19.640
He couldn't go around?

05:19.640 --> 05:21.640
There is... There's no around to go.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.680
Okay.

05:22.680 --> 05:23.360
Yeah.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.240
People think that Brandon is like...

05:25.240 --> 05:27.920
We call him in when you're out of town.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.120
But Brandon's always with us.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.960
He haunts us like a little pizza ghost.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.920
He's a pizza thief.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.320
Where were we?

05:38.320 --> 05:39.880
This is called... Who Are You Kidding?

05:39.880 --> 05:40.520
Who Are You Kidding?

05:40.520 --> 05:44.680
Okay, so... Okay.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.840
I run the risk of... Please appreciate my candor.

05:47.840 --> 05:52.160
I run the risk of offending a lot of close friends, really.

05:52.160 --> 05:52.720
When I say this.

05:52.720 --> 06:03.760
But you know that anybody who is actively working

06:03.760 --> 06:10.400
in the television or movie industry as a writer,

06:10.400 --> 06:15.480
we know that you don't really actually want to pick our brain.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.240
You want us to read your shitty script.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.560
Like you... You want us to...

06:20.560 --> 06:21.840
You want some... It's not...

06:21.840 --> 06:24.760
You pick your brain like when you say...

06:24.760 --> 06:28.120
I just want to pick your brain.

06:28.120 --> 06:28.960
That's not true.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.160
That's not what you want to do.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.880
Because that sounds fun.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.720
Like it sounds like you want to actually like...

06:34.720 --> 06:37.320
Oh, I want to hear all about what you have to say.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.520
But that's not really... It never works out that way.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.080
When you say pick your brain, you mean...

06:44.080 --> 06:45.160
I need something from you.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.120
I want something from you.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.480
I want a favor from you.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.560
That's a lunch that no one's going to show up for.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.200
Who Are You Kidding?

06:50.200 --> 06:54.080
Dan, can I pick your brain for a second?

06:54.080 --> 06:54.960
I have some dry cleaning.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.480
I need to pick that.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.840
I just want to pick your brain.

06:58.840 --> 06:59.800
And it's always like you go,

06:59.800 --> 07:01.560
oh, what did you want to pick my brain about?

07:01.560 --> 07:03.640
Well, boy, I'm in a real pickle.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.360
Because I wrote this screenplay.

07:05.360 --> 07:09.120
And I want to give it to Roseanne.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.000
But I also want to...

07:10.000 --> 07:12.120
It's like, no, what do you mean?

07:12.120 --> 07:13.200
Like, you just...

07:13.200 --> 07:14.480
Now is the perfect time.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.480
Yeah.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.760
I don't know why she's in my iCloud.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.440
Well, there is...

07:22.440 --> 07:23.360
She's in everyone's iCloud.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.400
Oh, right, Dan, I can get you, Roseanne.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.600
She's working at competitive rates right now.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.680
I really got to walk back.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.120
I don't know if I've done it on this podcast,

07:35.120 --> 07:36.840
but I got to walk back like 20 years

07:36.840 --> 07:38.920
of basically going to bat for Roseanne.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.640
And here's why.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.600
Because like, I don't...

07:42.600 --> 07:45.520
I mean, there was a time when all she was

07:45.520 --> 07:49.720
was she was just branded crazy lady with power.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.920
And like, I'm super woke and was back then.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.840
And I had a girlfriend at the time

07:56.840 --> 07:59.080
that was like a media studies like, you know,

07:59.080 --> 08:00.840
the analyst thingamabob.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.560
And she, you know, I was having trouble with a community

08:03.560 --> 08:05.880
and I would come home and like, Sony doesn't get me

08:05.880 --> 08:07.760
and NBC and all these Ivy League guys

08:07.760 --> 08:09.480
and all the stuff and she's like, you know,

08:09.480 --> 08:11.320
Roseanne went through what you're going through.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.560
And I kind of gobbled it up.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.560
And it was like, oh, really?

08:14.560 --> 08:16.080
I thought Roseanne was a crazy lady.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.040
And she's like, well, what do you think women

08:18.040 --> 08:19.160
with power are called?

08:19.160 --> 08:21.920
They're called crazy ladies by the like old boys network.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.280
And so I always, you know, that was like 15,

08:25.280 --> 08:26.760
that was a million years ago.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.240
That was eight years ago.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.680
But like that whole time I've always been like,

08:31.680 --> 08:33.280
and then I heard they were rebooting the show.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.560
And I'm like, I saw like the people being like,

08:36.560 --> 08:38.720
oh, we shouldn't do this stuff.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.800
And I gotta say, it was like, you know,

08:41.800 --> 08:43.920
to the extent that we have to like be accountable

08:43.920 --> 08:45.840
to our tweets, like our tweets mean anything.

08:45.840 --> 08:49.080
But I did weigh in on the side of like, hey, come on,

08:49.080 --> 08:51.960
let's not overreact the, what if it's like all the family?

08:51.960 --> 08:54.320
Like, isn't that gonna be therapeutic and wonderful?

08:54.320 --> 08:58.320
And I had friends, anyways, turns out she's a crazy lady.

08:58.320 --> 09:03.320
So, so, so, oh.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.800
Rob Schrab, you know how the,

09:20.800 --> 09:24.200
I thought my, I thought my observation like came

09:24.200 --> 09:28.000
into the station and like, I was so proud of myself.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.280
Turns out she's a crazy lady.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.240
And I was like, whoo!

09:32.240 --> 09:34.040
Rob Schrab for our listeners has a vacuum.

09:34.040 --> 09:34.880
What?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.120
He's holding an ineffectual microphone to it.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.840
You know, you know, a showtime with the Apollo

09:39.840 --> 09:42.240
has a Sandman, he comes out with a broom.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.200
This is like the white privilege version of that.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.160
Well, come on out, come on out.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.840
Rob Schrab, everybody!

09:48.840 --> 09:49.840
Who you kidding?

09:49.840 --> 09:53.760
I was hoping that was gonna be a lot more disruptive.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.880
Seeing as modern vacuum cleaners,

09:55.880 --> 09:58.080
a little quieter, a little subtler.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.920
It's on hiss mode.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.760
All right, there's one more.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.080
It's on hiss mode.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.320
Put it on loud comedy entrance mode.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.920
There's one more part to my segment, I don't know.

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
I don't know.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.920
I don't know.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
I don't know.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.920
I don't know.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.920
There's one more part to my segment, I don't know.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.920
All right, well, okay.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.920
Dan, you want to take it back to who you kidding?

10:35.920 --> 10:36.920
All right, we're back to who you kidding?

10:36.920 --> 10:38.920
You got one more, right?

10:38.920 --> 10:39.920
I got another one, yeah.

10:39.920 --> 10:40.920
You got a new one?

10:40.920 --> 10:41.920
Okay, back to who you kidding?

10:41.920 --> 10:45.920
Who you kidding?

10:48.920 --> 10:52.920
These are things that make me say who you kidding?

Where does that outrage come from?

I don't even know...

11:26.920 --> 11:29.920
I'm still feeling so much shit on my head.

He's mad and he had the vacuum set on quiet mode and he's making up for it.

12:45.580 --> 12:52.380
the ground since the last show no Rob I'm just short is your table

12:52.380 --> 12:55.900
unfeasibly high or your chair is strangely low no you know I've been

12:55.900 --> 13:02.580
losing weight it turns out you can lose weight in more than one direction yes

13:02.580 --> 13:07.020
you take out three vertebrae it's like seven pounds no it's amazing there's a

13:07.020 --> 13:14.460
lot of life hacks that I've learned do you know how much a kidney weighs 20

13:14.460 --> 13:27.660
pounds wow yeah what I know I lost 40 pounds Spencer almost got beat up on

13:27.660 --> 13:33.260
I just let me put a ribbon on this I don't I don't even believe in the

13:33.260 --> 13:36.540
segment that much I did that's the thing is that it's not my fault that it's

13:36.540 --> 13:42.620
gonna be overloaded and then fall flat like this is good this is good

13:42.620 --> 13:49.220
people like this who you kidding when you say these things you kidding do you

13:49.220 --> 13:54.020
really think you're fooling people who you kidding with Dan Harmon who you

13:54.020 --> 13:57.660
kidding with Dan Harmon all right so I just want to say has anybody in the

13:57.660 --> 14:07.060
history of the entire species across the whole planet has anybody ever ever

14:07.060 --> 14:16.420
achieved when being told to calm down calmness

14:16.540 --> 14:22.780
is anybody ever heard been told to calm down and had as a result calmness come

14:22.780 --> 14:28.420
over them it's never ever happened right and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna wager

14:28.420 --> 14:32.620
this and I'm not gonna get hyperbolic I'm gonna cut it back to 90% I'm gonna

14:32.620 --> 14:39.260
say 90% of the people who say calm down are in a bit of an agitated state but

14:39.260 --> 14:42.780
I'm allowing for 10% of like crazy circumstances where there's like a

14:42.780 --> 14:47.020
paramedic who's genuinely trying to be helpful like calm down like like you're

14:47.020 --> 14:54.340
dying like or your mom is like like like like like what do I do mom like I got

14:54.340 --> 14:59.300
I got bit by a shark and I think if like if you're like a you're training to be a

14:59.300 --> 15:02.340
fighter pilot and you're like one of those big simulators and you start like

15:02.340 --> 15:06.540
oh you're crashing the things are happening and the guy that's in the

15:06.540 --> 15:12.540
bush and the instructor says okay calm down calm down like this is advice yeah

15:12.540 --> 15:18.700
like like like take a chill the most irritating context of it all is that

15:18.700 --> 15:21.980
because they listen to a lot of true crime shows it's just like fucking 911

15:21.980 --> 15:30.460
operators like you calm down oh my god my baby's been stabbed with a demon knife

15:30.460 --> 15:35.700
ma'am calm down like like what are you talking about like it's just it's so

15:35.700 --> 15:39.500
crazy like they keep saying calm down and the crazy the thing that drives me

15:39.500 --> 15:44.220
nuts about it is if you listen to any amount of true crime we all know what

15:44.220 --> 15:50.860
happens if you are calm when you call 911 you get thrown in prison for 20

15:50.860 --> 15:56.820
years because they can't get past your fucking weird tone and the 911 cop

15:56.820 --> 16:02.940
oh it doesn't sound like his wife got stabbed to me like yeah I'm fucking calm

16:02.940 --> 16:08.940
I'm so terrified of somebody I love getting killed I'm gonna call 911 it's

16:08.940 --> 16:13.420
gonna be like you know like when I leave a store like I if I don't buy

16:13.420 --> 16:19.180
anything like I act like a shoplifter because I'm like so anyways take it easy

16:19.180 --> 16:23.020
like like because I just feel like well you should have bought something but I

16:23.020 --> 16:26.140
didn't so I guess I look like I'm stealing something so I'll just lean up

16:26.140 --> 16:29.820
against the door and stretch and then like you know like I don't want them to

16:29.820 --> 16:34.420
think I'm bolting and then I look like I'm stealing something I'm someone if you

16:34.420 --> 16:40.460
get stabbed I'm not you know and then if I call up 911 dispatch and I say that

16:40.460 --> 16:45.300
there was a demon knife involved and the person on the other end of the line's

16:45.300 --> 16:52.740
first question isn't about demon nights then fuck them yeah man calm down calm

16:52.740 --> 17:00.380
down demon knife I like like Spencer what is the what's critical on a demon

17:00.380 --> 17:10.940
night 17 to 20 you're saying you saying on a big it'd be there should be there's

17:10.940 --> 17:15.220
got to be a better way I think what he's saying is people who say calm down

17:15.220 --> 17:17.220
who are you kidding

17:22.220 --> 17:28.220
who are you kidding who are you kidding oh who are you kidding

17:30.220 --> 17:34.580
do you have do you have another one there no no that's a two that's the segment

17:34.580 --> 17:39.460

18:04.540 --> 18:10.780

19:29.980 --> 19:37.380

19:41.140 --> 20:06.260
that lady but I cut and pasted these paragraphs from I guess we missed

20:06.260 --> 20:13.340
having an audience I guess I mean we spent four years at a comic book

20:13.340 --> 20:20.660
back room then went like to a weird warehouse but now we're in a proper

20:20.660 --> 20:27.100
theater and now we've found out the showman that Rob really is I've been

20:27.100 --> 20:36.260
hiding it pretty good Spencer Spencer is being diminished by his table

20:41.780 --> 20:47.340
hey Robin Dan Robin I came up with a segment before the show I said it that

20:47.340 --> 21:01.460
cabinet back there that's called the Rob's cabinet of Horace

21:01.900 --> 21:10.260
yeah why did a guy leave a comment on my Instagram today I looked at her and

21:10.260 --> 21:17.700
that there's one guy on my Instagram and said hey are you gonna address last

21:17.700 --> 21:24.900
week's show I think you better go to the subreddit oh damn he went there holy

21:24.900 --> 21:31.020
shit what is it to what first of all it happened to prove him wrong did not have

21:31.020 --> 21:38.060
to go to the subreddit feel fine but what what did he mean what did you well

21:38.060 --> 21:46.100
you gotta go to subreddit if you don't gotta be a way around this there can't

21:46.100 --> 21:49.940
be things that are only discussable what you're doing right now is what they

21:49.940 --> 21:55.220
call refusal of the call this is this is a call to adventure that you are

21:55.220 --> 21:59.620
choosing to refuse right now I'm not going on the subreddit I don't care how

21:59.620 --> 22:06.300
cryptic you are hey Bitcoin rewards on the subreddit I'm not falling for it

22:06.300 --> 22:11.900
anyways I don't know this isn't worth not worth it there's a segment called it's

22:11.900 --> 22:14.420
not worth it

22:14.900 --> 22:19.780
it's not worth it

22:19.780 --> 22:26.780
just something I pasted into my phone it's not worth it

22:26.780 --> 22:34.340
it's just a waste of time cover your ears if you like entertainment

22:34.340 --> 22:39.340
I just want to I just saw this paragraph I'm subscribed for some reason to this

22:39.340 --> 22:48.940
CNN newsletter and Brian Brian Steltler Steltler he kind of does this little

22:48.940 --> 22:53.420
newsletter at the end of the day and he's talking about the our missing first

22:53.420 --> 23:00.500
lady and but he kind of interrupted himself because his little headline it's

23:00.500 --> 23:07.900
like in this newsletter thing okay this story is a talker let me fend off some

23:07.900 --> 23:11.740
of the criticism I've already seen on social media

23:11.740 --> 23:17.620
stop you there what are you doing what he's talking a word that I don't know

23:17.620 --> 23:21.380
what that means it's in quotes I think he's gonna I think he's gonna define

23:21.380 --> 23:24.220
talker he's gonna say what people are talking about it or he's saying this is

23:24.220 --> 23:29.100
one I talk and you don't get the story is a talker let me fend off so it's like

23:29.100 --> 23:33.580
hey I'm CNN you should be paying attention to me because I am the news

23:33.580 --> 23:37.980
anyways first lady's missing hey all right before I continue with this let me

23:37.980 --> 23:42.940
just explain this isn't the kind of news you get to complain about this is a

23:42.940 --> 23:48.340
talker talker is a let me fend off some of the criticism I've already seen on

23:48.340 --> 23:53.940
social media no this is probably not the most important story involving the

23:53.940 --> 23:59.180
trumps right now but it's a talker in a way that policy debates and ethics

23:59.180 --> 24:04.180
scandals and abuse of power allegations are typically not people are genuinely

24:04.180 --> 24:09.380
curious about this and concerned about her

24:10.260 --> 24:17.180
what what are you doing I mean wait that's that's more news that paragraph

24:17.180 --> 24:22.620
CNN is more newsworthy than does anybody in the audience know that term a talker

24:22.620 --> 24:26.980
and what that actually means I think he's just in die he's indoctrinating us he's

24:26.980 --> 24:31.300
saying shut the fuck up and let me like it's a talker no the context is like it's

24:31.300 --> 24:36.620
a talker talking about it's like a squeaker yeah but nobody but he said

24:36.620 --> 24:39.380
the other things weren't talkers and those are things that people are also

24:39.380 --> 24:42.900
talking about more than his yeah that was a stupid thing to have said and he

24:42.900 --> 24:49.580
said it right but then then there's a second paragraph it goes at the same

24:49.580 --> 24:55.100
time as I said on Sunday's reliable sources I think there's a risk of some

24:55.100 --> 24:58.940
liberals falling into a conspiracy theory trap here by assuming the worst about

24:58.940 --> 25:03.980
what's going on we need less speculating more reporting right like no like less

25:03.980 --> 25:08.940
headlines saying that the first lady's missing maybe yeah this is no time for

25:08.940 --> 25:19.380
abuse of relationship is this why don't you just just give me a script about how dumb I am and I'll read the

25:19.380 --> 25:27.220
I'm dumb like a sorry CNN like I feel like I owe this news and apology now what

25:27.220 --> 25:31.380
did you just do what you think is news and I'll watch you or not is this story

25:31.380 --> 25:36.420
about how we're paying attention to Melania missing wrong yeah it's not we're

25:36.420 --> 25:40.620
not doing it the perfect way but but but also don't jump down my throat for

25:40.620 --> 25:43.820
bringing it to you because this fucker's a talker because he is doing it the

25:43.820 --> 25:47.940
perfect way and you need to just you need to just listen it's a talker you

25:47.940 --> 25:51.180
need to take this shit to your water cooler but when you do don't flip the

25:51.180 --> 25:57.860
fuck out you libtards don't start don't start going on crazy and we're in tin

25:57.860 --> 26:06.220
foil hats about it we're just gonna talk about it it's time to talker it's a talker I just I just I'm

26:06.220 --> 26:09.900
overwhelmed exhausted with like I there's so much conversation because it comes up

26:09.900 --> 26:15.460
to me more as a think piece this isn't a thinker it's not a thinker not a thinker

26:15.460 --> 26:19.940
this is definitely that's what it is a talker you don't got to think about it

26:19.940 --> 26:26.340
you just got to talk and talk and talk and talk I feel like I in this time of

26:26.340 --> 26:29.820
like more information per second being more overwhelming and stuff like I

26:29.820 --> 26:34.580
where I feel like there's an increasing amount of bandwidth being spent on us

26:34.580 --> 26:39.540
talking to each other about how we should be perceiving right which is even

26:39.540 --> 26:47.580
extra insane because the it's like it's like it's like well the objective

26:47.580 --> 26:51.340
information would be the cure to all this like we could eat it's right within

26:51.340 --> 26:55.660
our grasp it could be like oh let's just be objective because we're getting a

26:55.660 --> 26:59.300
little too subjective but we don't want to do that so we're just like doubling

26:59.300 --> 27:02.620
down on the subjectivity and we keep going like all right now don't start

27:02.620 --> 27:06.700
perceiving this the wrong way and don't normalize this right tell me what to

27:06.700 --> 27:12.580
normalize you're you're normal you're the TV telling me not to normalize this is

27:12.580 --> 27:17.020
crazy yeah it's I don't know if tone policing is the right word but it's

27:17.020 --> 27:20.860
definitely like the media being all like here's how you should think and it

27:20.860 --> 27:25.340
shouldn't be critically of me yeah and it's like well that's what everyone bad

27:25.340 --> 27:30.300
does yeah tone policing did we coin it well I don't I mean tone policing is

27:30.300 --> 27:34.060
its own thing it's probably like a Venn diagram so I don't know it might be

27:34.060 --> 27:37.540
wrong to label it but it sounds like you're here to talk about that let's

27:37.540 --> 27:41.100
bring out Don Lemon everybody Don Lemon

27:41.100 --> 27:48.620
I thought I thought you had talked to Brandon about doing an impression. Oh just now.

27:48.620 --> 27:56.260
Tim. What? Racist. Oh. Busted. Finally.

27:57.540 --> 28:02.800
Taking us 30 years we fucking finally did it. If I if I said let's bring out

28:02.800 --> 28:05.820
Anderson Cooper you would have said oh I thought Brandon you had worked up a bit.

28:05.820 --> 28:12.380
All right you got me. You got me. You got me. You caught me seeing. Let's bring out

28:12.380 --> 28:14.900
Brandon Johnson. Brandon Johnson.

28:17.900 --> 28:24.020
Yo. Yo. Yo. Where'd he go? Oh no. He left. He just fled back into the night like the

28:24.020 --> 28:30.220
Phantom. I think he needs a longer running start. Brandon are you gonna

28:30.220 --> 28:35.940
hunt this theater like like the Phantom of the Opera? Brandon I think he he really

28:35.940 --> 28:39.660
meant it he wants you to come up here. Brandon get up here. He had his chance. He was on

28:39.660 --> 28:42.900
stage and he ran right back up.

28:42.900 --> 28:56.060
Oh. Oh. Thank you to me.

29:03.500 --> 29:11.780
Brandon also did stage work. Right. Right. Right. This is what I'm talking about.

29:11.780 --> 29:21.540
What I'm talking about. Showmanship. It's been amazing so far. Make some noise.

29:21.540 --> 29:32.020
Chicken wire motherfucker. Oh yeah. God damn it. Those chairs suck right. Yeah. Those chairs make your

29:32.020 --> 29:48.020
ass fall asleep. It might not be. Do we knock it out? Check if there's a button or a switch on

29:48.020 --> 30:00.100
the mic. Yeah. He might have turned it off. Jeff is gonna see if he turned it off. I did

30:00.100 --> 30:10.260
it one. Oh my god. It's that. Are you with the theater? Okay. Okay. Good. No offense but you

30:10.260 --> 30:20.260
look like any one of our fans. This is Brian everybody. Brian the tech man. Brian. Check. Check. Check. Just

30:20.260 --> 30:25.740
you know for the future. There we go. Okay. If there's ever any malfunctioned you could just

30:25.740 --> 30:31.820
run up on stage and start fucking with us. Well he was helping. I mean if someone dove on the stage

30:31.820 --> 30:35.740
and started working with the wires I mean that's definitely a lot better scenario than we could

30:35.740 --> 30:42.620
ask for. Yeah. I'm encouraging it. Dan can we get a mic check on you now. Yeah. Check. Hey do you

30:42.620 --> 30:49.180
want me to turn that off for you. I don't know. We could do it. Can we hear a little who are you

30:49.180 --> 30:53.180
kidding in that way. Zach how about we get a beat since we got the vocoder going. Why don't we put

30:53.180 --> 31:09.900
a little beat on emcee gun control. Yeah. Yeah. Emcee. Emcee. You and me. Emcee gun control gun

31:09.900 --> 31:30.700
control. Of guns. And how much they control. Emcee gun control my bet is you can't tell which side I'm on.

31:39.900 --> 31:47.660
It's one of, it's one of our show's few return characters.

31:47.660 --> 31:51.460
MC Gun Control.

31:51.460 --> 31:55.540
The last two of three appearances have featured me

31:55.540 --> 31:57.380
explaining the joke.

32:01.300 --> 32:04.980
I'm MC Gun Control.

32:04.980 --> 32:09.860
But you don't really know if I like guns or not.

32:09.860 --> 32:11.020
Oh, shit.

32:11.020 --> 32:13.260
It's time to take a stand, Gun Control.

32:13.260 --> 32:14.360
Take a stand now.

32:14.360 --> 32:14.940

32:15.500 --> 32:16.900
Left or right, up or down.

32:16.900 --> 32:17.380
What?

32:17.380 --> 32:18.380
Guns or no guns.

32:18.380 --> 32:20.240
And I'll right or go away.

32:20.240 --> 32:20.740
Wow.

32:20.740 --> 32:21.240
Wow.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
Oh.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.500
Oh.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.000
Oh.

32:25.000 --> 32:25.500
Oh.

32:25.500 --> 32:26.000
Oh.

32:26.000 --> 32:26.500
Oh.

32:26.500 --> 32:27.500
Oh.

32:27.500 --> 32:28.000
Oh.

32:28.000 --> 32:28.500
Oh.

32:28.500 --> 32:29.000
Oh.

32:29.000 --> 32:29.500
Oh.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.000
Oh.

32:30.000 --> 32:30.500
Oh.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.000
Oh.

32:31.000 --> 32:31.500
Oh.

32:31.500 --> 32:32.000
Oh.

32:32.000 --> 32:32.500
Oh.

32:32.500 --> 32:33.000
Oh.

32:33.000 --> 32:33.500
Oh.

32:33.500 --> 32:34.000
Oh.

32:34.000 --> 32:34.500
Oh.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.000
Oh.

32:35.000 --> 32:35.500
Oh.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.000
Oh.

32:36.000 --> 32:36.500
Oh.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.000
Oh.

32:37.000 --> 32:37.500
Oh.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.000
Oh.

32:38.000 --> 32:38.500
Oh.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.000
Oh.

32:39.000 --> 32:39.500
Oh.

32:39.500 --> 32:47.500
You know what, no one that's in favor of guns ever uses the phrase gun control.

32:47.500 --> 32:51.500
MC gun control, Marlore or Yanny!

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
I'm sorry, what?

32:57.500 --> 33:01.500
Which one do you hear? Marlore or Yanny?

33:01.500 --> 33:08.500
Obviously, Yanny!

33:08.500 --> 33:11.500
Alright, come on.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.500
He's against gun control.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.500
MC gun control is against...

33:22.500 --> 33:24.500
It seems like he is.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.500
He dodges the issue so well.

33:26.500 --> 33:29.500
His name should be MC gun awareness.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.500
Not MC gun control.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.500
Gun awareness, it would have been...

33:33.500 --> 33:38.500
But in my defense, it was an organically constructed bit.

33:38.500 --> 33:42.500
I mean, I don't sit at home in bed coming up with bits.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.500
If I do, these tickets are 50 bucks.

33:47.500 --> 33:51.500
Like, you're buying them, you don't even care if you're showing up.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.500
They're worth something signed.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.500
Where is your bed? I thought there would be a bed here.

33:58.500 --> 34:03.500
No, man, that was all part of the Howard Hughes darkness.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.500
We made up with the audience now.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.500
We're back, we're happy, we're doing segments.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.500
You're cleaned up.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.500
Shingle free!

34:12.500 --> 34:14.500
Shingle free?

34:14.500 --> 34:17.500
100% Shingle free.

34:17.500 --> 34:21.500
You got your attitude all fixed?

34:21.500 --> 34:24.500
Am I upstaging you guys?

34:24.500 --> 34:28.500
I've been wearing a low hat and I've got a box in front of me.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.500
Isn't this the definition of upstaging?

34:30.500 --> 34:33.500
You stand upstage and you make your fellow performers turn their backs.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.500
I would say come down a little bit, so then...

34:36.500 --> 34:38.500
Calm down.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.500
Calm down a little bit.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.500
I probably have one more segment I could do.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.500
Hell yeah.

34:46.500 --> 34:55.500
You weren't kidding when you said segments.

34:55.500 --> 34:59.500
Mind blowers from my therapist?

34:59.500 --> 35:09.500
When you go to therapy

35:09.500 --> 35:13.500
You're Billy Idol and you're with me

35:13.500 --> 35:16.500
Mind blowers from my therapist?

35:16.500 --> 35:21.500
I'm streaming with my fist up.

35:21.500 --> 35:24.500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.500
I mean...

35:26.500 --> 35:33.500
If you're going to steal Nick Cave songs, just tell him a crowd.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
I'm Billy Idol, what do you mean?

35:35.500 --> 35:36.500
Nick...

35:36.500 --> 35:41.500
For the listeners at home, the look on Jeff Davis' face just now.

35:41.500 --> 35:46.700
That was, okay, I'll call that, if you draw a triangle of Billy Eidel, Nick Cave, and

35:46.700 --> 35:49.020
David Byrne, you're right in the middle of that triangle.

35:49.020 --> 35:50.020
Yeah.

35:50.020 --> 35:52.420
There was a bit of David Byrne in there too.

35:52.420 --> 35:56.180
Well, I know how to make it more David Byrne, but I don't know how to make more Nick Cave,

35:56.180 --> 35:57.180
but I don't even know.

35:57.180 --> 36:00.180
Well, let's try it.

36:00.180 --> 36:02.500
You want to give the full Byrne?

36:02.500 --> 36:22.500
Now, now, now go full slider over to Billy Eidel now.

36:22.500 --> 36:32.340
Now, give me a little PJ Harvey, PJ Harvey.

36:32.340 --> 36:47.180
How about Paul Harvey, Paul Harvey, Paul, Paul Rubens, Paul Rubens, Steve Harvey, Steve

36:47.180 --> 36:48.180
Harvey.

36:48.180 --> 36:52.660
Oh, you should do that.

36:52.660 --> 36:58.340
Is that what you want?

36:58.340 --> 36:59.340
Racism?

36:59.340 --> 37:09.220
You want to catch the racists, who are you kidding, who the fuck are you kidding?

37:09.220 --> 37:12.260
Everybody wants to catch the racists.

37:12.260 --> 37:14.300
What are you going to do when you catch them?

37:14.300 --> 37:21.300
Brandon, I want Brandon at some point to take this tiny, tiny lectern and do tiny preacher.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.300
No.

37:22.300 --> 37:30.780
Brandon at Leach of Avon does a preacher character, what's it called?

37:30.780 --> 37:31.780
Father Brown.

37:31.780 --> 37:32.780
Father Brown.

37:32.780 --> 37:33.780
It's pretty goddamn funny.

37:33.780 --> 37:35.580
Good old Leach of Avon.

37:35.580 --> 37:36.580
This is my podium.

37:36.580 --> 37:37.580
I brought it over.

37:37.580 --> 37:38.580
I wouldn't take that podium from you.

37:38.580 --> 37:39.580
I wouldn't leave it to you.

37:39.580 --> 37:54.900
Because as you see, I've got a table, brother.

37:54.900 --> 38:12.060
What do you think?

38:12.060 --> 38:22.320
I don't know lots of them, isn't that his thing?

38:22.320 --> 38:23.500
Okay, name.

38:23.500 --> 38:36.260
like his Shazbot. I don't know. I don't know. I thought his thing was that, wow! Doesn't

38:36.260 --> 38:44.940
he growl and shit? There's 17 of them in one of his songs. Black Nerd.

38:44.940 --> 38:54.540
Brandon's working on his spinoff podcasts. So come back to the Doomsday Temple Challenge.

38:54.540 --> 39:01.100
What's this place called? The fucking dynasty? Why is it called? Doomsday Temple Challenge.

39:01.100 --> 39:06.900
Doomsday Temple Challenge. At the Rita... I don't even know what's going on.

39:06.900 --> 39:11.820
Brandon's launching his new spinoff podcast called Black Nerd.

39:11.820 --> 39:18.660
Yeah, first episode is all about Black Adam and fans. I got to hear that one.

39:18.660 --> 39:26.460
Black Dat Fan fans. Black what fans? Dat Fan. Dat Fan. He's a comedian.

39:26.460 --> 39:43.820
He ain't no joke. Dear energy. I'm gonna be honest. I came to watch tonight. I got so big. I'm sitting back there.

39:43.820 --> 39:49.620
I'm sitting back there. I got a piece of pizza. We saw you come from backstage. I'm sweating balls right now because I'm so high.

39:49.620 --> 39:56.940
I feel as though I've taken the energy in another direction. But I'm fucking good with it.

39:56.940 --> 40:05.740
Did you see? Did you see? You guys started making black jokes. I had to run on stage. I don't know what the fuck is going on.

40:05.740 --> 40:22.540
Jeff is viciously anti-pot. Shit. Listen. Hey, everybody. Everybody. Hide. He'll come back and go.

40:22.540 --> 40:38.660
And then we'll all come out and kick him. Oh shit. Jeff has a pizza.

40:38.660 --> 40:56.780
Jeff brought Brandon a pizza. Thank you. I'm gonna eat all your pizza now. That's good. I'd like some cereal.

40:56.780 --> 41:08.780
All right. Well, so look, I mean, I'm the straight man of my own show. So do you want me to do the therapist? Yes. My birthday.

41:08.780 --> 41:37.540
Oh Hoh, Ha, Ha, Ha Ha, Oh, Ha Hoh,Ha, Ha, Hoh, Ha, Ha, Ha, Hoh, Ugh, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Hoh, Ha, Hah, Hah, Hoh, duhh Ha, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hah, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hoh, Ha, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot.

41:37.540 --> 41:43.060
really frustrating to feel out of control and like everyone's kind of disrespecting the two very

41:43.060 --> 41:49.780
small things you're trying to do over the course of two hours. But I just want you to know that

41:50.420 --> 41:55.060
the longer it takes to do these two little bits, actually the less we have to do.

41:55.060 --> 42:03.140
I know, I know. So it is, it is, it's awesome. So I mean, and don't get me wrong, it's very comedic

42:03.140 --> 42:09.060
for you to be begrudging about this and don't lose that. But what I'm saying is this is great.

42:09.060 --> 42:18.340
This is all great. Yeah. Spencer, next week, please wear a black shirt and just, and do this.

42:22.340 --> 42:28.980
Like the beginning of Zarda is just kind of, oh yeah. We have to get it, we can chip in a little

42:28.980 --> 42:33.860
bit of our Harmontown Money and get a crystal ball on that fucking table. I know. I slowly want

42:33.860 --> 42:38.500
him to become inside the crystal ball. What if we, what if we got a green screen? They just were

42:38.500 --> 42:43.620
an all green suit. And so like I'm just literally a floating head. Yeah, you wouldn't even have to show

42:43.620 --> 42:53.540
up. Yeah. What if at the end of a 12 episode run here, Spencer was like, I think this is my last

42:53.540 --> 42:59.940
episode. I've done everything I want to do. And then he got up and under the table were 12 dead babies.

43:01.620 --> 43:05.300
And then, and then he had, he had, he had broken their necks

43:08.180 --> 43:15.380
for 90 minutes each. And each, each, each one was a,

43:15.380 --> 43:22.660
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, each one had a different Zodiac sign.

43:26.820 --> 43:34.660
So you went to therapy and you're all better now. No, no. Well, are these mind blowers? Did you,

43:34.660 --> 43:39.780
did you blow your therapist's mind or did you get your mind blown by the therapist? Mind blown.

43:39.780 --> 43:48.100
Oh, okay. Okay. We want to hear these. Yeah. So here's the how many do we have? How many,

43:48.100 --> 43:53.380
how many we can count this down? How many? Just one. This is the latest. We can still count it down.

43:55.380 --> 44:03.860
And now the top one mindblower from Dan's therapist starting at number one.

44:03.860 --> 44:11.780
The concept of want versus willing. So

44:14.260 --> 44:22.260
so her example was, well, I want world peace. I'm willing to be nice to dickheads today.

44:22.900 --> 44:27.540
You know, like, you can have an internal dialogue, like, what are you willing to do?

44:27.540 --> 44:35.060
Like, kind of, it's kind of blown my mind. Like, I've applied it to writing and I was,

44:35.060 --> 44:40.580
example, I was, I was packing my stuff for a Palm Springs trip and I got out of the shower.

44:40.580 --> 44:43.300
I looked at my toenails. I was like, well, those could use a trim.

44:44.580 --> 44:49.460
But what were you willing to do? And then I was like, I was like, well, I'll probably put that

44:49.460 --> 44:52.900
off. I'm going to pack later. I'll pack last minute. And then I'm going to be like rushing to

44:52.900 --> 44:57.700
clip my toenails. And then I just a voice in my headset. Are you willing to clip your toenails

44:57.700 --> 45:04.100
right now? The answer was yes, of course, because it kind of forces a dialogue or you like,

45:04.100 --> 45:07.860
you kind of like high road yourself. You're like, are you willing to clip your toenails?

45:07.860 --> 45:13.060
What kind of villain says no? No, I'm not willing to clip my toenails.

45:15.060 --> 45:20.500
Okay, well, then we're, we're at an impasse, as the French would say. I or as the British

45:20.500 --> 45:25.780
would call it an impasse. Or as the Mexicans would call it as regular standoff.

45:33.780 --> 45:36.580
I'm only upset with that joke that I didn't think of it.

45:40.900 --> 45:45.540
I have a question. What, what is this internal voice? Is it your voice?

45:45.540 --> 45:50.420
Or is it George Carlin? George Carlin. That's great. How'd you get that? I've been trying.

45:50.420 --> 45:55.860
It's amazing. Oh, you don't have to pay for it. It's, it's a common creative license.

45:55.860 --> 46:00.260
What do you call it? Creative Commons license. What, what, what, what if your internal voice

46:00.260 --> 46:03.300
sounded a little bit like Billy Idle? What would that sound like?

46:03.300 --> 46:16.260
Oh, well, are you willing to clip your toenails? With a scream and a shout and you clipped your

46:16.260 --> 46:20.020
toenails with the blood of the altar.

46:20.020 --> 46:31.860
I always, I always forget he's Hawaiian.

46:34.740 --> 46:40.820
I think that's cool. I mean, I, I know you like, I always feel like my internal monologue is like,

46:40.820 --> 46:44.420
oh, I want to do this and this and this. And then I come up with a bunch of excuses,

46:44.420 --> 46:48.980
but it's like, you can say you want all sorts of things that you're never going to put forth

46:48.980 --> 46:53.380
any effort for, but then you convince yourself that you are kind of, but there's good reasons.

46:53.380 --> 46:57.060
But being able to differentiate that is like, it's an important distinction.

46:57.060 --> 47:02.660
Yeah. Cause it, it slows down time. Like, it's funny how procrastination moves at the speed of

47:02.660 --> 47:09.620
light. Like you in one fell swoop will get an entire day's work worth non-working done

47:09.620 --> 47:15.060
at the very top of the day by simply going, what do I want to write a perfect script?

47:15.060 --> 47:17.380
Right. Well, that's not going to fucking happen today.

47:17.380 --> 47:21.940
So nothing's going to happen today. So instead, it's like, what are you willing to do?

47:21.940 --> 47:29.220
Write 10 pages or write, like my thing is I'm willing to write for four hours if it's easy.

47:29.780 --> 47:35.300
Like I'm willing to not stop typing. Yeah. My therapist is like, slow down, Charlie. I'm like,

47:35.300 --> 47:40.660
whoa, like racist. And like she, she was a nom and she's always,

47:43.140 --> 47:47.140
no, she's, she's like, I'm like, no, you don't get it. Like if I just fucking thought I could

47:47.140 --> 47:50.740
just type, type, type, type, type, you know, just spitting it, then, but it's like, you're,

47:50.740 --> 47:54.420
you're trying to adapt Vonnegut and it's like, oh, it's got to be good or something. And it's

47:54.420 --> 47:58.900
like, then nothing's going to get done. But what am I willing to do? I'm willing to do a bad job

47:58.900 --> 48:03.140
adapting Vonnegut for four hours. And then I'm like, by the way, no, no, this is applying to the

48:03.140 --> 48:07.620
Vonnegut thing. I'm totally tanking it eating, shitting the bed and about to get fired. Oh,

48:07.620 --> 48:15.700
yeah, that's right. Yeah. When does it do by like a week ago? Or

48:15.700 --> 48:22.580
yeah, what's it do? It was due like in 1997. That's what are you going to do with that answer,

48:22.580 --> 48:31.620
Jeff? What are you going to? What is that going to do for you? How do you spell TMZ? Are you texting

48:31.620 --> 48:36.340
Dan's agent? No, I know, church, church just texted me and she goes, they just found Melania

48:36.340 --> 48:45.220
two hours ago. Oh my God. Oh my God. Can we release the confetti? I understand what you're

48:45.220 --> 49:10.580
talking about, Dan, because I, for a while, finally, this is all I wanted. This is all I wanted

49:10.580 --> 49:22.180
for us to be on the same page. Can we get somebody from like the stage tech department

49:22.180 --> 49:26.820
to spike with the tape where all of these tables are so this never changes. I want

49:26.820 --> 49:32.340
mini podium and a little pizza table. I really do like this. It's fun. I like this stage arrangement.

49:32.340 --> 49:43.780
Hey, do you think, do you think Spider-Man gets bummed out when people call him Webhead?

49:46.820 --> 49:52.580
I mean, like, it's been around for a while. You know, Doc Ock goes, Webhead, do you think he's

49:52.580 --> 49:58.820
like, it's not funny. Stop it. That make any sense. Does he get pissed off? I mean, like,

49:58.820 --> 50:03.060
because they're not letting it go. I mean, we can't tell because he's got the mask on,

50:03.060 --> 50:09.620
but I bet he's a little like, I don't understand because he's webbed all over my body. He's

50:09.620 --> 50:14.660
canonically hilarious. That's like one of his big traits of Spider-Man. He's like this fucking

50:14.660 --> 50:20.980
hilarious, wisecracking guy. Right. So like, he would be all like, Yeah, no, that's hack. But would

50:20.980 --> 50:25.380
he be all like, Oh, yeah, that's like, it's like someone using a shitty insult. It has no power.

50:25.380 --> 50:31.220
Or would it be like, come on, why is everyone running with this? No, like, this version of

50:31.220 --> 50:36.820
Spider-Man is, this version of Spider-Man is kind of like, for better or for worse, he's just Iron

50:36.820 --> 50:41.940
Man Junior, right? Like, I watched the homecoming and it's like, Oh, he's just, he's just, he's just,

50:41.940 --> 50:47.940
he's got his little Spider Iron Man suit. Oh, okay. He's a Spider Iron Man now. That's cool.

50:48.580 --> 50:53.460
You haven't seen it? No, the Iron Spider. Excuse me.

50:53.460 --> 50:59.300
Well, what have you seen in haven't seen? I saw Spider-Man.

50:59.300 --> 51:03.300
Rob, Rob, have you seen the quiet place? Rob, did you watch it?

51:03.300 --> 51:04.100
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

51:04.100 --> 51:06.100
Did you like those sound boogins?

51:06.100 --> 51:07.380
I like sound boogins.

51:07.380 --> 51:08.180
Sound boogins.

51:08.180 --> 51:08.580
Fucking come on.

51:08.580 --> 51:09.620
Sound boogins.

51:09.620 --> 51:11.540
You got to like them sound boogins. Have you seen that?

51:11.540 --> 51:12.500
No, I haven't seen it.

51:17.220 --> 51:19.700
Brandon, you got anything good in theaters right now?

51:19.700 --> 51:23.780
Yeah. God damn, you're so fucking high. Look at this guy.

51:25.380 --> 51:26.340
Who are you talking to?

51:26.340 --> 51:28.980
I've never seen, are you talking to me?

51:28.980 --> 51:32.820
The thing is, if you never, if you never told, if you never told anybody, you wear a suit like

51:32.820 --> 51:36.260
that and people think, Oh, the only reason you might be high is you forgot to put a tie on tonight.

51:37.380 --> 51:42.100
You wear a suit like that and people think he shouldn't be sitting on a cooler with a

51:42.100 --> 51:43.780
pizza box as a table.

51:43.780 --> 51:51.140
I will tell you that I got into a fight with a guy who was drunk driving who ran me off the road

51:51.140 --> 51:55.780
and I got out of the car and I was like, I'll fuck you up. And he was too drunk.

51:55.780 --> 51:58.260
He got out of his truck and he was super drunk.

51:58.260 --> 52:00.580
And I was like, that's not a fair fight. You can't really.

52:02.020 --> 52:04.740
The hand is all back tonight. Thanks.

52:05.540 --> 52:07.060
And he was like, I'll fuck you up.

52:07.060 --> 52:07.700
And he was too drunk.

52:07.700 --> 52:09.220
And I was like, that's not a fair fight.

52:09.220 --> 52:11.140
I'm not going to punch this guy in the face.

52:11.140 --> 52:14.260
And then I said to him, get the fuck out of here because the cops are going to come and you're

52:14.260 --> 52:19.300
drunk. And I have on a suit. And I was stoned out of my ass.

52:20.660 --> 52:25.940
And it was so loud that when the cops rolled up, because it was so loud, so high right now,

52:25.940 --> 52:30.020
it was so loud that the cops came and I fucking walked over to the cops.

52:30.020 --> 52:35.540
High as a kite was like, officer, this man is inebriated.

52:37.940 --> 52:38.980
When did this happen?

52:38.980 --> 52:41.140
What do you say? This was on the way here.

52:43.940 --> 52:46.900
What? That's crazy.

52:47.780 --> 52:52.260
Why are you getting into encounters where you're saying I'll fuck you up to people?

52:52.260 --> 52:53.540
I'm always a little curious.

52:53.540 --> 52:57.060
Brandon, Brandon, you want to get out of the car.

52:57.060 --> 52:57.940
You want to get out of the car.

52:57.940 --> 52:59.380
You want to see what's going on for a second.

52:59.380 --> 53:01.060
Let's see. Let's see how far it's going to go.

53:03.060 --> 53:04.180
That's crazy.

53:04.180 --> 53:06.100
All right, really, that took it out of me.

53:06.100 --> 53:09.940
And that's crazy. We're the same age. You can't fuck anybody up.

53:10.820 --> 53:13.460
No. No, you're right.

53:14.820 --> 53:16.740
Brandon can fuck anybody in this audience up.

53:18.580 --> 53:21.780
I would never fuck anyone up in Harmontown.

53:21.780 --> 53:24.660
Yay. Yay, applause.

53:27.140 --> 53:28.100
There were no applause.

53:28.100 --> 53:29.300
Power changed my mind.

53:29.860 --> 53:33.860
After that lackluster applause, I'll be out front.

53:33.860 --> 53:36.820
What? That's so crazy that happened today.

53:36.820 --> 53:38.020
Give me my pizza.

53:40.660 --> 53:41.860
Oh, ain't that a bitch?

53:44.900 --> 53:47.940
Isn't that just, you know, a perfect metaphor?

53:48.820 --> 53:50.740
We for sure talked about this.

53:50.740 --> 53:56.420
The album cover for the Fat Boys album where it's them and they're opening a pizza box

53:56.420 --> 54:02.580
and inside the pizza box is the three fat boys dressed as old-timey convicts

54:02.580 --> 54:07.460
stealing the fat, giant Fat Boys pizza and they have like...

54:07.460 --> 54:08.980
Is it all you can eat?

54:08.980 --> 54:13.460
Yeah, and they have like ball and chains on them and they're like,

54:13.460 --> 54:15.700
whoa, but they're just like eating.

54:15.700 --> 54:20.500
They're like, it's like, oh, they're eating, oh, we're eating our own pizza.

54:20.500 --> 54:22.340
We're eating us as pizza.

54:22.340 --> 54:25.940
Are any of the Fat Boys still with us? Are they all dead?

54:27.940 --> 54:28.740
I don't know.

54:28.740 --> 54:29.460
I don't think so.

54:29.460 --> 54:36.820
I don't think so. Remember when the Fat Boys did the theme song to Nightmare on Elm Street 4?

54:37.380 --> 54:38.020
Yeah.

54:38.020 --> 54:40.260
That's when it was really getting scary.

54:41.860 --> 54:46.180
The music video where they're like, they're all walking up to the Elm Street.

54:46.180 --> 54:49.940
I was going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

54:49.940 --> 54:52.820
And then Freddy Krueger comes out, starts rapping.

54:52.820 --> 54:55.940
You may be fat, but I've got knives.

54:55.940 --> 54:58.260
You better start rapping for your lives,

54:58.260 --> 54:59.300
bitch.

55:01.380 --> 55:07.540
And this was around the time when horror movies were really getting,

55:07.540 --> 55:09.860
like people were like, oh, we got to protect the children.

55:09.860 --> 55:14.420
Probably they're going to really start being mentally freaked out by that.

55:14.420 --> 55:15.300
And then you're watching it.

55:15.300 --> 55:17.540
It's like, this is ridiculous.

55:17.540 --> 55:24.660
It's that melted child molester with fingernails walking around with these Fat Boys

55:24.660 --> 55:28.420
rapping about murdering children.

55:29.300 --> 55:30.340
Calm down.

55:30.340 --> 55:31.940
Yeah. What's your problem with that?

55:32.500 --> 55:39.860
Amazingly, that franchise survived the Fat Boys enough to see the Will Smith, the DJ,

55:39.860 --> 55:44.580
DJ, Jazzy, Jennifer, the Fresh Prince did a Nightmare on Elm Street.

55:44.580 --> 55:48.020
Yeah. Like, let me tell you about the time I was on Elm Street.

55:48.980 --> 55:51.300
I was like, holy shit, this thing's bulletproof.

55:51.300 --> 55:53.540
You can't fucking sell this thing out.

55:53.540 --> 56:04.500
Well, quote, Freddie Kruger has more authenticity to fucking unload than the executive branch.

56:08.420 --> 56:09.380
Give it a look.

56:09.380 --> 56:10.660
Go home tonight.

56:10.660 --> 56:15.060
Check out the Fat Boys Nightmare on Elm Street 4.

56:15.620 --> 56:19.780
This isn't when they, this, this was considered one of the best ones too.

56:19.780 --> 56:21.300
Out of the dream warriors.

56:21.300 --> 56:23.620
No, Dream Warriors is my favorite.

56:23.620 --> 56:24.420
That's Dawkin.

56:24.420 --> 56:25.620
That's Dawkin who does that.

56:25.620 --> 56:26.020
Dawkin.

56:26.900 --> 56:28.100
Dawkin fucking rule.

56:29.380 --> 56:30.100
Kind of scary.

56:32.020 --> 56:36.020
We went to see Dawkin and they did that song and we fucking shit our brains out on the floor.

56:36.020 --> 56:37.220
I think they did the whole soundtrack.

56:38.100 --> 56:41.140
They did everything and we shit our brains out.

56:41.780 --> 56:43.140
We saw Dawkin live.

56:43.940 --> 56:45.220
What, how long ago was this?

56:45.220 --> 56:46.420
Like about 10 years ago?

56:46.420 --> 56:47.300
It was at the House of Blues.

56:47.300 --> 56:48.580
Easily, easily 12 years ago.

56:48.580 --> 56:49.220
Yeah.

56:49.220 --> 56:50.340
House of Blues.

56:50.340 --> 56:51.220
We shit every day.

56:51.220 --> 56:52.580
They brought in Lynch, what's his name?

56:52.580 --> 56:53.220
Is it George Lynch?

56:53.220 --> 56:55.300
Is it the bass player or no guitar player?

56:55.300 --> 56:58.420
And he came in, they used to hate each other and he got out there and did a guitar solo.

56:58.420 --> 57:00.500
That was a fucking just a ball burner.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.140
It was so good.

57:01.140 --> 57:02.260
This is such a ball burner.

57:02.260 --> 57:03.220
All right, all right.

57:04.580 --> 57:07.220
Come on, keep this fucking sweet train.

57:07.220 --> 57:11.700
What about Bobby Brown's Ghostbusters 2 rap?

57:11.700 --> 57:12.660
That one doesn't hold up.

57:13.940 --> 57:16.420
No, thank God for someone saying it.

57:18.020 --> 57:19.460
It's 2018.

57:19.460 --> 57:21.700
It's time to take control.

57:21.700 --> 57:22.500
Let's get out of this.

57:22.500 --> 57:26.260
So I totally sinking into this tape.

57:26.260 --> 57:28.900
Yeah, no, and it's, it will continue.

57:28.900 --> 57:32.020
I expect to, you know, it'll be above my neck level soon.

57:33.700 --> 57:39.060
Okay, name a movie that would never have a crazy rap in its soundtrack.

57:39.060 --> 57:40.100
Wild West.

57:40.100 --> 57:40.660
Silkwood.

57:41.940 --> 57:43.140
Schindler's List, yo.

57:44.660 --> 57:46.180
Jumanji, Sophie's Choice.

57:46.180 --> 57:53.940
I heard Silkwood.

57:55.940 --> 57:59.380
Meryl Streep is a story about nuclear contamination.

58:01.940 --> 58:02.660
Not Meryl Streep?

58:03.940 --> 58:04.820
There's no Meryl Streep?

58:04.820 --> 58:06.660
Yeah, I don't think she should be anywhere.

58:06.660 --> 58:07.940
Meryl Streep is such a good actress.

58:07.940 --> 58:09.140
She plays Cher in that movie.

58:10.980 --> 58:14.980
I said name a movie and I got like, I got like, I heard like three movies everyone

58:14.980 --> 58:16.740
knows that are all about the Holocaust.

58:16.740 --> 58:19.860
And then one that's no one knows.

58:19.860 --> 58:22.340
Let's give you, let's give you a bit more of a lob.

58:24.660 --> 58:24.900
What?

58:25.780 --> 58:26.900
Haven't, haven't seen it.

58:26.900 --> 58:32.820
But okay, I'll, I'll, I'll do the, I'll do the Will Smith rap about Quiet Place.

58:32.820 --> 58:33.860
Zach, you got a beat for that?

58:35.060 --> 58:36.500
Zac McKeever up at the beat house.

58:39.620 --> 58:44.900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, he doesn't do that.

58:44.900 --> 58:54.900
Let me tell you about the time I was going outside and I was trying to be, keep my mouth

58:54.900 --> 58:55.620
real wide.

58:55.620 --> 58:59.300
But DJ Jazzy Jeff said, hey, fresh prints.

58:59.300 --> 59:01.380
You better put that down, Clef.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.100
Because we got to be quiet.

59:04.100 --> 59:06.420
Because there's Quiet Place.

59:06.420 --> 59:07.460
This isn't going to work.

59:07.460 --> 59:09.140
That's like, you can't improvise.

59:09.700 --> 59:11.700
That's crazy to think you can improvise that.

59:11.700 --> 59:13.540
You, you, you set up the beat though.

59:14.100 --> 59:14.580
I what?

59:14.580 --> 59:18.660
I know I did, but my, my, my eyes were bigger than my talents.

59:18.660 --> 59:23.060
I didn't, you know, that's, because you did a refrain.

59:23.060 --> 59:26.340
Even like, that's how I knew I wasn't in a quiet place.

59:30.820 --> 59:35.380
Well, we took off our shoes and we walked on some sand and we had to make sidewalks

59:35.380 --> 59:36.740
made of it across the land.

59:36.740 --> 59:39.220
But DJ Jeff said, hey, fresh prints.

59:39.220 --> 59:41.860
We got to, did not go over there and eat those mints.

59:41.860 --> 59:44.980
But I said, okay, I think I'm allowed to do that.

59:44.980 --> 59:48.180
But I did it and I was real loud, smack.

59:48.180 --> 59:53.220
And then the big Boogins came out and that's how I wanted to have a quiet place.

59:59.060 --> 59:59.460
Yeah.

59:59.460 --> 01:00:05.380
Thank you for your incredibly condescending polite applause.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.980
It just goes to show you Boogins just don't understand.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:19.140
There's a million kinds of applause and that, that's the applause that was like, just finish.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.220
Thank you for wrapping it up.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:23.700
Yeah.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.740
Anybody see this?

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.540
Fuck you.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.580
Anybody see this upgrade movie?

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.300
This upgrade?

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.900
I hear it's pretty good.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.740
It seems like a shadow run movie.

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.420
Seems like a shadow run.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.940
Seems like a shadow run.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.220
I remember shadow run.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.940
Shadow run, you hear about this shadow run in the news lately?

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.740
What is that?

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.620
No, it's like a weird cyberpunk role-playing game.

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.100
No, but it does though, because it's like,

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:56.100
we love, that's the secret word today, role-playing game.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.020
No, but like he gets wired reflexes.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.420
I don't know.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.700
It's in the, I don't know.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.620
It just seemed very shadow running and guys like arm turns into a gun,

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.260
like a bunch of like tropes from shadow runner hitting the trailer.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.340
I was like, you want, you want to go see it with me?

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:10.660
Okay.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.940
Do they have some of that cyberware?

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:14.900
Yeah.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.540
Yeah, man.

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.020
Wetware.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.700
That's all I got.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.260
Sorry.

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.860
What were you guys going to talk about upgrade?

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.380
I didn't mean to hijack it.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.020
No, I haven't seen it, but I heard it's really,

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.380
people are really enjoying it.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.220
They're really having a good time.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:27.940
Okay, I'll go.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:33.060
Awesome.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:33.860
That sounds great.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.620
You should take him.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.500
All right.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.140
He's having a hard time, you should take him.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.740
Yeah, he's had a hard life.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.140
Maybe not.

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.180
Maybe you shouldn't take him.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:44.660
Okay.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:48.660
Is it, is it, that's the basis you, you, you invite people to a movie on is whether

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:49.460
or not they've had a hard life.

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.100
It's 9-Eleven.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:56.500
The date when the people.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.180
Okay, let me tell you about the time.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:03.220
We went to New York and we had to arrive when my parents were gone and we see the sites,

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.820
but then two planes came out of there.

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.780
We had a good run here.

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.500
Have you checked out the backstage?

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.620
The backstage is groovy.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.700
Yeah, there's an upstairs like little fuck cubby hole.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.540
There's like a little like staircase you go up and there's a mattress with like yellow.

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:45.780
Ronald Coleman used to fuck Anton Lavey upstairs back in the 1930s.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.820
Hey, I, I, I Wikipediaed this shit before I came here.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.580
Here at the, at the Telegraph Sucker, what the fuck?

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.580
Dynasty typewriter.

01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.780
Why is it called a typewriter?

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:01.940
You don't call a place a typewriter.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.940
And I look at the, I like it.

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:06.820
I like it.

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.260
Everyone here likes it.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.340
I like the name.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:13.540
And if Jeff, if you need Jeff to like it, Jeff will like it.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.540
I don't even get what that joke meant.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.460
Spencer's all over your shit tonight.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:25.620
Yeah, cause you got it.

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:26.020
He got it.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.220
You got on his shit last time.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.100
I know I love it.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:28.980
See, I'm learning.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:29.860
Like that's what I'm going to do.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:31.780
I'm going to rip people's heads off once in a while.

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:32.260
Right.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:32.980
It's good behavior.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:33.940
It's been rewarded.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.820
Great last thing.

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.340
You know, speaking of ripping people's heads off,

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.620
I thought of a segment we could play.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.700
It's called D&D, motherfucker.

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.020
Oh, damn.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.580
Schrab, you're staying, Brandon, you're staying.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.700
You can just chill if you want.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.660
You don't have to stay, but we would love to have you up here.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:58.340
It's been a long, bloody time since we've played our D&D campaign.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:03.140
So we're going to need a good beefy recap on this one.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.100
Sure, yeah.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:04.420
Yeah.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:08.660
Spencer, can you give me a nice beefy recap?

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:10.820
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.300
You know how I like my recaps.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.180
Nice and beefy.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.540
I want to get my beefy recap.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:25.540
I want to take my beefy recap.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.540
There's a town that you will go to.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:31.540
Beefy recap.

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.540
Go to Toofrow.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:37.540
I want to get my beefy recap.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:41.540
I want to get my beefy recap.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.540
Nope, stop.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.540
I won't.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.540
It's not that kind of show.

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.540
That's the shit he drags in from who's line.

01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.540
It's not going to be any clapping.

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:03.540
Yeah, and we finally under E called entertainment.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.540
All right, fair enough.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.540
You do you.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.540
Go ahead, entertain people.

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:21.540
See where it gets you.

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.540
What was that?

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.540
Was that referencing a certain other song, beefy recap?

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.540
Yeah, I guess it was a little electric avenue, obviously.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.540
Right, Brandon?

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.540
Yes.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:33.540
Yes, it was.

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.540
Or no, Funky Town.

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.540
What was I thinking of?

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:43.540
Under this administration, I can only say yes.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.540
I don't want to do it again.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.540
What are you holding?

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.540
Oh, it's a microphone.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.540
He scared me for a second.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:59.540
Out in the street.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:03.540
Out in the street.

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:07.540
Out in the street.

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.540
Oh, no.

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:13.540
Oh, no.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.540
We're going to rock down to electric avenue.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.540
Then we'll take it higher.

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.540
Look at this motherfucker clap.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.540
Just out of...

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:25.540
out of...

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.540
because he saw Jeff sing.

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.540
Clap!

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.540
It's fucking good.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.540
Stop the street.

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:43.540
On the dark side of town.

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.540
There is lots of work to be done.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.540
Out in the street.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.540
There is violence.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.540
Something, something, something.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:57.540
I'm trying to figure out how to ruin their clapping.

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.540
I want to make them party to something awful.

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.540
Like...

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:07.540
Clap, if you eat babies.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.540
That's what I say.

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.540
Yeah, they love it.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.540
Because I picked a safe form of causticity.

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.540
What if I went there?

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.540
You would have been fucked up.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.540
What have you been up to?

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:23.540
What have I been up to?

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.540
What have you been up to lately?

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:27.540
I haven't...

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:29.540
I've been trying to keep the friendship alive.

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.540
I've been cancelling every appointment I've ever had.

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.540
I've been trying to finish this thing.

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.540
I can't finish it.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.540
I'm supposed to finish it.

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.540
You should finish it.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.540
You know what?

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.540
Great idea.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.540
Do you want 5%?

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.540
No, I just want you to be happy.

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.540
See?

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:57.540
See?

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.540
That's how I go to Boston.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.540
Let's get Steve Levy up here, everybody.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.540
Steve Levy!

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.540
Hey, before we do D&D,

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.540
Spencer, do we want to talk about

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.540
the altercation that we saw today?

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.540
Sure, yeah.

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.540
So...

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.540
I was leaving Little Doms today.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.540
You were leaving Little Doms,

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.540
and there was three dudes,

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.540
and they were following...

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.540
There were three white dudes,

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.540
and they were following a black guy

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.540
without a shirt who had long dreadlocks

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.540
who was walking his bicycle,

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.540
and they were following him and having a moving argument.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.540
Oh, Tommy!

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.540
Yeah.

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.540
And so,

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.540
I didn't know what the situation was,

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:51.540
but it's always...

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:53.540
I had listened to a podcast where someone

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.540
watched as five people just beat the shit

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.540
unmercelessly out of this guy,

01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.540
and it was just horrible,

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.540
and so I was like, I don't want to see

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.540
three guys kick the shit out of some guy.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.540
So I walked over there while...

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:07.540
And they were yelling and escalating,

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.540
and I didn't get there until

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.540
they actually started punching and stuff,

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.540
but everyone was gathering and watching.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.540
They were knocking coffee at each other.

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.540
Yeah, they were knocking each other's drinks.

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.540
I think the initial altercation

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.540
happened at the coffee bean,

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.540
and then someone knocked a drink out of someone's hand,

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.540
and then it moved outside,

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.540
and the cops were called.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.540
I don't know. Anyway, I get there,

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.540
and then they're engaged,

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.540
and so I just get as close as I can.

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.540
Oh, well, that's a nuptial spat.

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.540
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.540
What do you mean?

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.540
Wait, so this fight...

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.540
Well, that's the thing.

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:45.540
It didn't start as a fight,

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.540
but the three guys were clearly

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.540
harassing and threatening the guy

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.540
to make him feel uncomfortable,

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.540
and he was like, I took you guys...

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.540
I took both of your asses on earlier,

01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:57.540
and I won, and then so then the guy

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.540
was like, you know, come at me,

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.540
and then they were trying to

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.540
kind of two-at-one go out,

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:05.540
not like tag team, but kind of like

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.540
be ready to catch him off guard and stuff,

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.540
and so that was about when I got there.

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.540
I was dodging and stuff.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.540
Maybe about three or four punches had been thrown,

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.540
but then I just get up, like,

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.540
and one of the guys, like, right behind the guy,

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.540
and then I'm like, hey, can we stop fighting?

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.540
Let's please stop fighting.

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.540
Can we not stop fighting?

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.540
Can you stop fighting? Stop fighting.

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.540
And then they're like, oh, no,

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.540
you got witnesses here, knock it off, man.

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.540
We're the victims he sees, and I'm like,

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.540
you guys are idiots. Just stop.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.540
Come on, knock it off.

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.540
And then he's like, no, this guy's wrong,

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.540
and then I walked away because they weren't

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.540
actively, like, looking to get in a punch

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.540
at that point because I was, I don't know,

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.540
the thing is you get worked up into this

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.540
spell of violence and rage, and, like,

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.540
it's very easy to break it, but, like,

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.540
you don't see anything outside of that bubble

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.540
when you're in it, so, like, I feel like

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.540
I just, like, distracted them enough,

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.540
and then, um, yeah, I heard the sirens,

01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.540
and I started walking away, and then a police guy,

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.540
like, pulled a big U-turn and, like,

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.540
stopped them, and then the guy,

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:05.540
the black guy, he, like, ran to the place

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.540
and so, and then I was like, I'm out,

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.540
I don't want to answer any questions.

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.540
And did the, and when the police started

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.540
to beat him,

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.540
that was, that was definitely

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.540
my worry.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.540
He seemed, he seemed willing

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.540
to go to the police, and so I was like,

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.540
well, the police was probably really in trouble.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.540
When the police show up and there's a black guy

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.540
there, that's a great time for all the witnesses,

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.540
just to scatter.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.540
There was a lot of witnesses,

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.540
there was just no one who was breaking up the fight.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.540
What Spencer didn't know is that

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.540
I was in the optometrist

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.540
where this was all happening,

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.540
and I'm, and the fight

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.540
was happening in the front window where

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.540
everybody in the

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.540
atometry building was looking out the window

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.540
going, oh, like,

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.540
opening up the door, like, a half...

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.540
What's happening?

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.540
What's happening?

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.540
Going, hey, stop, stop fighting.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.540
Stop fighting, stop fighting, yeah.

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.540
And me and Randall Park's brother

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.540
sitting there going, dude, what's going on?

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.540
We should do something, yeah.

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.540
We should probably do something.

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.540
Isn't that, isn't that Spencer

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.540
across the street?

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.540
Yeah, he's, he looks like he's about to cross

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.540
the street, and meanwhile I was like,

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.540
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.540
And so I watched,

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.540
and Spencer had no idea that I

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.540
was living in his world.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.540
I didn't want to say one thing, the only thing,

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.540
you were telling this story and you were narrating

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.540
for the guy who said like, hey, I took

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.540
two of you guys out for coffee.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.540
This isn't,

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.540
this isn't how I pictured this

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.540
afternoon going.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.540
And then

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.540
the third guy's like, well, you should

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.540
have gone with my bid.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.540
They're all architects.

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.540
All right, Spencer, do you think

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.540
you can recap, like,

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.540
D&D from years gone by?

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.540
Oh, yeah.

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.540
You guys done for that at all?

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.540
Yeah.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.540
You guys done for that at all?

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.540
No.

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.540
No.

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.540
No.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.540
I heard one voice of dissent.

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.540
All right, where's the music?

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.540
Spencer, you want some music for this?

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.540
Or do you want to do it in acapella?

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:17.540
I don't care, man.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.540
Come on, hero.

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.540
Come on, hero.

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.540
Yeah, man.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.540
Let's get some fucking music.

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.540
Yeah.

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.540
Yeah, D&D.

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.540
There's an audience here.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.540
D&D, yeah.

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.540
Do it good, son.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.540
I'll fuck you up.

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.540
I'll rob you, bro.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.540
D&D.

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:43.540
Let's get on this roller coaster.

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.540
Go to another dimension.

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.540
All right.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.540
So the gang was on

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.540
a mission to find

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.540
this gem.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.540
They were searching around

01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.540
and they were finding some clues.

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.540
They kidnapped a guy to get more clues,

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.540
but they didn't really find any clues

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.540
from that guy.

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.540
And then, what's his name?

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.540
Diarrhea Jr.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.540
He started snooping around on his loan,

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.540
but he got in over his head

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.540
and before he knew it, he was kidnapped

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.540
and locked somewhere.

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.540
So our heroes went to save him

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.540
and they found him.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.540
Did something happen?

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.540
Okay.

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.540
They found him and it was fun,

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.540
but they had to fight.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.540
There was a fight.

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:33.540
They were fighting.

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.540
They're still fighting.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.540
They got to save

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.540
DJ from the evil

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.540
actor's

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.540
guild.

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.540
Now

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.540
on Harmontown.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.540
All right.

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.540
I'd like to pretend I heard more of that

01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.540
than I did because I was handing out the character sheets,

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.540
but I think I'll be all right.

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.540
Oh, were you forced to do that?

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.540
I should have done it earlier.

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.540
I did not manage my time well.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.540
I'm excited. This is the first time ever

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.540
I have my own sheet.

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.540
Yeah, you want to read off some fast facts.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.540
Not playing Aaron or Steve Levy

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.540
or whatever.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.540
You know, I feel like you never asked me for it.

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.540
I would have definitely complied with that.

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.540
I like to say I'm like an easygoing person, I think.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.540
I want everyone to feel included.

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.540
DnTB.

01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.540
You guys,

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:35.540
you're in a fight.

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.540
You're in the underground area

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.540
of the theater house

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.540
of the screen actor's guild.

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.540
No, what was it?

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.540
It was a guild

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.540
of acting people.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.540
And you're down there.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:51.540
It's like a wooden,

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.540
what do you call it?

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.540
Like a break room. There's tables and chairs

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:57.540
and you see a dartboard on the wall

01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.540
and there's a map on the wall.

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.540
You were fighting and you seem to have killed

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.540
two of these guys.

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.540
The only one who's left

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.540
is a dude holding a gun.

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:09.540
It's like a lightning gun.

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:11.540
It shoots lightning and he shot you with lightning before.

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.540
Shit.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.540
A lightning gun.

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.540
Isn't everybody entangled

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.540
in a tree thing?

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.540
Right. Thank you for bringing that up.

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.540
Jeff turned into a tree

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.540
and then he entangled everybody.

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:29.540
Oh, that's right. Yeah, I remember that.

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.540
I was there for that.

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.540
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.540
I'm used to having a table.

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.540
Can I do a good old-fashioned

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.540
observe surrounding

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.540
to see who's where and what's what?

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.540
Yeah, so there's two corpses

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:45.540
on the ground

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.540
and then there's one guy who's kind of

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.540
entangled in your tree

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.540
that's you and he's not like super

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.540
entangled. He's just, you know,

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.540
he's like wrestling with vines and such.

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.540
Right.

01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.540
Then there's everyone else.

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:01.540
Yeah, there's a door.

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.540
There's actually three doors

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.540
and like I said, some tables, chairs, a dartboard.

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:07.540
These fucking glasses.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.540
So combat is still happening right now.

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.540
Oh, yeah.

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.540
So do you want to, who has the initiative?

01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.540
He does. He shoots you with a gun.

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:17.540
Me? Yeah.

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.540
What? That's just a tree.

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:21.540
That's, but you entangled him.

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.540
Well, it's a tree.

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.540
All right, it's hard to dodge as a tree.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.540
Oh, no, but you're immune to lightning.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.540
Okay, so. Yeah.

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.540
We established that.

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:35.540
Wait, wait. Do trees get hit by lightning all the time, though?

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:37.540
Yeah.

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.540
Because I have my fire, my, like,

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.540
fire abilities, maybe?

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:43.540
Is that why?

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.540
No.

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.540
Okay. Hey, look.

01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:49.540
Trees have resistance to electricity. They're not immune.

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.540
Okay. All right.

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.540
So I dodged it?

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.540
No, you're a tree.

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:57.540
But I absorb it.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.540
Yes, yes, sorry.

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.540
I'm not going to question you ever, ever again.

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:03.540
Thank you. That's all I've ever wanted.

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.540
Does anyone else want to play?

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.540
Can I...

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.540
How do I have him entangled?

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.540
Like, where are my branches around him?

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.540
They're mostly around his ankles.

01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.540
Like, his arms are unencumbered,

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.540
and that's why he could shoot you with a gun.

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:19.540
I pick him up by the ankles and hold him upside down

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.540
like a pinata so that the rest of our,

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.540
or the squad can come attack.

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:25.540
All right, you do that.

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:27.540
Yes, I fucking do.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.540
Am I entangled in his three branches?

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.540
Yeah, currently.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.540
Hey.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.540
Is he shooting lightning?

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.540
He did.

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.540
Okay.

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.540
Did you have a question?

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.540
No, let me know when he does again.

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.540
Okay. All right.

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:47.540
Because I'm going to do, I want to do something.

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.540
Do you want to prepare something?

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.540
No.

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.540
Yeah.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.540
What do you want to prepare?

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.540
I want to prepare jumping in front of the lightning.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:59.540
Okay, great. You do that. Perfect.

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:01.540
Can I...

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.540
Can I shimmy out of the branches?

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.540
Yeah, do you want to try?

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.540
Yeah.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.540
Do you have a scape artist or anything?

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.540
He could escape.

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.540
No, I don't have a scape artist.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.540
All right, give me your decks.

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.540
15.

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.540
All right.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:21.540
You don't escape.

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:23.540
You really got me tangled here.

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.540
You can move your arms,

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.540
but you can't move very easily.

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.540
Can't I just choose to let him free?

01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:31.540
This is like...

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.540
I don't have anything to control over my entanglements.

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:35.540
You do on your turn.

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.540
Okay.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.540
Sorry, Diary, I should have used my first turn

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.540
to let you get free.

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:43.540
It's cool. I'll just chill here in your branches.

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:45.540
All right.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.540
You're like, Jeff, let me go.

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.540
Let me go, man.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.540
I'm like...

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.540
Let me go.

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.540
I'm stuck in your branches. What the fuck?

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.540
Let me go.

01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:59.540
The bear walks through the frame.

01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.540
No.

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.540
No.

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.540
You all see that bear?

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.540
No.

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.540
It does not change the game at all.

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.540
No, that happens. That happens.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.540
I mean, it doesn't...

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.540
No one seems to react very much, but sure.

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.540
So you guys not just see that bear?

01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:19.540
It's glorious.

01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:21.540
Yes, but don't we have bigger fish to fry?

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:23.540
We're in a world...

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:25.540
Guys, you guys are going to freak out

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:27.540
if you don't want to go.

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.540
Do you want to go?

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.540
Garry Shandling.

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.540
Oh, yeah.

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.540
Is my special ability

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:37.540
of shielding aura...

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:39.540
That's not a thing I invoke.

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.540
Is that a thing that's just...

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.540
That's not passive?

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:45.540
I think you do have to invoke it.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.540
Okay.

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.540
Because it's allies within 20 feet

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.540
get plus two armor class

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.540
per round, per level.

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.540
Would you rather add channel energy

01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.540
if I feel like...

01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.540
Have they gotten their asses kicked?

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:01.540
It's been like six months since we played.

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.540
We've been kind of like taking up eating.

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.540
They've been taken damage, and they got some healing.

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.540
They could probably use some more healing.

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:09.540
You could do both of those though.

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.540
Because the aura is like a minor action.

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.540
Hoaaahhhhhh...

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:17.540
Heal.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.540
Ooh.

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:24.540
Man, this is gonna be great.

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:29.540
Okay, everyone heals 13.

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:30.540
Damn.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.540
I don't have a pen.

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.540
Hmm, that's okay.

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:43.540
Alright, so the guy with the gun, he's upside down.

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.540
He's trying to shoot.

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.540
Whose turn is it?

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.540
It's my turn.

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:52.540
Oh, no.

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:55.540
Brandon's stuck.

01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:59.540
Thank you, my good man.

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.540
Oh, no.

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:03.540
Brandon's high.

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.540
Oh, no.

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:07.540
Sorry, Brandon.

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.540
He'll fuck you up.

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.540
You were gonna fuck the guy up?

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:17.540
He wasn't good at it, but he was willing to say so, right?

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:19.540
You were just bluffing, right?

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:22.540
You're not gonna fuck anybody up.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.540
I think he's got it in him.

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:31.540
I think that's racist.

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:37.540
When do I get to say what's racist?

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.540
He shoots a gun.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.540
I jump in front.

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:45.540
I jump in front of the lightning.

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:47.540
Alright, you do that.

01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.540
Yes.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:53.540
I jump in front of the lightning because...

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:57.540
You got this, bro.

01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:58.540
I got it.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.540
Shambling Mount is subjected to...

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:04.540
Whenever the Shambling Mount is subjected to lightning damage,

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:08.540
it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:15.540
equal to the lightning damage dealt.

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.540
Those aren't our mics.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:23.540
Rob's mic just took four damage.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.540
Alright, so...

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:26.540
Right?

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.540
Wait, what?

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:28.540
Right?

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.540
What do you mean right?

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:30.540
What I just said.

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:33.540
Yeah, you're reading, right?

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:35.540
But it's right.

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:38.540
I've just revealed if you make something up

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:41.540
and sound like it's reading, I'll buy it.

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:43.540
Well, now I know that's how I convince you.

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.540
Yeah, so, okay.

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:47.540
You jump in front of his lightning gun

01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:49.540
right as he pulls the trigger,

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.540
and lightning blasts into your body

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.540
and through your vegetative mass,

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:56.540
energizing the wriggling, writhing,

01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:59.540
viney forms that make you up.

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:01.540
You regain 12 health.

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.540
12 health?

01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:03.540
I'll take it.

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.540
Steve and Dan get hit by the lightning

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.540
as it cuts through the shambling mound.

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.540
You each take 12 damage.

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:13.540
What the fuck?

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:14.540
Guys.

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:15.540
Good thing you healed, huh?

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.540
Gary.

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:20.540
You're supposed to absorb it.

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:22.540
Yeah, I am.

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.540
Okay, at the same time,

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.540
one of the doors on the far wall flies open

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:29.540
and you can see a little dwarf yelling,

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:30.540
and he's just yelling.

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.540
He's holding what looks like a big baseball bat,

01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:35.540
and he comes right towards one of these.

01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.540
Jesus Christ!

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.540
What the fuck?

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:41.540
He comes right towards Jeff.

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:42.540
Who's a tree?

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:43.540
Chad.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.540
Jeff.

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.540
Oh, Chad.

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:46.540
No, you're right.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:49.540
I was like, no, you're Chad.

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.540
I know this one.

01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.540
He comes at me?

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.540
Does he mean me harm?

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:55.540
He does, yeah.

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.540
He's wielding, it looks like a whiffleball bat.

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:00.540
Well, I say you're going to bring a bat to a tree fight?

01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:01.540
He does.

01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.540
He brings a bat to a tree fight.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:06.540
And the bat is smeared with poop.

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.540
Oh, boy.

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:08.540
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:09.540
You don't like it.

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:10.540
What?

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.540
You don't like it?

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.540
It's a poop bat.

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.540
Does he attack me?

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:16.540
Yeah.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:17.540
Does he attack me?

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.540
Yeah, yeah, no.

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:21.540
He hits you with the bat and you hear a pop,

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.540
and both of you disappear and reappear.

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:28.540
You guys, you see both of them dematerialize out of existence.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.540
What the fuck?

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.540
The Thanos?

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:35.540
A dwarf just hit me with a magic whiffleball bat,

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:36.540
and now I'm gone?

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:37.540
Yeah.

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:39.540
And the dwarf's gone.

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.540
He's gone too, yeah.

01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:42.540
Briefly.

01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:46.540
You reappear in a dark building filling with smoke.

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:47.540
But we don't see that.

01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:50.540
No, you don't know that happens.

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:53.540
Okay.

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.540
Hello.

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.540
Have we fucking met?

01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:58.540
You're a tree.

01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.540
You can't talk.

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:00.540
Okay.

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.540
He just smells like shit.

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:06.540
Am I in a different dimension than the rest of the fight right now?

01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:08.540
No, you feel like it's the same dimension.

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:12.540
Okay, I summon nature's ally and get that bear.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.540
Can you summon a bear?

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.540
I can summon a bear.

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:17.540
Can you?

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:19.540
I'm a druid.

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:22.540
I don't have it all written down here.

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:24.540
I can speak with animals.

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.540
I can summon a creature to fight.

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:27.540
Right.

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.540
I just saw that bear walk by.

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:29.540
That's different.

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:30.540
Huh?

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.540
You can use your speak with animals to talk to the bear.

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:33.540
All right.

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.540
Do you want to play the bear brandon?

01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:36.540
Yes.

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:37.540
Okay.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.540
That's what I'm talking about.

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:40.540
Hey bear!

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:41.540
Bear!

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:43.540
What can I do for you?

01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:44.540
Hey.

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:47.540
You know all those times you use trees to scratch your ass

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.540
and climb up and get that honey and do all that shit?

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.540
Oh, I do.

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.540
Right after I steal a picnic basket.

01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:57.540
Okay, well, now you're being racist.

01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:58.540
What?

01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:03.540
Don't marge in the last bears.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.540
I'm saying, well, maybe I am too.

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.540
I'm saying you look like a badass that might fuck somebody up.

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:12.540
I've been known to eat a porcupine.

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:17.540
How would you feel if you saw a dwarf walk up with a magic whiffleball bat

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.540
and beat up a tree?

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:21.540
Covered in poop.

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:24.540
Is that what makes it magical?

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:25.540
I don't know.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.540
It makes it shittier.

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.540
Okay.

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.540
Well, I would like to tear him apart.

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:31.540
All right.

01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:32.540
You want to join me in this fight?

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:33.540
I'd love to.

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:34.540
Let's get down.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:35.540
All right.

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:37.540
And let it be known, I didn't even have to summon you.

01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.540
I just had to talk to you.

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:43.540
I've always been looking for someone who would listen.

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:50.540
Well, that's too bad because this fight is a talker.

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:55.540
You've got to be kidding me.

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:57.540
I'm just fucking with you.

01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:58.540
Let's do this.

01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:59.540
Whoo!

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:08.540
What's up?

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:09.540
Who wants to do?

01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:10.540
Anyone could go.

01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:13.540
I'm back in my natural form right now.

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.540
Oh, you stopped being a tree?

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:15.540
Okay.

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:16.540
Didn't you say I became...

01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:17.540
Oh, I'm still a tree.

01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:18.540
Yeah.

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:19.540
Unless you stop.

01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:22.540
No, I'm going to go fucking bark skin.

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.540
Okay.

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:24.540
That makes me tougher, right?

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:25.540
Yeah.

01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:26.540
Yeah.

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:29.540
Try to hit me with that bat again, motherfucker.

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:30.540
My skin got...

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.540
How much tougher is my bark now?

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.540
I want to say what level are you?

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:35.540
Three.

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:37.540
I think you get plus three armor class.

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:38.540
Okay.

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.540
Yeah, bark skin.

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:40.540
Yeah.

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.540
The bear, do you want to go?

01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:45.540
Where are we going?

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:49.540
There's a dwarf with a whiffle ball bat and you saw a tree who just talked to you and

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:50.540
asked you to fight.

01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:54.540
It just grew more bark.

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:58.540
But I can still talk as a non-action movement, right?

01:28:58.540 --> 01:28:59.540
Yeah.

01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.540
I say, hey, just go full bear on this motherfucker.

01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:04.540
Like, don't hold anything back.

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:08.540
Oh, I'm going to do him like Leo got dead in Revenant.

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:09.540
Yeah.

01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:10.540
Fucking...

01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:11.540
Yeah.

01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:14.540
And I want it to last as long as that scene in Revenant.

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:15.540
That's right.

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:16.540
I want you to sit on him for a while.

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:17.540
I want you...

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:18.540
I want this to go on.

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:21.540
There will be moments where you think we're having sex.

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:23.540
But it will be an attack.

01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:24.540
But I don't want to give...

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.540
I don't want to give...

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:26.540
I don't want to give a bear...

01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:27.540
bear notes.

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:30.540
This time, the bear wins.

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.540
Okay.

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:36.540
Well, you got there right.

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.540
Let us go forth and catch this little...

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.540
with a ball, bitch.

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:42.540
Just go attack this motherfucker.

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:43.540
Wow!

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:44.540
Wow!

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.540
Wow!

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.540
Wow!

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:47.540
Wow!

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:48.540
Wow!

01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:49.540
Wow!

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:50.540
Wow!

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:51.540
Wow!

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:52.540
Wow!

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:53.540
Wow!

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:54.540
I can't...

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.540
Wow!

01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:56.540
Wow!

01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:57.540
Wow!

01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.540
Wow!

01:29:58.540 --> 01:29:59.540
Wow!

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:00.540
Wow!

01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:01.540
Wow!

01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:02.540
Wow!

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:03.540
Wow!

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:04.540
Wow!

01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:09.540
You truly is high.

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.540
Wow!

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:11.540
You're super high.

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:18.540
All right, you hit him with your bear paw.

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:30.540
You deal nine damage.

01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.540
Wow!

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:47.340
You take a big chunk out of his side. Yeah, it moved it got moved to two places. You

01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:52.940
guys should go. No, it's hard to know if you're winning or losing. You know, I've seen the

01:30:52.940 --> 01:31:00.660
bear. I don't know if he's on our side. Can I talk to our friends right now? Are we on

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:05.500
a different level? No, you're in a different level. You don't know. Can I have an audible

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:10.340
here? I wanted to ask you, who's in the room right now? The guy with the gun. There's one

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:19.020
guy in the gun and then the rest of us. Yeah. Okay. Continue. You guys continue. Dan, you

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:28.020
haven't said anything for a while. Do something. I'm going to get this motherfucker. And the

01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:41.100
way I'm going to do it is, magically, with a spell I like to call, uh, inflict light

01:31:41.100 --> 01:32:03.660
wounds. It sounds, uh, it's, uh, it's bite is worse than it's bark. All right. And you're

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:08.700
going for the gun guy. Yeah. There's only one guy in the room. Is he going to go for

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:16.180
us? What do you have to ask that question? Yes. All right. You do it. Your hands crackle

01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:24.620
with fell energies as you touch into his body. Thou shall do harm. You can feel the shock

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:30.260
of the spell release. It feels like a very powerful electric spark and it's, it's crazy.

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:35.300
You could just see instantly his flesh just starts necrotizing and sizzling like the whole

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:43.020
side of his body goes black and that's, he's all messed up. Like, uh, he's really bad.

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:46.820
While that's happening, I want to Captain America throw my shield at him. Just whip

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:54.460
it at him really fucking hard. All right. You do that. You hit him in the teeth. You get

01:32:54.460 --> 01:33:01.740
him for six damage. Nice. A teeth damage hurts. I do it. Can I go? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I do

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:06.060
a slam attack. Multi, multi slam attack. How much damage, what's your, what's the, how

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:15.820
much damage does it do? Oh, so much. Uh, uh, plus eight. No, the dice is like 2d something.

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:29.300
Uh, you fucking nerd. Yeah, 2d six plus five plus grab. Awesome. So I slam and grab him.

01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:40.540
All right. You hit him for eight damage with your, with your meaty paw. Yeah. Okay. Veggie

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:47.900
paw. Now it happens. Yeah. Now it, now it happens. My turn. Um, he, he pulls out his

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:55.500
gun and, uh, he shoots it. He shoots it at Steve and it's like click, click, click, click,

01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:02.820
click. Like it's empty. Damn, dude. And then he throws it at Steve. What? It's a critical hit.

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:09.340
Can I catch it? Yeah, sure. You can catch it. I want to catch that gun. All right. It hits

01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:15.580
you in the face for five damage. Ow. And then you catch it. You caught it with your face.

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:20.060
All right. I still got it. I whip it right back at his face. Okay. Well, it's not your

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:27.020
turn, but you could do that. Um, then at the same time, you see the, the corpse of the, uh, one

01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:32.100
of the guys you killed, he kind of like magically kind of lifts up onto his feet. It's very

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:36.820
disturbing, you know, almost like a puppet being raised by its strings. And you can see

01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:42.420
he's been like sliced in half by when he exploded, but it kind of like, you could see his sinews

01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:46.780
kind of coming back together and then he crawls up onto the ceiling and he starts hissing.

01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:50.580
Which guy? Which guy is this? He, okay. So you might not remember him because this is

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:56.180
way back when, but one of the three guys had a big like robot juggernaut arm kind of thing.

01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:02.980
And he went as to punch you and immediately just exploded because his arm exploded. But,

01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:06.980
but now he's, he's seemingly come back from the dead and is hissing on the ceiling like

01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:16.340
a cockroach. What a feeling. When you're hissing on the ceiling.

01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:30.100
Man, I'm going to engulf him. All right, let's go back to the shack then.

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:34.500
Fuck yeah. This is a bear shack? Yeah, you're a tree with more bark.

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:38.060
All right, who's, who's, who's, who's charnaces? It's you, you're a tree more bark.

01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:41.060
All right, I've been waiting to use this spell for a good old time. Do I have another spell

01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:44.060
on me right now? It depends on the spell level.

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:48.860
It's a first level. One, two. Yeah, I think maybe you have a one left.

01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:55.820
Okay, I cast magic fang, which gives my, gives one natural weapon of my subject creature.

01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:59.540
He gets a plus one attack. So I can make his claws or his teeth.

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:01.660
Right. You get a plus one. Yeah.

01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:07.940
So I just beefed up the bear. The bear gets magic fangs. You feel a magical

01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:16.820
sharpness embody your parts. Oh, the sharpness. I'm still going to do

01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:24.940
damage. Oh, I like this. I feel more bad.

01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:32.140
I turn over to the bear. First off, we never, we never exchange names.

01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:42.540
Oh, I'm Chad. What's your name? Bear me back. Yeah. That's our show.

01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:48.220
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Bear me back.

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:56.020
How long were you sitting on that joke, Brandon? 10 years old.

01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:59.780
Bear me back. And not only did your fangs just get sharper because I'm a druid who has

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:02.380
made your teeth a little sharper. Thank you.

01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:05.740
When you attack, I think you'll find out. Remember all that crazy noise that you made

01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:09.020
when you were attacking earlier? It gets me going.

01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:13.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, this gets a little weirder.

01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:21.220
Also, also, sometimes the bear goes into a little burning max standup in the middle

01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:26.220
of the attack. Oh, oh, oh, bees, bees, bees. You're not going

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:30.220
to get me on that, honey. You're going to get me on that, honey.

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:35.740
Give me something to sum, bitch, honey. I bite your face off.

01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:45.020
I bite your sum, bitch, face off. Okay.

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.580
Now you still got to go attack this dude. I'll attack this mother fuck.

01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:50.780
You ain't going to tell me not to attack no mother.

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:53.420
I'm attacking right now. I'll walk up to his front door.

01:37:53.420 --> 01:38:00.420
I'll attack his front door, man. I'll attack his mama.

01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:04.420
Okay, hold on. All right.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:11.420
This is a critical measurement of our attack. It's not. It's better than that.

01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:23.380
It's damaged. All right. You smash him in the face with

01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:28.340
a bear paw and then you hit him on the other side of his head, so you're holding him in

01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:33.380
the head and then you moll his face. It's great. You deal 24 damage.

01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:39.380
Oh, yeah. Bernie Mac.

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:47.500
All right. He's like flailing around and as his face is being hit eating, he like lashes

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:51.660
out and he hits you with a bat and both of you poof and go outside and now you're somewhere

01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.660
else. But as that happens, you finished eating his face.

01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.180
So he's dead now. But we're outside.

01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:04.580
Well, not you. You're inside and you're a tree.

01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:07.380
So if the cops come, I'm in trouble. Yeah.

01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:10.980
Fucking Bernie Mac's just chilling outside.

01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:14.220
He's with the corpse though. Oh, he's back with the other dude.

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.700
Yeah, he teleported. No, well, he's in a third location.

01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:26.740
Oh, it's fun. In the underground place, also, the guy's still hissing on the ceiling and

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:32.620
the other guy doesn't have a gun because Steve caught it.

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:36.900
Am I grabbing him still? Which? No.

01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:40.140
You tried to grab him and failed. I didn't call that out, but...

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:45.380
Okay. Well, thanks for telling me. Well, I did not say that you grabbed him.

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:51.180
Really? Well, I suppose I have no choice.

01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:57.980
I've got to summon the level of monster that I'm allowed to.

01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:04.900
Probably my ward. All right, summon monster one.

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:08.980
I'd like to summon a monster of the kind that can climb walls.

01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:15.980
I hope there's an ant in there, maybe. An ant?

01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:22.300
I think I feel that there's an ant. An giant ant, my favorite kind.

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:25.100
Does it have to be giant? It does, yeah.

01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:28.460
You're going to want it to be. You love those big ants.

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:31.580
Check this out. You like that ceiling?

01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:43.020
I forget. What's your race in class again, Dan?

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:52.940
I don't see the world through that lens.

01:40:52.940 --> 01:41:00.060
I am a human, size medium, gender medium.

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:05.940
He's a class human. He's a cleric.

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:14.100
Carry on. Antimum summonum.

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:20.300
All right, you do that. The ant feverishly comes out of another dimension

01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:23.340
and climbs up a wall and then onto the ceiling.

01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:28.180
And you can see his powerful mandibles snap the guy right on the foot

01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:32.740
with his jaws and leg scissors. They just snip his foot clean off

01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:36.620
and it falls to the floor. Yikes.

01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:43.540
He hisses more screamingly. Someone else.

01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:48.300
I engulf what's left of him. He's on the ceiling?

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:52.060
Yeah. You can't reach.

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:55.460
What? You can't reach. What if I jumped?

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:58.340
You can try that, but you might fail.

01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:03.300
Well, you're going to try a jumping engulf.

01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:06.820
Yeah, what are we playing at here? Why not?

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.220
What are we trying to do here?

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:11.660
Yeah. I just ate lightning with my body.

01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:15.660
I think I can do this. Okay.

01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:21.620
I do a jump. I do like a, I do a, I roll up and a fall,

01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:29.100
but then I jump and I'm like, wow. And I like throw myself at him to engulf him.

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.380
And? All right. Does it work?

01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:37.220
You jump up there after rolling up into a ball to like gather potential energy

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:42.100
and you hit him, but you just barely graze him, so.

01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:45.220
It's not even a slam? No, it missed as a slam.

01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:48.620
I see that as a success. We didn't think you were going to make it.

01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:52.460
Didn't even think you were going to touch him. Thank you.

01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:55.580
Thank you. It's, it's, you know, I mean, you're not going to get anywhere.

01:42:55.580 --> 01:43:01.500
And like, if you don't try, you miss every 100% of the chances you don't take, right?

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.980
That's what they say. Oh, yeah.

01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:09.820
Actually, Wayne Gretzky. Oh, God.

01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:17.340
Know the room. Wayne Gretzky.

01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:19.660
What? What are you talking about?

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:23.980
Does that do one damage to everyone else in my deck?

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.740
I don't know anything about magic. What Deep Space Nine episode was he in?

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:32.540
What's that? What's, what's, what's that new red skull chain attack?

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:37.020
Chain Roller Goblin. It's a rare from Dominaria.

01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:39.900
Yeah, that's what we're saying. Make sure you update your decks.

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:43.740
It's got first strike.

01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:47.340
You can deal one damage to every other character in the other guy's deck.

01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:51.580
Oh man. Ran him up red is going to infect this meta. I tell you what,

01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:55.260
standards not going to be the same after Chain Roller Goblin comes through.

01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:58.300
Are we still playing? Yeah, more or less.

01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:03.500
What's happening? In the Sumerian times, I appeared as a great

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:17.580
Glorthos. I don't know the real. So, Spence, the gun that I'm holding,

01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:20.940
it's just totally out of ammo? Uh, yeah. It seems to be empty.

01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:24.060
You can't catch lightning in a gun more than one.

01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:27.580
That's, it's just out of ammo? Yeah. I can tell, I can for sure tell that.

01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:30.620
Yeah, well, I mean, you could pull a trigger. Okay. And it's empty.

01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:34.300
So, it's not like fixable. All right. Well, you don't, I mean, you're not a

01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:37.260
wizard, so you don't know how to, like, fix a magic thing.

01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:41.660
Let me look at it. How hard can this be?

01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:46.780
Okay, I give Gary the gun, and then I charge the guy on the ground with my

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:49.340
elvish blade, and I want to, I want to slice his

01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:55.020
head clean off. Okay. He doesn't really try and dodge.

01:44:55.020 --> 01:45:01.500
You get him. Oh, yeah. What's your strength, boss?

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:05.740
Uh, it's 18 plus four. Okay. You deal seven damage.

01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:09.660
You hit him in the neck. Jesus Christ.

01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:13.820
It doesn't go through, but it's real deep and gross. Yeah, describe it to me.

01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:19.100
Well, it's, it's not like it goes. Look at your biceps. You need to,

01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:26.060
you need to walk that talk back. You're scaring people. I'm sorry.

01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:28.940
I'm sorry. Is the, is the blood shooting everywhere?

01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:33.020
Yeah, it like, it went down instead of like sideways through his neck, so it's

01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:35.900
just kind of like he's, he's cleft open kind of in his

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:41.980
collarbone area, and he's just spewing. I stop examining the lightning gun and

01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.220
just take a step back and go,

01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:51.100
I mean, I just met you guys, but I mean, you were beating up this

01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:56.620
tied up person in my living room like earlier today, and now you're, you're

01:45:56.620 --> 01:46:02.540
cutting people's necks. I don't know. I'm just, I, I,

01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:06.380
this is all being said with my face, because we're, this is all happening so

01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:10.060
fast, but my expression is like,

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:15.260
I mean, I mean, like if you, if you gave me a

01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:19.260
glance, you would probably go, he's questioning

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:22.620
the, the, what is going on. You know what I mean?

01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:25.980
Yeah. You know, like when you were, you would be in a room,

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:29.180
you know, and then somebody says something and everybody laughs, but you

01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:32.620
didn't like it. You were like, yeah. You know, like one of

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.500
those, they just kind of like,

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:41.180
yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. You're going through all the stuff

01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:46.300
that when you retell the story later, you'll, you'll be like, and I'm like,

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:52.620
yeah, I was like, and I was like, what the fuck is going on here?

01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:59.340
I am not, I do not want any part of this, and somebody would say,

01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:05.980
you said that? No, I was, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like

01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:13.500
yeah. So is my blade still in his neck? Yeah, no, I mean, no, it's part of the

01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:17.260
attack that withdraw the blade and stuff. Okay, okay.

01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:23.580
Being made out of plant, the blood is, is, is weird to me, right? It's

01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:27.500
weird. No, you're a carnivorous plant. If we

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:33.180
water him. But I don't have blood. Feed me. But you eat blood.

01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:41.580
Thank you, Steve. What's happening? I got a little drunk.

01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:46.780
Little shop of horse. So I'm like going,

01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:52.380
is that what I'm doing? Well, I mean, it's your choice, but you're not

01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:56.300
unused to blood because you're like, you're like a shark. You know, it's like

01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:00.300
for your poop or you're a plant, like you wouldn't you be more into poop?

01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:05.580
No, I'm not into poop. What's that fertilizer? Like,

01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:09.420
I'm with Carlos on this one. I think you like poop.

01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:14.860
Nitrogen and carnivorous plants. Just finish killing this guy, okay?

01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:18.940
All right. Look, you're boring the DM.

01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:22.780
So what's happened with this guy? What's happening with this guy?

01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:26.620
The guy on the ceiling, he's been hissing. He was more of a screaming

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:29.340
hiss. He jumps down onto the ground and

01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:34.140
grabs the guy who was holding a flaming sword before he dies, and he

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:37.980
plunges his mouth into his body and starts sucking out his blood, and he

01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:41.740
like dries him up, like he sucks him dry like a

01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:45.580
husk. And then he just blasts, newly empowered. He

01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:48.700
like, he does a shoryuken uppercut and blasts through

01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:53.260
the ceiling, shoryuken, while hissing. And then he

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:56.540
like, ninja flips like a crazy vampire out of the building.

01:48:56.540 --> 01:49:01.580
What the fuck? This guy, all while hissing.

01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:03.820
Yeah.

01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:09.020
A lot thickens. We've not got a single answer on what the fuck is going on

01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:12.460
anymore. Are we back in the other part with it?

01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:17.100
Meanwhile in the shack, it's filling with smoke, and your bark is thicker than

01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:23.820
ever. All right, can I turn back into a druid

01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:27.820
my regular form? 100%. And I want to pick up that fucking

01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:32.300
teleportation whiffleball bat. I want that. It's not there, it's outside.

01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:36.060
I walk outside and go get that bat. Okay, you see a bear.

01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:38.940
He's eating a corpse.

01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:43.900
I walk around just kind of testing things out, like just like, I see like a

01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:48.540
like a like the edge of the the doorway, and I tap it with the bat just

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:51.900
testing out the properties of this bat. Nothing happens. Okay.

01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:55.020
I go up to the bat, I go up to the bear, I say, love babe, Bernie Mac,

01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:59.100
when you're done, I gotta say I really appreciate

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:05.260
what you did. You ate the fuck out of that, dude.

01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:11.420
Stand with me. Let's hold hands. Hold, put your paw on my hand, and I'm gonna take

01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:14.620
this bat, and I'm gonna tap us both at the same time with this bat.

01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:18.460
You're not gonna hit me with that bat.

01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:20.860
No, it's a tap. It's a tap. You're not gonna tap me.

01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.820
It's a little tap. You're not even gonna tap me.

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:27.340
What are you tapping me? I will do it like this. I will do it like that.

01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:31.260
I will do it with a whiffleball bat.

01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:37.980
And so we hold it, we hold paw and hand, and I do a double tap, and I'm hitting

01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:42.940
both of us at the same time. All right, if he can sense to that, sure.

01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:47.660
Right, that's cool. Yeah, you could try to dodge it.

01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:54.540
Anyway, you do it. You teleport 20 feet up in the air and fall 20 feet.

01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:58.380
Your legs hurt, but like you don't take any damage.

01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.820
All right, that's my bat.

01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:08.140
I decide to make amends. Look, I don't know what's going on.

01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.300
I just tap myself lightly on the head with the bat.

01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:13.740
You tell it, you disappear.

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:22.780
Where do I go? All right, you reappear back in the room with

01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:27.340
everyone, without the bear. Oh, I wanted the bear.

01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:33.100
I hit myself again. All right, you reappear outside 30 feet in the

01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.980
air and you fall.

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:40.460
No damage? Not yet. Okay.

01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:48.460
Like geographically, am I near the bear? Can I see the bear? Is it totally different?

01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:52.060
Yeah, when you were airborne, you could see the bear.

01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:57.820
I yell, bear any matter, come to the sound of my voice. I haven't quite got the

01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:03.980
hang of this Wiffleball bat yet. Fall on me. I'll break your fall, your 30 feet in

01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:08.060
the air. That happens.

01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:12.700
Do I land on it? I already landed it, right? Yeah, yeah. All right. What do you say we

01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:19.820
stop fucking with this Wiffleball bat? So, I mean, you let me finish eating this dude.

01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:25.660
Is the bat still smeared with poop? Yep, the whole time. Yeah.

01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:30.940
All I want in my cinematic mind's eye is for me to come back to the rest of the

01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:35.340
party with a bear and a bat covered in poop

01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:38.620
and not give any explanation about what happened.

01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:45.820
Well, as it relates to the bat, we didn't have any rabbits to wipe our ass with.

01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:53.980
I'm putting all these jokes in a book for your grandpa.

01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:57.740
You don't come out to hunt, do you? It's another bear joke.

01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:00.540
Yay. All right. So, are we back with the group now?

01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:05.660
Well, you didn't do anything. I'm trying to walk with the bear back.

01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:09.900
Oh, yeah. No, you walk back. Okay, you walk back in, you wander back in, and

01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:14.940
yeah, there's a guy screaming and bleeding. It's great.

01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:19.820
Chad's back. Look at the fur on this guy. It's so smooth.

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:25.900
It's so soft. Jesus. I'm sorry.

01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:31.500
Beautiful. What the fuck is going on?

01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:34.700
This is crazy. Where'd you go? I went around.

01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:37.100
I get everybody. Everybody. Let's huddle up. Get in the circle.

01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.140
All right. Well, there's one more enemy left, I think. Oh, there is?

01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:44.620
Yeah. What's in there? Yeah, but he's screaming and bleeding and unarmed.

01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:49.740
We should probably take him prisoner, interrogate him.

01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:57.420
We've been good at that. Why don't we have him dig his own grave and just...

01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:02.700
Cliff Hanger!

01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:08.700
Thank you all.

01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:12.220
Thank you all for coming down to our first show at the Doomsday Telegraph,

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:19.900
where this fucking place is called. Can we get up for our guest, Rob Schrab?

01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:26.140
Brandon Johnson. Steve Levy.

01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:34.060
Also, Church, Usang, Zach, Brian here on Tech, Chris, Sarah, Vanessa, who I met earlier.

01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:36.860
What a wonderful theater. Thank you so much, all of you, for being our first

01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:43.900
guest down at the new place.

01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:47.900
Drive fast and take chances. We love you all.

01:54:47.900 --> 01:55:05.820
Did you get any of that?

01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:19.740
It's a good show.
