gonna get hyperbolic I'm gonna cut it back to 90% I'm gonna\n\n14:32.620 --> 14:39.260\nsay 90% of the people who say calm down are in a bit of an agitated state but\n\n14:39.260 --> 14:42.780\nI'm allowing for 10% of like crazy circumstances where there's like a\n\n14:42.780 --> 14:47.020\nparamedic who's genuinely trying to be helpful like calm down like like you're\n\n14:47.020 --> 14:54.340\ndying like or your mom is like like like like like what do I do mom like I got\n\n14:54.340 --> 14:59.300\nI got bit by a shark and I think if like if you're like a you're training to be a\n\n14:59.300 --> 15:02.340\nfighter pilot and you're like one of those big simulators and you start like\n\n15:02.340 --> 15:06.540\noh you're crashing the things are happening and the guy that's in

all is that\n\n15:18.700 --> 15:21.980\nbecause they listen to a lot of true crime shows it's just like fucking 911\n\n15:21.980 --> 15:30.460\noperators like you calm down oh my god my baby's been stabbed with a demon knife\n\n15:30.460 --> 15:35.700\nma'am calm down like like what are you talking about like it's just it's so\n\n15:35.700 --> 15:39.500\ncrazy like they keep saying calm down and the crazy the thing that drives me\n\n15:39.500 --> 15:44.220\nnuts about it is if you listen to any amount of true crime we all know what\n\n15:44.220 --> 15:50.860\nhappens if you are calm when you call 911 you get thrown in prison for 20\n\n15:50.860 --> 15:56.820\nyears because they can't get past your fucking weird tone and the 911 cop\n\n15:56.820 --> 16:02.940\noh it doesn't sound like his wife got stabbed to me like yeah I'm fucking calm\n\n16:02.940 --> 16:08.940\nI'm so terrified of somebody I love getting killed I'm gonna call 911 it's\n\n16:08.940 --> 16:13.420\ngonna be like you know like when I leave a store like I if I don't buy\n\n16:13.420 --> 16:19.180\nanything like I act like a shoplifter because I'm like so anyways take it easy\n\n16:19.180 --> 16:23.020\nlike like because I just feel like well you should have bought something but I\n\n16:23.020 --> 16:26.140\ndidn't so I guess I look like I'm stealing something so I'll just lean up\n\n16:26.140 --> 16:29.820\nagainst the door and stretch and then like you know like I don't want them to\n\n16:29.820 --> 16:34.420\nthink I'm bolting and then I look like I'm stealing something I'm someone if you\n\n16:34.420 --> 16:40.460\nget stabbed I'm not you know and then if I call up 911 dispatch and I say that\n\n16:40.460 --> 16:45.300\nthere was a demon knife involved and the person on the other end of the line's\n\n16:45.300 --> 16:52.740\nfirst question isn't about demon nights then fuck them yeah man calm down calm\n\n16:52.740 --> 17:00.380\ndown demon knife I like like Spencer what is

22:19.780\nit's not worth it\n\n22:19.780 --> 22:26.780\njust something I pasted into my phone it's not worth it\n\n22:26.780 --> 22:34.340\nit's just a waste of time cover your ears if you like entertainment\n\n22:34.340 --> 22:39.340\nI just want to I just saw this paragraph I'm subscribed for some reason to this\n\n22:39.340 --> 22:48.940\nCNN newsletter and Brian Brian Steltler Steltler he kind of does this little\n\n22:48.940 --> 22:53.420\nnewsletter at the end of the day and he's talking about the our missing first\n\n22:53.420 --> 23:00.500\nlady and but he kind of interrupted himself because his little headline it's\n\n23:00.500 --> 23:07.900\nlike in this newsletter thing okay this story is a talker let me fend off some\n\n23:07.900 --> 23:11.740\nof the criticism I've already seen on social media\n\n23:11.740 --> 23:17.620\nstop you there what are you doing what he's talking a word that I don't know\n\n23:17.620 --> 23:21.380\nwhat that means it's in quotes I think he's gonna I think he's gonna define\n\n23:21.380 --> 23:24.220\ntalker he's gonna say what people are talking about it or he's saying this is\n\n23:24.220 --> 23:29.100\none I talk and you don't get the story is a talker let me fend off so it's like\n\n23:29.100 --> 23:33.580\nhey I'm CNN you should be paying attention to me because I am the news\n\n23:33.580 --> 23:37.980\nanyways first lady's missing hey all right before I continue with this let me\n\n23:37.980 --> 23:42.940\njust explain this isn't the kind of news you get to complain about this is a\n\n23:42.940 --> 23:48.340\ntalker talker is a let me fend off some of the criticism I've already seen on\n\n23:48.340 --> 23:53.940\nsocial media no this is probably not the most important story involving the\n\n23:53.940 --> 23:59.180\ntrumps right now but it's a talker in a way that policy debates and ethics\n\n23:59.180 --> 24:04.180\nscandals and abuse of power allegations are typically not people are genuinely\n\n24:04.180 --> 24:09.380\ncurious about this and concerned about her\n\n24:10.260 --> 24:17.180\nwhat what are you doing I mean wait that's that's more news that paragraph\n\n24:17.180 --> 24:22.620\nCNN is more newsworthy than does anybody in the audience know that term a talker\n\n24:22.620 --> 24:26.980\nand what that actually means I think he's just in die he's indoctrinating us he's\n\n24:26.980 --> 24:31.300\nsaying shut the fuck up and let me like it's a talker no the context is like it's\n\n24:31.300 --> 24:36.620\na talker talking about it's like a squeaker yeah but nobody but he said\n\n24:36.620 --> 24:39.380\nthe other things weren't talkers and those are things that people are also\n\n24:39.380 --> 24:42.900\ntalking about more than his yeah that was a stupid thing to have said and he\n\n24:42.900 --> 24:49.580\nsaid it right but then then there's a second paragraph it goes at the same\n\n24:49.580 --> 24:55.100\ntime as I said on Sunday's reliable sources I think there's a risk of some\n\n24:55.100 --> 24:58.940\nliberals falling into a conspiracy theory trap here by assuming the worst about\n\n24:58.940 --> 25:03.980\nwhat's going on we need less speculating more reporting right like no like less\n\n25:03.980 --> 25:08.940\nheadlines saying that the first lady's missing maybe yeah this is no time for\n\n25:08.940 --> 25:19.380\nabuse of relationship is this why don't you just just give me a script about how dumb I am and I'll read the\n\n25:19.380 --> 25:27.220\nI'm dumb like a sorry CNN like I feel like I owe this news and apology now what\n\n25:27.220 --> 25:31.380\ndid you just do what you think is news and I'll watch you or not is this story\n\n25:31.380 --> 25:36.420\nabout how we're paying attention to Melania missing wrong yeah it's not we're\n\n25:36.420 --> 25:40.620\nnot doing it the perfect way but but but also don't jump down my throat for\n\n25:40.620 --> 25:43.820\nbringing it to you because this fucker's a talker because he is doing it the\n\n25:43.820 --> 25:47.940\nperfect way and you need to just you need to just listen it's a talker you\n\n25:47.940 --> 25:51.180\nneed to take this shit to your water cooler but when you do don't flip the\n\n25:51.180 --> 25:57.860\nfuck out you libtards don't start don't start going on crazy and we're in tin\n\n25:57.860 --> 26:06.220\nfoil hats about it we're just gonna talk about it it's time to talker it's a talker I just I just I'm\n\n26:06.220 --> 26:09.900\noverwhelmed exhausted with like I there's so much conversation because it comes up\n\n26:09.900 --> 26:15.460\nto me more as a think piece this isn't a thinker it's not a thinker not a thinker\n\n26:15.460 --> 26:19.940\nthis is definitely that's what it is a talker you don't got to think about it\n\n26:19.940 --> 26:26.340\nyou just got to talk and talk and talk and talk I feel like I in this time of\n\n26:26.340 --> 26:29.820\nlike more information per second being more overwhelming and stuff like I\n\n26:29.820 --> 26:34.580\nwhere I feel like there's an increasing amount of bandwidth being spent on us\n\n26:34.580 --> 26:39.540\ntalking to each other about how we should be perceiving right which is even\n\n26:39.540 --> 26:47.580\nextra insane because the it's like it's like it's like well the objective\n\n26:47.580 --> 26:51.340\ninformation would be the cure to all this like we could eat it's right within\n\n26:51.340 --> 26:55.660\nour grasp it could be like oh let's just be objective because we're getting a\n\n26:55.660 --> 26:59.300\nlittle too subjective but we don't want to do that so we're just like doubling\n\n26:59.300 --> 27:02.620\ndown on the subjectivity and we keep going like all right now don't start\n\n27:02.620 --> 27:06.700\nperceiving this the wrong way and don't normalize this right tell me what to\n\n27:06.700 --> 27:12.580\nnormalize you're you're normal you're the TV telling me not to normalize this is\n\n27:12.580 --> 27:17.020\ncrazy yeah it's I don't know if tone policing is the right word but it's\n\n27:17.020 --> 27:20.860\ndefinitely like the media being all like here's how you should think and it\n\n27:20.860 --> 27:25.340\nshouldn't be critically of me yeah and it's like well that's what everyone bad\n\n27:25.340 --> 27:30.300\ndoes yeah tone policing did we coin it well I don't I mean tone policing is\n\n27:30.300 --> 27:34.060\nits own thing it's probably like a Venn diagram so I don't know it might be\n\n27:34.060 --> 27:37.540\nwrong to label it but it sounds like you're here to talk about that let's\n\n27:37.540 --> 27:41.100\nbring out Don Lemon everybody Don Lemon\n\n27:41.100 --> 27:48.620\nI thought I thought you had talked to Brandon about doing an impression.

I'm gonna be honest. I came to watch tonight. I got so big. I'm sitting back there.\n\n39:43.820 --> 39:49.620\nI'm sitting back there. I got a piece of pizza. We saw you come from backstage. I'm sweating balls right now because I'm so high.\n\n39:49.620 --> 39:56.940\nI feel as though I've taken the energy in another direction. But I'm fucking good with it.\n\n39:56.940 --> 40:05.740\nDid you see? Did you see? You guys started making black jokes. I had to run on stage. I don't know what the fuck is going on.\n\n40:05.740 --> 40:22.540\nJeff is viciously anti-pot. Shit. Listen. Hey, everybody. Everybody. Hide.

But I just want you to know that\n\n41:50.420 --> 41:55.060\nthe longer it takes to do these two little bits, actually the less we have to do.\n\n41:55.060 --> 42:03.140\nI know, I know. So it is, it is, it's awesome. So I mean, and don't get me wrong, it's very comedic\n\n42:03.140 --> 42:09.060\nfor you to be begrudging about this and don't lose that. But what I'm saying is this is great.\n\n42:09.060 --> 42:18.340\nThis is all great. Yeah. Spencer, next week, please wear a black shirt and just, and do this.\n\n42:22.340 --> 42:28.980\nLike the beginning of Zarda is just kind of, oh yeah. We have to get it, we can chip in a little\n\n42:28.980 --> 42:33.860\nbit of our Harmontown Money and get a crystal ball on that fucking table. I know. I slowly want\n\n42:33.860 --> 42:38.500\nhim to become inside the crystal ball. What if we, what if we got a green screen? They just were\n\n42:38.500 --> 42:43.620\nan all green suit. And so like I'm just literally a floating head. Yeah, you wouldn't even have to show\n\n42:43.620 --> 42:53.540\nup. Yeah. What if at the end of a 12 episode run here, Spencer was like, I think this is my last\n\n42:53.540 --> 42:59.940\nepisode. I've done everything I want to do. And then he got up and under the table were 12 dead babies.\n\n43:01.620 --> 43:05.300\nAnd then, and then he had, he had, he had broken their necks\n\n43:08.180 --> 43:15.380\nfor 90 minutes each. And each, each, each one was a,\n\n43:15.380 --> 43:22.660\noh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, each one had a different Zodiac sign.\n\n43:26.820 --> 43:34.660\nSo you went to therapy and you're all better now. No, no. Well, are these mind blowers? Did you,\n\n43:34.660 --> 43:39.780\ndid you blow your therapist's mind or did you get your mind blown by the therapist? Mind blown.\n\n43:39.780 --> 43:48.100\nOh, okay. Okay. We want to hear these. Yeah. So here's the how many do we have? How many,\n\n43:48.100 --> 43:53.380\nhow many we can count this down? How many? Just one. This is the latest. We can still count it down.\n\n43:55.380 --> 44:03.860\nAnd now the top one mindblower from Dan's therapist starting at number one.\n\n44:03.860 --> 44:11.780\nThe concept of want versus willing. So\n\n44:14.260 --> 44:22.260\nso her example was, well, I want world peace. I'm willing to be nice to dickheads today.\n\n44:22.900 --> 44:27.540\nYou know, like, you can have an internal dialogue, like, what are you willing to do?\n\n44:27.540 --> 44:35.060\nLike, kind of, it's kind of blown my mind. Like, I've applied it to writing and I was,\n\n44:35.060 --> 44:40.580\nexample, I was, I was packing my stuff for a Palm Springs trip and I got out of the shower.\n\n44:40.580 --> 44:43.300\nI looked at my toenails. I was like, well, those could use a trim.\n\n44:44.580 --> 44:49.460\nBut what were you willing to do? And then I was like, I was like, well, I'll probably put that\n\n44:49.460 --> 44:52.900\noff. I'm going to pack later. I'll pack last minute. And then I'm going to be like rushing to\n\n44:52.900 --> 44:57.700\nclip my toenails. And then I just a voice in my headset. Are you willing to clip your toenails\n\n44:57.700 --> 45:04.100\nright now? The answer was yes, of course, because it kind of forces a dialogue or you like,\n\n45:04.100 --> 45:07.860\nyou kind of like high road yourself. You're like, are you willing to clip your toenails?\n\n45:07.860 --> 45:13.060\nWhat kind of villain says no? No, I'm not willing to clip my toenails.\n\n45:15.060 --> 45:20.500\nOkay, well, then we're, we're at an impasse, as the French would say. I or as the British\n\n45:20.500 --> 45:25.780\nwould call it an impasse. Or as the Mexicans would call it as regular standoff.\n\n45:33.780 --> 45:36.580\nI'm only upset with that joke that I didn't think of it.\n\n45:40.900 --> 45:45.540\nI have a question. What, what is this internal voice? Is it your voice?\n\n45:45.540 --> 45:50.420\nOr is it George Carlin? George Carlin. That's great. How'd you get that? I've been trying.\n\n45:50.420 --> 45:55.860\nIt's amazing. Oh, you don't have to pay for it. It's, it's a common creative license.\n\n45:55.860 --> 46:00.260\nWhat do you call it? Creative Commons license. What, what, what, what if your internal voice\n\n46:00.260 --> 46:03.300\nsounded a little bit like Billy Idle? What would that sound like?\n\n46:03.300 --> 46:16.260\nOh, well, are you willing to clip your toenails? With a scream and a shout and you clipped your\n\n46:16.260 --> 46:20.020\ntoenails with the blood of the altar.\n\n46:20.020 --> 46:31.860\nI always, I always forget he's Hawaiian.\n\n46:34.740 --> 46:40.820\nI think that's cool. I mean, I, I know you like, I always feel like my internal monologue is like,\n\n46:40.820 --> 46:44.420\noh, I want to do this and this and this. And then I come up with a bunch of excuses,\n\n46:44.420 --> 46:48.980\nbut it's like, you can say you want all sorts of things that you're never going to put forth\n\n46:48.980 --> 46:53.380\nany effort for, but then you convince yourself that you are kind of, but there's good reasons.\n\n46:53.380 --> 46:57.060\nBut being able to differentiate that is like, it's an important distinction.\n\n46:57.060 --> 47:02.660\nYeah. Cause it, it slows down time. Like, it's funny how procrastination moves at the speed of\n\n47:02.660 --> 47:09.620\nlight. Like you in one fell swoop will get an entire day's work worth non-working done\n\n47:09.620 --> 47:15.060\nat the very top of the day by simply going, what do I want to write a perfect script?\n\n47:15.060 --> 47:17.380\nRight. Well, that's not going to fucking happen today.\n\n47:17.380 --> 47:21.940\nSo nothing's going to happen today. So instead, it's like, what are you willing to do?\n\n47:21.940 --> 47:29.220\nWrite 10 pages or write, like my thing is I'm willing to write for four hours if it's easy.\n\n47:29.780 --> 47:35.300\nLike I'm willing to not stop typing. Yeah. My therapist is like, slow down, Charlie. I'm like,\n\n47:35.300 --> 47:40.660\nwhoa, like racist. And like she, she was a nom and she's always,\n\n47:43.140 --> 47:47.140\nno, she's, she's like, I'm like, no, you don't get it. Like if I just fucking thought I could\n\n47:47.140 --> 47:50.740\njust type, type, type, type, type, you know, just spitting it, then, but it's like, you're,\n\n47:50.740 --> 47:54.420\nyou're trying to adapt Vonnegut and it's like, oh, it's got to be good or something. And it's\n\n47:54.420 --> 47:58.900\nlike, then nothing's going to get done. But what am I willing to do? I'm willing to do a bad job\n\n47:58.900 --> 48:03.140\nadapting Vonnegut for four hours. And then I'm like, by the way, no, no, this is applying to the\n\n48:03.140 --> 48:07.620\nVonnegut thing. I'm totally tanking it eating, shitting the bed and about to get fired. Oh,\n\n48:07.620 --> 48:15.700\nyeah, that's right. Yeah. When does it do by like a week ago? Or\n\n48:15.700 --> 48:22.580\nyeah, what's it do? It was due like in 1997. That's what are you going to do with that answer,\n\n48:22.580 --> 48:31.620\nJeff? What are you going to? What is that going to do for you? How do you spell TMZ? Are you texting\n\n48:31.620 --> 48:36.340\nDan's agent? No, I know, church, church just texted me and she goes, they just found Melania\n\n48:36.340 --> 48:45.220\ntwo hours ago. Oh my God. Oh my God. Can we release the confetti? I understand what you're\n\n48:45.220 --> 49:10.580\ntalking about, Dan, because I, for a while, finally, this is all I wanted. This is all I wanted\n\n49:10.580 --> 49:22.180\nfor us to be on the same page. Can we get somebody from like the stage tech department\n\n49:22.180 --> 49:26.820\nto spike with the tape where all of these tables are so this never changes. I want\n\n49:26.820 --> 49:32.340\nmini podium and a little pizza table. I really do like this. It's fun. I like this stage arrangement.\n\n49:32.340 --> 49:43.780\nHey, do you think, do you think Spider-Man gets bummed out when people call him Webhead?\n\n49:46.820 --> 49:52.580\nI mean, like, it's been around for a while. You know, Doc Ock goes, Webhead, do you think he's\n\n49:52.580 --> 49:58.820\nlike, it's not funny. Stop it. That make any sense. Does he get pissed off? I mean, like,\n\n49:58.820 --> 50:03.060\nbecause they're not letting it go. I mean, we can't tell because he's got the mask on,\n\n50:03.060 --> 50:09.620\nbut I bet he's a little like, I don't understand because he's webbed all over my body. He's\n\n50:09.620 --> 50:14.660\ncanonically hilarious. That's like one of his big traits of Spider-Man. He's like this fucking\n\n50:14.660 --> 50:20.980\nhilarious, wisecracking guy. Right. So like, he would be all like, Yeah, no, that's hack. But would\n\n50:20.980 --> 50:25.380\nhe be all like, Oh, yeah, that's like, it's like someone using a shitty insult. It has no power.\n\n50:25.380 --> 50:31.220\nOr would it be like, come on, why is everyone running with this? No, like, this version of\n\n50:31.220 --> 50:36.820\nSpider-Man is, this version of Spider-Man is kind of like, for better or for worse, he's just Iron\n\n50:36.820 --> 50:41.940\nMan Junior, right? Like, I watched the homecoming and it's like, Oh, he's just, he's just, he's just,\n\n50:41.940 --> 50:47.940\nhe's got his little Spider Iron Man suit. Oh, okay. He's a Spider Iron Man now. That's cool.\n\n50:48.580 --> 50:53.460\nYou haven't seen it? No, the Iron Spider. Excuse me.\n\n50:53.460 --> 50:59.300\nWell, what have you seen in haven't seen? I saw Spider-Man.\n\n50:59.300 --> 51:03.300\nRob, Rob, have you seen the quiet place? Rob, did you watch it?\n\n51:03.300 --> 51:04.100\nYeah, yeah, I saw it.\n\n51:04.100 --> 51:06.100\nDid you like those sound boogins?\n\n51:06.100 --> 51:07.380\nI like sound boogins.\n\n51:07.380 --> 51:08.180\nSound boogins.\n\n51:08.180 --> 51:08.580\nFucking come on.\n\n51:08.580 --> 51:09.620\nSound boogins.\n\n51:09.620 --> 51:11.540\nYou got to like them sound boogins. Have you seen that?\n\n51:11.540 --> 51:12.500\nNo, I haven't seen it.\n\n51:17.220 --> 51:19.700\nBrandon, you got anything good in theaters right now?\n\n51:19.700 --> 51:23.780\nYeah. God damn, you're so fucking high. Look at this guy.\n\n51:25.380 --> 51:26.340\nWho are you talking to?\n\n51:26.340 --> 51:28.980\nI've never seen, are you talking to me?\n\n51:28.980 --> 51:32.820\nThe thing is, if you never, if you never told, if you never told anybody, you wear a suit like\n\n51:32.820 --> 51:36.260\nthat and people think, Oh, the only reason you might be high is you forgot to put a tie on tonight.\n\n51:37.380 --> 51:42.100\nYou wear a suit like that and people think he shouldn't be sitting on a cooler with a\n\n51:42.100 --> 51:43.780\npizza box as a table.\n\n51:43.780 --> 51:51.140\nI will tell you that I got into a fight with a guy who was drunk driving who ran me off the road\n\n51:51.140 --> 51:55.780\nand I got out of the car and I was like, I'll fuck you up. And he was too drunk.\n\n51:55.780 --> 51:58.260\nHe got out of his truck and he was super drunk.\n\n51:58.260 --> 52:00.580\nAnd I was like, that's not a fair fight. You can't really.\n\n52:02.020 --> 52:04.740\nThe hand is all back tonight. Thanks.\n\n52:05.540 --> 52:07.060\nAnd he was like, I'll fuck you up.\n\n52:07.060 --> 52:07.700\nAnd he was too drunk.\n\n52:07.700 --> 52:09.220\nAnd I was like, that's not a fair fight.\n\n52:09.220 --> 52:11.140\nI'm not going to punch this guy in the face.\n\n52:11.140 --> 52:14.260\nAnd then I said to him, get the fuck out of here because the cops are going to come and you're\n\n52:14.260 --> 52:19.300\ndrunk. And I have on a suit. And I was stoned out of my ass.\n\n52:20.660 --> 52:25.940\nAnd it was so loud that when the cops rolled up, because it was so loud, so high right now,\n\n52:25.940 --> 52:30.020\nit was so loud that the cops came and I fucking walked over to the cops.\n\n52:30.020 --> 52:35.540\nHigh as a kite was like, officer, this man is inebriated.\n\n52:37.940 --> 52:38.980\nWhen did this happen?\n\n52:38.980 --> 52:41.140\nWhat do you say? This was on the way here.\n\n52:43.940 --> 52:46.900\nWhat? That's crazy.\n\n52:47.780 --> 52:52.260\nWhy are you getting into encounters where you're saying I'll fuck you up to people?\n\n52:52.260 --> 52:53.540\nI'm always a little curious.\n\n52:53.540 --> 52:57.060\nBrandon, Brandon, you want to get out of the car.\n\n52:57.060 --> 52:57.940\nYou want to get out of the car.\n\n52:57.940 --> 52:59.380\nYou want to see what's going on for a second.\n\n52:59.380 --> 53:01.060\nLet's see. Let's see how far it's going to go.\n\n53:03.060 --> 53:04.180\nThat's crazy.\n\n53:04.180 --> 53:06.100\nAll right, really, that took it out of me.\n\n53:06.100 --> 53:09.940\nAnd that's crazy.

That's so crazy that happened today.\n\n53:36.820 --> 53:38.020\nGive me my pizza.\n\n53:40.660 --> 53:41.860\nOh, ain't that a bitch?\n\n53:44.900 --> 53:47.940\nIsn't that just, you know, a perfect metaphor?\n\n53:48.820 --> 53:50.740\nWe for sure talked about this.\n\n53:50.740 --> 53:56.420\nThe album cover for the Fat Boys album where it's them and they're opening a pizza box\n\n53:56.420 --> 54:02.580\nand inside the pizza box is the three fat boys dressed as old-timey convicts\n\n54:02.580 --> 54:07.460\nstealing the fat, giant Fat Boys pizza and they have like...\n\n54:07.460 --> 54:08.980\nIs it all you can eat?\n\n54:08.980 --> 54:13.460\nYeah, and they have like ball and chains on them and they're like,\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:15.700\nwhoa, but they're just like eating.\n\n54:15.700 --> 54:20.500\nThey're like, it's like, oh, they're eating, oh, we're eating our own pizza.\n\n54:20.500 --> 54:22.340\nWe're eating us as pizza.\n\n54:22.340 --> 54:25.940\nAre any of the Fat Boys still with us? Are they all dead?\n\n54:27.940 --> 54:28.740\nI don't know.\n\n54:28.740 --> 54:29.460\nI don't think so.\n\n54:29.460 --> 54:36.820\nI don't think so. Remember when the Fat Boys did the theme song to Nightmare on Elm Street 4?\n\n54:37.380 --> 54:38.020\nYeah.\n\n54:38.020 --> 54:40.260\nThat's when it was really getting scary.\n\n54:41.860 --> 54:46.180\nThe music video where they're like, they're all walking up to the Elm Street.\n\n54:46.180 --> 54:49.940\nI was going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n54:49.940 --> 54:52.820\nAnd then Freddy Krueger comes out, starts rapping.\n\n54:52.820 --> 54:55.940\nYou may be fat, but I've got knives.\n\n54:55.940 --> 54:58.260\nYou better start rapping for your lives,\n\n54:58.260 --> 54:59.300\nbitch.\n\n55:01.380 --> 55:07.540\nAnd this was around the time when horror movies were really getting,\n\n55:07.540 --> 55:09.860\nlike people were like, oh, we got to protect the children.\n\n55:09.860 --> 55:14.420\nProbably they're going to really start being mentally freaked out by that.\n\n55:14.420 --> 55:15.300\nAnd then you're watching it.\n\n55:15.300 --> 55:17.540\nIt's like, this is ridiculous.\n\n55:17.540 --> 55:24.660\nIt's that melted child molester with fingernails walking around with these Fat Boys\n\n55:24.660 --> 55:28.420\nrapping about murdering children.\n\n55:29.300 --> 55:30.340\nCalm down.\n\n55:30.340 --> 55:31.940\nYeah. What's your problem with that?\n\n55:32.500 --> 55:39.860\nAmazingly, that franchise survived the Fat Boys enough to see the Will Smith, the DJ,\n\n55:39.860 --> 55:44.580\nDJ, Jazzy, Jennifer, the Fresh Prince did a Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\n55:44.580 --> 55:48.020\nYeah. Like, let me tell you about the time I was on Elm Street.\n\n55:48.980 --> 55:51.300\nI was like, holy shit, this thing's bulletproof.\n\n55:51.300 --> 55:53.540\nYou can't fucking sell this thing out.\n\n55:53.540 --> 56:04.500\nWell, quote, Freddie Kruger has more authenticity to fucking unload than the executive branch.\n\n56:08.420 --> 56:09.380\nGive it a look.\n\n56:09.380 --> 56:10.660\nGo home tonight.\n\n56:10.660 --> 56:15.060\nCheck out the Fat Boys Nightmare on Elm Street 4.\n\n56:15.620 --> 56:19.780\nThis isn't when they, this, this was considered one of the best ones too.\n\n56:19.780 --> 56:21.300\nOut of the dream warriors.\n\n56:21.300 --> 56:23.620\nNo, Dream Warriors is my favorite.\n\n56:23.620 --> 56:24.420\nThat's Dawkin.\n\n56:24.420 --> 56:25.620\nThat's Dawkin who does that.\n\n56:25.620 --> 56:26.020\nDawkin.\n\n56:26.900 --> 56:28.100\nDawkin fucking rule.\n\n56:29.380 --> 56:30.100\nKind of scary.\n\n56:32.020 --> 56:36.020\nWe went to see Dawkin and they did that song and we fucking shit our brains out on the floor.\n\n56:36.020 --> 56:37.220\nI think they did the whole soundtrack.\n\n56:38.100 --> 56:41.140\nThey did everything and we shit our brains out.\n\n56:41.780 --> 56:43.140\nWe saw Dawkin live.\n\n56:43.940 --> 56:45.220\nWhat, how long ago was this?\n\n56:45.220 --> 56:46.420\nLike about 10 years ago?\n\n56:46.420 --> 56:47.300\nIt was at the House of Blues.\n\n56:47.300 --> 56:48.580\nEasily, easily 12 years ago.\n\n56:48.580 --> 56:49.220\nYeah.\n\n56:49.220 --> 56:50.340\nHouse of Blues.\n\n56:50.340 --> 56:51.220\nWe shit every day.\n\n56:51.220 --> 56:52.580\nThey brought in Lynch, what's his name?\n\n56:52.580 --> 56:53.220\nIs it George Lynch?\n\n56:53.220 --> 56:55.300\nIs it the bass player or no guitar player?\n\n56:55.300 --> 56:58.420\nAnd he came in, they used to hate each other and he got out there and did a guitar solo.\n\n56:58.420 --> 57:00.500\nThat was a fucking just a ball burner.\n\n57:00.500 --> 57:01.140\nIt was so good.\n\n57:01.140 --> 57:02.260\nThis is such a ball burner.\n\n57:02.260 --> 57:03.220\nAll right, all right.\n\n57:04.580 --> 57:07.220\nCome on, keep this fucking sweet train.\n\n57:07.220 --> 57:11.700\nWhat about Bobby Brown's Ghostbusters 2 rap?\n\n57:11.700 --> 57:12.660\nThat one doesn't hold up.\n\n57:13.940 --> 57:16.420\nNo, thank God for someone saying it.\n\n57:18.020 --> 57:19.460\nIt's 2018.\n\n57:19.460 --> 57:21.700\nIt's time to take control.\n\n57:21.700 --> 57:22.500\nLet's get out of this.\n\n57:22.500 --> 57:26.260\nSo I totally sinking into this tape.\n\n57:26.260 --> 57:28.900\nYeah, no, and it's, it will continue.\n\n57:28.900 --> 57:32.020\nI expect to, you know, it'll be above my neck level soon.\n\n57:33.700 --> 57:39.060\nOkay, name a movie that would never have a crazy rap in its soundtrack.\n\n57:39.060 --> 57:40.100\nWild West.\n\n57:40.100 --> 57:40.660\nSilkwood.\n\n57:41.940 --> 57:43.140\nSchindler's List, yo.\n\n57:44.660 --> 57:46.180\nJumanji, Sophie's Choice.\n\n57:46.180 --> 57:53.940\nI heard Silkwood.\n\n57:55.940 --> 57:59.380\nMeryl Streep is a story about nuclear contamination.\n\n58:01.940 --> 58:02.660\nNot Meryl Streep?\n\n58:03.940 --> 58:04.820\nThere's no Meryl Streep?\n\n58:04.820 --> 58:06.660\nYeah, I don't think she should be anywhere.\n\n58:06.660 --> 58:07.940\nMeryl Streep is such a good actress.\n\n58:07.940 --> 58:09.140\nShe plays Cher in that movie.\n\n58:10.980 --> 58:14.980\nI said name a movie and I got like, I got like, I heard like three movies everyone\n\n58:14.980 --> 58:16.740\nknows that are all about the Holocaust.\n\n58:16.740 --> 58:19.860\nAnd then one that's no one knows.\n\n58:19.860 --> 58:22.340\nLet's give you, let's give you a bit more of a lob.\n\n58:24.660 --> 58:24.900\nWhat?\n\n58:25.780 --> 58:26.900\nHaven't, haven't seen it.\n\n58:26.900 --> 58:32.820\nBut okay, I'll, I'll, I'll do the, I'll do the Will Smith rap about Quiet Place.\n\n58:32.820 --> 58:33.860\nZach, you got a beat for that?\n\n58:35.060 --> 58:36.500\nZac McKeever up at the beat house.\n\n58:39.620 --> 58:44.900\nOh, oh, oh, oh, he doesn't do that.\n\n58:44.900 --> 58:54.900\nLet me tell you about the time I was going outside and I was trying to be, keep my mouth\n\n58:54.900 --> 58:55.620\nreal wide.\n\n58:55.620 --> 58:59.300\nBut DJ Jazzy Jeff said, hey, fresh prints.\n\n58:59.300 --> 59:01.380\nYou better put that down, Clef.\n\n59:02.500 --> 59:04.100\nBecause we got to be quiet.\n\n59:04.100 --> 59:06.420\nBecause there's Quiet Place.\n\n59:06.420 --> 59:07.460\nThis isn't going to work.\n\n59:07.460 --> 59:09.140\nThat's like, you can't improvise.\n\n59:09.700 --> 59:11.700\nThat's crazy to think you can improvise that.\n\n59:11.700 --> 59:13.540\nYou, you, you set up the beat though.\n\n59:14.100 --> 59:14.580\nI what?\n\n59:14.580 --> 59:18.660\nI know I did, but my, my, my eyes were bigger than my talents.\n\n59:18.660 --> 59:23.060\nI didn't, you know, that's, because you did a refrain.\n\n59:23.060 --> 59:26.340\nEven like, that's how I knew I wasn't in a quiet place.\n\n59:30.820 --> 59:35.380\nWell, we took off our shoes and we walked on some sand and we had to make sidewalks\n\n59:35.380 --> 59:36.740\nmade of it across the land.\n\n59:36.740 --> 59:39.220\nBut DJ Jeff said, hey, fresh prints.\n\n59:39.220 --> 59:41.860\nWe got to, did not go over there and eat those mints.\n\n59:41.860 --> 59:44.980\nBut I said, okay, I think I'm allowed to do that.\n\n59:44.980 --> 59:48.180\nBut I did it and I was real loud, smack.\n\n59:48.180 --> 59:53.220\nAnd then the big Boogins came out and that's how I wanted to have a quiet place.\n\n59:59.060 --> 59:59.460\nYeah.\n\n59:59.460 --> 01:00:05.380\nThank you for your incredibly condescending polite applause.\n\n01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.980\nIt just goes to show you Boogins just don't understand.\n\n01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:19.140\nThere's a million kinds of applause and that, that's the applause that was like, just finish.\n\n01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.220\nThank you for wrapping it up.\n\n01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:23.700\nYeah.\n\n01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.740\nAnybody see this?\n\n01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.540\nFuck you.\n\n01:00:26.740 -->

a shadow run movie.\n\n01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.420\nSeems like a shadow run.\n\n01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.940\nSeems like a shadow run.\n\n01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.220\nI remember shadow run.\n\n01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.940\nShadow run, you hear about this shadow run in the news lately?\n\n01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.740\nWhat is that?\n\n01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.620\nNo, it's like a weird cyberpunk role-playing game.\n\n01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.100\nNo, but it does though, because it's like,\n\n01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:56.100\nwe love, that's the secret word today, role-playing game.\n\n01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.020\nNo, but like he gets wired reflexes.\n\n01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.420\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.700\nIt's in the, I don't know.\n\n01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.620\nIt just seemed very shadow running and guys like arm turns into a gun,\n\n01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.260\nlike a bunch of like tropes from shadow runner hitting the trailer.\n\n01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.340\nI was like, you want, you want to go see it with me?\n\n01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:10.660\nOkay.\n\n01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.940\nDo they have some of that cyberware?\n\n01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:14.900\nYeah.\n\n01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.540\nYeah, man.\n\n01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.020\nWetware.\n\n01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.700\nThat's all I got.\n\n01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.260\nSorry.\n\n01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.860\nWhat were you guys going to talk about upgrade?\n\n01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.380\nI didn't mean to hijack it.\n\n01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.020\nNo, I haven't seen it, but I heard it's really,\n\n01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.380\npeople are really enjoying it.\n\n01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.220\nThey're really having a good time.\n\n01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:27.940\nOkay, I'll go.\n\n01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:33.060\nAwesome.\n\n01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:33.860\nThat sounds great.\n\n01:01:33.860 -->

he's had a hard life.\n\n01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.140\nMaybe not.\n\n01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.180\nMaybe you shouldn't take him.\n\n01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:44.660\nOkay.\n\n01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:48.660\nIs it, is it, that's the basis you, you, you invite people to a movie on is whether\n\n01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:49.460\nor not they've had a hard life.\n\n01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.100\nIt's 9-Eleven.\n\n01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:56.500\nThe date when the people.\n\n01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.180\nOkay, let me tell you about the time.\n\n01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:03.220\nWe went to New York and we had to arrive when my parents were gone and we see the sites,\n\n01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.820\nbut then two planes came out of there.\n\n01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.780\nWe had a good run here.\n\n01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.500\nHave you checked out the backstage?\n\n01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.620\nThe backstage is groovy.\n\n01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.700\nYeah, there's an

Coleman used to fuck Anton Lavey upstairs back in the 1930s.\n\n01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.820\nHey, I, I, I Wikipediaed this shit before I came here.\n\n01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.580\nHere at the, at

call a place a typewriter.\n\n01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.940\nAnd I look at the, I like it.\n\n01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:06.820\nI like it.\n\n01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.260\nEveryone here likes

ripping people's heads off,\n\n01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.620\nI thought of a segment we could play.\n\n01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.700\nIt's called D&D, motherfucker.\n\n01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.020\nOh, damn.\n\n01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.580\nSchrab, you're staying, Brandon, you're staying.\n\n01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.700\nYou can just chill if you want.\n\n01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.660\nYou don't have to stay, but we would love to have you up here.\n\n01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:58.340\nIt's been a long, bloody time since we've played our D&D campaign.\n\n01:03:58.340 -->

recap?\n\n01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.540\nYeah, I guess it was a little electric avenue, obviously.\n\n01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.540\nRight, Brandon?\n\n01:05:29.540 -->

01:05:49.540\nOh, it's a microphone.\n\n01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.540\nHe scared me for a second.\n\n01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:59.540\nOut in the street.\n\n01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:03.540\nOut in the street.\n\n01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:07.540\nOut in the street.\n\n01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.540\nOh, no.\n\n01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:13.540\nOh, no.\n\n01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.540\nWe're going to rock

--> 01:06:49.540\nOut in the street.\n\n01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.540\nThere is violence.\n\n01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.540\nSomething, something, something.\n\n01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:57.540\nI'm

following...\n\n01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.540\nThere were three white dudes,\n\n01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.540\nand they were following a black guy\n\n01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.540\nwithout a shirt who had long dreadlocks\n\n01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.540\nwho was walking his bicycle,\n\n01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.540\nand they were following him and having a moving argument.\n\n01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.540\nOh, Tommy!\n\n01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.540\nYeah.\n\n01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.540\nAnd so,\n\n01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.540\nI didn't know what the situation was,\n\n01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:51.540\nbut it's always...\n\n01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:53.540\nI had listened to a podcast where someone\n\n01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.540\nwatched as five people just beat the shit\n\n01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.540\nunmercelessly out of this guy,\n\n01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.540\nand it was just horrible,\n\n01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.540\nand so I was like, I don't want to see\n\n01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.540\nthree guys kick the shit out of some guy.\n\n01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.540\nSo I walked over there while...\n\n01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:07.540\nAnd they were yelling and escalating,\n\n01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.540\nand I didn't get there until\n\n01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.540\nthey actually started punching and stuff,\n\n01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.540\nbut everyone was gathering and watching.\n\n01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.540\nThey were knocking coffee at each other.\n\n01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.540\nYeah, they were knocking each other's drinks.\n\n01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.540\nI think the initial altercation\n\n01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.540\nhappened at the coffee bean,\n\n01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.540\nand then someone knocked a drink out of someone's hand,\n\n01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.540\nand then it moved outside,\n\n01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.540\nand the cops were called.\n\n01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.540\nI don't know. Anyway, I get there,\n\n01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.540\nand then they're engaged,\n\n01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.540\nand so I just get as close as I can.\n\n01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.540\nOh, well, that's a nuptial spat.\n\n01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.540\nOh, God. Oh, Jesus.\n\n01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.540\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.540\nWait, so this fight...\n\n01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.540\nWell, that's the thing.\n\n01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:45.540\nIt didn't start as a fight,\n\n01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.540\nbut the three guys were clearly\n\n01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.540\nharassing and threatening the guy\n\n01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.540\nto make him feel uncomfortable,\n\n01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.540\nand he was like, I took you guys...\n\n01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.540\nI took both of your asses on earlier,\n\n01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:57.540\nand I won, and then so then the guy\n\n01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.540\nwas like, you know, come at me,\n\n01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.540\nand then they were trying to\n\n01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.540\nkind of two-at-one go out,\n\n01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:05.540\nnot like tag team, but kind of like\n\n01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.540\nbe ready to catch him off guard and stuff,\n\n01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.540\nand so that was about when I got there.\n\n01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.540\nI was dodging and stuff.\n\n01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.540\nMaybe about three or four punches had been thrown,\n\n01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.540\nbut then I just get up, like,\n\n01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.540\nand one of the guys, like, right behind the guy,\n\n01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.540\nand then I'm like, hey, can we stop fighting?\n\n01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.540\nLet's please stop fighting.\n\n01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.540\nCan we not stop fighting?\n\n01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.540\nCan you stop fighting? Stop fighting.\n\n01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.540\nAnd then they're like, oh, no,\n\n01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.540\nyou got witnesses here, knock it off, man.\n\n01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.540\nWe're the victims he sees, and I'm like,\n\n01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.540\nyou guys are idiots. Just stop.\n\n01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.540\nCome on, knock it off.\n\n01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.540\nAnd then he's like, no, this guy's wrong,\n\n01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.540\nand then I walked away because they weren't\n\n01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.540\nactively, like, looking to get in a punch\n\n01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.540\nat that point because I was, I don't know,\n\n01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.540\nthe thing is you get worked up into this\n\n01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.540\nspell of violence and rage, and, like,\n\n01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.540\nit's very easy to break it, but, like,\n\n01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.540\nyou don't see anything outside of that bubble\n\n01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.540\nwhen you're in it, so, like, I feel like\n\n01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.540\nI just, like, distracted them enough,\n\n01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.540\nand then, um, yeah, I heard the sirens,\n\n01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.540\nand I started walking away, and then a police guy,\n\n01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.540\nlike, pulled a big U-turn and, like,\n\n01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.540\nstopped them, and then the guy,\n\n01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:05.540\nthe black guy, he, like, ran to the place\n\n01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.540\nand so, and then I was like, I'm out,\n\n01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.540\nI don't want to answer any questions.\n\n01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.540\nAnd did the, and when the police started\n\n01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.540\nto beat him,\n\n01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.540\nthat was, that was definitely\n\n01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.540\nmy worry.\n\n01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.540\nHe seemed, he seemed willing\n\n01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.540\nto go to the police, and so I was like,\n\n01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.540\nwell, the police was probably really in trouble.\n\n01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.540\nWhen the police show up and there's a black guy\n\n01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.540\nthere, that's a great time for all the witnesses,\n\n01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.540\njust to scatter.\n\n01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.540\nThere was a lot of witnesses,\n\n01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.540\nthere was just no one who was breaking up the fight.\n\n01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.540\nWhat Spencer didn't know is that\n\n01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.540\nI was in the optometrist\n\n01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.540\nwhere this was all happening,\n\n01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.540\nand I'm, and the fight\n\n01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.540\nwas happening in the front window where\n\n01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.540\neverybody in the\n\n01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.540\natometry building was looking out the window\n\n01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.540\ngoing, oh, like,\n\n01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.540\nopening up the door, like, a half...\n\n01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.540\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.540\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.540\nGoing, hey, stop, stop fighting.\n\n01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.540\nStop fighting, stop fighting, yeah.\n\n01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.540\nAnd me and Randall Park's brother\n\n01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.540\nsitting there going, dude, what's going on?\n\n01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.540\nWe should do something, yeah.\n\n01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.540\nWe should probably do something.\n\n01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.540\nIsn't that, isn't that Spencer\n\n01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.540\nacross the street?\n\n01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.540\nYeah, he's, he looks like he's about to cross\n\n01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.540\nthe street, and meanwhile I was like,\n\n01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.540\nI'm gonna fuck you up.\n\n01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.540\nAnd so I watched,\n\n01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.540\nand Spencer had no idea that I\n\n01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.540\nwas living in his world.\n\n01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.540\nI didn't want to say one thing, the only thing,\n\n01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.540\nyou were telling this story and you were narrating\n\n01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.540\nfor the guy who said like, hey, I took\n\n01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.540\ntwo of you guys out for coffee.\n\n01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.540\nThis isn't,\n\n01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.540\nthis isn't how I pictured this\n\n01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.540\nafternoon going.\n\n01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.540\nAnd then\n\n01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.540\nthe third guy's like, well, you should\n\n01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.540\nhave gone with my bid.\n\n01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.540\nThey're all architects.\n\n01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.540\nAll right, Spencer, do you think\n\n01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.540\nyou can recap, like,\n\n01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.540\nD&D from years gone by?\n\n01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.540\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.540\nYou guys done for that at all?\n\n01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.540\nYeah.\n\n01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.540\nYou guys done for that at all?\n\n01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.540\nNo.\n\n01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.540\nNo.\n\n01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.540\nNo.\n\n01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.540\nI heard one voice of dissent.\n\n01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.540\nAll right, where's the music?\n\n01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.540\nSpencer, you want some music for this?\n\n01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.540\nOr do you want to do it in acapella?\n\n01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:17.540\nI don't care, man.\n\n01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.540\nCome on, hero.\n\n01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.540\nCome on, hero.\n\n01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.540\nYeah, man.\n\n01:13:23.540 -->

01:13:49.540\nAll right.\n\n01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.540\nSo the gang was on\n\n01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.540\na mission to find\n\n01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.540\nthis gem.\n\n01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.540\nThey were searching around\n\n01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.540\nand they were finding some clues.\n\n01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.540\nThey kidnapped a guy to get more clues,\n\n01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.540\nbut they didn't really find any clues\n\n01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.540\nfrom that guy.\n\n01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.540\nAnd then, what's his name?\n\n01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.540\nDiarrhea Jr.\n\n01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.540\nHe started snooping around on his loan,\n\n01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.540\nbut he got in over his head\n\n01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.540\nand before he knew it, he was kidnapped\n\n01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.540\nand locked somewhere.\n\n01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.540\nSo our heroes went to save him\n\n01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.540\nand they found him.\n\n01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.540\nDid something happen?\n\n01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.540\nOkay.\n\n01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.540\nThey found him and it was fun,\n\n01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.540\nbut they had to fight.\n\n01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.540\nThere was a fight.\n\n01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:33.540\nThey were fighting.\n\n01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.540\nThey're still fighting.\n\n01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.540\nThey got to save\n\n01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.540\nDJ from the evil\n\n01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.540\nactor's\n\n01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.540\nguild.\n\n01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.540\nNow\n\n01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.540\non Harmontown.\n\n01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.540\nAll right.\n\n01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.540\nI'd like to pretend I heard more of that\n\n01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.540\nthan I did because I was handing out the character sheets,\n\n01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.540\nbut I think I'll be all

And the\n\n01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:41.100\nway I'm going to do it is, magically, with a spell I like to call, uh, inflict light\n\n01:31:41.100 --> 01:32:03.660\nwounds. It sounds, uh, it's, uh, it's bite is worse than it's bark. All right. And you're\n\n01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:08.700\ngoing for the gun guy. Yeah. There's only one guy in the room. Is he going to go for\n\n01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:16.180\nus? What do you have to ask that question? Yes. All right. You do it. Your hands crackle\n\n01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:24.620\nwith fell energies as you touch into his body. Thou shall do harm. You can feel the shock\n\n01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:30.260\nof the spell release. It feels like a very powerful electric spark and it's, it's crazy.\n\n01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:35.300\nYou could just see instantly his flesh just starts necrotizing and sizzling like the whole\n\n01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:43.020\nside of his body goes black and that's, he's all messed up. Like, uh, he's really bad.\n\n01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:46.820\nWhile that's happening, I want to Captain America throw my shield at him. Just whip\n\n01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:54.460\nit at him really fucking hard. All right. You do that. You hit him in the teeth. You get\n\n01:32:54.460 --> 01:33:01.740\nhim for six damage. Nice. A teeth damage hurts. I do it. Can I go? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I do\n\n01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:06.060\na slam attack. Multi, multi slam attack. How much damage, what's your, what's the, how\n\n01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:15.820\nmuch damage does it do? Oh, so much. Uh, uh, plus eight. No, the dice is like 2d something.\n\n01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:29.300\nUh, you fucking nerd. Yeah, 2d six plus five plus grab. Awesome. So I slam and grab him.\n\n01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:40.540\nAll right. You hit him for eight damage with your, with your meaty paw. Yeah. Okay. Veggie\n\n01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:47.900\npaw. Now it happens. Yeah. Now it, now it happens. My turn. Um, he, he pulls out his\n\n01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:55.500\ngun and, uh, he shoots it. He shoots it at Steve and it's like click, click, click, click,\n\n01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:02.820\nclick. Like it's empty. Damn, dude. And then he throws it at Steve. What? It's a critical hit.\n\n01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:09.340\nCan I catch it? Yeah, sure. You can catch it. I want to catch that gun. All right. It hits\n\n01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:15.580\nyou in the face for five damage. Ow. And then you catch it. You caught it with your face.\n\n01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:20.060\nAll right. I still got it. I whip it right back at his face. Okay. Well, it's not your\n\n01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:27.020\nturn, but you could do that. Um, then at the same time, you see the, the corpse of the, uh, one\n\n01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:32.100\nof the guys you killed, he kind of like magically kind of lifts up onto his feet. It's very\n\n01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:36.820\ndisturbing, you know, almost like a puppet being raised by its strings. And you can see\n\n01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:42.420\nhe's been like sliced in half by when he exploded, but it kind of like, you could see his sinews\n\n01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:46.780\nkind of coming back together and then he crawls up onto the ceiling and he starts hissing.\n\n01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:50.580\nWhich guy? Which guy is this? He, okay. So you might not remember him because this is\n\n01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:56.180\nway back when, but one of the three guys had a big like robot juggernaut arm kind of thing.\n\n01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:02.980\nAnd he went as to punch you and immediately just exploded because his arm exploded. But,\n\n01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:06.980\nbut now he's, he's seemingly come back from the dead and is hissing on the ceiling like\n\n01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:16.340\na cockroach. What a feeling. When you're hissing on the ceiling.\n\n01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:30.100\nMan, I'm going to engulf him. All right, let's go back to the shack then.\n\n01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:34.500\nFuck yeah. This is a bear shack? Yeah, you're a tree with more bark.\n\n01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:38.060\nAll right, who's, who's, who's, who's charnaces? It's you, you're a tree more bark.\n\n01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:41.060\nAll right, I've been waiting to use this spell for a good old time. Do I have another spell\n\n01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:44.060\non me right now? It depends on the spell level.\n\n01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:48.860\nIt's a first level. One, two. Yeah, I think maybe you have a one left.\n\n01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:55.820\nOkay, I cast magic fang, which gives my, gives one natural weapon of my subject creature.\n\n01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:59.540\nHe gets a plus one attack. So I can make his claws or his teeth.\n\n01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:01.660\nRight. You get a plus one. Yeah.\n\n01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:07.940\nSo I just beefed up the bear. The bear gets magic fangs. You feel a magical\n\n01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:16.820\nsharpness embody your parts. Oh, the sharpness. I'm still going to do\n\n01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:24.940\ndamage. Oh, I like this. I feel more bad.\n\n01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:32.140\nI turn over to the bear. First off, we never, we never exchange names.\n\n01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:42.540\nOh, I'm Chad. What's your name? Bear me back. Yeah. That's our show.\n\n01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:48.220\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Bear me back.\n\n01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:56.020\nHow long were you sitting on that joke, Brandon? 10 years old.\n\n01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:59.780\nBear me back. And not only did your fangs just get sharper because I'm a druid who has\n\n01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:02.380\nmade your teeth a little sharper. Thank you.\n\n01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:05.740\nWhen you attack, I think you'll find out. Remember all that crazy noise that you made\n\n01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:09.020\nwhen you were attacking earlier? It gets me going.\n\n01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:13.300\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Well, this gets a little weirder.\n\n01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:21.220\nAlso, also, sometimes the bear goes into a little burning max standup in the middle\n\n01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:26.220\nof the attack. Oh, oh, oh, bees, bees, bees. You're not going\n\n01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:30.220\nto get me on that, honey. You're going to get me on that, honey.\n\n01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:35.740\nGive me something to sum, bitch, honey. I bite your face off.\n\n01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:45.020\nI bite your sum, bitch, face off. Okay.\n\n01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.580\nNow you still got to go attack this dude. I'll attack this mother fuck.\n\n01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:50.780\nYou ain't going to tell me not to attack no mother.\n\n01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:53.420\nI'm attacking right now. I'll walk up to his front door.\n\n01:37:53.420 --> 01:38:00.420\nI'll attack his front door, man. I'll attack his mama.\n\n01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:04.420\nOkay, hold on. All right.\n\n01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:11.420\nThis is a critical measurement of our attack. It's not. It's better than that.\n\n01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:23.380\nIt's damaged. All right. You smash him in the face with\n\n01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:28.340\na bear paw and then you hit him on the other side of his head, so you're holding him in\n\n01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:33.380\nthe head and then you moll his face. It's great. You deal 24 damage.\n\n01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:39.380\nOh, yeah. Bernie Mac.\n\n01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:47.500\nAll right. He's like flailing around and as his face is being hit eating, he like lashes\n\n01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:51.660\nout and he hits you with a bat and both of you poof and go outside and now you're somewhere\n\n01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.660\nelse. But as that happens, you finished eating his face.\n\n01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.180\nSo he's dead now. But we're outside.\n\n01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:04.580\nWell, not you. You're inside and you're a tree.\n\n01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:07.380\nSo if the cops come, I'm in trouble. Yeah.\n\n01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:10.980\nFucking Bernie Mac's just chilling outside.\n\n01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:14.220\nHe's with the corpse though. Oh, he's back with the other dude.\n\n01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.700\nYeah, he teleported. No, well, he's in a third location.\n\n01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:26.740\nOh, it's fun. In the underground place, also, the guy's still hissing on the ceiling and\n\n01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:32.620\nthe other guy doesn't have a gun because Steve caught it.\n\n01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:36.900\nAm I grabbing him still? Which? No.\n\n01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:40.140\nYou tried to grab him and failed. I didn't call that out, but...\n\n01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:45.380\nOkay. Well, thanks for telling me. Well, I did not say that you grabbed him.\n\n01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:51.180\nReally? Well, I suppose I have no choice.\n\n01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:57.980\nI've got to summon the level of monster that I'm allowed to.\n\n01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:04.900\nProbably my ward. All right, summon monster one.\n\n01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:08.980\nI'd like to summon a monster of the kind that can climb walls.\n\n01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:15.980\nI hope there's an ant in there, maybe. An ant?\n\n01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:22.300\nI think I feel that there's an ant. An giant ant, my favorite kind.\n\n01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:25.100\nDoes it have to be giant? It does, yeah.\n\n01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:28.460\nYou're going to want it to be. You love those big ants.\n\n01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:31.580\nCheck this out. You like that ceiling?\n\n01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:43.020\nI forget. What's your race in class again, Dan?\n\n01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:52.940\nI don't see the world through that lens.\n\n01:40:52.940 --> 01:41:00.060\nI am a human, size medium, gender medium.\n\n01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:05.940\nHe's a class human. He's a cleric.\n\n01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:14.100\nCarry on. Antimum summonum.\n\n01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:20.300\nAll right, you do that. The ant feverishly comes out of another dimension\n\n01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:23.340\nand climbs up a wall and then onto the ceiling.\n\n01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:28.180\nAnd you can see his powerful mandibles snap the guy right on the foot\n\n01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:32.740\nwith his jaws and leg scissors. They just snip his foot clean off\n\n01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:36.620\nand it falls to the floor. Yikes.\n\n01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:43.540\nHe hisses more screamingly. Someone else.\n\n01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:48.300\nI engulf what's left of him. He's on the ceiling?\n\n01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:52.060\nYeah. You can't reach.\n\n01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:55.460\nWhat? You can't reach. What if I jumped?\n\n01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:58.340\nYou can try that, but you might fail.\n\n01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:03.300\nWell, you're going to try a jumping engulf.\n\n01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:06.820\nYeah, what are we playing at here? Why not?\n\n01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.220\nWhat are we trying to do here?\n\n01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:11.660\nYeah. I just ate lightning with my body.\n\n01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:15.660\nI think I can do this. Okay.\n\n01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:21.620\nI do a jump. I do like a, I do a, I roll up and a fall,\n\n01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:29.100\nbut then I jump and I'm like, wow. And I like throw myself at him to engulf him.\n\n01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.380\nAnd? All right. Does it work?\n\n01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:37.220\nYou jump up there after rolling up into a ball to like gather potential energy\n\n01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:42.100\nand you hit him, but you just barely graze him, so.\n\n01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:45.220\nIt's not even a slam? No, it missed as a slam.\n\n01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:48.620\nI see that as a success. We didn't think you were going to make it.\n\n01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:52.460\nDidn't even think you were going to touch him. Thank you.\n\n01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:55.580\nThank you. It's, it's, you know, I mean, you're not going to get anywhere.\n\n01:42:55.580 --> 01:43:01.500\nAnd like, if you don't try, you miss every 100% of the chances you don't take, right?\n\n01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.980\nThat's what they say. Oh, yeah.\n\n01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:09.820\nActually, Wayne Gretzky. Oh, God.\n\n01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:17.340\nKnow the room. Wayne Gretzky.\n\n01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:19.660\nWhat? What are you talking about?\n\n01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:23.980\nDoes that do one damage to everyone else in my deck?\n\n01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.740\nI don't know anything about magic. What Deep Space Nine episode was he in?\n\n01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:32.540\nWhat's that? What's, what's, what's that new red skull chain attack?\n\n01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:37.020\nChain Roller Goblin. It's a rare from Dominaria.\n\n01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:39.900\nYeah, that's what we're saying. Make sure you update your decks.\n\n01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:43.740\nIt's got first strike.\n\n01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:47.340\nYou can deal one damage to every other character in the other guy's deck.\n\n01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:51.580\nOh man. Ran him up red is going to infect this meta. I tell you what,\n\n01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:55.260\nstandards not going to be the same after Chain Roller Goblin comes through.\n\n01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:58.300\nAre we still playing? Yeah, more or less.\n\n01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:03.500\nWhat's happening? In the Sumerian times, I appeared as a great\n\n01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:17.580\nGlorthos. I don't know the real. So, Spence, the gun that I'm holding,\n\n01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:20.940\nit's just totally out of ammo? Uh, yeah. It seems to be empty.\n\n01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:24.060\nYou can't catch lightning in a gun more than one.\n\n01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:27.580\nThat's, it's just out of ammo? Yeah. I can tell, I can for sure tell that.\n\n01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:30.620\nYeah, well, I mean, you could pull a trigger. Okay. And it's empty.\n\n01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:34.300\nSo, it's not like fixable. All right. Well, you don't, I mean, you're not a\n\n01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:37.260\nwizard, so you don't know how to, like, fix a magic thing.\n\n01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:41.660\nLet me look at it. How hard can this be?\n\n01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:46.780\nOkay, I give Gary the gun, and then I charge the guy on the ground with my\n\n01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:49.340\nelvish blade, and I want to, I want to slice his\n\n01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:55.020\nhead clean off. Okay. He doesn't really try and dodge.\n\n01:44:55.020 --> 01:45:01.500\nYou get him. Oh, yeah. What's your strength, boss?\n\n01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:05.740\nUh, it's 18 plus four. Okay. You deal seven damage.\n\n01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:09.660\nYou hit him in the neck. Jesus Christ.\n\n01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:13.820\nIt doesn't go through, but it's real deep and gross. Yeah, describe it to me.\n\n01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:19.100\nWell, it's, it's not like it goes. Look at your biceps. You need to,\n\n01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:26.060\nyou need to walk that talk back. You're scaring people. I'm sorry.\n\n01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:28.940\nI'm sorry. Is the, is the blood shooting everywhere?\n\n01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:33.020\nYeah, it like, it went down instead of like sideways through his neck, so it's\n\n01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:35.900\njust kind of like he's, he's cleft open kind of in his\n\n01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:41.980\ncollarbone area, and he's just spewing. I stop examining the lightning gun and\n\n01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.220\njust take a step back and go,\n\n01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:51.100\nI mean, I just met you guys, but I mean, you were beating up this\n\n01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:56.620\ntied up person in my living room like earlier today, and now you're, you're\n\n01:45:56.620 --> 01:46:02.540\ncutting people's necks. I don't know. I'm just, I, I,\n\n01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:06.380\nthis is all being said with my face, because we're, this is all happening so\n\n01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:10.060\nfast, but my expression is like,\n\n01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:15.260\nI mean, I mean, like if you, if you gave me a\n\n01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:19.260\nglance, you would probably go, he's questioning\n\n01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:22.620\nthe, the, what is going on. You know what I mean?\n\n01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:25.980\nYeah. You know, like when you were, you would be in a room,\n\n01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:29.180\nyou know, and then somebody says something and everybody laughs, but you\n\n01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:32.620\ndidn't like it. You were like, yeah. You know, like one of\n\n01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.500\nthose, they just kind of like,\n\n01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:41.180\nyeah, yeah. Uh-huh. You're going through all the stuff\n\n01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:46.300\nthat when you retell the story later, you'll, you'll be like, and I'm like,\n\n01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:52.620\nyeah, I was like, and I was like, what the fuck is going on here?\n\n01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:59.340\nI am not, I do not want any part of this, and somebody would say,\n\n01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:05.980\nyou said that? No, I was, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like\n\n01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:13.500\nyeah. So is my blade still in his neck? Yeah, no, I mean, no, it's part of the\n\n01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:17.260\nattack that withdraw the blade and stuff. Okay, okay.\n\n01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:23.580\nBeing made out of plant, the blood is, is, is weird to me, right? It's\n\n01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:27.500\nweird. No, you're a carnivorous plant. If we\n\n01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:33.180\nwater him. But I don't have blood. Feed me. But you eat blood.\n\n01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:41.580\nThank you, Steve. What's happening? I got a little drunk.\n\n01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:46.780\nLittle shop of horse. So I'm like going,\n\n01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:52.380\nis that what I'm doing? Well, I mean, it's your choice, but you're not\n\n01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:56.300\nunused to blood because you're like, you're like a shark. You know, it's like\n\n01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:00.300\nfor your poop or you're a plant, like you wouldn't you be more into poop?\n\n01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:05.580\nNo, I'm not into poop. What's that fertilizer? Like,\n\n01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:09.420\nI'm with Carlos on this one. I think you like poop.\n\n01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:14.860\nNitrogen and carnivorous plants. Just finish killing this guy, okay?\n\n01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:18.940\nAll right. Look, you're boring the DM.\n\n01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:22.780\nSo what's happened with this guy? What's happening with this guy?\n\n01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:26.620\nThe guy on the ceiling, he's been hissing. He was more of a screaming\n\n01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:29.340\nhiss. He jumps down onto the ground and\n\n01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:34.140\ngrabs the guy who was holding a flaming sword before he dies, and he\n\n01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:37.980\nplunges his mouth into his body and starts sucking out his blood, and he\n\n01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:41.740\nlike dries him up, like he sucks him dry like a\n\n01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:45.580\nhusk. And then he just blasts, newly empowered. He\n\n01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:48.700\nlike, he does a shoryuken uppercut and blasts through\n\n01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:53.260\nthe ceiling, shoryuken, while hissing. And then he\n\n01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:56.540\nlike, ninja flips like a crazy vampire out of the building.\n\n01:48:56.540 --> 01:49:01.580\nWhat the fuck? This guy, all while hissing.\n\n01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:03.820\nYeah.\n\n01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:09.020\nA lot thickens. We've not got a single answer on what the fuck is going on\n\n01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:12.460\nanymore. Are we back in the other part with it?\n\n01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:17.100\nMeanwhile in the shack, it's filling with smoke, and your bark is thicker than\n\n01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:23.820\never. All right, can I turn back into a druid\n\n01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:27.820\nmy regular form? 100%. And I want to pick up that fucking\n\n01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:32.300\nteleportation whiffleball bat. I want that. It's not there, it's outside.\n\n01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:36.060\nI walk outside and go get that bat. Okay, you see a bear.\n\n01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:38.940\nHe's eating a corpse.\n\n01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:43.900\nI walk around just kind of testing things out, like just like, I see like a\n\n01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:48.540\nlike a like the edge of the the doorway, and I tap it with the bat just\n\n01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:51.900\ntesting out the properties of this bat. Nothing happens. Okay.\n\n01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:55.020\nI go up to the bat, I go up to the bear, I say, love babe, Bernie Mac,\n\n01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:59.100\nwhen you're done, I gotta say I really appreciate\n\n01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:05.260\nwhat you did. You ate the fuck out of that, dude.\n\n01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:11.420\nStand with me. Let's hold hands. Hold, put your paw on my hand, and I'm gonna take\n\n01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:14.620\nthis bat, and I'm gonna tap us both at the same time with this bat.\n\n01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:18.460\nYou're not gonna hit me with that bat.\n\n01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:20.860\nNo, it's a tap. It's a tap. You're not gonna tap me.\n\n01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.820\nIt's a little tap. You're not even gonna tap me.\n\n01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:27.340\nWhat are you tapping me? I will do it like this. I will do it like that.\n\n01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:31.260\nI will do it with a whiffleball bat.\n\n01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:37.980\nAnd so we hold it, we hold paw and hand, and I do a double tap, and I'm hitting\n\n01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:42.940\nboth of us at the same time. All right, if he can sense to that, sure.\n\n01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:47.660\nRight, that's cool. Yeah, you could try to dodge it.\n\n01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:54.540\nAnyway, you do it. You teleport 20 feet up in the air and fall 20 feet.\n\n01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:58.380\nYour legs hurt, but like you don't take any damage.\n\n01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.820\nAll right, that's my bat.\n\n01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:08.140\nI decide to make amends. Look, I don't know what's going on.\n\n01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.300\nI just tap myself lightly on the head with the bat.\n\n01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:13.740\nYou tell it, you disappear.\n\n01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:22.780\nWhere do I go? All right, you reappear back in the room with\n\n01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:27.340\neveryone, without the bear. Oh, I wanted the bear.\n\n01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:33.100\nI hit myself again. All right, you reappear outside 30 feet in the\n\n01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.980\nair and you fall.\n\n01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:40.460\nNo damage? Not yet. Okay.\n\n01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:48.460\nLike geographically, am I near the bear? Can I see the bear? Is it totally different?\n\n01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:52.060\nYeah, when you were airborne, you could see the bear.\n\n01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:57.820\nI yell, bear any matter, come to the sound of my voice. I haven't quite got the\n\n01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:03.980\nhang of this Wiffleball bat yet. Fall on me. I'll break your fall, your 30 feet in\n\n01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:08.060\nthe air. That happens.\n\n01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:12.700\nDo I land on it? I already landed it, right? Yeah, yeah. All right. What do you say we\n\n01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:19.820\nstop fucking with this Wiffleball bat? So, I mean, you let me finish eating this dude.\n\n01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:25.660\nIs the bat still smeared with poop? Yep, the whole time. Yeah.\n\n01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:30.940\nAll I want in my cinematic mind's eye is for me to come back to the rest of the\n\n01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:35.340\nparty with a bear and a bat covered in poop\n\n01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:38.620\nand not give any explanation about what happened.\n\n01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:45.820\nWell, as it relates to the bat, we didn't have any rabbits to wipe our ass with.\n\n01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:53.980\nI'm putting all these jokes in a book for your grandpa.\n\n01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:57.740\nYou don't come out to hunt, do you? It's another bear joke.\n\n01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:00.540\nYay. All right. So, are we back with the group now?\n\n01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:05.660\nWell, you didn't do anything. I'm trying to walk with the bear back.\n\n01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:09.900\nOh, yeah. No, you walk back. Okay, you walk back in, you wander back in, and\n\n01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:14.940\nyeah, there's a guy screaming and bleeding. It's great.\n\n01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:19.820\nChad's back. Look at the fur on this guy. It's so smooth.\n\n01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:25.900\nIt's so soft. Jesus. I'm sorry.\n\n01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:31.500\nBeautiful. What the fuck is going on?\n\n01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:34.700\nThis is crazy. Where'd you go? I went around.\n\n01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:37.100\nI get everybody. Everybody. Let's huddle up. Get in the circle.\n\n01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.140\nAll right. Well, there's one more enemy left, I think. Oh, there is?\n\n01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:44.620\nYeah. What's in there? Yeah, but he's screaming and bleeding and unarmed.\n\n01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:49.740\nWe should probably take him prisoner, interrogate him.\n\n01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:57.420\nWe've been good at that. Why don't we have him dig his own grave and just...\n\n01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:02.700\nCliff Hanger!\n\n01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:08.700\nThank you all.\n\n01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:12.220\nThank you all for coming down to our first show at the Doomsday Telegraph,\n\n01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:19.900\nwhere this fucking place is called.
