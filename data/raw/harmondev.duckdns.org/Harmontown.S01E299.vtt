WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.960
Tasting, tasting. Hello gang, how's all things going out there? All right. Who has some sidewalk

00:24.960 --> 00:43.960
chocolate? Did I hear a youp from Dave Kline out there? Can we get a universal youp? I think we're

00:43.960 --> 00:51.120
ready to go. Hello, my name is Jeff Bryan Davis. I'm very happy to be back controlling. I know that

00:51.120 --> 00:58.880
we all love Brandon Johnson, but his reign of terror is over. It's my honor to announce once

00:58.880 --> 01:10.880
again from beautiful MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, Harmontown is now in session. Spencer

01:10.880 --> 01:25.440
Crittenden, the Game Master extraordinaire. Did he get thinner or is he farther away from me right

01:25.440 --> 01:33.680
now? Both. Did you get sexy candles? Oh, yeah. I love it. Why don't we bring out just just for

01:33.680 --> 01:57.360
good fun a mayor. Let's call him Dan Harmon. Thank you. Jeff Davis, revoiced. Revoiced. I can talk

01:57.360 --> 02:06.840
again. Yeah. Revoiced. Moist. The larynx is re-moist. Voiced. Maybe I can rap with you. Maybe you

02:06.840 --> 02:18.960
can sing a tune. Maybe I can pee and poop. Maybe I can get a harpoon. Am I a whale? Yes. And I'm a

02:18.960 --> 02:27.840
whaler. Riding on my ship. There she blows. It turns out it took three months to find out you

02:27.840 --> 02:36.880
and I are bad at improv. I'm with the show. Okay. Not like we're going to hurt you. Welcome back,

02:36.880 --> 02:46.880
everybody. It's good to see you all again. I missed you so much. Do you now have, are you like when

02:46.880 --> 02:52.880
our friends have quadruple bypasses and they're like secretly, they're like, I can eat anything now.

02:52.880 --> 02:59.360
I think I'm probably one and a half weeks away from being full like stage voice, but I get to go,

02:59.360 --> 03:06.800
ha, I can do that now. And who didn't miss me going, ha, that's the best part of everything. You

03:06.800 --> 03:14.880
can't do karaoke yet. I could, but I shouldn't. Right. Wait, what you got? Well, you could do,

03:14.880 --> 03:21.680
you could do like George Michael, but not Neil Diamond. No, I could do Neil Diamond.

03:22.400 --> 03:27.840
No, Neil, George Michael, like, well, you could do just the certain parts of George. Well, I guess

03:27.840 --> 03:34.640
it would be nice if I could touch your body. That's like nice and easy. Just give me some hot tea.

03:34.640 --> 03:44.720
That's because you're a tenor. I'm a baritone. I can go money talks. I can sing in the baritone.

03:44.720 --> 03:53.120
You sing more in a tenor. Even though you look like Pavarotti. No, but he's a tenor. So yeah,

03:53.120 --> 03:58.480
there you are. Yeah. What is it? What is a tenor? That's, so that's like, so it goes, it goes all

03:58.480 --> 04:09.280
the way up to 11ers or what is the, it doesn't get any better. See, there's nothing written. So

04:09.280 --> 04:13.680
actually you should be impressed by that. I don't, I'm not saying you have to be. It's just like,

04:13.680 --> 04:20.160
if you're not, it's going to be a long night. But what, what, what key do you think, I'm not going

04:20.160 --> 04:26.400
to play it so we don't get in trouble. What key do you think father figure is in? I don't know,

04:26.400 --> 04:30.880
just like sing it, riff it. I don't know keys. Oh, just start singing it like whatever.

04:33.280 --> 04:43.600
That's all I wanted. Something sacred, something special in your life. For just one moment,

04:43.600 --> 04:54.320
just to be a baby. I don't know. Is that, is that, is that, is that an E? Is that an E sharp?

04:56.160 --> 05:01.920
That's totally E sharp. Yeah. Is there such thing as an E sharp? Or is that F? It might be F.

05:02.640 --> 05:07.440
I know it's like, I know it's like, I know it's A through F. See, I have a thing, my doctor, my

05:07.440 --> 05:13.200
doctor told me that I have to do a thing every day called the, the swelling test where I have a

05:13.200 --> 05:20.880
piano keyboard and I play a note and I have to, I have to find my ceiling. And if I, if I lose

05:20.880 --> 05:28.400
my ceiling by half a step, be quiet for a day. If I lose my ceiling by a whole step, call her

05:28.400 --> 05:34.160
because something bad's happening. But when she first gave it to me, it was G sharp four,

05:34.160 --> 05:42.800
like in the fourth octave. I'm now C five. That's a fucking big jump. I don't know.

05:42.800 --> 05:48.240
Right? Yeah. Dave Kline knows, Dave Kline comes from a family of Dave, can you give me a youp and

05:48.240 --> 05:58.640
see C four? It's a C five. That was F. That was F and you're being a bully.

05:58.640 --> 06:06.320
So okay, I have a question. It comes from two opera singers. I have some questions.

06:06.320 --> 06:14.240
When you get your green screen elliptical, then Dave Kline is wearing a t-shirt and he's got the,

06:14.240 --> 06:18.960
what do you call those things? Kettlebells? Kettlebells. What are you doing, Dave? You're

06:18.960 --> 06:21.920
just, you're lifting kettlebells. This guy's working his ass off and you're just going,

06:21.920 --> 06:26.240
youp, youp. That's not hard. That's harder.

06:32.240 --> 06:36.240
Okay. All right. That scans. That scans. Dave, do you want to come up and talk about the workout?

06:36.240 --> 06:40.240
That's good, Dave Kline up here, everybody.

06:49.040 --> 06:53.840
I just want to narrate that Jeff went for two power moves and without power moves,

06:53.840 --> 06:58.240
both times by Dave Kline. That was an impressive. Good to see you. Thanks for coming on stage.

07:01.120 --> 07:05.520
Am I going to, am I becoming the fat guy in Harmontown? Because everybody now is fucking

07:05.520 --> 07:10.800
fit as a fiddle. I know what the audience is thinking. You didn't have to introduce Dave.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.920
We can tell from looking at him that he's the sculptor of your body.

07:17.280 --> 07:23.520
You scream personal trainer. He also screams shampoo and conditioner.

07:24.560 --> 07:30.080
This guy's hair is fucking magnificent. Look, I got a pretty serious athletic background.

07:30.080 --> 07:36.480
I'm formally trained in the art of yoga. Got a 200 hour certification with the

07:36.480 --> 07:38.960
national yoga alliance. Do yoga work. Shout out to yoga works.

07:40.960 --> 07:47.200
I also have an illustrious swimming career, former state champion, New Jersey representative of the

07:47.200 --> 07:57.360
USA zone competition, Columbia division one swim program, NCAA. YMCA national championship

07:57.360 --> 08:04.480
qualifier. Let's go. I'm also pretty nasty on a pickup basketball court. I know it's a

08:04.480 --> 08:08.800
podcast. It probably isn't podcast gold, but could you could you do a little exercise for us and

08:08.800 --> 08:14.240
show us, like teach us one exercise? Sure. This is a classic exercise that comes from, I think,

08:15.520 --> 08:20.480
I don't know, I think the punk movement really kind of got it down right. But what I think

08:20.480 --> 08:26.160
physiology is all about is movement, power, spirit and linking your energy, mind and physiology into

08:26.160 --> 08:32.480
a reality that you're comfortable with. I miss the show so much. So I'm going to give you one of

08:32.480 --> 08:37.440
my favorite exercises that's ever been ever been done. It's got a shamanic element. It's got a lot

08:37.440 --> 08:43.840
of cardio. Should the whole audience get up and try this with us? Yeah. Oh, I totally, totally

08:43.840 --> 08:47.920
encourage anyone. Bring up as many people as you think should get on stage right now to do this

08:47.920 --> 08:56.240
right now. If I can get seven volunteers, seven is a good number. One, two, three, four, five.

08:59.680 --> 09:04.720
If you've got your hand up, get up here. Get out of here. Come on up here. Now I'm going to give

09:04.720 --> 09:13.840
you an exercise that's not a traditional yoga element. It's a little bit sped up. My name is

09:13.840 --> 09:17.200
Dave. It's nice to meet you. My name is Dave. It's nice to meet you. My name is Dave. It's

09:17.200 --> 09:20.160
really nice to meet you. My name is Dave. It's nice to meet you. Shout out to the Guardians.

09:20.160 --> 09:26.160
I love that. Shout out Dave Kline. Dave Kline. Dave Kline, nice to meet you. Did we get anybody

09:26.160 --> 09:34.160
that's not in the alt right? I don't know. I don't know. We got all of 4chan up here. You're

09:34.160 --> 09:38.480
missing, I think. Let's curve this around. Let's curve out the demographics. Okay. All right. I

09:38.480 --> 09:43.520
didn't see Leon. Hello, ladies. We've got some lady exercises. All right. Now you're going to want

09:43.520 --> 09:49.520
to stagger yourself. So one step back, one step forward. All right. All right. Now we're going

09:49.520 --> 09:58.320
to start out slow because of the music. 4chan work out. Going to watch security video of Chinese

09:58.320 --> 10:08.640
babies dying. Right here. Now you're going to shake it on down. Bring it up halfway. Bring it on back

10:08.640 --> 10:20.640
down. Back up. Hey. Back down. Halfway on up. Now we're going to link the breathing. Exhale down.

10:24.800 --> 10:34.560
Inhale with your arms up now. And down. Exhale. Halfway up. Inhale. Down. Exhale.

10:34.560 --> 10:45.520
Inhale. Lift it on back up. Up, up, up. Inhale. Hold, hold. Break it on down. Freestyle.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.440
Breathe however you want on this freestyle because I'm going to introduce the next one.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.200
Let's hear it for our freestyle yoga expert. Let's hear it for him. Thank you.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.280
All right. Now we're going to speed it up a little bit. We got anything a little bit faster?

10:59.280 --> 11:04.160
Because what I wanted to do is a cardio movement from kind of the punk era. We're going to do

11:04.160 --> 11:08.800
some hip bang. Wait, weren't you just telling us? We're going to head bang. That was what we were

11:08.800 --> 11:15.120
learning. Okay. All right. That movement we just did is an integral part of yoga. It's the beginning

11:15.120 --> 11:21.440
of the sun's salutation. All right. But now we're going to speed it up. Thrash metal long hair.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.840
Furious energetics. All right. Yo yo, but you know what you are going to do? You're going to get all

11:27.840 --> 11:34.160
the blood in your heart to come up to your noggin into your brain. We're going to head bang right

11:34.160 --> 11:40.880
now. All right. It's the same motion as yoga. Just a little faster with a different fulcrum

11:40.880 --> 11:45.840
energetics. So let's take a couple breaths of fire. All right. Take a nice deep inhale.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.240
Hold. Now exhale in like 10 first.

11:50.240 --> 11:56.720
Inhale. 10 short.

11:59.760 --> 12:04.000
That's right. All right. We're getting the energetic going. It starts lighting the fire inside.

12:05.440 --> 12:08.960
Same movement. I'm going to demonstrate where we're going with this. Now it's going to be a little

12:08.960 --> 12:27.360
bit faster. Now that seems dangerous. I guess they're opting out. They're opting out.

12:29.440 --> 12:36.960
Yeah. Most of them have have contacts in. So they're going to finish out. Finish out as we do any

12:36.960 --> 12:48.080
good yoga practice with a cool down. Take a nice deep breath in for three. Hold for three. Nice

12:48.080 --> 12:59.040
exhale out. Look, this world, there's a lot going on energetically, politically, personally, you

12:59.040 --> 13:04.480
know, who knows. I got friends with financial problems that come into a yoga studio. They say

13:04.480 --> 13:11.760
what I need is to just lay down. So here's what you need to do. Lay on down. This is a classic

13:11.760 --> 13:21.040
yoga pose called Savasana, aka corpse pose. Corpse pose. They got names. You're going to lay your

13:21.040 --> 13:27.920
hands down. All right. And now you got a choice here. If you put your palms down on the ground,

13:27.920 --> 13:34.000
you're kind of a closed circuit and you're just kind of staying in your own zone and getting

13:34.000 --> 13:44.640
your energetics kind of properly orbiting your spirit. All right. But on the other hand, come on,

13:44.640 --> 13:51.120
orbit that spirit. You want to receive it. Orbit. You want to launch these planets. You're not

13:51.120 --> 13:57.440
orbiting. No, no, no. But seriously, on the real, if you want to receive a little bit of an energetic

13:57.440 --> 14:04.160
from the universe, palms up. That's all. You have a choice. No, no, on the ground, on the ground.

14:04.160 --> 14:11.600
So legs out straight, everybody. Legs out straight, palms up, and just do three nice browns of four

14:11.600 --> 14:22.480
count in, four count whole, four count out. That's it. Just three of them. All right. Well,

14:22.480 --> 14:27.040
and in the meantime, Dan, how you doing? I'm good. I'm good. Thank you for the folks at home

14:27.040 --> 14:33.040
exercise has been happening. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You might want to rewind, mute the volume and

14:33.040 --> 14:39.280
just think about meundies for three minutes. That's fair. They make a nice undergarment.

14:39.280 --> 14:45.920
And socks. And now onesies. But also think about subscribing to the video version of the podcast

14:45.920 --> 14:51.760
because you could be looking at people laying down. That's right. All right. And when you're

14:51.760 --> 14:56.800
all done, when you're all done, you can bring your knees up to the sky. You can bring yourself

14:56.800 --> 15:03.920
up to a seated position. You can gently rise up with this newly energized spirit. You guys were

15:03.920 --> 15:08.720
fucking phenomenal. I got to thank you for your fucking positivity and going along with a maniacal

15:08.720 --> 15:13.760
session. Let's hear for Dave Kline and the freestyle yoga section and the solid gold yoga

15:13.760 --> 15:19.840
dancers, everybody. Let's hear it from. All right. Everybody get off the stage. Let's hear it from

15:19.840 --> 15:25.520
you guys. It's fantastic. I'm not sure what we accomplished, but I'm sure it was important.

15:25.520 --> 15:38.480
Well, yoga. Oh, popcorn. All right. Yeah. I mean, I, so that's, that's what you do every morning.

15:38.480 --> 15:42.320
I'm going to, yeah. And I'm going to try not to be phased by the fact that I thought he meant it

15:42.320 --> 15:47.840
when he was saying all that stuff to me all the time. Then I was amazing and doing a great job.

15:47.840 --> 15:51.280
We just said that to a bunch of strangers who just laid there. You know that these are non-performers

15:51.280 --> 15:54.480
that just got up on the stage, did a weird thing and didn't even ask any questions.

15:54.480 --> 15:59.200
And we're pretty good sports about it. That's pretty amazing. Well, but they didn't work as

15:59.200 --> 16:07.040
hard as I do. Yo, who wants to see how hard he works? Yeah. We got it. We can't, I'm not trying

16:07.040 --> 16:14.560
to get out of it. We can't keep this. Let's see how hard Dan Harmon works every day with Dave Kline.

16:14.560 --> 16:19.920
I got to count for you. There's people listening to the podcast. We have to say things. I'm going

16:19.920 --> 16:26.160
to say, I'm going to say real fast. 50, 40, 30, 12, 97, 65, 41. No, I can't, you, what, you, what,

16:26.160 --> 16:29.200
you, they don't want to watch me plank on my elbows.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.760
And they don't want to see you take your shirt off before you do it.

16:37.760 --> 16:55.040
All the way, all the way, all the way. I wanted you to see my Minecraft for sure.

16:55.040 --> 17:01.840
Oh, all right.

17:09.120 --> 17:14.640
Body by Klein. Look, he's so much skinnier. He has it. Look at this. That's crazy.

17:14.640 --> 17:18.640
Dude, look at this core. Look at this definition.

17:24.160 --> 17:32.000
All right. Dan, do you want to call out any other podcaster right now and threaten them like a

17:32.000 --> 17:38.480
wrestler? Just Chris Pratt's coming for you, Chris Pratt.

17:38.480 --> 17:46.560
50, 40, 30, 12, 97, 65, 41, 50, 41, 50, 41, 50, 41, 52, 41, 52, 41, 52, 41, 52, 41, 52, 41,

17:46.560 --> 17:50.400
52, 41, 52, 41, 53, 41, 53, 41, 54, 41, 54, 41, 54, 41, 54, 41, 54, 41, 54.

17:50.400 --> 17:56.320
He's doing it. He's planking. This is a full plank, a push-up style plank.

17:59.760 --> 18:03.040
He's drinking alcohol while planking. Oh my God.

18:03.040 --> 18:08.640
He's drinking again while planking.

18:12.480 --> 18:18.640
And the crowd are loving it. Jeff moves the alcohol.

18:18.640 --> 18:36.240
He's going for another drink. Oh, he's losing it. But he's maintaining. He went for another.

18:48.640 --> 18:58.240
He's still going. And he can't stop.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.240
You can see Fatih setting in.

19:07.840 --> 19:12.880
Jeff is, oh, Jeff put a drink on his back. This is a type of torture.

19:12.880 --> 19:18.480
This is what murderers do to their victims.

19:18.480 --> 19:36.080
He feels triumphantly, as if getting ready to masturbate.

19:36.080 --> 19:48.880
You did it. Yeah. Yeah. Coming for you, Chris Pratt. Yeah.

19:52.560 --> 19:59.600
I didn't really mean for you to take your shirt off. I was just doing a bit. No, I know. You didn't

19:59.600 --> 20:06.960
say it, though I did. Now, when I say, no, that was fucking outstanding. That was

20:06.960 --> 20:10.960
actually outstanding and amazing. Fucking great effort on that. But see, doesn't that sound the

20:10.960 --> 20:17.600
same as when he sent it to those other people? That's similar enough. For me, it was worth losing

20:17.600 --> 20:22.400
my voice just to see that. Oh, yeah. Oh, man. I had to go into a dark place. You got to do a

20:22.400 --> 20:31.040
swelling test. You got to go do a swelling test. I do every day. Right now. Play a C5.

20:31.040 --> 20:37.680
Anybody have a, who has a pitch pipe? I think Dave's got it. Can you send for, I have to do every

20:37.680 --> 20:50.560
day. I have to get my C5. Yeah, you're still there. You're still there. I think it's like,

20:50.560 --> 20:56.640
I think it's that C5. Yeah. I went to the desert with Cody to, he knows. Wait, do you have perfect

20:56.640 --> 21:04.720
pitch? Sing C5 for me. That's just what Jeff was doing. That's amazing. Do you really have perfect

21:04.720 --> 21:10.240
pitch? You need a really good relative or shitty perfect pitch. Well, relative to a note you've

21:10.240 --> 21:14.880
recently heard, that's the same thing, but you have perfect pitch. Relative perfect pitch. Now,

21:14.880 --> 21:20.640
what's the highest note you can hit? It depends on the day. Well, today is the day, Jack.

21:22.480 --> 21:27.520
That's definitely an F5. Oh. Hit it again.

21:27.520 --> 21:39.440
That's terrifying and amazing at the same time. Should we bring out Rob Schrab?

21:47.280 --> 21:55.440
Rob Schrab, come on stage. Or maybe Rob Schrab taking a shift. He's certainly doing some tricks.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.520
Yeah, why has he been so shy? He is normally. Let me tell you a quick story.

22:02.880 --> 22:08.000
Steve Levy and Rob Schrab at the same time. That was the trick.

22:10.400 --> 22:16.160
Yep, I'm going to take it. We're going to Levy. We're going to Steve. We're going to Schrab.

22:18.400 --> 22:22.400
All right. I don't know if I was meant to come out on stage. It's kind of cold. But you did?

22:22.400 --> 22:29.600
Well, hey. All right, knack it up. Everybody clean it up. Clean up the show. Come on.

22:29.600 --> 22:35.280
All right, all right, all right. Come on, shape a show. Let's get some craft going on here.

22:36.320 --> 22:41.680
Let me tell you a story. I went to the desert with Cody. Storytime.

22:41.680 --> 22:56.720
Storytime. Storytime. Tim's Storytime. He's going to tell us a story. He's going to knit a yarn.

22:58.560 --> 23:05.920
And this kid came out from the kitchen and to serve us our food, bringing the food to the table.

23:05.920 --> 23:15.360
And he was very bashful. And he said, here you go. Careful. It's a hot plate. Mr. Harmon,

23:17.520 --> 23:26.240
serving you has been my birthday. And I said, oh, is it your birthday?

23:28.160 --> 23:33.680
And he said, yes, today's my birthday. And I was like, I wanted to say, well, technically,

23:33.680 --> 23:42.400
that's not a compliment. You could hate me in serving you. It would be better if it wasn't.

23:42.400 --> 23:47.280
Like he should have said, it is now. But it was his birthday. That's the implication. Serving

23:47.280 --> 23:55.360
you has been my birthday kid. Did you put him on blast? Yeah. For doing that? Yeah, yeah. I went

23:55.360 --> 24:03.360
back through his Twitter 10 years and I found some jokes about Monica Lewinsky that were

24:03.360 --> 24:12.240
pretty cum-oriented, which is not really what's in right now. Was that kid James Gunn? Yes,

24:12.240 --> 24:18.720
that kid was James Gunn. When you say a kid, how old? Like a teenager? I don't know. I mean,

24:18.720 --> 24:24.560
I'm 45. Everyone's a kid. Only people that aren't kids are in a space station dying.

24:24.560 --> 24:33.840
Spencer, why don't you play us something? Hey. On the piano. I'll tell you another

24:34.480 --> 24:39.760
story. That's not really a story. It's another funny thing I wrote down that someone said.

24:39.760 --> 24:47.680
I was watching a true crime show and one of the people said, one of those things where there's

24:47.680 --> 24:53.920
like a cop trying to like, the cops are trying to, you know, they're trying to sound hard boiled.

24:55.840 --> 25:01.840
And a guy said, it's like finding a needle in a basket of haystacks.

25:03.680 --> 25:07.920
And he's like, I don't know. That sounds like it might be easier. That metaphor needed pushing up.

25:09.920 --> 25:15.200
He solved the crime of metaphors. He just redefined. He's just miniaturizing haystacks to

25:15.200 --> 25:20.000
the point where a bunch of them fit in a basket. Isn't that just a basket of hay? It's a hay basket.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.600
I'd rather find a needle in a basket of hay than a haystack. Right.

25:25.120 --> 25:31.520
Was that phrase must have been invented before magnets, right? Magnets? Yeah. Oh, right. Yeah.

25:31.520 --> 25:38.080
Pretty easy. Before magnets that are powerful enough to suck a needle out of. High fives are

25:38.080 --> 25:47.040
being exchanged. And that's not the sound of two high fives. He had two mics up to one high five.

25:49.200 --> 25:55.360
And that's not the sound of four high fives. That's four. Ow. Ow. Too hard. You know how you,

25:55.360 --> 25:59.520
you know how you do it. You aim for the other person's elbow. Okay. Yeah. That's the,

25:59.520 --> 26:01.600
you got to make eye contact with their elbow.

26:01.600 --> 26:09.360
I guess it's a bad trick. That works. I don't really have anything else. That was a two,

26:09.360 --> 26:16.480
those are the two things. Yo, what about Noval? Yeah. What do you, what do you think is easier,

26:16.480 --> 26:20.960
Dan, finding a needle in a haystack or finding a needle in a basket of haystacks?

26:21.840 --> 26:24.480
Honestly, I mean, what if someone, what if it was their first time here?

26:24.480 --> 26:30.720
I'll tell you what. Yo, you've been doing some interesting delvings into, you know,

26:30.720 --> 26:36.240
the thinking about the history and future history of humanity. Shout out to Yuval Noah Harari,

26:36.240 --> 26:40.880
author of sapiens and Homo Deus. We're getting deep into this shit in the mornings.

26:40.880 --> 26:46.880
What were you saying? All the aerobics I was just hearing on the speaker, like going,

26:46.880 --> 26:54.800
we have to say things. It's a podcast. Come on, people. We have to say things. It's a podcast.

26:56.080 --> 27:05.040
Stop it. We have to say things. It's a podcast. Yeah, I said that. People, it's a podcast.

27:05.680 --> 27:13.920
We have to say things. There's some hips on this too. Come on. Stop with this. You have to say

27:13.920 --> 27:23.760
things. Come on. Yeah, I did read this book, Homo Deus, Homo Deus, Homo Deus. Sorry, that's how

27:23.760 --> 27:29.440
you can remember it. That's good. By the author of sapiens, I was talking about the book sapiens

27:29.440 --> 27:37.920
last time. This is a 2016 follow up, I think, Homo Deus. It's talking about what's to become of us,

27:37.920 --> 27:43.360
where have we been and what's to become of us? Very eye-opening and then eye-punching and then eye-

27:43.360 --> 27:49.920
closing, because it'll just make you want to roll over and wait for the dream slash nightmare of

27:49.920 --> 27:55.760
our evolution and the way it's going to, which is us becoming robot people. Top two, screws in the

27:55.760 --> 28:04.000
eyeball. Yeah. I'm sure that's accurate. Which of the screws into the eyeballs did you find most,

28:04.000 --> 28:10.480
you know, or most memorable or interesting? Yeah, Dan. Oh. Yeah, which screws into the eyeballs?

28:10.480 --> 28:19.280
Yeah, yeah. You got to say things. It's a podcast. People are paying money for the words.

28:21.200 --> 28:27.440
I thought the most interesting aspect was tracing the evolution of human religion globally from,

28:28.160 --> 28:32.240
you know, animism or animus, whatever that is, where you're like, you know, we were talking

28:32.240 --> 28:37.360
about that last time, like, oh, my friend's a bird. He brought me fire and, you know,

28:37.360 --> 28:44.640
he can fly and I can't and kind of on equal terms with everything around me. Also, my worst enemy,

28:44.640 --> 28:50.000
my best friend, all these critters, and moving from that to polytheism, moving from that to

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
monotheism, and then we really have replaced that with humanism. Like, we, even if we don't want to

28:56.000 --> 28:59.920
admit it and we want to talk about things like, I believe in God and all that stuff, we still are

28:59.920 --> 29:04.160
having conversations about looking within ourselves, which wasn't always the case a long time ago.

29:04.160 --> 29:09.920
Like you would actually like grab a sword and like run over to the Middle East with it because

29:09.920 --> 29:14.720
you truly actually believed that something outside yourself was going to like make you a silver surfer

29:14.720 --> 29:19.920
after you died. Like, like, like you really believed in it in the way that you believe

29:19.920 --> 29:24.640
where Waze is telling you to go. Like, like it was a concrete thought. We still have that philosophy

29:24.640 --> 29:29.520
these days. Was that, was that how the Crusades was? Yeah, like people, people back then really

29:29.520 --> 29:34.720
believed that there was like an external force and we have evolved in terms of our philosophy,

29:34.720 --> 29:39.760
even the religious among us, even a zealot is somebody who's still saying, you know,

29:39.760 --> 29:44.000
I've looked within myself and I know what God's mission is, kind of like they're not waiting for

29:44.000 --> 29:49.440
like a cloud to like come and help save them from pigeons or something. Like they're like nobody,

29:49.440 --> 29:54.400
like we all, we've all evolved into humanism, the worship of humanity. And then, and then taking

29:54.400 --> 30:00.880
that and saying like, well, there's two big branches of humanism that are kind of, you know,

30:00.880 --> 30:07.200
at odds. And like the one that's one out is liberal liberal humanism, which is basically

30:07.200 --> 30:10.560
saying, look, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, but I know it's important to be human.

30:11.920 --> 30:15.600
You know, and then the other one is the evolutionary humanism. And a lot of us probably go back and

30:15.600 --> 30:20.320
forth between these things. But in our current political state, you can see these things magnified

30:20.320 --> 30:25.920
to the point where they could kill ants on and burn wood, because it's like the extreme forms of

30:25.920 --> 30:31.520
that shit in the way that you pull up a lever and a pulling booth is like, it's like, God damn it,

30:31.520 --> 30:37.360
the fucking like the evolutionary humanism is like, I love humanity so much that I don't want

30:37.360 --> 30:42.640
that person slowing us down. I don't want that person getting away with anything. I'm tired of

30:42.640 --> 30:47.840
saying that that person's equal to that person. When we all know that's not true, some things are

30:47.840 --> 30:53.600
more valuable than others like, let's stop fucking around and let's get better. I say that with a

30:53.600 --> 30:58.960
mocking voice because that's not the team I fight for because I don't, how do you, how do you stand

30:58.960 --> 31:04.160
on that slope without slipping into the fucking Moff Tarkin territory? Like, I don't, I don't,

31:04.160 --> 31:08.560
I don't know, maybe it says more about me than you that I can't, I can't go near that fucking slope.

31:08.560 --> 31:13.360
I choose not to, I don't want to stand there. I prefer the liberal humanism, which is like,

31:13.360 --> 31:18.240
but he, he tell, the interesting thing is that he tells, he earns his trajectory by explaining

31:18.240 --> 31:23.600
where we've been and talking about how like World War II was like this kind of like grand

31:24.880 --> 31:31.040
sort of climax of the, of, of, it was, it was a, it was a battle during which like liberal democracy,

31:33.120 --> 31:37.680
it was this close to extinction because it was catching a left punch from socialism.

31:38.240 --> 31:42.400
All the poor people waking up, you can see this in your, your friends, you were having these

31:42.400 --> 31:49.520
conversations right now with the, the socialists saying, hey liberals, you know, you, like, you

31:49.520 --> 31:54.720
are rich and you are privileged and you are saying that you want everybody to be free because if

31:54.720 --> 31:58.880
they're free, they're free to do what they did yesterday and do the same thing tomorrow and

31:58.880 --> 32:02.720
you're free to be rich and they're free to be poor. And, and socialists are like, we're catching

32:02.720 --> 32:08.880
on to you, you're not, you're an elitist and, and God, get that left punch coming. And then

32:08.880 --> 32:14.320
at the same time leading up to World War II, there's this right punch coming from your,

32:14.320 --> 32:18.400
your little characters around the world who are going, hey, I'm poor too and you know what

32:18.400 --> 32:21.760
sick and tired to say and that guy's beautiful when the truth is he's ugly.

32:22.880 --> 32:27.680
And I don't want to listen to this song. When I want to listen to Wagner, it's beautiful,

32:27.680 --> 32:33.440
it's the best music ever. And while I'm tired of fucking around and I'm going to troll the world

32:33.440 --> 32:39.280
and, and prove that everything is like, like needs to be better and I stop lying. Everyone

32:39.280 --> 32:43.840
tells the truth. Life is ugly and we can make it more beautiful if we fucking eat each other.

32:45.280 --> 32:50.640
And, and both of those guys, you get a left fist and a right fist coming at the people with all

32:50.640 --> 32:56.880
the money who were like living high in the hog and who could only win that war that, that, that

32:56.880 --> 33:02.800
chapter really by forming an alliance with socialism. Like that is like, we could only really

33:02.800 --> 33:07.760
win World War II by teaming up with Russia. But that's just a microcosm of, of the general,

33:08.800 --> 33:12.800
general facts that as far as these data fields are concerned, these philosophies, it's like

33:13.680 --> 33:18.320
liberal democracy was, it's sort of like saying, hey, can't we all just get along? Can't we all

33:18.320 --> 33:23.520
just hang out? And it's a, it's a, your crimes are unintentional kind of when you say that your

33:23.520 --> 33:29.520
crimes are silence, you know, your crimes are, you're not really helping necessarily. And that

33:29.520 --> 33:35.440
needed to be fused with, hey, it's great, you be poor, other people can be rich. I, we had to pair

33:35.440 --> 33:40.240
that with the, I believe in that so much, I'd like to help the poor. Like that kind of fusion came

33:40.240 --> 33:47.440
out of, of that chapter, which is the only way that this liberal isistic, like humanism beat

33:47.440 --> 33:55.040
out the evolutionary humanistic model. But the punchline is that it matters to us a lot, but

33:55.040 --> 33:59.200
it doesn't really matter on the grand scale. You can tell this guy is like, those are just roads

33:59.200 --> 34:03.680
that sort of like go like this and I'm waving my hands in a nonsensical motion for those.

34:03.680 --> 34:10.400
He's like doing a double helix situation. They, it's like, I consider it a great thing that one

34:10.400 --> 34:17.440
side one out of the other, but kind of all roads lead to a distinct lack of Rome in that, like,

34:18.080 --> 34:22.960
no matter, all, it's like all humanism, which is the only thing that survived, like no one's out

34:22.960 --> 34:29.040
there like, don't, I worship a black cat from outer space that really exists. Like they, like we, we

34:29.040 --> 34:34.400
are all humanists around the globe. So these like factions, these warring factions of humanists

34:34.400 --> 34:40.480
are all going to one way or another be slaves to data technology that you're not going to be,

34:40.480 --> 34:46.880
we're not going to be able to say that our goal is for humanity to be either happy or evolved and

34:46.880 --> 34:54.880
improved. Those are just, both of those teams would eventually just get swallowed up by algorithmic

34:54.880 --> 35:01.120
thinking. Because even if you're the most loving, like, like, let's just play it as it lays, open

35:01.120 --> 35:06.320
your heart, be a good person kind of person, like, it's only going to be a matter of time before that

35:06.320 --> 35:13.440
person has to admit that doing that without using data that we've been covering about people

35:13.440 --> 35:21.760
is actually just willful disobedience of, of making people happy. Like, it's, we're vast,

35:21.760 --> 35:26.480
we're quickly approaching a threshold according to this author where, like, computers are gonna,

35:26.480 --> 35:30.480
not computers, like we think, I still think of computers as like a laptop and all the shit,

35:30.480 --> 35:35.280
whatever, the fucking information field that we're creating, the internet of all things,

35:35.280 --> 35:40.080
is going to know us better than we know ourselves. It's going to be, we're not going to be able to

35:40.080 --> 35:48.560
keep up with people who are willing to let data tell them who to date tomorrow, what to eat,

35:49.600 --> 35:53.760
where to put their kids in school, like, like, how to, how to approach their philosophy, like,

35:53.760 --> 35:59.040
no matter what your philosophy is, algorithms are going to be, it's like, like the way I put it,

35:59.040 --> 36:04.240
I'm not paraphrasing him, I'm just, like, you can't, you can't shake your fist at a choo-choo

36:04.240 --> 36:09.280
train faster than a train. Like, you can stand next to a train track and go like, I hate that darn

36:09.280 --> 36:14.640
train track, like, and you can be right, like, train tracks are ugly, the thing blows smoke,

36:14.640 --> 36:19.200
it's beautiful next to the train track, you could live in a nice log cabin, but that,

36:20.000 --> 36:24.960
everybody on the train is gonna fuck more and make more people than the person in the log cabin,

36:24.960 --> 36:29.920
so that's just the basic. So where does that put your philosophy right now? Like, where are you at?

36:29.920 --> 36:34.560
I think it puts all of our philosophies in this kind of, like, just sort of newly perspective,

36:34.560 --> 36:39.360
like, it's just like, oh, so that's the struggle we're having right now, but then it's like, oh,

36:39.360 --> 36:45.200
does it really matter almost? Like, because it's like, like, we're so close to an age,

36:45.200 --> 36:51.760
and he wrote this book in 2016, like, January, I think, and so I would think that he would have

36:51.760 --> 36:57.600
more paragraphs about, told you so, if, if, if, if while he was writing it, he was like, working this,

36:57.600 --> 37:02.080
like, shit happening, because he's kind of predicting it in this book, and I'm like, oh,

37:02.080 --> 37:08.000
shit. What is he predicting? Well, just the idea that we're going, that democracy is going to start

37:08.000 --> 37:15.120
to be assailed by data, that, that, that algorithms, and he gives this example, and it's, I think it's

37:15.120 --> 37:20.240
just blind, like, he's not, he didn't read about Cambridge Analytica, he didn't, he's just giving

37:20.240 --> 37:26.640
the example, he goes like, Facebook accounts have more information about people than they have about

37:26.640 --> 37:33.520
themselves, and they did a study where people said as much, they, they gave people's closest

37:33.520 --> 37:38.240
friends a test about their friends, they said, how well do you know, Jeff Davis, answer these

37:38.240 --> 37:43.280
questions, and then they kept the algorithmically predicted answers to themselves, and theirs were

37:43.280 --> 37:48.640
more accurate, that Facebook itself can answer questions about you more than your friends can,

37:48.640 --> 37:53.760
and then on top of it, more than you can, that, because we don't remember shit, like, we, we

37:53.760 --> 38:00.400
live a fucking weird experiential life, but our narrative is like, it's hardwired, so the guy

38:00.400 --> 38:05.280
gives this example, it's a little hokey, but it's also just kind of poetic of, of like, you're

38:05.280 --> 38:12.160
going to go on a date in the future, and you, you say to your Cortana Google thing, you go, I don't

38:12.160 --> 38:18.800
know who I should, I got Carl called me, and Jerry called me, like, Jerry's awesome, and he makes me

38:18.800 --> 38:24.640
laugh, but Carl's, Carl has more respect for me, I think, I don't know, I'm so confused, my parents,

38:24.640 --> 38:30.800
like, so I don't know what to do, and like, we'll quickly be approaching a time when your, your,

38:31.440 --> 38:36.880
this, this Google Cortana Siri thing, like, whatever this is, will say to you, hey, listen,

38:37.600 --> 38:43.360
I know you better than you know yourself, like, I'm not talking down to you, I'm just here to help,

38:43.360 --> 38:47.840
and I know, I know you so well that I know you're not going to like what I have to tell you,

38:47.840 --> 38:51.760
but I have monitored your heart rate on every date you've ever been on with both of these guys,

38:52.640 --> 38:56.480
and I have monitored their heart rates, and I, where I rather, I've talked to their Cortana

38:56.480 --> 39:02.560
Google series, and, and, and, because you guys, you guys gave limited authorization to, to do a

39:02.560 --> 39:08.720
little brokering of, of the, of the adrenaline, of the, you know, endocrine levels and the things

39:08.720 --> 39:14.000
that you've felt, and the, and I've, I've read all of the books that you've read, I've even read the

39:14.000 --> 39:18.320
books, finished the books that you fell asleep reading, and I've noted the pull-up parts where

39:18.320 --> 39:24.000
you fall asleep, I've noted the paragraphs that you have to read over and over again, because

39:24.000 --> 39:29.120
some, some of them you want, they're important to you, some of them you, you're too dense to, to get,

39:29.120 --> 39:34.640
like, and all of this for me is information, and for you it's just fleeting gas, and you don't,

39:34.640 --> 39:40.960
if you get a cold, you might vote wrong, whereas I know what you march for, and I know what t-shirts

39:40.960 --> 39:46.480
you buy, and I know how you genuinely feel on average for the last 15 years of your life,

39:46.480 --> 39:53.360
and I'm telling you 87% Carl, that's all I'm gonna say, and also wear the green dress, it makes you

39:53.360 --> 39:58.320
look better, like, like, you, you've been retaining water lately, and you tend to blah, blah, blah,

39:58.320 --> 40:02.240
blah, like, it's gonna tell you, it's gonna be better at telling you shit that's gonna actually

40:02.240 --> 40:08.080
make you succeed in, in, by our definitions of success, better than your aunt can.

40:08.080 --> 40:12.320
What's bad about that though? There's nothing bad, it's like this, this guy is continually

40:12.320 --> 40:17.440
pummeling, it's meat tenderizing, it's just like you, it's just bashes humanity into like this,

40:17.440 --> 40:23.120
it's like, he's like, just admit it, we're going to merge with data. Yeah, like, especially like,

40:23.120 --> 40:27.680
you're into this kind of stuff, like, does that scare you, or do you, or do you dig that?

40:27.680 --> 40:33.840
No, because I think the bad aspects of that, like, society using evil data to control people's minds,

40:33.840 --> 40:38.560
that's already happening, so like, it's not, it's gonna get worse the same way everything's

40:38.560 --> 40:43.200
always getting worse, but I think the potential for good is good, I don't know, there's one

40:43.200 --> 40:46.880
government, I don't know where it is, it's in like, the Netherlands or something, I don't know,

40:46.880 --> 40:54.160
but they, they have a section of, of government where they enact legislation by science, so they

40:54.160 --> 40:59.840
use data to determine what's probably the best policy to enact, then they do a test run of that

40:59.840 --> 41:05.280
policy, take data, and then they analyze that policy and do another test policy, until they have

41:05.280 --> 41:08.720
policy that they can actually enact that they know is going to work, and it doesn't have to do with

41:08.720 --> 41:13.360
voting, it's just data and knowledge and science, and that's probably better than governance, I can

41:13.360 --> 41:18.960
see how that can be hijacked by manipulators, but on its own, but that's all, that every system is

41:18.960 --> 41:22.720
like that. But if it flows freely enough, hacking, it shouldn't matter too much, like, especially

41:22.720 --> 41:27.680
things that don't have to do with privacy. Do we all, do we all have to fuck Carl? Yeah, well,

41:27.680 --> 41:32.960
87% of us wear green dress and body shame ourselves. I'm, I'm more considered about this green dress.

41:35.840 --> 41:40.880
Yeah, it, it, it makes a pretty compelling argument for like, you know, right now we're

41:40.880 --> 41:46.080
worried about voting, voting fraud, and like, how do we keep the, the polls honest, and hopefully

41:46.080 --> 41:50.640
we'll get through that, but there is going to come a point where we're going to start, if we're

41:50.640 --> 41:54.560
going to evolve, we're going to be asking ourselves at a certain point, why are we, why are we going

41:54.560 --> 42:01.600
to the poll to do this, when the, the poll is supposed to be a measurement of, of all of these

42:01.600 --> 42:05.920
like processors that are supposed to be networked together, that are living their life together

42:05.920 --> 42:10.640
and having a social contract together, so why, why go every two years and four years for these

42:10.640 --> 42:16.320
referendums that are like rep, that are, that are purposely boiling things down to an obfuscated,

42:16.320 --> 42:22.640
like, kind of set of data, as opposed to just, you know, like if the algorithms get good enough

42:22.640 --> 42:28.320
at regulating society and making things fair for people, if that's its directive, hey, Skynet,

42:28.320 --> 42:34.400
make things fair, okay, we'll do, we'll, we'll go through phases where we're like, Skynet,

42:34.400 --> 42:39.520
I'm watching you, don't go Terminator on us, haha, I saw that movie too, I understand the

42:39.520 --> 42:46.800
reverence, but seriously, I'll get you to work on time, and, and we'll, we'll kind of like, let

42:46.800 --> 42:50.720
ways get us to work on time a few times before we're willing to say, all right, just, just pick

42:50.720 --> 42:55.920
the root, just pick the root, and then after a while, if everyone says, just pick the root,

42:55.920 --> 43:02.560
we're not gonna get any more upset about it picking everyone's root and collectively ushering us into

43:02.560 --> 43:08.160
ways that get everyone home any more than we get upset about, hey, who chose the shape of this

43:08.160 --> 43:15.280
aluminum can? I think big vending machines behind this soda, you know, like, we don't really, we're

43:15.280 --> 43:21.120
not like, how do you know, I'm boxed out of whether or not this is a perfect cylinder, like, we just

43:21.120 --> 43:25.840
kind of trust a bunch of shit after a while, or just like, okay, I guess that's how soda should

43:25.840 --> 43:31.760
be shaped, I don't know, I grew up on it, and, and, and yeah, any hacking, any kind of hacking

43:31.760 --> 43:37.040
stories will just be like, see, that's why you need more security, like, these North Koreans gave you

43:37.040 --> 43:42.640
a flu, like in your nanovirus protection, like, like, your kid got a cold because of North Korea,

43:42.640 --> 43:47.760
guess we need to upgrade, like, and anybody that's a Luddite is just gonna get sick and die sooner,

43:47.760 --> 43:56.160
oh well, look, I'm out, like, like, I always, I always finish these books, I get a pit in my

43:56.160 --> 43:59.600
stomach, and then I'm like, just get to the part where you say this won't happen for 50 years,

43:59.600 --> 44:02.720
and that's what he does at the end, he's like, of course this could take 50 years, or 100, I'm

44:02.720 --> 44:10.480
like, peace, I just, I just want people to find my one-eyed Willy skeleton with a Minecraft laptop,

44:10.480 --> 44:16.960
like, fucking, what, is this a booby, what did he want, he tried to close the laptop and a fucking

44:16.960 --> 44:22.400
bowling ball falls on you, for no reason, I mean, there's no treasure, what the fuck were those

44:22.400 --> 44:31.280
pirates doing, what the, what the fuck was, what were they doing, like, how, how, how, let's go into

44:31.280 --> 44:36.400
this cave, it's raining, all right, but just for a little bit, right, just for a little bit, it's

44:36.400 --> 44:41.840
raining, and I'm getting me patched with. Okay, I understand the Spanish are chasing us to Seattle,

44:41.840 --> 44:49.120
and, uh, I just, I just want to make sure, Willy, Willy, you have a tendency to overdevelop

44:49.120 --> 44:55.680
things, and I want to make sure, as a pirate who has been honored to work with you, that you don't

44:55.680 --> 45:01.760
go into a tailspin of, right, right, okay, we could have been in there three times by now,

45:01.760 --> 45:07.600
okay, all right, you don't have to high road me, all right, let's, let's hide, speaking Spanish,

45:07.600 --> 45:12.480
let's get into the cave, let's hide in the cave, because it's raining out, okay, it's raining in

45:12.480 --> 45:17.840
the Spanish, okay, let's make sure, you know what, let's seal this, let's seal it up behind us, I'll

45:17.840 --> 45:26.400
seal it up with cement, okay, you know what, uh, make sure the cement, uh, is wet, well, that it,

45:26.400 --> 45:32.480
you know, just make sure there's like a kind of omega protocol where, if the ship needs to go

45:32.480 --> 45:38.240
back out, that there's something that can trigger the ship leaving, that you're sealing, don't seal

45:38.880 --> 45:48.960
us in, to, yeah, well, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, what's going on? Oh, fuck, goddammit, the Spanish

45:48.960 --> 45:58.000
found us, I knew we shouldn't have gone to Seattle, look, hey, all right, you're either

45:58.000 --> 46:03.760
gonna need to be, join, join one-eyed Willie and the pirates, I promise you, riches beyond your

46:03.760 --> 46:10.480
wildest imaginings, what's in it for me, what's in it for me, uh, well, also I speak English because,

46:10.480 --> 46:16.240
you know, the English, treasure is in it for you, okay, what we request is a bit of help setting

46:16.240 --> 46:22.960
a few moderate booby traps, okay, that is my, that is my, because we can't have this repeated,

46:22.960 --> 46:28.160
does anyone else know, you can't, we can't have more of you, I'm just a, just a lonely Spanish

46:28.160 --> 46:35.520
pirate, all right, all right, all right, let's talk more work, does anyone know piano? I have

46:35.520 --> 46:43.280
an idea for a booby trap, uh, I'm not the best with instruments, oh, see, see, you know, you've

46:43.280 --> 46:50.160
taken piano, I know piano, okay, I'm gonna get ten, ten of our guys to dig a bottomless pit,

46:50.160 --> 46:57.680
right, uh, or find one, fuck it, you know, maybe we'll get lucky, oh, I, I, I would, uh, pit,

47:00.960 --> 47:06.560
you found a pit, no, no, it's, this place is built next to a giant pit, oh, great, well,

47:06.560 --> 47:11.200
let's build one of these concrete seals, am I doing, am I still with the wall, I mean,

47:11.200 --> 47:16.480
yes, you keep up at the wall, all right, okay, I didn't stop, actually, you know what, what,

47:16.480 --> 47:20.960
can I just one memo before we start all these booby trap projects, yes, can we make sure,

47:20.960 --> 47:26.880
cement's drying, can we make sure every day, every day, no matter how much booby track work we

47:26.880 --> 47:35.600
have to do, we all meet back here in the galley of the ship and sit down in case we all die at the

47:35.600 --> 47:44.320
same time, that seems like very, very sound advice, it's just, you know, I know it's a rare chance,

47:44.320 --> 47:50.640
but if it happens, boy, can you imagine finding this ship, and it's like, whoa, they all died

47:50.640 --> 47:55.440
around the table, all right, I'm gonna go find the piano and put it next to the pit, what am I

47:55.440 --> 48:07.040
doing, I forget, you give me a music, a sheet music for scales, and tell Tony to stop driving

48:07.040 --> 48:13.520
like a maniac, or I swear I'm gonna stab him in both eyes, until to the point where bone grows

48:13.520 --> 48:19.680
over his eye sockets, wedging the knives in, I feel like you need to calm down, I think cement's

48:19.680 --> 48:26.880
drying, you're right, you're right, sorry, has anyone put the giant octopus in the water?

48:26.880 --> 48:32.160
No, no, no, we're not gonna use that, we decided, we took a couple pictures that didn't work out,

48:32.160 --> 48:39.760
we'll fix it in post, it was a good, it was a good idea there, it was a good idea there,

48:39.760 --> 48:45.120
but we just didn't, it just didn't come together the way, and the cement is dry,

48:45.120 --> 48:51.200
it's dry, I didn't, I was waiting for you to please talk and do the omega door,

48:51.200 --> 48:57.200
I had the piano right next to the bottom of the pit, oh shit, okay, he dropped his pee,

48:57.200 --> 49:01.360
you know, I predict that that's gonna keep happening, we know what we need to do, we need

49:01.360 --> 49:08.560
to make a safety water slide that leads right to the ship for anyone who runs into too much trouble,

49:08.560 --> 49:13.280
so they can just skirt around all of the tracks, no matter whether they fail or succeed,

49:13.280 --> 49:18.880
they should just be able to ultimately just slide down a water slide and get right to the treasure,

49:18.880 --> 49:27.600
hey, already done, already done, oh great, all right, hello, oh god, he's a ghost,

49:29.600 --> 49:38.320
I am the god Poseidon, oh, who put this guy in charge, this guy doesn't know what the fuck I had to do,

49:38.320 --> 49:45.200
oh shit, I'm just a god Poseidon, but this guy seems like he doesn't, he's all over the shop,

49:45.200 --> 49:48.720
yeah Aquaman in the house, what the fuck is going on over here, oh shit Aquaman,

49:48.720 --> 49:52.320
oh shit, hey Aquaman, look at this guy over here, he's making rules and fucking another thing,

49:52.320 --> 50:00.880
what the crossover is going on, what, it's Aquaman, what the hell, I mean, I, yeah, anyways,

50:00.880 --> 50:06.080
well it just seems like, it just seems like, it seems like those pirates spent a, spent a

50:06.080 --> 50:13.040
little, so okay, that was the goonies, yeah, okay, that was the goonies, yeah,

50:15.040 --> 50:20.560
yeah, I was in a commercial for the goonies, oh really, yeah, what do you mean, that's the end of

50:20.560 --> 50:26.480
that story, like you were saying like, I just saw it and it's great, no, my dad worked, my dad worked

50:26.480 --> 50:32.240
for a TV station and like back then like local channels did a lot more legwork than they currently

50:32.240 --> 50:38.400
do relative to like the top-down advertising stuff, so he cut the local ad for like the TV

50:38.400 --> 50:45.680
showing of the goonies and his genius idea was like having his kids get sucked into the television

50:45.680 --> 50:50.720
set where they're going through all these goonies scenes that they're green screened into, so,

50:50.720 --> 50:56.880
what the fuck, what the fuck, what, how long have I known you, why are you first telling us this now,

50:56.880 --> 51:02.160
how did you, where is this, it took me that whole sketch, why are we watching it, it took me that

51:02.160 --> 51:07.600
whole sketch to realize you were doing the goonies, where, where, I did not know that this was what

51:07.600 --> 51:13.280
you cared about, I understand that, that was a long, long peer for you to walk off of, you know

51:13.280 --> 51:18.240
what we were talking about, the goonies, but we've known you for, since the fucking documentary,

51:18.240 --> 51:22.240
I didn't know that's something that matters to people, you haven't told us that you got zapted to

51:22.240 --> 51:29.920
a television green screened in front of shit, where is it, where is it, I want to watch it now,

51:31.440 --> 51:37.840
it doesn't like, yeah, where, so, where, I don't know, well someone, can you guys look for it

51:37.840 --> 51:42.560
while we're doing this, I don't know what to search for, can you call somebody, don't pay attention

51:42.560 --> 51:48.320
to the comedy, call somebody, I could, I could text my dad, let's see what he says, text your dad,

51:48.320 --> 51:56.960
what a genius idea, are you fucking kidding me, did you have the beard back, yeah I had the beard,

51:58.240 --> 52:02.080
just to warn you, if you try to text your dad, there's no signal up here, and a lot of people

52:02.080 --> 52:06.000
will think you texted your dad two weeks in a row, and they'll be really disappointed to hear

52:06.000 --> 52:16.080
that the messages didn't actually go out, oh, I can't believe this shit, I'm hearing, I can't

52:16.080 --> 52:24.800
believe it, why can't you, why are you surprised, I don't understand, why, what are you talking about,

52:26.000 --> 52:30.960
no, because I was a kid sitting on a couch, and my dad took maybe 12 seconds of footage,

52:30.960 --> 52:36.240
and then he cut an ad out of it, like, I wasn't like on it, I was at home, I don't, what's cool

52:36.240 --> 52:40.800
about it, you have to explain what's cool about it, well, don't you ever laugh at Tim and Eric

52:40.800 --> 52:48.240
stuff, well, sure, it probably looks kind of funny that you're getting green screen zapped

52:48.240 --> 52:53.680
into the Goonies, and also it's you, and you probably don't have a beard, and there's probably

52:53.680 --> 52:59.440
a lot of funny elements about it, it's like finding out that after knowing Jack Black for

52:59.440 --> 53:03.920
a thousand years that he was the guy in the pitfall commercial, but that's good, because like

53:03.920 --> 53:11.280
pitfall was an enduring game and commercial, and Goonies isn't well remembered, yeah, no, not at all,

53:11.280 --> 53:16.800
I get it, I can see the comparison, no one cares about the Goonies, nobody cares about me, I care

53:16.800 --> 53:23.440
about you, oh man, I want to see this commercial, I got, that's what I wasn't getting, I got high

53:23.440 --> 53:28.160
with Dick Donner, the director of the Goonies, but I didn't know that it was Richard Donner,

53:28.160 --> 53:33.840
yeah, he was just... It's Dick to Jeff, because he got high with him. I didn't know, I didn't know

53:33.840 --> 53:39.120
it was Richard Donner who created like Superman and directed Superman. The creator of Superman,

53:39.120 --> 53:46.560
Richard Donner, I remember when I created Superman, I remember the first drawing of

53:46.560 --> 53:53.600
Superman when I was... He directed Superman. I was Richard Donner and I drew, wrote and created

53:53.600 --> 54:03.040
Superman before making the movie Superman and the Goonies. I'm on your side. I'm on your side.

54:03.040 --> 54:11.920
I'm Richard Donner, Dick Donner to my Google's friends. How many of you guys, honestly, like by

54:11.920 --> 54:19.200
applause and you know... That was a good Richard Donner. I'm predicting 8% some of you guys who

54:19.200 --> 54:23.840
are on the cusp that are going to do that, you're going to fake this to make yourselves feel younger.

54:25.040 --> 54:31.920
So that's margin of error 8%, but applaud if you didn't get the Goonies references.

54:33.920 --> 54:39.280
Okay, that's a margin of 8%, that's like, yeah, so like four people. Okay, I'm still...

54:40.480 --> 54:45.760
Applaud if you didn't enjoy yourself anyway. I'm actually kind of sick. I've never thought that

54:45.760 --> 54:59.440
that movie... Reddit is going. Schrabs clapping exaggeratedly.

55:02.560 --> 55:08.240
I didn't get... Oftentimes, I don't hear the first half of what Rob says, so I just catch

55:08.240 --> 55:15.520
him on the tail and I'm like, what is happening? That's all that matters. But I would have been

55:15.520 --> 55:18.400
fine, by the way, if it was the whole audience. I would have been a little regretful of making

55:18.400 --> 55:25.520
you listen to 10 minutes of radio play about Goonies, but... Why are these chairs taped off for

55:25.520 --> 55:33.680
you, sir? Can you read off those names on that tape? Bright Bart? Like the supremacy.

55:33.680 --> 55:38.160
And Hickenbotham. Okay, these are fuckers that I invited.

55:39.920 --> 55:45.760
Where? You there? Born in Hickenbotham? So in the future... I thought you were...

55:45.760 --> 55:51.040
Jeff... You have seats up front of the fucker, your fucking bum... Walk it down here and get

55:51.040 --> 55:56.080
your... In the future, we'll have Jeff tell you that we're roping off seats for you. That way,

55:56.080 --> 56:01.440
you'll know. This guy's name is Hickenbotham? I was late, I didn't want to interrupt.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.760
All right, get down there. Thank God you didn't do that.

56:08.240 --> 56:13.680
That's not his fault. That's not his fault. Somebody's name born like Jason Bourne with an

56:13.680 --> 56:17.600
E and someone's name is Hickenbotham, which sounds like a made-up name. It is a weird...

56:17.600 --> 56:21.360
Like you picture Jason Bourne when you picture... And then Hickenbotham, you picture like a

56:21.360 --> 56:31.280
jug band. Welcome Hickenbotham and Bourne, everybody. Here's Hickenbotham and Bourne's He-Haw Act from

56:31.280 --> 56:36.800
years ago. Hey, Jason, is it true that...

56:36.800 --> 56:47.040
You want... You want to start?

56:47.040 --> 56:53.920
Yeah, I wanted to come up from the cornstalk, but he's in a place...

56:53.920 --> 56:55.440
Do you want to start from the top?

56:57.280 --> 56:58.480
Till the music goes away.

56:58.480 --> 57:03.360
Look what happened. It looks like another Hickenbotham and Bourne sketch.

57:03.360 --> 57:07.440
Okay, all right. Well, it's not going to hold up, but that's okay.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.960
Hey, hey...

57:14.240 --> 57:16.960
Hey, hey, Bourne. Yeah, Hickenbotham.

57:17.680 --> 57:23.200
Is it true when you sit in any room, you always are aware of where the exits are

57:23.200 --> 57:25.200
and how to field strip any weapon?

57:25.840 --> 57:30.240
Yeah, but I still can't get my ex-wife to stop taking elimony.

57:30.240 --> 57:33.920
He-Haw!

57:37.760 --> 57:42.000
Now, I know you saw the Goonies, but I also know I got away with that because

57:42.000 --> 57:48.080
you've never seen He-Haw. I've barely seen He-Haw, and I'm a test tube baby.

57:48.080 --> 57:48.960
That's how old I am.

57:48.960 --> 57:53.680
Yeah, they strip up behind like plywood corn and told jokes.

57:53.680 --> 57:54.080
Yeah.

57:54.080 --> 57:54.800
Very good.

57:54.800 --> 58:00.480
Hey, duck, did you- I heard an invisible man can't outshine your cornpone.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.200
Say what?

58:06.480 --> 58:11.280
They also would have a bit which where they would have like,

58:11.280 --> 58:16.400
they would have this old man with glasses and a mustache sitting in a window

58:17.280 --> 58:23.280
miming like he's wiping the window, but there was no glass, and then you would hear off camera,

58:23.280 --> 58:30.960
hey grandpa, what's for supper? Well, we've got corn on the cob and rice and beans,

58:30.960 --> 58:34.000
and we also got some green beans too.

58:34.880 --> 58:38.240
Yum, yum, and then they would go back, and then that was it, that was it.

58:38.880 --> 58:43.120
That was the best, they did it every single episode.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.920
And remember Roy Clark and what's his name?

58:45.920 --> 58:49.920
They would sing that she met another and she was got,

58:49.920 --> 58:54.560
but like the gimmick was they'd sing the same song every time, but then the runner was that

58:54.560 --> 58:59.920
they would they would in each other's spaces and then they would like break and laugh.

58:59.920 --> 59:04.240
There was a lot of, the 70s culture was all about people breaking and laughing at what they were

59:04.240 --> 59:06.400
doing, so like the cannonball run was like-

59:06.400 --> 59:09.680
Yeah, it was like the hillbilly version of Laughin where-

59:09.680 --> 59:10.560
Yeah, that's exactly.

59:10.560 --> 59:11.440
More progressive.

59:11.440 --> 59:14.160
You could get away with a lot of just like, you barely had to-

59:14.160 --> 59:18.960
My wife told me, honey, it's our 50th wedding anniversary tonight, let's run upstairs and

59:18.960 --> 59:21.200
have sex, and I told her I cannot do both.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.320
I might look hard to get, but I can be had.

59:35.600 --> 59:36.720
These are hee-haw jugs.

59:36.720 --> 59:40.080
Yeah, I think it's time to introduce the band, and the band would all get up and-

59:40.080 --> 59:41.120
Hello, my name's James.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.360
They'd all get up and shake hands.

59:43.360 --> 59:46.480
You know what would be interesting, because I was thinking, oh you're like a digital Henny

59:46.480 --> 59:51.120
Youngman, and I was thinking, it'd be interesting to do like, no one's in like a full new wave,

59:51.120 --> 59:55.600
like Gary Newman version of Henny Youngman, like a guy that just like looks like a corpse,

59:55.600 --> 01:00:03.440
and he's got like baggy eyes, and he just has like goth hair, and he tells these like

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.080
one-liners, and then does like Gary Newman's things.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.120
My wife came to me and told me that she doesn't want to see me anymore.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.680
I said, I can't riff a one-liner.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.920
I said, why don't you poke your eyes out?

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.600
Me and my cars, me and my car, friends are electric.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.400
It's just Zach Galifianakis, but the piano's electric.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.160
I mean, look, I don't care if what I want to see is compatible with the planet anymore.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.880
I'm very comfortable retiring from the earth, I just want to-

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.760
What's one thing that you're comfortable not seeing?

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.120
Well, I'm still kind of getting used to like the Twitter addiction,

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.360
like I've been off of Twitter for a month now.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.160
You've lost like 40 characters.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.800
I still have like a kind of like residual like sense of loss, like a phantom limb.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:17.920
I mean, like a decade is a long time to express yourself and connect to others

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.600
in one specific medium.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.040
Even my generation isn't used to such stability.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.400
Things usually change faster than Twitter even did.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:38.560
I still feel like a kind of like, oh, like the myth of the soldier who like my arm hurts,

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.880
and it's like your arm got blown off.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.920
It's like you have this like, I'm like, I should tweet this.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.040
Kind of like you still have this sort of like electrical impulse.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.120
Like that's a tweet, but you can't tweet it.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:55.040
And then because of that subsides, it's very much like because I quit smoking.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.960
I smoked from 18 to 32.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.960
So kind of a comparable addiction like level as far as like what to get over.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.480
And so if it is like smoking, then I then I guess like maybe a month from now,

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.640
it'll parabolically get to the point where I'll be like, oh, did I used to tweet?

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.360
You know, like because I forget that I was ever a smoker.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.480
But like that first couple months is like, God damn it.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.360
What the fuck?

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.880
Your whole neurology is based around this minute to minute like flowchart.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.680
It's just like a whole section of your flowchart is taken out.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:37.040
And it's tough because we are none of us like we are right to not admit

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.640
that it's important to us.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.200
Like why would we want to say that?

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.600
We know that it's stupid.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.320
And so that actually makes it harder, same as with cigarettes.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.360
Because cigarettes don't say, it's good for you.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.800
Like they show like a cowboy going like, I'm just fucking do what I fucking want.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.760
You know, like the messaging of cigarettes is like fuck, fuck society and fucking die

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.200
before you could fucking kill me.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.880
That's a great commercial for cigarettes.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.720
Good luck killing me, mother fucker.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.840
Can't shoot a corpse.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.680
That really is kind of the message.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.080
I'll be dead 40 seconds before you kill me.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.080
But yeah, so it's those kind of like benign little things.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.840
Like I work what I'm hoping will return is like the blogging instinct or something.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.600
I think I have so I so miss my 27 year old self.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:40.480
I miss my I miss that that kid that that was so trustful of the internet.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:49.280
And so like so actually like appropriately self loathing just enough that all he wanted

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:55.040
was to actually just splay himself scatter himself against the rocks of the internet

01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:01.920
and say, yeah, look at every fucking shitty little piece of me and choke on it.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:07.600
Like I like that guy that I think that guy's punk rock and interesting and

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.760
but I don't know if at 45 you can.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760
I don't know if it's healthy to emulate that guy.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.160
We all know that's what 45 year old guys do.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:21.040
They try to emulate 27 year olds and then they the result is a little messy.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.800
It results in a sunroof basically sunroof with a big spot.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:31.120
What about doing like a diaristic thing like Davis Derrister's where he writes,

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.320
you know, like little shirts.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.000
Well, that's what I'm basically I'm hoping that that that maybe that this Twitter

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.240
that that Twitter point of the neurology will that that it represents like a cauterized

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:48.160
like thing that that will force a new neurology pattern that that that behind that is an impulse

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.960
to share and and explore and that it will be forced after a while.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.600
I don't want to force it that it will it will grow like and I'll go like, damn,

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:04.480
I just want to fucking write like I'm waiting to my therapist said like you have to create a new

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:11.200
personality that doesn't isn't linked to your brand and your fame and all these things because

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.640
these things are those things are not like you're you're you're nostalgic for an age before you

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:22.960
were famous and and so that kid is shooting a slingshot at the moon and that's freedom of

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.080
expression. That's really like that's when you're that's when you're hot and you're interesting

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:34.000
and you're saying things that like people want to listen to and then you like so if you if you

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.920
have any hope you really what you really need to and you want to share your thoughts online what you

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.240
what I need to do is like keep an actual diary like I did when I was 27 but it's like the difficult

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:50.080
thing is like I need to like become a different person I need to like just be some random person

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:57.680
who has zero followers on monday and bachmann books bachmann books yeah yeah be a richard bachmann

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.760
be a bachmann but it's but but it's I mean I tell you need to be a bachmann bachmann am I being

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:10.640
a pain in the ass Dan just to suggest again that like you you you knuckle down and write features

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.320
that the stuff that you want to get off your chest and don't like like do do the thing that's the

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.080
scariest I have jobs and stuff that'll be very fulfilling and and and all that stuff but I'm

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:25.840
talking about like the the kind of like driftwood part of the stuff that's still part joy and part

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:34.240
what I am good at like that like like I have I'm obviously like so focused on Rick and Morty

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:45.120
right now and and don't want a drop of myself to risk like not going into that barrel but the

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:52.640
truth is that there's a bunch of me that's of no use to Rick and Morty and I would I would like to

01:06:52.640 --> 01:07:02.720
think that I'm still capable of like writing of like of going like this is the day I had this is

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:09.040
how I feel about the world this is this is this is what I want to say to anyone who finds this

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:15.600
after I'm dead for me like as a friend of yours I'm gonna hear most of what's already on your mind

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:20.720
because we hang out but I would like to have it in paper form I would like to have that as a me

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.560
too I want to go back to that that's what I'm saying like I feel like when I remember when

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:29.840
Twitter came out because I was I was I was Spencer's age when my space happened and I remember walking

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:36.160
with my friend Stephen Notley who's been on this podcast he I remember I remember him as the

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.040
literally the first person that said the word blog to me and we were walking back from the

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.960
rustic Inn to my my place in Las Feliz and he was he was talking about technology and how excited he

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:52.240
was and and he said like oh and people are doing these blogs now and I'm like what what's a blog

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:56.400
and he's like oh it's just like this crazy thing it's like this cultural revolution where people

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.920
are keeping these online diaries and they're just sharing whatever like it's like like there's like

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.240
there's an there's a guy that is an artist for Disney and he just says whatever the fuck he

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.440
wants to say like he works at Disney but it's like it's hard for us to understand that but back

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:16.160
then it was like it was kind of like a loophole the internet was like sort of like in your wildest

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:21.200
dreams anyone's ever gonna listen to this because it's still what Dan rather thinks that's important

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:27.840
and we we exited that age so blindingly fast that we can't even remember that it was like

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:33.680
we went to the internet to actually put messages in bottles and we're like wouldn't it be hilarious

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:41.040
if anybody ever found this and and and like that culture was so interesting I don't know if we

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:48.800
can ever get it back but I I remember when Twitter started happening how unmistakable it was it was

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:58.240
as clear as as as the difference between cocaine which I have snorted numerous times to to great

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:04.160
end and like talked about improv for six hours with people the only other people who on coke would

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:11.600
want to talk about improv for six hours and then I remember getting that key bump of crystal like

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.240
like like in a bathroom where it was like and it was like this burn and it was like what the

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:24.160
fuck is wrong with your coke and and that friend going that wasn't coke I was like yeah it was shiny

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.520
and it was like that was crystal meth and it was like it was ground up and I was like

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:38.960
good why do I want to go home and like like violate my sofa like like I don't want to talk to anyone

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:44.800
about improv but I want to build a rocket I don't know what I want it was just a different thing

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.040
and it didn't really matter if it was better or worse it was just the fact that it kind of made

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:55.840
the other thing obsolete and and I because I read and I remember what Twitter it was like it was

01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.320
like oh micro blogging and I was like I noticed I was like tweeting and people were making fun of

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.560
Twitter and they're like oh you know because Twitter would say what's going on and then you'd

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.280
answer going uh I don't know and everyone was like tweet I don't know what the fuck is this what's

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:15.600
this shit what is the funny um and and then it was like you just noticed I was like oh I'm not

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:22.880
blogging anymore I why would I when there was this rush like like who was I kidding about why I was

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:30.000
blogging and yet the irony is that the the the discipline was more admirable also also the

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.280
blogging thing was a way of micro writing where you could have been putting down things on paper

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:40.560
in there could they could have been novels or short stories or diaristic the big catch 22 is

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:46.560
that no you know this is where I want to let all of us off the hook it's like I mean like we got to

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.160
we got to accept that the fact is that we're motivated by by a lot more than craftsmanship

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.920
we just simply it is really hard to tell somebody to keep a journal and put it under their bed

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.960
every night there's a couple people out here maybe are like what do you mean that's the easiest

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.640
thing in the world I love doing it you fucking won the neurological lottery because there is this

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:15.280
like like insidious like weird like lobe of your brain that is goes back to when you're a chimp I

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.920
think that's just like yeah but when you're a kid and there's no internet writing in a in a spiral

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:28.320
notebook about how your day went I have five spiral notebooks filled with my dumb ass 16-year-old

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:35.840
thoughts because there wasn't enough internet back then for me to be that narcissistic in in in digital

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:41.200
form and if there was Twitter when I was that age I wouldn't have written these obnoxious essays

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:45.840
is it about the immediacy of it like if you I think it's just well I think it's just what we're

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:52.160
seeking like if you get a job writing a tv show or a film and you go okay I have to work on this I

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:59.040
get notes it all goes it takes months and months maybe years and years for you for you and Rob to

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:04.480
write a thing together or you alone to write a thing is it the immediacy yeah I think it's the

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:10.480
ratio I think it is it's like like like to take a little piece of what you just said if you get a

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.960
job doing something like the like it's like Dorothy Parker said like I I hate writing I love having

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:24.640
written but also like I like I can't I can't give you I can't give you a first draft but I love

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.280
closing the deal the right one like like that day that you run off of the Warner Brothers a lot and

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:36.160
you're like they fucking bought it what the fuck talking robots meet a spongebob you run out to the

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.840
barn you're like I'm gonna tell spongebob's gonna say this and then this robot dick's gonna come on oh my

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.680
god this is gonna be the best movie ever and then like the and then you're like you wake up the next

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.480
day and you're like I got a fucking dopamine rush off of selling that movie I'm not gonna write it

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:55.040
if Dorothy if Dorothy Parker or Winston Churchill or Juno Barnes or like like like all these hilarious

01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:01.040
like all the Algonquin roundtable writers had Twitter they wouldn't have written shit they

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.680
would just go oh I get the dopamine rush of having said one little epigram and made everybody

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.120
fucking freak out and then I can go to bed and do drugs forever it's really what we're good at I mean

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.720
again that's a that's a not to drive it into the ground but that's that sapiens book like it doesn't

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.680
mention Twitter I don't think once but it's very it's glaring it's throbbing off of that book when

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.720
it talks about like the what I was talking about how we defeated Neanderthals and Homo erectus because

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:37.280
of our predilection for gossip like our it's it's it's eerily uplifting and downtrodding to

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.680
learn that your species is doing all the things that it's currently doing not as some weird by

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:50.880
product of sentience which is this like race from animal to god but that exactly what we're doing

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:57.120
right now is exactly the thing that we've always been good at and is the we tweeted the Neanderthals

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:04.400
out of existence you we expect expect that to be well we have our our our gossip our particular

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:11.760
our ability to to to understand things beyond a hundred people is how we beat all of the other

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.240
forms of human his technical term for it was that sapiens developed like sentience and then

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:22.880
subjectivity the ability to think abstractly and then when you can relate abstract ideas it's

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:29.600
gossip so like if I say to you I go hey did you hear that this guy Jeremy Johnson like like what

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:36.640
he said about like how we should kick the Neanderthals ass like you we we are we our species was able

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:42.080
to to reach that Neanderthals couldn't do that they couldn't go like hey you did you hear what

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:48.240
Ugg said about what it's it's just like like they they they were arguably more intelligent than us

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:53.600
on like a local level like they like we probably I think we would have really gotten along with them

01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.680
could we do a scene where a almost sapiens meets a Neanderthal and tries to try to gossip with

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:08.160
try to gossip with with a Neanderthal okay please give us a music cue

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:16.560
do stand up from the corn do corn husk no no it's more of a scene right i'm coming i'm visiting

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:24.720
your cave i'm coming around and i think i could i suggest could i make a suggestion that the okay

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:33.280

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:51.200
hundred million years a hundred million years well this morning maybe you have you think you

cake and a fucking last chance what all right bone mar got the boys outside all right use those

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:09.600
special things from the netgeo documentary that that are like they look like an incense holder

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:16.240
but there's a match in them that throws an arrow farther than any spear can go at a level okay

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:22.320
where here we are standing back further than any spear can can land uh i'm using our like weird

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:31.280
highlight you're gonna i'm gonna hide behind a rock let them fly you you you you you you you

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:43.600
you guys dead you extinct oh boy it's gonna be a long epoch there are epochs and there are epochs

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:53.840
yeah that was good though it's like uh i don't think mel bricks could have done that better

01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:02.160
i think it tells a story about how we got here but look i don't think the neanderthals were like

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:08.240
dumb i bet i think that that's the that's the weird thing i think that all of we were humans so we

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.960
were all way above chimpanzees and when you look at chimpanzees you're like jesus christ these dudes

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:20.160
are really close to like they're so you everybody that was the end of those like you know bob neanderthal

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:27.120
goes up to jill neanderthal and goes hey do you hear about jim over there and then the other one

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:33.200
would go like hey man don't do that well he's like i think i think he's like that was it i no i think

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.880
i think i think you got a hundred neanderthal tribe and the one neanderthal goes up the other

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:42.800
goes like hey did you hear about jim and if he has heard about jim and he knows jim he's like

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:52.480
got yeah totally gotcha and and but what we invented was the idea of like hey did you hear about this

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:59.920
guy jim who's jim well anyways he's this guy from 30 miles away you maybe you'll meet him one day

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:05.280
maybe you won't but he's like this right and so he's looking at this snake and the snake like

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.800
tries to bite him and he grabs it and he fucking eats it jim's a hero pass the word along jim's the

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:17.440
fucking best in fact you know the snakes i'm going to give you actually a piece of fabric that has

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:24.320
the word j on it and like it means jim and like if we ever come around and we go like dude jim

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:28.640
needs to fucking muscle up the neanderthals are giving us trouble like can we count on you guys

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:36.960
my my handshakes my bond like we'll leave you in peace these concepts the concept of of of of

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:46.400
of it's a shirt don't overreact a shirt fell off my lap but it's it's it's basically that it's our

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:53.200
ability to believe in things that aren't that are not real weaponizing weaponizing abstract thought

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.600
here's a way that we would have loved that we would love to hang out with neanderthals right now

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:04.720
is that neanderthals would be like hey can you hang out tomorrow night and we would say no neanderthal

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:10.160
i have to work and the neanderthal would go why i just asked if you want to hang out tomorrow night

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:17.200
it's gonna be the best by neanderthal standards and we'd be like i know i can't because even though

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:24.480
i'm square right now with american express like i i if i don't keep working i might get fired and if

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:30.800
i do get fired i won't be able to pay and the neanderthals like whoa whoa whoa i'm asking if you

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.840
want to hang out tomorrow night like neanderthals basically styles in teen wolf like like like

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:47.200
it it's it's it's every it's every um i take offense to that because it's being in the moment

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.000
i mean i thought like like we kind of invented being out of the moment it's kind of sad like

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.840
like like that we yeah that's we invented we invented the but it's also it's just as good

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:03.200
too though we invented peter pan and we invented taxes well i mean i got a theory oh yeah we're

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.080
definitely if you look at the brain patterns and like that type of thing if you take abstract

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.920
thought and like things that can distract you from a meditative state for instance right

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.960
so like uh regrets what happened yesterday what i'm gonna do tomorrow things that you want to

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.840
happen to stream of consciousness or whatever a lot of monks and a lot of serious motherfuckers

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.760
dedicate 50 70 years in a cave to get to that level to even like get rid of that stream we barely

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:34.160
even know what that type of a mind is capable of we're best able to do 200 hours certification

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.280
i'm in i mean yeah at the very least what was that a yupa light we're a yup nation out there

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.120
you're trying to create a yup army around right here i mean yo i got people i got i got eyes on

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:49.040
every corner you overthrowing my neanderthal tribe go ahead please it is well anyway just

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.080
long story short so i've studied the yoga and stuff and it's either bullshit or it's not

01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.080
but what these guys say what these guys say is that these high-level motherfucker monks

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:08.480
could do some heavy-duty shit like but everywhere from levitation to laser beams being able to you

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:14.240
know teleport to being able to commune with deities or call things to happen to healings

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:20.000
that's why i that are another mystic traditions like jc laying down the miracles and shit which

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.200
all happen to be classic yoga master miracles just saying but anyway i'm saying if the fact

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.880
that it was a different brain or a different thought pattern and that we we didn't have access

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.560
to uh you know abstract thought and being able to weaponize that i think harari overlooks the

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:43.840
capabilities of like a fully whatever neanderthal or yogic or whatever meditative mind and we have

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.360
no way of knowing that but if you want to if you want to get down to the nitty gritty of it what

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:52.720
i'm scared of and my takeaway from it was there was major competition or a reason that these species

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:57.280
like one after each other and i think you know it just yeah it's the reason is us you know what

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.240
you know what i'm scared of is like i'm scared that we're gonna meet an alien planet and that the

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:10.480
alien planet is gonna it's just gonna have like crab monsters that are like they're like kind of

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:16.240
like 90 iq crab people and they're like we come in peace and we're like okay we can deal you're

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:22.240
basically uh antiques roadshow viewer we're like we're ready to rock i i don't know why i took a

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.800
shot at i just picked a random group of people to take a shot at it was the randomest i have no

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:37.680
opinion about you if you watch antiques i'm so sorry i went so lateral i'm so gun shy about

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:44.560
like picking fights with anybody that are just like just punched like the basically the the

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:51.280
demographic equivalent of the of the blind melon girl dressed as a bumblebee like pow and it's just

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:58.240
like i don't know where to land this bam antiques roadshow viewers what did they do to deserve this

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:04.320
today i would i would have gone junior kick bus anyways i like like like like so so like these

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.160
crab creatures go like we come in peace and we're like we come in peace too and they're like we love

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.640
crab stuff and we're like we love crab stuff too like we're down like how about you send some

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:18.480
crab people to our planet like we'll shut down some red lobsters during your visit to avoid

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.200
awkwardness and you will probably have monkey restaurants that you need to shut down but

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:27.760
like we'll send some emissaries to your planet i'm worried that our emissaries basically what

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.760
i'm learning from the sapiens book is that the thing that will happen i'm not i'm not i'm not

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:38.560
really worried about this happening i'm i'm i'm expressing a concern about our species is that

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:44.720
that we're the kind of species that if that happened and we went to their planet everything

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:50.880
would be kosher until we got to their planet and they were like so anyways here's some flowers

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:54.960
the flowers oh these flowers are nice and the flowers like don't fuck with me motherfucker

01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:00.160
and we'd be like whoa flower just talked shit and the crab and we're like yeah sometimes the

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:07.200
flowers talk shit and and and we'd be like you gotta get your flowers in line bro like and they're

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.880
like no crabs live among the flowers uh they're like okay well who pollinates the thing well the

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:19.200
bees do have you met the bees i'm a bee i'm a bee like wait are they smart bees or dumb bees

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:26.320
well we don't really judge uh there's they have brains they're super smart and like and we're just

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:30.720
like we will without even realizing what they're like dude like like it's kind of remember when

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:34.800
i told my story of going to fiji and it's like i couldn't just fucking relax like i had these like

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:43.040
like these these people that live in fucking like just they just live in like what i call garbage

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:50.080
and have what i call unreasonable smiles on their face and have been trained by a hotel slash like

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:54.880
their thing and like all i can do is fucking drink their mystical root and like like i think

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:59.680
i'm being a good guy by trying to stir up shit i'm like seriously though it's fucked up if the

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:05.440
army runs your island like like i'm like i'm like it's like gossip it's like it's like what i can't

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:11.760
fucking like like take it easy like like like maybe shit that doesn't seem i just i fear that

01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:18.240
homo sapiens is that's like it's weird now i realize it's weird having read that book that

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:24.080
we are that that there's grizzly bears and brown bears and black bears and there's all these things

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:29.280
and it's like nope we're just the only human and that we've actually worked that into our history

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:35.600
that we teach ourselves and he meant we go like yep there can be only one no yeah if you're a

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:42.160
serial killer like like there can be only one and that we would react poorly to an intergalactic

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:47.600
community that we that they would meet us at a party if if if volkins or anybody came around

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:53.680
they would be like dude these people can't handle spiders talking to them because they they they

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:59.440
have it built into them they believe that every planet has to have a fucking kirk on it that like

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:06.080
tells the planet what to do and they they believe that because they're basically like dexter they

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:11.680
were born in blood and they believe that you have to kill in order to live and they they're like

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:18.400
genocidal maniacs and to the point where their pecassos don't know that they're genocidal maniacs

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:24.000
like people that believe in not genocide are genocidal maniacs they just believe in like this

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.800
pyramid structure that we we're unique in the universe in that regard because the the leverage

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:36.240
that we used on some other planet there's like a grasshopper species it's like yeah jump really high

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:43.200
and i like i jump so high that eventually i they didn't become sentient like they they just became

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:50.000
like this really like amazing high jumping dominant species that was like so facile that they kind of

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.760
like yeah they're arguably in charge of the planet but then they're operating a kind of co

01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:01.120
cooperation with like a tree that grabs you if you move too fast and eats you with its trunk

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:06.720
and we're going to show up and go come on what's the fucking episode here who do i kill and they're

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:11.920
going to be like whoa whoa flow bill like no one invited you to this wild west show and we're like

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:17.760
no no where's the side show who's who do i lasso i i i worry that that's actually i don't worry

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.040
that that's gonna happen because in our wildest dreams we'll ever meet anyone from another planet

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:26.000
i'm worried that that's what we are that that's the disease we have that we actually don't even

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.360
know we're suffering from it because we have no one to talk to about it let me throw you a counter

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.000
point that's who we were before we got to like a globalized like structure of society that we kind

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
of were approaching but you can't you can't if you kill everybody if you kill everybody you

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
could have talked to we need to we need to clone neanderthals and we need to talk to them that's

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:51.600
our only hope but the end of dexter's uh ambidextrous what the amb the end of dexter sucks all right

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.840
my thing is think about how many human generations it took to get to the i thought he said the amb

01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:02.800
the ambidextrous sex i said i was i was like tell me more and then it was like oh no no

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:10.720
white white how does dexter end he gets away with it he moves away secretly to uh

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:15.840
he becomes a lumberjack and now another and now he kills wait how is that a bad ending for dexter

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:25.360
you wanted to just keep killing people i expected more from you or are you born i don't know i

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:31.200
there's only one way to find out get him if he if he breaks all our necks and and and interpol

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:36.960
can't catch him that was the higgin bottom how would you how would you have an ended dexter

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:48.560
like after you saw him go become a lumberjack you were like well i clearly they should have

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:53.360
done this right i mean what was the you're eating cake well let him answer let him answer

01:34:53.360 --> 01:35:02.320
i mean i i like that bro something something like actually well we don't have to all right

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:08.240
well i one hand i one hand don't do that to him on the other hand do you know how that feels see

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:16.560
to hear fucking humanity while you're just treading water oh oh oh oh oh yeah come on

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:24.240
he becomes a superhero at the end of at the end that's a good way to end

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.600
is that he just goes like now but you know what now i know what i need to do and he like gets

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.040
off the payphone like neo and he just like flies up another camera look i'm not saying you're wrong

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:40.800
i stopped watching after episode six because as with lost i know when i'm being dicked around

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:49.280
i know i know when i'm watching improv and when i'm watching

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:56.160
i don't like serialization you if you're gonna serialize your show you got a you

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:02.880
like you got another thing you got you you you better make the most of that fucking season

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:08.720
you better blow my fucking gen X mind at the end of that season because i got as a

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.840
millennials coming and pitch me shit at my shitty little studio that should just die anyway so who

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.720
cares but like like like like you hear a millennial go pitching they'll go like it's like for better

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:22.880
and for worse like in the post netflix world the the millennial writers would be like so

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:32.640
the show i want to do is uh groundhog day meets groundhog day and but here's the thing but but

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:39.200
so it meets a first season no groundhog day nothing it's just a guy shaving and then he

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:44.240
keeps shaving every episode two through fourteen he's like his beard keeps like it's like where's

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.640
something wrong with my beard and like end of that season it's like oh shit saucer comes down

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.560
outer space it's groundhog day planet now seasons two through seven i'm like wait what in the

01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:05.120
fucking entitlement like what you you kids with your serialization like unbelievable i i you already

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:14.240
rejected my pitch now this is just this is just me it was bad enough the first time but i want to

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:21.520
say also i'm a convert because i i i talked shit about mind hunter like every episode kept hate

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:26.240
watching mind hunter stupid mind hunter i got to the end of mind hunter like right like the last

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:33.200
couple episodes i started getting sucked in mind mind hunter don't mind hunter he hunts mind don't

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:41.440
mind hunter he's just a little bit abrasive don't mind hunter now hunter are you going to behave

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:48.160
yourself don't mind hunter is he german i what was his last was mind hunter my point is if you're

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.120
gonna if you're gonna serialize your television please like really understand that the reason

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:58.720
you're serializing it is for a reason it's like minecraft tiles like like can you can you make

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:03.520
this mark as like a tile pattern like like because that's a certain amount of bits or you're gonna

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:09.440
make it react as if when you place like a 16-bit video game when you're texturing does your texture

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.920
when it when it's placed next to another texture okay does it have to change in order for it to

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:22.480
tile properly it's shit like that like like rick and morty is a like i would like to think it's

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:28.960
like a like every tile is like you could come in anywhere i always said that i always thought i also

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:35.600
thought that about community but then people said i was wrong but like it's like my model is crack

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:45.280
rocks every rock gets you high every rock makes you want to smoke all the crack in order in order

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:53.200
of the crack you want to go back podcasting plays that out make it you make a podcast and then people

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:59.760
are like jesus christ now i gotta go back 200 episodes of this shit oh speaking of which uh so

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:07.680
david cummings the canadian uh horror host of uh the uh no sleep podcast levy levy told me that

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:15.120
his agent reached out and he wants to come on the show because i think i said like if i correct me

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:19.280
right what i said was because i was like oh i want to talk about this like my new passion is this

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.800
this guy who sounds like scott thompson he does this horror host thing and then uh i i believe

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:30.400
what i said uh and if i didn't i'll say it now is if you're if this is gonna get back to you

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:36.400
because i'm so tired of me talking about shit that i love and then people like yeah i'm causing

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:45.200
damage with my lenny breaking the rabbit's neck hugs like like like like uh like i don't want to

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:50.320
have that effect i don't like that when people are like oh ron jeremy you did a banana you think

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:56.240
you know that whole effect i'm not but if you're out there and you you reddited ron jeremy about

01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.640
the banana thing don't it's not your fault either it's just who we are we're a fucking horrible

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:05.520
species what the enderthals what doesn't matter it doesn't matter what's the podcast david i think

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:11.200
what i said was david comings pleased to sort of symbolize the fact that i mean you no harm in

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:16.000
talking about how i love how funny it is that there is i'll fly you out first class and you

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.800
want if you want to be on the show i don't know his podcast it's called the no sleep podcast if

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:24.480
you just type in no sleep you'll get a different podcast that he has two episodes and it's about

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:31.360
like chicago comics or something there's a podcast called the no sleep podcast it's it's like and it's

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:37.760
at least 11th season it's been going on forever if you go back from the beginning it's amazing

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:45.600
this guy david comings he sounds like scott thompson and he's just like as the sun goes down on the

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:52.800
it's a scary stories podcast and then he does he just it's just people narrating scary stories

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:58.960
but it's so canadian it's really funny it's really fun is it it makes me it gives me like a dose of

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:05.520
warmth that i need in a cold world it's sincere it is sincere but that's not to say that that you

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:10.480
can't enjoy it well that's not to say that the podcast doesn't it takes itself real seriously

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:15.840
it would be mad if you laughed at it do you think i'd like it i think you would yes i could but it's

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:22.160
been on for 11 seasons yeah you're first telling me now well i just found it i just found it through

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:29.760
another podcast called uh the creepy it's just called creepy john grills who's in uh minnesota

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:36.080
who so i mistook him for canadian uh but he emailed me because i became a patreon subscriber

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:41.600
and then i wrote a thing and i had yeah whatever but he he his endless plugging of the no sleep

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:48.480
podcast should i listen to creepy i don't think you'd like it i don't want to like i don't like

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:53.760
recommend more of a no sleep guy to me all right i think you yeah i don't know

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:02.160
was that not what you were asking for i can't hear what you're saying yeah there's a problem

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:10.560
on this stage i wrote this i i what don't you say i wish that mine you're like more of a no sleep

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:19.840
guy to me all right i wish that there was enough of a signal up here that i could we're gonna get

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:26.000
you a horizon phone for the stage i had this guy who does this creepy pasta podcast creepy i i he

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.880
like i told you if you're a patreon subscriber at the top level one of the luxuries the tears is

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:36.960
you can send him a script and he'll read it like as if it's creepy pasta and i i sent a thing called

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:44.960
creepy pasta yeah it's it's derived from the term copy pasta which is an aberration of the phrase

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:52.640
