Did I hear a youp from Dave Kline out there? Can we get a universal youp? I think we're\n\n00:43.960 --> 00:51.120\nready to go. Hello, my name is Jeff Bryan Davis. I'm very happy to be back controlling. I know that\n\n00:51.120 --> 00:58.880\nwe all love Brandon Johnson, but his reign of terror is over. It's my honor to announce once\n\n00:58.880 --> 01:10.880\nagain from beautiful MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, Harmontown is now in session. Spencer\n\n01:10.880 --> 01:25.440\nCrittenden, the Game Master extraordinaire. Did he get thinner or is he farther away from me right\n\n01:25.440 --> 01:33.680\nnow? Both. Did you get sexy candles? Oh, yeah. I love it. Why don't we bring out just just for\n\n01:33.680 --> 01:57.360\ngood fun a mayor. Let's call him Dan Harmon. Thank you. Jeff Davis, revoiced. Revoiced. I can talk\n\n01:57.360 --> 02:06.840\nagain. Yeah. Revoiced. Moist. The larynx is re-moist. Voiced. Maybe I can rap with you. Maybe you\n\n02:06.840 --> 02:18.960\ncan sing a tune. Maybe I can pee and poop. Maybe I can get a harpoon. Am I a whale? Yes. And I'm a\n\n02:18.960 --> 02:27.840\nwhaler. Riding on my ship. There she blows. It turns out it took three months to find out you\n\n02:27.840 --> 02:36.880\nand I are bad at improv. I'm with the show. Okay. Not like we're going to hurt you. Welcome back,\n\n02:36.880 --> 02:46.880\neverybody. It's good to see you all again. I missed you so much. Do you now have, are you like when\n\n02:46.880 --> 02:52.880\nour friends have quadruple bypasses and they're like secretly, they're like, I can eat anything now.\n\n02:52.880 --> 02:59.360\nI think I'm probably one and a half weeks away from being full like stage voice, but I get to go,\n\n02:59.360 --> 03:06.800\nha, I can do that now. And who didn't miss me going, ha, that's the best part of everything. You\n\n03:06.800 --> 03:14.880\ncan't do karaoke yet. I could, but I shouldn't. Right. Wait, what you got? Well, you could do,\n\n03:14.880 --> 03:21.680\nyou could do like George Michael, but not Neil Diamond. No, I could do Neil Diamond.\n\n03:22.400 --> 03:27.840\nNo, Neil, George Michael, like, well, you could do just the certain parts of George. Well, I guess\n\n03:27.840 --> 03:34.640\nit would be nice if I could touch your body. That's like nice and easy. Just give me some hot tea.\n\n03:34.640 --> 03:44.720\nThat's because you're a tenor. I'm a baritone. I can go money talks. I can sing in the baritone.\n\n03:44.720 --> 03:53.120\nYou sing more in a tenor. Even though you look like Pavarotti. No, but he's a tenor. So yeah,\n\n03:53.120 --> 03:58.480\nthere you are. Yeah. What is it? What is a tenor? That's, so that's like, so it goes, it goes all\n\n03:58.480 --> 04:09.280\nthe way up to 11ers or what is the, it doesn't get any better. See, there's nothing written. So\n\n04:09.280 --> 04:13.680\nactually you should be impressed by that. I don't, I'm not saying you have to be. It's just like,\n\n04:13.680 --> 04:20.160\nif you're not, it's going to be a long night. But what, what, what key do you think, I'm not going\n\n04:20.160 --> 04:26.400\nto play it so we don't get in trouble. What key do you think father figure is in? I don't know,\n\n04:26.400 --> 04:30.880\njust like sing it, riff it. I don't know keys. Oh, just start singing it like whatever.\n\n04:33.280 --> 04:43.600\nThat's all I wanted. Something sacred, something special in your life. For just one moment,\n\n04:43.600 --> 04:54.320\njust to be a baby. I don't know. Is that, is that, is that, is that an E? Is that an E sharp?\n\n04:56.160 --> 05:01.920\nThat's totally E sharp. Yeah. Is there such thing as an E sharp? Or is that F? It might be F.\n\n05:02.640 --> 05:07.440\nI know it's like, I know it's like, I know it's A through F. See, I have a thing, my doctor, my\n\n05:07.440 --> 05:13.200\ndoctor told me that I have to do a thing every day called the, the swelling test where I have a\n\n05:13.200 --> 05:20.880\npiano keyboard and I play a note and I have to, I have to find my ceiling. And if I, if I lose\n\n05:20.880 --> 05:28.400\nmy ceiling by half a step, be quiet for a day. If I lose my ceiling by a whole step, call her\n\n05:28.400 --> 05:34.160\nbecause something bad's happening. But when she first gave it to me, it was G sharp four,\n\n05:34.160 --> 05:42.800\nlike in the fourth octave. I'm now C five. That's a fucking big jump. I don't know.\n\n05:42.800 --> 05:48.240\nRight? Yeah. Dave Kline knows, Dave Kline comes from a family of Dave, can you give me a youp and\n\n05:48.240 --> 05:58.640\nsee C four? It's a C five. That was F. That was F and you're being a bully.\n\n05:58.640 --> 06:06.320\nSo okay, I have a question. It comes from two opera singers. I have some questions.\n\n06:06.320 --> 06:14.240\nWhen you get your green screen elliptical, then Dave Kline is wearing a t-shirt and he's got the,\n\n06:14.240 --> 06:18.960\nwhat do you call those things? Kettlebells? Kettlebells. What are you doing, Dave? You're\n\n06:18.960 --> 06:21.920\njust, you're lifting kettlebells. This guy's working his ass off and you're just going,\n\n06:21.920 --> 06:26.240\nyoup, youp. That's not hard. That's harder.\n\n06:32.240 --> 06:36.240\nOkay. All right. That scans. That scans. Dave, do you want to come up and talk about the workout?\n\n06:36.240 --> 06:40.240\nThat's good, Dave Kline up here, everybody.\n\n06:49.040 --> 06:53.840\nI just want to narrate that Jeff went for two power moves and without power moves,\n\n06:53.840 --> 06:58.240\nboth times by Dave Kline. That was an impressive. Good to see you. Thanks for coming on stage.\n\n07:01.120 --> 07:05.520\nAm I going to, am I becoming the fat guy in Harmontown? Because everybody now is fucking\n\n07:05.520 --> 07:10.800\nfit as a fiddle. I know what the audience is thinking. You didn't have to introduce Dave.\n\n07:10.800 --> 07:13.920\nWe can tell from looking at him that he's the sculptor of your body.\n\n07:17.280 --> 07:23.520\nYou scream personal trainer. He also screams shampoo and conditioner.\n\n07:24.560 --> 07:30.080\nThis guy's hair is fucking magnificent. Look, I got a pretty serious athletic background.\n\n07:30.080 --> 07:36.480\nI'm formally trained in the art of yoga. Got a 200 hour certification with the\n\n07:36.480 --> 07:38.960\nnational yoga alliance. Do yoga work. Shout out to yoga works.\n\n07:40.960 --> 07:47.200\nI also have an illustrious swimming career, former state champion, New Jersey representative of the\n\n07:47.200 --> 07:57.360\nUSA zone competition, Columbia division one swim program, NCAA. YMCA national championship\n\n07:57.360 --> 08:04.480\nqualifier. Let's go. I'm also pretty nasty on a pickup basketball court. I know it's a\n\n08:04.480 --> 08:08.800\npodcast. It probably isn't podcast gold, but could you could you do a little exercise for us and\n\n08:08.800 --> 08:14.240\nshow us, like teach us one exercise? Sure. This is a classic exercise that comes from, I think,\n\n08:15.520 --> 08:20.480\nI don't know, I think the punk movement really kind of got it down right. But what I think\n\n08:20.480 --> 08:26.160\nphysiology is all about is movement, power, spirit and linking your energy, mind and physiology into\n\n08:26.160 --> 08:32.480\na reality that you're comfortable with. I miss the show so much. So I'm going to give you one of\n\n08:32.480 --> 08:37.440\nmy favorite exercises that's ever been ever been done. It's got a shamanic element. It's got a lot\n\n08:37.440 --> 08:43.840\nof cardio. Should the whole audience get up and try this with us? Yeah. Oh, I totally, totally\n\n08:43.840 --> 08:47.920\nencourage anyone. Bring up as many people as you think should get on stage right now to do this\n\n08:47.920 --> 08:56.240\nright now. If I can get seven volunteers, seven is a good number. One, two, three, four, five.\n\n08:59.680 --> 09:04.720\nIf you've got your hand up, get up here. Get out of here. Come on up here. Now I'm going to give\n\n09:04.720 --> 09:13.840\nyou an exercise that's not a traditional yoga element. It's a little bit sped up. My name is\n\n09:13.840 --> 09:17.200\nDave. It's nice to meet you. My name is Dave. It's nice to meet you. My name is Dave. It's\n\n09:17.200 --> 09:20.160\nreally nice to meet you. My name is Dave. It's nice to meet you. Shout out to the Guardians.\n\n09:20.160 --> 09:26.160\nI love that. Shout out Dave Kline. Dave Kline. Dave Kline, nice to meet you. Did we get anybody\n\n09:26.160 --> 09:34.160\nthat's not in the alt right? I don't know. I don't know. We got all of 4chan up here. You're\n\n09:34.160 --> 09:38.480\nmissing, I think. Let's curve this around. Let's curve out the demographics. Okay. All right. I\n\n09:38.480 --> 09:43.520\ndidn't see Leon. Hello, ladies. We've got some lady exercises. All right. Now you're going to want\n\n09:43.520 --> 09:49.520\nto stagger yourself. So one step back, one step forward. All right. All right. Now we're going\n\n09:49.520 --> 09:58.320\nto start out slow because of the music. 4chan work out. Going to watch security video of Chinese\n\n09:58.320 --> 10:08.640\nbabies dying. Right here. Now you're going to shake it on down. Bring it up halfway. Bring it on back\n\n10:08.640 --> 10:20.640\ndown. Back up. Hey. Back down. Halfway on up. Now we're going to link the breathing. Exhale down.\n\n10:24.800 --> 10:34.560\nInhale with your arms up now. And down. Exhale. Halfway up. Inhale. Down. Exhale.\n\n10:34.560 --> 10:45.520\nInhale. Lift it on back up. Up, up, up. Inhale. Hold, hold. Break it on down. Freestyle.\n\n10:46.720 --> 10:49.440\nBreathe however you want on this freestyle because I'm going to introduce the next one.\n\n10:49.440 --> 10:53.200\nLet's hear it for our freestyle yoga expert. Let's hear it for him. Thank you.\n\n10:56.400 --> 10:59.280\nAll right. Now we're going to speed it up a little bit. We got anything a little bit faster?\n\n10:59.280 --> 11:04.160\nBecause what I wanted to do is a cardio movement from kind of the punk era. We're going to do\n\n11:04.160 --> 11:08.800\nsome hip bang. Wait, weren't you just telling us? We're going to head bang. That was what we were\n\n11:08.800 --> 11:15.120\nlearning. Okay. All right. That movement we just did is an integral part of yoga. It's the beginning\n\n11:15.120 --> 11:21.440\nof the sun's salutation. All right. But now we're going to speed it up. Thrash metal long hair.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:27.840\nFurious energetics. All right. Yo yo, but you know what you are going to do? You're going to get all\n\n11:27.840 --> 11:34.160\nthe blood in your heart to come up to your noggin into your brain. We're going to head bang right\n\n11:34.160 --> 11:40.880\nnow. All right. It's the same motion as yoga. Just a little faster with a different fulcrum\n\n11:40.880 --> 11:45.840\nenergetics. So let's take a couple breaths of fire. All right. Take a nice deep inhale.\n\n11:47.440 --> 11:50.240\nHold. Now exhale in like 10 first.\n\n11:50.240 --> 11:56.720\nInhale. 10 short.\n\n11:59.760 --> 12:04.000\nThat's right. All right. We're getting the energetic going. It starts lighting the fire inside.\n\n12:05.440 --> 12:08.960\nSame movement. I'm going to demonstrate where we're going with this. Now it's going to be a little\n\n12:08.960 --> 12:27.360\nbit faster. Now that seems dangerous. I guess they're opting out. They're opting out.\n\n12:29.440 --> 12:36.960\nYeah. Most of them have have contacts in. So they're going to finish out. Finish out as we do any\n\n12:36.960 --> 12:48.080\ngood yoga practice with a cool down. Take a nice deep breath in for three. Hold for three. Nice\n\n12:48.080 --> 12:59.040\nexhale out. Look, this world, there's a lot going on energetically, politically, personally, you\n\n12:59.040 --> 13:04.480\nknow, who knows. I got friends with financial problems that come into a yoga studio. They say\n\n13:04.480 --> 13:11.760\nwhat I need is to just lay down. So here's what you need to do. Lay on down. This is a classic\n\n13:11.760 --> 13:21.040\nyoga pose called Savasana, aka corpse pose. Corpse pose. They got names. You're going to lay your\n\n13:21.040 --> 13:27.920\nhands down. All right. And now you got a choice here. If you put your palms down on the ground,\n\n13:27.920 --> 13:34.000\nyou're kind of a closed circuit and you're just kind of staying in your own zone and getting\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:44.640\nyour energetics kind of properly orbiting your spirit. All right. But on the other hand, come on,\n\n13:44.640 --> 13:51.120\norbit that spirit. You want to receive it. Orbit. You want to launch these planets. You're not\n\n13:51.120 --> 13:57.440\norbiting. No, no, no. But seriously, on the real, if you want to receive a little bit of an energetic\n\n13:57.440 --> 14:04.160\nfrom the universe, palms up. That's all. You have a choice. No, no, on the ground, on the ground.\n\n14:04.160 --> 14:11.600\nSo legs out straight, everybody. Legs out straight, palms up, and just do three nice browns of four\n\n14:11.600 --> 14:22.480\ncount in, four count whole, four count out. That's it. Just three of them. All right. Well,\n\n14:22.480 --> 14:27.040\nand in the meantime, Dan, how you doing? I'm good. I'm good. Thank you for the folks at home\n\n14:27.040 --> 14:33.040\nexercise has been happening. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You might want to rewind, mute the volume and\n\n14:33.040 --> 14:39.280\njust think about meundies for three minutes. That's fair. They make a nice undergarment.\n\n14:39.280 --> 14:45.920\nAnd socks. And now onesies. But also think about subscribing to the video version of the podcast\n\n14:45.920 --> 14:51.760\nbecause you could be looking at people laying down. That's right. All right. And when you're\n\n14:51.760 --> 14:56.800\nall done, when you're all done, you can bring your knees up to the sky. You can bring yourself\n\n14:56.800 --> 15:03.920\nup to a seated position. You can gently rise up with this newly energized spirit. You guys were\n\n15:03.920 --> 15:08.720\nfucking phenomenal. I got to thank you for your fucking positivity and going along with a maniacal\n\n15:08.720 --> 15:13.760\nsession. Let's hear for Dave Kline and the freestyle yoga section and the solid gold yoga\n\n15:13.760 --> 15:19.840\ndancers, everybody. Let's hear it from. All right. Everybody get off the stage. Let's hear it from\n\n15:19.840 --> 15:25.520\nyou guys. It's fantastic. I'm not sure what we accomplished, but I'm sure it was important.\n\n15:25.520 --> 15:38.480\nWell, yoga. Oh, popcorn. All right. Yeah. I mean, I, so that's, that's what you do every morning.\n\n15:38.480 --> 15:42.320\nI'm going to, yeah. And I'm going to try not to be phased by the fact that I thought he meant it\n\n15:42.320 --> 15:47.840\nwhen he was saying all that stuff to me all the time. Then I was amazing and doing a great job.\n\n15:47.840 --> 15:51.280\nWe just said that to a bunch of strangers who just laid there. You know that these are non-performers\n\n15:51.280 --> 15:54.480\nthat just got up on the stage, did a weird thing and didn't even ask any questions.\n\n15:54.480 --> 15:59.200\nAnd we're pretty good sports about it. That's pretty amazing. Well, but they didn't work as\n\n15:59.200 --> 16:07.040\nhard as I do. Yo, who wants to see how hard he works? Yeah. We got it. We can't, I'm not trying\n\n16:07.040 --> 16:14.560\nto get out of it. We can't keep this. Let's see how hard Dan Harmon works every day with Dave Kline.\n\n16:14.560 --> 16:19.920\nI got to count for you. There's people listening to the podcast. We have to say things. I'm going\n\n16:19.920 --> 16:26.160\nto say, I'm going to say real fast. 50, 40, 30, 12, 97, 65, 41. No, I can't, you, what, you, what,\n\n16:26.160 --> 16:29.200\nyou, they don't want to watch me plank on my elbows.\n\n16:34.560 --> 16:37.760\nAnd they don't want to see you take your shirt off before you do it.\n\n16:37.760 --> 16:55.040\nAll the way, all the way, all the way. I wanted you to see my Minecraft for sure.\n\n16:55.040 --> 17:01.840\nOh, all right.\n\n17:09.120 --> 17:14.640\nBody by Klein. Look, he's so much skinnier. He has it. Look at this. That's crazy.\n\n17:14.640 --> 17:18.640\nDude, look at this core. Look at this definition.\n\n17:24.160 --> 17:32.000\nAll right. Dan, do you want to call out any other podcaster right now and threaten them like a\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:38.480\nwrestler? Just Chris Pratt's coming for you, Chris Pratt.\n\n17:38.480 --> 17:46.560\n50, 40, 30, 12, 97, 65, 41, 50, 41, 50, 41, 50, 41, 52, 41, 52, 41, 52, 41, 52, 41, 52, 41,\n\n17:46.560 --> 17:50.400\n52, 41, 52, 41, 53, 41, 53, 41, 54, 41, 54, 41, 54, 41, 54, 41, 54, 41, 54.\n\n17:50.400 --> 17:56.320\nHe's doing it. He's planking. This is a full plank, a push-up style plank.\n\n17:59.760 --> 18:03.040\nHe's drinking alcohol while planking. Oh my God.\n\n18:03.040 --> 18:08.640\nHe's drinking again while planking.\n\n18:12.480 --> 18:18.640\nAnd the crowd are loving it. Jeff moves the alcohol.\n\n18:18.640 --> 18:36.240\nHe's going for another drink. Oh, he's losing it. But he's maintaining. He went for another.\n\n18:48.640 --> 18:58.240\nHe's still going. And he can't stop.\n\n19:01.840 --> 19:04.240\nYou can see Fatih setting in.\n\n19:07.840 --> 19:12.880\nJeff is, oh, Jeff put a drink on his back. This is a type of torture.\n\n19:12.880 --> 19:18.480\nThis is what murderers do to their victims.\n\n19:18.480 --> 19:36.080\nHe feels triumphantly, as if getting ready to masturbate.\n\n19:36.080 --> 19:48.880\nYou did it. Yeah. Yeah. Coming for you, Chris Pratt. Yeah.\n\n19:52.560 --> 19:59.600\nI didn't really mean for you to take your shirt off. I was just doing a bit. No, I know. You didn't\n\n19:59.600 --> 20:06.960\nsay it, though I did. Now, when I say, no, that was fucking outstanding. That was\n\n20:06.960 --> 20:10.960\nactually outstanding and amazing. Fucking great effort on that. But see, doesn't that sound the\n\n20:10.960 --> 20:17.600\nsame as when he sent it to those other people? That's similar enough. For me, it was worth losing\n\n20:17.600 --> 20:22.400\nmy voice just to see that. Oh, yeah. Oh, man. I had to go into a dark place. You got to do a\n\n20:22.400 --> 20:31.040\nswelling test. You got to go do a swelling test. I do every day. Right now. Play a C5.\n\n20:31.040 --> 20:37.680\nAnybody have a, who has a pitch pipe? I think Dave's got it. Can you send for, I have to do every\n\n20:37.680 --> 20:50.560\nday. I have to get my C5. Yeah, you're still there. You're still there. I think it's like,\n\n20:50.560 --> 20:56.640\nI think it's that C5. Yeah. I went to the desert with Cody to, he knows. Wait, do you have perfect\n\n20:56.640 --> 21:04.720\npitch? Sing C5 for me. That's just what Jeff was doing. That's amazing. Do you really have perfect\n\n21:04.720 --> 21:10.240\npitch? You need a really good relative or shitty perfect pitch. Well, relative to a note you've\n\n21:10.240 --> 21:14.880\nrecently heard, that's the same thing, but you have perfect pitch. Relative perfect pitch. Now,\n\n21:14.880 --> 21:20.640\nwhat's the highest note you can hit? It depends on the day. Well, today is the day, Jack.\n\n21:22.480 --> 21:27.520\nThat's definitely an F5. Oh. Hit it again.\n\n21:27.520 --> 21:39.440\nThat's terrifying and amazing at the same time. Should we bring out Rob Schrab?\n\n21:47.280 --> 21:55.440\nRob Schrab, come on stage. Or maybe Rob Schrab taking a shift. He's certainly doing some tricks.\n\n21:55.440 --> 21:59.520\nYeah, why has he been so shy? He is normally. Let me tell you a quick story.\n\n22:02.880 --> 22:08.000\nSteve Levy and Rob Schrab at the same time. That was the trick.\n\n22:10.400 --> 22:16.160\nYep, I'm going to take it. We're going to Levy. We're going to Steve. We're going to Schrab.\n\n22:18.400 --> 22:22.400\nAll right. I don't know if I was meant to come out on stage. It's kind of cold. But you did?\n\n22:22.400 --> 22:29.600\nWell, hey. All right, knack it up. Everybody clean it up. Clean up the show. Come on.\n\n22:29.600 --> 22:35.280\nAll right, all right, all right. Come on, shape a show. Let's get some craft going on here.\n\n22:36.320 --> 22:41.680\nLet me tell you a story. I went to the desert with Cody. Storytime.\n\n22:41.680 --> 22:56.720\nStorytime. Storytime. Tim's Storytime. He's going to tell us a story. He's going to knit a yarn.\n\n22:58.560 --> 23:05.920\nAnd this kid came out from the kitchen and to serve us our food, bringing the food to the table.\n\n23:05.920 --> 23:15.360\nAnd he was very bashful. And he said, here you go. Careful. It's a hot plate. Mr. Harmon,\n\n23:17.520 --> 23:26.240\nserving you has been my birthday. And I said, oh, is it your birthday?\n\n23:28.160 --> 23:33.680\nAnd he said, yes, today's my birthday. And I was like, I wanted to say, well, technically,\n\n23:33.680 --> 23:42.400\nthat's not a compliment. You could hate me in serving you. It would be better if it wasn't.\n\n23:42.400 --> 23:47.280\nLike he should have said, it is now. But it was his birthday. That's the implication. Serving\n\n23:47.280 --> 23:55.360\nyou has been my birthday kid. Did you put him on blast? Yeah. For doing that? Yeah, yeah. I went\n\n23:55.360 --> 24:03.360\nback through his Twitter 10 years and I found some jokes about Monica Lewinsky that were\n\n24:03.360 --> 24:12.240\npretty cum-oriented, which is not really what's in right now. Was that kid James Gunn? Yes,\n\n24:12.240 --> 24:18.720\nthat kid was James Gunn. When you say a kid, how old? Like a teenager? I don't know. I mean,\n\n24:18.720 --> 24:24.560\nI'm 45. Everyone's a kid. Only people that aren't kids are in a space station dying.\n\n24:24.560 --> 24:33.840\nSpencer, why don't you play us something? Hey. On the piano. I'll tell you another\n\n24:34.480 --> 24:39.760\nstory. That's not really a story. It's another funny thing I wrote down that someone said.\n\n24:39.760 --> 24:47.680\nI was watching a true crime show and one of the people said, one of those things where there's\n\n24:47.680 --> 24:53.920\nlike a cop trying to like, the cops are trying to, you know, they're trying to sound hard boiled.\n\n24:55.840 --> 25:01.840\nAnd a guy said, it's like finding a needle in a basket of haystacks.\n\n25:03.680 --> 25:07.920\nAnd he's like, I don't know. That sounds like it might be easier. That metaphor needed pushing up.\n\n25:09.920 --> 25:15.200\nHe solved the crime of metaphors. He just redefined. He's just miniaturizing haystacks to\n\n25:15.200 --> 25:20.000\nthe point where a bunch of them fit in a basket. Isn't that just a basket of hay? It's a hay basket.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:23.600\nI'd rather find a needle in a basket of hay than a haystack. Right.\n\n25:25.120 --> 25:31.520\nWas that phrase must have been invented before magnets, right? Magnets? Yeah. Oh, right. Yeah.\n\n25:31.520 --> 25:38.080\nPretty easy. Before magnets that are powerful enough to suck a needle out of. High fives are\n\n25:38.080 --> 25:47.040\nbeing exchanged. And that's not the sound of two high fives. He had two mics up to one high five.\n\n25:49.200 --> 25:55.360\nAnd that's not the sound of four high fives. That's four. Ow. Ow. Too hard. You know how you,\n\n25:55.360 --> 25:59.520\nyou know how you do it. You aim for the other person's elbow. Okay. Yeah. That's the,\n\n25:59.520 --> 26:01.600\nyou got to make eye contact with their elbow.\n\n26:01.600 --> 26:09.360\nI guess it's a bad trick. That works. I don't really have anything else. That was a two,\n\n26:09.360 --> 26:16.480\nthose are the two things. Yo, what about Noval? Yeah. What do you, what do you think is easier,\n\n26:16.480 --> 26:20.960\nDan, finding a needle in a haystack or finding a needle in a basket of haystacks?\n\n26:21.840 --> 26:24.480\nHonestly, I mean, what if someone, what if it was their first time here?\n\n26:24.480 --> 26:30.720\nI'll tell you what. Yo, you've been doing some interesting delvings into, you know,\n\n26:30.720 --> 26:36.240\nthe thinking about the history and future history of humanity. Shout out to Yuval Noah Harari,\n\n26:36.240 --> 26:40.880\nauthor of sapiens and Homo Deus. We're getting deep into this shit in the mornings.\n\n26:40.880 --> 26:46.880\nWhat were you saying? All the aerobics I was just hearing on the speaker, like going,\n\n26:46.880 --> 26:54.800\nwe have to say things. It's a podcast. Come on, people. We have to say things. It's a podcast.\n\n26:56.080 --> 27:05.040\nStop it. We have to say things. It's a podcast. Yeah, I said that. People, it's a podcast.\n\n27:05.680 --> 27:13.920\nWe have to say things. There's some hips on this too. Come on. Stop with this. You have to say\n\n27:13.920 --> 27:23.760\nthings. Come on. Yeah, I did read this book, Homo Deus, Homo Deus, Homo Deus. Sorry, that's how\n\n27:23.760 --> 27:29.440\nyou can remember it. That's good. By the author of sapiens, I was talking about the book sapiens\n\n27:29.440 --> 27:37.920\nlast time. This is a 2016 follow up, I think, Homo Deus. It's talking about what's to become of us,\n\n27:37.920 --> 27:43.360\nwhere have we been and what's to become of us? Very eye-opening and then eye-punching and then eye-\n\n27:43.360 --> 27:49.920\nclosing, because it'll just make you want to roll over and wait for the dream slash nightmare of\n\n27:49.920 --> 27:55.760\nour evolution and the way it's going to, which is us becoming robot people. Top two, screws in the\n\n27:55.760 --> 28:04.000\neyeball. Yeah. I'm sure that's accurate. Which of the screws into the eyeballs did you find most,\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:10.480\nyou know, or most memorable or interesting? Yeah, Dan. Oh. Yeah, which screws into the eyeballs?\n\n28:10.480 --> 28:19.280\nYeah, yeah. You got to say things. It's a podcast. People are paying money for the words.\n\n28:21.200 --> 28:27.440\nI thought the most interesting aspect was tracing the evolution of human religion globally from,\n\n28:28.160 --> 28:32.240\nyou know, animism or animus, whatever that is, where you're like, you know, we were talking\n\n28:32.240 --> 28:37.360\nabout that last time, like, oh, my friend's a bird. He brought me fire and, you know,\n\n28:37.360 --> 28:44.640\nhe can fly and I can't and kind of on equal terms with everything around me. Also, my worst enemy,\n\n28:44.640 --> 28:50.000\nmy best friend, all these critters, and moving from that to polytheism, moving from that to\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:56.000\nmonotheism, and then we really have replaced that with humanism. Like, we, even if we don't want to\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:59.920\nadmit it and we want to talk about things like, I believe in God and all that stuff, we still are\n\n28:59.920 --> 29:04.160\nhaving conversations about looking within ourselves, which wasn't always the case a long time ago.\n\n29:04.160 --> 29:09.920\nLike you would actually like grab a sword and like run over to the Middle East with it because\n\n29:09.920 --> 29:14.720\nyou truly actually believed that something outside yourself was going to like make you a silver surfer\n\n29:14.720 --> 29:19.920\nafter you died. Like, like, like you really believed in it in the way that you believe\n\n29:19.920 --> 29:24.640\nwhere Waze is telling you to go. Like, like it was a concrete thought. We still have that philosophy\n\n29:24.640 --> 29:29.520\nthese days. Was that, was that how the Crusades was? Yeah, like people, people back then really\n\n29:29.520 --> 29:34.720\nbelieved that there was like an external force and we have evolved in terms of our philosophy,\n\n29:34.720 --> 29:39.760\neven the religious among us, even a zealot is somebody who's still saying, you know,\n\n29:39.760 --> 29:44.000\nI've looked within myself and I know what God's mission is, kind of like they're not waiting for\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:49.440\nlike a cloud to like come and help save them from pigeons or something. Like they're like nobody,\n\n29:49.440 --> 29:54.400\nlike we all, we've all evolved into humanism, the worship of humanity. And then, and then taking\n\n29:54.400 --> 30:00.880\nthat and saying like, well, there's two big branches of humanism that are kind of, you know,\n\n30:00.880 --> 30:07.200\nat odds. And like the one that's one out is liberal liberal humanism, which is basically\n\n30:07.200 --> 30:10.560\nsaying, look, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, but I know it's important to be human.\n\n30:11.920 --> 30:15.600\nYou know, and then the other one is the evolutionary humanism. And a lot of us probably go back and\n\n30:15.600 --> 30:20.320\nforth between these things. But in our current political state, you can see these things magnified\n\n30:20.320 --> 30:25.920\nto the point where they could kill ants on and burn wood, because it's like the extreme forms of\n\n30:25.920 --> 30:31.520\nthat shit in the way that you pull up a lever and a pulling booth is like, it's like, God damn it,\n\n30:31.520 --> 30:37.360\nthe fucking like the evolutionary humanism is like, I love humanity so much that I don't want\n\n30:37.360 --> 30:42.640\nthat person slowing us down. I don't want that person getting away with anything. I'm tired of\n\n30:42.640 --> 30:47.840\nsaying that that person's equal to that person. When we all know that's not true, some things are\n\n30:47.840 --> 30:53.600\nmore valuable than others like, let's stop fucking around and let's get better. I say that with a\n\n30:53.600 --> 30:58.960\nmocking voice because that's not the team I fight for because I don't, how do you, how do you stand\n\n30:58.960 --> 31:04.160\non that slope without slipping into the fucking Moff Tarkin territory? Like, I don't, I don't,\n\n31:04.160 --> 31:08.560\nI don't know, maybe it says more about me than you that I can't, I can't go near that fucking slope.\n\n31:08.560 --> 31:13.360\nI choose not to, I don't want to stand there. I prefer the liberal humanism, which is like,\n\n31:13.360 --> 31:18.240\nbut he, he tell, the interesting thing is that he tells, he earns his trajectory by explaining\n\n31:18.240 --> 31:23.600\nwhere we've been and talking about how like World War II was like this kind of like grand\n\n31:24.880 --> 31:31.040\nsort of climax of the, of, of, it was, it was a, it was a battle during which like liberal democracy,\n\n31:33.120 --> 31:37.680\nit was this close to extinction because it was catching a left punch from socialism.\n\n31:38.240 --> 31:42.400\nAll the poor people waking up, you can see this in your, your friends, you were having these\n\n31:42.400 --> 31:49.520\nconversations right now with the, the socialists saying, hey liberals, you know, you, like, you\n\n31:49.520 --> 31:54.720\nare rich and you are privileged and you are saying that you want everybody to be free because if\n\n31:54.720 --> 31:58.880\nthey're free, they're free to do what they did yesterday and do the same thing tomorrow and\n\n31:58.880 --> 32:02.720\nyou're free to be rich and they're free to be poor. And, and socialists are like, we're catching\n\n32:02.720 --> 32:08.880\non to you, you're not, you're an elitist and, and God, get that left punch coming. And then\n\n32:08.880 --> 32:14.320\nat the same time leading up to World War II, there's this right punch coming from your,\n\n32:14.320 --> 32:18.400\nyour little characters around the world who are going, hey, I'm poor too and you know what\n\n32:18.400 --> 32:21.760\nsick and tired to say and that guy's beautiful when the truth is he's ugly.\n\n32:22.880 --> 32:27.680\nAnd I don't want to listen to this song. When I want to listen to Wagner, it's beautiful,\n\n32:27.680 --> 32:33.440\nit's the best music ever. And while I'm tired of fucking around and I'm going to troll the world\n\n32:33.440 --> 32:39.280\nand, and prove that everything is like, like needs to be better and I stop lying. Everyone\n\n32:39.280 --> 32:43.840\ntells the truth. Life is ugly and we can make it more beautiful if we fucking eat each other.\n\n32:45.280 --> 32:50.640\nAnd, and both of those guys, you get a left fist and a right fist coming at the people with all\n\n32:50.640 --> 32:56.880\nthe money who were like living high in the hog and who could only win that war that, that, that\n\n32:56.880 --> 33:02.800\nchapter really by forming an alliance with socialism. Like that is like, we could only really\n\n33:02.800 --> 33:07.760\nwin World War II by teaming up with Russia. But that's just a microcosm of, of the general,\n\n33:08.800 --> 33:12.800\ngeneral facts that as far as these data fields are concerned, these philosophies, it's like\n\n33:13.680 --> 33:18.320\nliberal democracy was, it's sort of like saying, hey, can't we all just get along? Can't we all\n\n33:18.320 --> 33:23.520\njust hang out? And it's a, it's a, your crimes are unintentional kind of when you say that your\n\n33:23.520 --> 33:29.520\ncrimes are silence, you know, your crimes are, you're not really helping necessarily. And that\n\n33:29.520 --> 33:35.440\nneeded to be fused with, hey, it's great, you be poor, other people can be rich. I, we had to pair\n\n33:35.440 --> 33:40.240\nthat with the, I believe in that so much, I'd like to help the poor. Like that kind of fusion came\n\n33:40.240 --> 33:47.440\nout of, of that chapter, which is the only way that this liberal isistic, like humanism beat\n\n33:47.440 --> 33:55.040\nout the evolutionary humanistic model. But the punchline is that it matters to us a lot, but\n\n33:55.040 --> 33:59.200\nit doesn't really matter on the grand scale. You can tell this guy is like, those are just roads\n\n33:59.200 --> 34:03.680\nthat sort of like go like this and I'm waving my hands in a nonsensical motion for those.\n\n34:03.680 --> 34:10.400\nHe's like doing a double helix situation. They, it's like, I consider it a great thing that one\n\n34:10.400 --> 34:17.440\nside one out of the other, but kind of all roads lead to a distinct lack of Rome in that, like,\n\n34:18.080 --> 34:22.960\nno matter, all, it's like all humanism, which is the only thing that survived, like no one's out\n\n34:22.960 --> 34:29.040\nthere like, don't, I worship a black cat from outer space that really exists. Like they, like we, we\n\n34:29.040 --> 34:34.400\nare all humanists around the globe. So these like factions, these warring factions of humanists\n\n34:34.400 --> 34:40.480\nare all going to one way or another be slaves to data technology that you're not going to be,\n\n34:40.480 --> 34:46.880\nwe're not going to be able to say that our goal is for humanity to be either happy or evolved and\n\n34:46.880 --> 34:54.880\nimproved. Those are just, both of those teams would eventually just get swallowed up by algorithmic\n\n34:54.880 --> 35:01.120\nthinking. Because even if you're the most loving, like, like, let's just play it as it lays, open\n\n35:01.120 --> 35:06.320\nyour heart, be a good person kind of person, like, it's only going to be a matter of time before that\n\n35:06.320 --> 35:13.440\nperson has to admit that doing that without using data that we've been covering about people\n\n35:13.440 --> 35:21.760\nis actually just willful disobedience of, of making people happy. Like, it's, we're vast,\n\n35:21.760 --> 35:26.480\nwe're quickly approaching a threshold according to this author where, like, computers are gonna,\n\n35:26.480 --> 35:30.480\nnot computers, like we think, I still think of computers as like a laptop and all the shit,\n\n35:30.480 --> 35:35.280\nwhatever, the fucking information field that we're creating, the internet of all things,\n\n35:35.280 --> 35:40.080\nis going to know us better than we know ourselves. It's going to be, we're not going to be able to\n\n35:40.080 --> 35:48.560\nkeep up with people who are willing to let data tell them who to date tomorrow, what to eat,\n\n35:49.600 --> 35:53.760\nwhere to put their kids in school, like, like, how to, how to approach their philosophy, like,\n\n35:53.760 --> 35:59.040\nno matter what your philosophy is, algorithms are going to be, it's like, like the way I put it,\n\n35:59.040 --> 36:04.240\nI'm not paraphrasing him, I'm just, like, you can't, you can't shake your fist at a choo-choo\n\n36:04.240 --> 36:09.280\ntrain faster than a train. Like, you can stand next to a train track and go like, I hate that darn\n\n36:09.280 --> 36:14.640\ntrain track, like, and you can be right, like, train tracks are ugly, the thing blows smoke,\n\n36:14.640 --> 36:19.200\nit's beautiful next to the train track, you could live in a nice log cabin, but that,\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:24.960\neverybody on the train is gonna fuck more and make more people than the person in the log cabin,\n\n36:24.960 --> 36:29.920\nso that's just the basic. So where does that put your philosophy right now? Like, where are you at?\n\n36:29.920 --> 36:34.560\nI think it puts all of our philosophies in this kind of, like, just sort of newly perspective,\n\n36:34.560 --> 36:39.360\nlike, it's just like, oh, so that's the struggle we're having right now, but then it's like, oh,\n\n36:39.360 --> 36:45.200\ndoes it really matter almost? Like, because it's like, like, we're so close to an age,\n\n36:45.200 --> 36:51.760\nand he wrote this book in 2016, like, January, I think, and so I would think that he would have\n\n36:51.760 --> 36:57.600\nmore paragraphs about, told you so, if, if, if, if while he was writing it, he was like, working this,\n\n36:57.600 --> 37:02.080\nlike, shit happening, because he's kind of predicting it in this book, and I'm like, oh,\n\n37:02.080 --> 37:08.000\nshit. What is he predicting? Well, just the idea that we're going, that democracy is going to start\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:15.120\nto be assailed by data, that, that, that algorithms, and he gives this example, and it's, I think it's\n\n37:15.120 --> 37:20.240\njust blind, like, he's not, he didn't read about Cambridge Analytica, he didn't, he's just giving\n\n37:20.240 --> 37:26.640\nthe example, he goes like, Facebook accounts have more information about people than they have about\n\n37:26.640 --> 37:33.520\nthemselves, and they did a study where people said as much, they, they gave people's closest\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:38.240\nfriends a test about their friends, they said, how well do you know, Jeff Davis, answer these\n\n37:38.240 --> 37:43.280\nquestions, and then they kept the algorithmically predicted answers to themselves, and theirs were\n\n37:43.280 --> 37:48.640\nmore accurate, that Facebook itself can answer questions about you more than your friends can,\n\n37:48.640 --> 37:53.760\nand then on top of it, more than you can, that, because we don't remember shit, like, we, we\n\n37:53.760 --> 38:00.400\nlive a fucking weird experiential life, but our narrative is like, it's hardwired, so the guy\n\n38:00.400 --> 38:05.280\ngives this example, it's a little hokey, but it's also just kind of poetic of, of like, you're\n\n38:05.280 --> 38:12.160\ngoing to go on a date in the future, and you, you say to your Cortana Google thing, you go, I don't\n\n38:12.160 --> 38:18.800\nknow who I should, I got Carl called me, and Jerry called me, like, Jerry's awesome, and he makes me\n\n38:18.800 --> 38:24.640\nlaugh, but Carl's, Carl has more respect for me, I think, I don't know, I'm so confused, my parents,\n\n38:24.640 --> 38:30.800\nlike, so I don't know what to do, and like, we'll quickly be approaching a time when your, your,\n\n38:31.440 --> 38:36.880\nthis, this Google Cortana Siri thing, like, whatever this is, will say to you, hey, listen,\n\n38:37.600 --> 38:43.360\nI know you better than you know yourself, like, I'm not talking down to you, I'm just here to help,\n\n38:43.360 --> 38:47.840\nand I know, I know you so well that I know you're not going to like what I have to tell you,\n\n38:47.840 --> 38:51.760\nbut I have monitored your heart rate on every date you've ever been on with both of these guys,\n\n38:52.640 --> 38:56.480\nand I have monitored their heart rates, and I, where I rather, I've talked to their Cortana\n\n38:56.480 --> 39:02.560\nGoogle series, and, and, and, because you guys, you guys gave limited authorization to, to do a\n\n39:02.560 --> 39:08.720\nlittle brokering of, of the, of the adrenaline, of the, you know, endocrine levels and the things\n\n39:08.720 --> 39:14.000\nthat you've felt, and the, and I've, I've read all of the books that you've read, I've even read the\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:18.320\nbooks, finished the books that you fell asleep reading, and I've noted the pull-up parts where\n\n39:18.320 --> 39:24.000\nyou fall asleep, I've noted the paragraphs that you have to read over and over again, because\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:29.120\nsome, some of them you want, they're important to you, some of them you, you're too dense to, to get,\n\n39:29.120 --> 39:34.640\nlike, and all of this for me is information, and for you it's just fleeting gas, and you don't,\n\n39:34.640 --> 39:40.960\nif you get a cold, you might vote wrong, whereas I know what you march for, and I know what t-shirts\n\n39:40.960 --> 39:46.480\nyou buy, and I know how you genuinely feel on average for the last 15 years of your life,\n\n39:46.480 --> 39:53.360\nand I'm telling you 87% Carl, that's all I'm gonna say, and also wear the green dress, it makes you\n\n39:53.360 --> 39:58.320\nlook better, like, like, you, you've been retaining water lately, and you tend to blah, blah, blah,\n\n39:58.320 --> 40:02.240\nblah, like, it's gonna tell you, it's gonna be better at telling you shit that's gonna actually\n\n40:02.240 --> 40:08.080\nmake you succeed in, in, by our definitions of success, better than your aunt can.\n\n40:08.080 --> 40:12.320\nWhat's bad about that though? There's nothing bad, it's like this, this guy is continually\n\n40:12.320 --> 40:17.440\npummeling, it's meat tenderizing, it's just like you, it's just bashes humanity into like this,\n\n40:17.440 --> 40:23.120\nit's like, he's like, just admit it, we're going to merge with data. Yeah, like, especially like,\n\n40:23.120 --> 40:27.680\nyou're into this kind of stuff, like, does that scare you, or do you, or do you dig that?\n\n40:27.680 --> 40:33.840\nNo, because I think the bad aspects of that, like, society using evil data to control people's minds,\n\n40:33.840 --> 40:38.560\nthat's already happening, so like, it's not, it's gonna get worse the same way everything's\n\n40:38.560 --> 40:43.200\nalways getting worse, but I think the potential for good is good, I don't know, there's one\n\n40:43.200 --> 40:46.880\ngovernment, I don't know where it is, it's in like, the Netherlands or something, I don't know,\n\n40:46.880 --> 40:54.160\nbut they, they have a section of, of government where they enact legislation by science, so they\n\n40:54.160 --> 40:59.840\nuse data to determine what's probably the best policy to enact, then they do a test run of that\n\n40:59.840 --> 41:05.280\npolicy, take data, and then they analyze that policy and do another test policy, until they have\n\n41:05.280 --> 41:08.720\npolicy that they can actually enact that they know is going to work, and it doesn't have to do with\n\n41:08.720 --> 41:13.360\nvoting, it's just data and knowledge and science, and that's probably better than governance, I can\n\n41:13.360 --> 41:18.960\nsee how that can be hijacked by manipulators, but on its own, but that's all, that every system is\n\n41:18.960 --> 41:22.720\nlike that. But if it flows freely enough, hacking, it shouldn't matter too much, like, especially\n\n41:22.720 --> 41:27.680\nthings that don't have to do with privacy. Do we all, do we all have to fuck Carl? Yeah, well,\n\n41:27.680 --> 41:32.960\n87% of us wear green dress and body shame ourselves. I'm, I'm more considered about this green dress.\n\n41:35.840 --> 41:40.880\nYeah, it, it, it makes a pretty compelling argument for like, you know, right now we're\n\n41:40.880 --> 41:46.080\nworried about voting, voting fraud, and like, how do we keep the, the polls honest, and hopefully\n\n41:46.080 --> 41:50.640\nwe'll get through that, but there is going to come a point where we're going to start, if we're\n\n41:50.640 --> 41:54.560\ngoing to evolve, we're going to be asking ourselves at a certain point, why are we, why are we going\n\n41:54.560 --> 42:01.600\nto the poll to do this, when the, the poll is supposed to be a measurement of, of all of these\n\n42:01.600 --> 42:05.920\nlike processors that are supposed to be networked together, that are living their life together\n\n42:05.920 --> 42:10.640\nand having a social contract together, so why, why go every two years and four years for these\n\n42:10.640 --> 42:16.320\nreferendums that are like rep, that are, that are purposely boiling things down to an obfuscated,\n\n42:16.320 --> 42:22.640\nlike, kind of set of data, as opposed to just, you know, like if the algorithms get good enough\n\n42:22.640 --> 42:28.320\nat regulating society and making things fair for people, if that's its directive, hey, Skynet,\n\n42:28.320 --> 42:34.400\nmake things fair, okay, we'll do, we'll, we'll go through phases where we're like, Skynet,\n\n42:34.400 --> 42:39.520\nI'm watching you, don't go Terminator on us, haha, I saw that movie too, I understand the\n\n42:39.520 --> 42:46.800\nreverence, but seriously, I'll get you to work on time, and, and we'll, we'll kind of like, let\n\n42:46.800 --> 42:50.720\nways get us to work on time a few times before we're willing to say, all right, just, just pick\n\n42:50.720 --> 42:55.920\nthe root, just pick the root, and then after a while, if everyone says, just pick the root,\n\n42:55.920 --> 43:02.560\nwe're not gonna get any more upset about it picking everyone's root and collectively ushering us into\n\n43:02.560 --> 43:08.160\nways that get everyone home any more than we get upset about, hey, who chose the shape of this\n\n43:08.160 --> 43:15.280\naluminum can? I think big vending machines behind this soda, you know, like, we don't really, we're\n\n43:15.280 --> 43:21.120\nnot like, how do you know, I'm boxed out of whether or not this is a perfect cylinder, like, we just\n\n43:21.120 --> 43:25.840\nkind of trust a bunch of shit after a while, or just like, okay, I guess that's how soda should\n\n43:25.840 --> 43:31.760\nbe shaped, I don't know, I grew up on it, and, and, and yeah, any hacking, any kind of hacking\n\n43:31.760 --> 43:37.040\nstories will just be like, see, that's why you need more security, like, these North Koreans gave you\n\n43:37.040 --> 43:42.640\na flu, like in your nanovirus protection, like, like, your kid got a cold because of North Korea,\n\n43:42.640 --> 43:47.760\nguess we need to upgrade, like, and anybody that's a Luddite is just gonna get sick and die sooner,\n\n43:47.760 --> 43:56.160\noh well, look, I'm out, like, like, I always, I always finish these books, I get a pit in my\n\n43:56.160 --> 43:59.600\nstomach, and then I'm like, just get to the part where you say this won't happen for 50 years,\n\n43:59.600 --> 44:02.720\nand that's what he does at the end, he's like, of course this could take 50 years, or 100, I'm\n\n44:02.720 --> 44:10.480\nlike, peace, I just, I just want people to find my one-eyed Willy skeleton with a Minecraft laptop,\n\n44:10.480 --> 44:16.960\nlike, fucking, what, is this a booby, what did he want, he tried to close the laptop and a fucking\n\n44:16.960 --> 44:22.400\nbowling ball falls on you, for no reason, I mean, there's no treasure, what the fuck were those\n\n44:22.400 --> 44:31.280\npirates doing, what the, what the fuck was, what were they doing, like, how, how, how, let's go into\n\n44:31.280 --> 44:36.400\nthis cave, it's raining, all right, but just for a little bit, right, just for a little bit, it's\n\n44:36.400 --> 44:41.840\nraining, and I'm getting me patched with. Okay, I understand the Spanish are chasing us to Seattle,\n\n44:41.840 --> 44:49.120\nand, uh, I just, I just want to make sure, Willy, Willy, you have a tendency to overdevelop\n\n44:49.120 --> 44:55.680\nthings, and I want to make sure, as a pirate who has been honored to work with you, that you don't\n\n44:55.680 --> 45:01.760\ngo into a tailspin of, right, right, okay, we could have been in there three times by now,\n\n45:01.760 --> 45:07.600\nokay, all right, you don't have to high road me, all right, let's, let's hide, speaking Spanish,\n\n45:07.600 --> 45:12.480\nlet's get into the cave, let's hide in the cave, because it's raining out, okay, it's raining in\n\n45:12.480 --> 45:17.840\nthe Spanish, okay, let's make sure, you know what, let's seal this, let's seal it up behind us, I'll\n\n45:17.840 --> 45:26.400\nseal it up with cement, okay, you know what, uh, make sure the cement, uh, is wet, well, that it,\n\n45:26.400 --> 45:32.480\nyou know, just make sure there's like a kind of omega protocol where, if the ship needs to go\n\n45:32.480 --> 45:38.240\nback out, that there's something that can trigger the ship leaving, that you're sealing, don't seal\n\n45:38.880 --> 45:48.960\nus in, to, yeah, well, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, what's going on? Oh, fuck, goddammit, the Spanish\n\n45:48.960 --> 45:58.000\nfound us, I knew we shouldn't have gone to Seattle, look, hey, all right, you're either\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:03.760\ngonna need to be, join, join one-eyed Willie and the pirates, I promise you, riches beyond your\n\n46:03.760 --> 46:10.480\nwildest imaginings, what's in it for me, what's in it for me, uh, well, also I speak English because,\n\n46:10.480 --> 46:16.240\nyou know, the English, treasure is in it for you, okay, what we request is a bit of help setting\n\n46:16.240 --> 46:22.960\na few moderate booby traps, okay, that is my, that is my, because we can't have this repeated,\n\n46:22.960 --> 46:28.160\ndoes anyone else know, you can't, we can't have more of you, I'm just a, just a lonely Spanish\n\n46:28.160 --> 46:35.520\npirate, all right, all right, all right, let's talk more work, does anyone know piano?

gonna get ten, ten of our guys to dig a bottomless pit,\n\n46:50.160 --> 46:57.680\nright, uh, or find one, fuck it, you know, maybe we'll get lucky, oh, I, I, I would, uh, pit,\n\n47:00.960 --> 47:06.560\nyou found a pit, no, no, it's, this place is built next to a giant pit, oh, great, well,\n\n47:06.560 --> 47:11.200\nlet's build one of these concrete seals, am I doing, am I still with the wall, I mean,\n\n47:11.200 --> 47:16.480\nyes, you keep up at the wall, all right, okay, I didn't stop, actually, you know what, what,\n\n47:16.480 --> 47:20.960\ncan I just one memo before we start all these booby trap projects, yes, can we make sure,\n\n47:20.960 --> 47:26.880\ncement's drying, can we make sure every day, every day, no matter how much booby track work we\n\n47:26.880 --> 47:35.600\nhave to do, we all meet back here in the galley of the ship and sit down in case we all die at the\n\n47:35.600 --> 47:44.320\nsame time, that seems like very, very sound advice, it's just, you know, I know it's a rare chance,\n\n47:44.320 --> 47:50.640\nbut if it happens, boy, can you imagine finding this ship, and it's like, whoa, they all died\n\n47:50.640 --> 47:55.440\naround the table, all right, I'm gonna go find the piano and put it next to the pit, what am I\n\n47:55.440 --> 48:07.040\ndoing, I forget, you give me a music, a sheet music for scales, and tell Tony to stop driving\n\n48:07.040 --> 48:13.520\nlike a maniac, or I swear I'm gonna stab him in both eyes, until to the point where bone grows\n\n48:13.520 --> 48:19.680\nover his eye sockets, wedging the knives in, I feel like you need to calm down, I think cement's\n\n48:19.680 --> 48:26.880\ndrying, you're right, you're right, sorry, has anyone put the giant octopus in the water?\n\n48:26.880 --> 48:32.160\nNo, no, no, we're not gonna use that, we decided, we took a couple pictures that didn't work out,\n\n48:32.160 --> 48:39.760\nwe'll fix it in post, it was a good, it was a good idea there, it was a good idea there,\n\n48:39.760 --> 48:45.120\nbut we just didn't, it just didn't come together the way, and the cement is dry,\n\n48:45.120 --> 48:51.200\nit's dry, I didn't, I was waiting for you to please talk and do the omega door,\n\n48:51.200 --> 48:57.200\nI had the piano right next to the bottom of the pit, oh shit, okay, he dropped his pee,\n\n48:57.200 --> 49:01.360\nyou know, I predict that that's gonna keep happening, we know what we need to do, we need\n\n49:01.360 --> 49:08.560\nto make a safety water slide that leads right to the ship for anyone who runs into too much trouble,\n\n49:08.560 --> 49:13.280\nso they can just skirt around all of the tracks, no matter whether they fail or succeed,\n\n49:13.280 --> 49:18.880\nthey should just be able to ultimately just slide down a water slide and get right to the treasure,\n\n49:18.880 --> 49:27.600\nhey, already done, already done, oh great, all right, hello, oh god, he's a ghost,\n\n49:29.600 --> 49:38.320\nI am the god Poseidon, oh, who put this guy in charge, this guy doesn't know what the fuck I had to do,\n\n49:38.320 --> 49:45.200\noh shit, I'm just a god Poseidon, but this guy seems like he doesn't, he's all over the shop,\n\n49:45.200 --> 49:48.720\nyeah Aquaman in the house, what the fuck is going on over here, oh shit Aquaman,\n\n49:48.720 --> 49:52.320\noh shit, hey Aquaman, look at this guy over here, he's making rules and fucking another thing,\n\n49:52.320 --> 50:00.880\nwhat the crossover is going on, what, it's Aquaman, what the hell, I mean, I, yeah, anyways,\n\n50:00.880 --> 50:06.080\nwell it just seems like, it just seems like, it seems like those pirates spent a, spent a\n\n50:06.080 --> 50:13.040\nlittle, so okay, that was the goonies, yeah, okay, that was the goonies, yeah,\n\n50:15.040 --> 50:20.560\nyeah, I was in a commercial for the goonies, oh really, yeah, what do you mean, that's the end of\n\n50:20.560 --> 50:26.480\nthat story, like you were saying like, I just saw it and it's great, no, my dad worked, my dad worked\n\n50:26.480 --> 50:32.240\nfor a TV station and like back then like local channels did a lot more legwork than they currently\n\n50:32.240 --> 50:38.400\ndo relative to like the top-down advertising stuff, so he cut the local ad for like the TV\n\n50:38.400 --> 50:45.680\nshowing of the goonies and his genius idea was like having his kids get sucked into the television\n\n50:45.680 --> 50:50.720\nset where they're going through all these goonies scenes that they're green screened into, so,\n\n50:50.720 --> 50:56.880\nwhat the fuck, what the fuck, what, how long have I known you, why are you first telling us this now,\n\n50:56.880 --> 51:02.160\nhow did you, where is this, it took me that whole sketch, why are we watching it, it took me that\n\n51:02.160 --> 51:07.600\nwhole sketch to realize you were doing the goonies, where, where, I did not know that this was what\n\n51:07.600 --> 51:13.280\nyou cared about, I understand that, that was a long, long peer for you to walk off of, you know\n\n51:13.280 --> 51:18.240\nwhat we were talking about, the goonies, but we've known you for, since the fucking documentary,\n\n51:18.240 --> 51:22.240\nI didn't know that's something that matters to people, you haven't told us that you got zapted to\n\n51:22.240 --> 51:29.920\na television green screened in front of shit, where is it, where is it, I want to watch it now,\n\n51:31.440 --> 51:37.840\nit doesn't like, yeah, where, so, where, I don't know, well someone, can you guys look for it\n\n51:37.840 --> 51:42.560\nwhile we're doing this, I don't know what to search for, can you call somebody, don't pay attention\n\n51:42.560 --> 51:48.320\nto the comedy, call somebody, I could, I could text my dad, let's see what he says, text your dad,\n\n51:48.320 --> 51:56.960\nwhat a genius idea, are you fucking kidding me, did you have the beard back, yeah I had the beard,\n\n51:58.240 --> 52:02.080\njust to warn you, if you try to text your dad, there's no signal up here, and a lot of people\n\n52:02.080 --> 52:06.000\nwill think you texted your dad two weeks in a row, and they'll be really disappointed to hear\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:16.080\nthat the messages didn't actually go out, oh, I can't believe this shit, I'm hearing, I can't\n\n52:16.080 --> 52:24.800\nbelieve it, why can't you, why are you surprised, I don't understand, why, what are you talking about,\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:30.960\nno, because I was a kid sitting on a couch, and my dad took maybe 12 seconds of footage,\n\n52:30.960 --> 52:36.240\nand then he cut an ad out of it, like, I wasn't like on it, I was at home, I don't, what's cool\n\n52:36.240 --> 52:40.800\nabout it, you have to explain what's cool about it, well, don't you ever laugh at Tim and Eric\n\n52:40.800 --> 52:48.240\nstuff, well, sure, it probably looks kind of funny that you're getting green screen zapped\n\n52:48.240 --> 52:53.680\ninto the Goonies, and also it's you, and you probably don't have a beard, and there's probably\n\n52:53.680 --> 52:59.440\na lot of funny elements about it, it's like finding out that after knowing Jack Black for\n\n52:59.440 --> 53:03.920\na thousand years that he was the guy in the pitfall commercial, but that's good, because like\n\n53:03.920 --> 53:11.280\npitfall was an enduring game and commercial, and Goonies isn't well remembered, yeah, no, not at all,\n\n53:11.280 --> 53:16.800\nI get it, I can see the comparison, no one cares about the Goonies, nobody cares about me, I care\n\n53:16.800 --> 53:23.440\nabout you, oh man, I want to see this commercial, I got, that's what I wasn't getting, I got high\n\n53:23.440 --> 53:28.160\nwith Dick Donner, the director of the Goonies, but I didn't know that it was Richard Donner,\n\n53:28.160 --> 53:33.840\nyeah, he was just... It's Dick to Jeff, because he got high with him. I didn't know, I didn't know\n\n53:33.840 --> 53:39.120\nit was Richard Donner who created like Superman and directed Superman. The creator of Superman,\n\n53:39.120 --> 53:46.560\nRichard Donner, I remember when I created Superman, I remember the first drawing of\n\n53:46.560 --> 53:53.600\nSuperman when I was... He directed Superman. I was Richard Donner and I drew, wrote and created\n\n53:53.600 --> 54:03.040\nSuperman before making the movie Superman and the Goonies. I'm on your side. I'm on your side.\n\n54:03.040 --> 54:11.920\nI'm Richard Donner, Dick Donner to my Google's friends. How many of you guys, honestly, like by\n\n54:11.920 --> 54:19.200\napplause and you know... That was a good Richard Donner. I'm predicting 8% some of you guys who\n\n54:19.200 --> 54:23.840\nare on the cusp that are going to do that, you're going to fake this to make yourselves feel younger.\n\n54:25.040 --> 54:31.920\nSo that's margin of error 8%, but applaud if you didn't get the Goonies references.\n\n54:33.920 --> 54:39.280\nOkay, that's a margin of 8%, that's like, yeah, so like four people. Okay, I'm still...\n\n54:40.480 --> 54:45.760\nApplaud if you didn't enjoy yourself anyway. I'm actually kind of sick. I've never thought that\n\n54:45.760 --> 54:59.440\nthat movie... Reddit is going. Schrabs clapping exaggeratedly.\n\n55:02.560 --> 55:08.240\nI didn't get... Oftentimes, I don't hear the first half of what Rob says, so I just catch\n\n55:08.240 --> 55:15.520\nhim on the tail and I'm like, what is happening? That's all that matters. But I would have been\n\n55:15.520 --> 55:18.400\nfine, by the way, if it was the whole audience. I would have been a little regretful of making\n\n55:18.400 --> 55:25.520\nyou listen to 10 minutes of radio play about Goonies, but... Why are these chairs taped off for\n\n55:25.520 --> 55:33.680\nyou, sir? Can you read off those names on that tape? Bright Bart? Like the supremacy.\n\n55:33.680 --> 55:38.160\nAnd Hickenbotham. Okay, these are fuckers that I invited.\n\n55:39.920 --> 55:45.760\nWhere? You there? Born in Hickenbotham? So in the future... I thought you were...\n\n55:45.760 --> 55:51.040\nJeff... You have seats up front of the fucker, your fucking bum... Walk it down here and get\n\n55:51.040 --> 55:56.080\nyour... In the future, we'll have Jeff tell you that we're roping off seats for you. That way,\n\n55:56.080 --> 56:01.440\nyou'll know. This guy's name is Hickenbotham? I was late, I didn't want to interrupt.\n\n56:01.440 --> 56:03.760\nAll right, get down there. Thank God you didn't do that.\n\n56:08.240 --> 56:13.680\nThat's not his fault. That's not his fault. Somebody's name born like Jason Bourne with an\n\n56:13.680 --> 56:17.600\nE and someone's name is Hickenbotham, which sounds like a made-up name. It is a weird...\n\n56:17.600 --> 56:21.360\nLike you picture Jason Bourne when you picture... And then Hickenbotham, you picture like a\n\n56:21.360 --> 56:31.280\njug band. Welcome Hickenbotham and Bourne, everybody. Here's Hickenbotham and Bourne's He-Haw Act from\n\n56:31.280 --> 56:36.800\nyears ago. Hey, Jason, is it true that...\n\n56:36.800 --> 56:47.040\nYou want... You want to start?\n\n56:47.040 --> 56:53.920\nYeah, I wanted to come up from the cornstalk, but he's in a place...\n\n56:53.920 --> 56:55.440\nDo you want to start from the top?\n\n56:57.280 --> 56:58.480\nTill the music goes away.\n\n56:58.480 --> 57:03.360\nLook what happened. It looks like another Hickenbotham and Bourne sketch.\n\n57:03.360 --> 57:07.440\nOkay, all right. Well, it's not going to hold up, but that's okay.\n\n57:08.800 --> 57:10.960\nHey, hey...\n\n57:14.240 --> 57:16.960\nHey, hey, Bourne. Yeah, Hickenbotham.\n\n57:17.680 --> 57:23.200\nIs it true when you sit in any room, you always are aware of where the exits are\n\n57:23.200 --> 57:25.200\nand how to field strip any weapon?\n\n57:25.840 --> 57:30.240\nYeah, but I still can't get my ex-wife to stop taking elimony.\n\n57:30.240 --> 57:33.920\nHe-Haw!\n\n57:37.760 --> 57:42.000\nNow, I know you saw the Goonies, but I also know I got away with that because\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:48.080\nyou've never seen He-Haw. I've barely seen He-Haw, and I'm a test tube baby.\n\n57:48.080 --> 57:48.960\nThat's how old I am.\n\n57:48.960 --> 57:53.680\nYeah, they strip up behind like plywood corn and told jokes.\n\n57:53.680 --> 57:54.080\nYeah.\n\n57:54.080 --> 57:54.800\nVery good.\n\n57:54.800 --> 58:00.480\nHey, duck, did you- I heard an invisible man can't outshine your cornpone.\n\n58:00.480 --> 58:01.200\nSay what?\n\n58:06.480 --> 58:11.280\nThey also would have a bit which where they would have like,\n\n58:11.280 --> 58:16.400\nthey would have this old man with glasses and a mustache sitting in a window\n\n58:17.280 --> 58:23.280\nmiming like he's wiping the window, but there was no glass, and then you would hear off camera,\n\n58:23.280 --> 58:30.960\nhey grandpa, what's for supper? Well, we've got corn on the cob and rice and beans,\n\n58:30.960 --> 58:34.000\nand we also got some green beans too.\n\n58:34.880 --> 58:38.240\nYum, yum, and then they would go back, and then that was it, that was it.\n\n58:38.880 --> 58:43.120\nThat was the best, they did it every single episode.\n\n58:43.120 --> 58:45.920\nAnd remember Roy Clark and what's his name?\n\n58:45.920 --> 58:49.920\nThey would sing that she met another and she was got,\n\n58:49.920 --> 58:54.560\nbut like the gimmick was they'd sing the same song every time, but then the runner was that\n\n58:54.560 --> 58:59.920\nthey would they would in each other's spaces and then they would like break and laugh.\n\n58:59.920 --> 59:04.240\nThere was a lot of, the 70s culture was all about people breaking and laughing at what they were\n\n59:04.240 --> 59:06.400\ndoing, so like the cannonball run was like-\n\n59:06.400 --> 59:09.680\nYeah, it was like the hillbilly version of Laughin where-\n\n59:09.680 --> 59:10.560\nYeah, that's exactly.\n\n59:10.560 --> 59:11.440\nMore progressive.\n\n59:11.440 --> 59:14.160\nYou could get away with a lot of just like, you barely had to-\n\n59:14.160 --> 59:18.960\nMy wife told me, honey, it's our 50th wedding anniversary tonight, let's run upstairs and\n\n59:18.960 --> 59:21.200\nhave sex, and I told her I cannot do both.\n\n59:27.680 --> 59:30.320\nI might look hard to get, but I can be had.\n\n59:35.600 --> 59:36.720\nThese are hee-haw jugs.\n\n59:36.720 --> 59:40.080\nYeah, I think it's time to introduce the band, and the band would all get up and-\n\n59:40.080 --> 59:41.120\nHello, my name's James.\n\n59:41.120 --> 59:43.360\nThey'd all get up and shake hands.\n\n59:43.360 --> 59:46.480\nYou know what would be interesting, because I was thinking, oh you're like a digital Henny\n\n59:46.480 --> 59:51.120\nYoungman, and I was thinking, it'd be interesting to do like, no one's in like a full new wave,\n\n59:51.120 --> 59:55.600\nlike Gary Newman version of Henny Youngman, like a guy that just like looks like a corpse,\n\n59:55.600 --> 01:00:03.440\nand he's got like baggy eyes, and he just has like goth hair, and he tells these like\n\n01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.080\none-liners, and then does like Gary Newman's things.\n\n01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.120\nMy wife came to me and told me that she doesn't want to see me anymore.\n\n01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.680\nI said, I can't riff a one-liner.\n\n01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.920\nI said, why don't you poke your eyes out?\n\n01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.600\nMe and my cars, me and my car, friends are electric.\n\n01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.400\nIt's just Zach Galifianakis, but the piano's electric.\n\n01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.160\nI mean, look, I don't care if what I want to see is compatible with the planet anymore.\n\n01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.880\nI'm very comfortable retiring from the earth, I just want to-\n\n01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.760\nWhat's one thing that you're comfortable not seeing?\n\n01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.120\nWell, I'm still kind of getting used to like the Twitter addiction,\n\n01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.360\nlike I've been off of Twitter for a month now.\n\n01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.160\nYou've lost like 40 characters.\n\n01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.800\nI still have like a kind of like residual like sense of loss, like a phantom limb.\n\n01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:17.920\nI mean, like a decade is a long time to express yourself and connect to others\n\n01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.600\nin one specific medium.\n\n01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.040\nEven my generation isn't used to such stability.\n\n01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.400\nThings usually change faster than Twitter even did.\n\n01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:38.560\nI still feel like a kind of like, oh, like the myth of the soldier who like my arm hurts,\n\n01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.880\nand it's like your arm got blown off.\n\n01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.920\nIt's like you have this like, I'm like, I should tweet this.\n\n01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.040\nKind of like you still have this sort of like electrical impulse.\n\n01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.120\nLike that's a tweet, but you can't tweet it.\n\n01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:55.040\nAnd then because of that subsides, it's very much like because I quit smoking.\n\n01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.960\nI smoked from 18 to 32.\n\n01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.960\nSo kind of a comparable addiction like level as far as like what to get over.\n\n01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.480\nAnd so if it is like smoking, then I then I guess like maybe a month from now,\n\n01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.640\nit'll parabolically get to the point where I'll be like, oh, did I used to tweet?\n\n01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.360\nYou know, like because I forget that I was ever a smoker.\n\n01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.480\nBut like that first couple months is like, God damn it.\n\n01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.360\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.880\nYour whole neurology is based around this minute to minute like flowchart.\n\n01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.680\nIt's just like a whole section of your flowchart is taken out.\n\n01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:37.040\nAnd it's tough because we are none of us like we are right to not admit\n\n01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.640\nthat it's important to us.\n\n01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.200\nLike why would we want to say that?\n\n01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.600\nWe know that it's stupid.\n\n01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.320\nAnd so that actually makes it harder, same as with cigarettes.\n\n01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.360\nBecause cigarettes don't say, it's good for you.\n\n01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.800\nLike they show like a cowboy going like, I'm just fucking do what I fucking want.\n\n01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.760\nYou know, like the messaging of cigarettes is like fuck, fuck society and fucking die\n\n01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.200\nbefore you could fucking kill me.\n\n01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.880\nThat's a great commercial for cigarettes.\n\n01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.720\nGood luck killing me, mother fucker.\n\n01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.840\nCan't shoot a corpse.\n\n01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.680\nThat really is kind of the message.\n\n01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.080\nI'll be dead 40 seconds before you kill me.\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.080\nBut yeah, so it's those kind of like benign little things.\n\n01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.840\nLike I work what I'm hoping will return is like the blogging instinct or something.\n\n01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.600\nI think I have so I so miss my 27 year old self.\n\n01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:40.480\nI miss my I miss that that kid that that was so trustful of the internet.\n\n01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:49.280\nAnd so like so actually like appropriately self loathing just enough that all he wanted\n\n01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:55.040\nwas to actually just splay himself scatter himself against the rocks of the internet\n\n01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:01.920\nand say, yeah, look at every fucking shitty little piece of me and choke on it.\n\n01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:07.600\nLike I like that guy that I think that guy's punk rock and interesting and\n\n01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.760\nbut I don't know if at 45 you can.\n\n01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760\nI don't know if it's healthy to emulate that guy.\n\n01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.160\nWe all know that's what 45 year old guys do.\n\n01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:21.040\nThey try to emulate 27 year olds and then they the result is a little messy.\n\n01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.800\nIt results in a sunroof basically sunroof with a big spot.\n\n01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:31.120\nWhat about doing like a diaristic thing like Davis Derrister's where he writes,\n\n01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.320\nyou know, like little shirts.\n\n01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.000\nWell, that's what I'm basically I'm hoping that that that maybe that this Twitter\n\n01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.240\nthat that Twitter point of the neurology will that that it represents like a cauterized\n\n01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:48.160\nlike thing that that will force a new neurology pattern that that that behind that is an impulse\n\n01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.960\nto share and and explore and that it will be forced after a while.\n\n01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.600\nI don't want to force it that it will it will grow like and I'll go like, damn,\n\n01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:04.480\nI just want to fucking write like I'm waiting to my therapist said like you have to create a new\n\n01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:11.200\npersonality that doesn't isn't linked to your brand and your fame and all these things because\n\n01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.640\nthese things are those things are not like you're you're you're nostalgic for an age before you\n\n01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:22.960\nwere famous and and so that kid is shooting a slingshot at the moon and that's freedom of\n\n01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.080\nexpression. That's really like that's when you're that's when you're hot and you're interesting\n\n01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:34.000\nand you're saying things that like people want to listen to and then you like so if you if you\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.920\nhave any hope you really what you really need to and you want to share your thoughts online what you\n\n01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.240\nwhat I need to do is like keep an actual diary like I did when I was 27 but it's like the difficult\n\n01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:50.080\nthing is like I need to like become a different person I need to like just be some random person\n\n01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:57.680\nwho has zero followers on monday and bachmann books bachmann books yeah yeah be a richard bachmann\n\n01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.760\nbe a bachmann but it's but but it's I mean I tell you need to be a bachmann bachmann am I being\n\n01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:10.640\na pain in the ass Dan just to suggest again that like you you you knuckle down and write features\n\n01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.320\nthat the stuff that you want to get off your chest and don't like like do do the thing that's the\n\n01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.080\nscariest I have jobs and stuff that'll be very fulfilling and and and all that stuff but I'm\n\n01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:25.840\ntalking about like the the kind of like driftwood part of the stuff that's still part joy and part\n\n01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:34.240\nwhat I am good at like that like like I have I'm obviously like so focused on Rick and Morty\n\n01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:45.120\nright now and and don't want a drop of myself to risk like not going into that barrel but the\n\n01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:52.640\ntruth is that there's a bunch of me that's of no use to Rick and Morty and I would I would like to\n\n01:06:52.640 --> 01:07:02.720\nthink that I'm still capable of like writing of like of going like this is the day I had this is\n\n01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:09.040\nhow I feel about the world this is this is this is what I want to say to anyone who finds this\n\n01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:15.600\nafter I'm dead for me like as a friend of yours I'm gonna hear most of what's already on your mind\n\n01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:20.720\nbecause we hang out but I would like to have it in paper form I would like to have that as a me\n\n01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.560\ntoo I want to go back to that that's what I'm saying like I feel like when I remember when\n\n01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:29.840\nTwitter came out because I was I was I was Spencer's age when my space happened and I remember walking\n\n01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:36.160\nwith my friend Stephen Notley who's been on this podcast he I remember I remember him as the\n\n01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.040\nliterally the first person that said the word blog to me and we were walking back from the\n\n01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.960\nrustic Inn to my my place in Las Feliz and he was he was talking about technology and how excited he\n\n01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:52.240\nwas and and he said like oh and people are doing these blogs now and I'm like what what's a blog\n\n01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:56.400\nand he's like oh it's just like this crazy thing it's like this cultural revolution where people\n\n01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.920\nare keeping these online diaries and they're just sharing whatever like it's like like there's like\n\n01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.240\nthere's an there's a guy that is an artist for Disney and he just says whatever the fuck he\n\n01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.440\nwants to say like he works at Disney but it's like it's hard for us to understand that but back\n\n01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:16.160\nthen it was like it was kind of like a loophole the internet was like sort of like in your wildest\n\n01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:21.200\ndreams anyone's ever gonna listen to this because it's still what Dan rather thinks that's important\n\n01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:27.840\nand we we exited that age so blindingly fast that we can't even remember that it was like\n\n01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:33.680\nwe went to the internet to actually put messages in bottles and we're like wouldn't it be hilarious\n\n01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:41.040\nif anybody ever found this and and and like that culture was so interesting I don't know if we\n\n01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:48.800\ncan ever get it back but I I remember when Twitter started happening how unmistakable it was it was\n\n01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:58.240\nas clear as as as the difference between cocaine which I have snorted numerous times to to great\n\n01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:04.160\nend and like talked about improv for six hours with people the only other people who on coke would\n\n01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:11.600\nwant to talk about improv for six hours and then I remember getting that key bump of crystal like\n\n01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.240\nlike like in a bathroom where it was like and it was like this burn and it was like what the\n\n01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:24.160\nfuck is wrong with your coke and and that friend going that wasn't coke I was like yeah it was shiny\n\n01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.520\nand it was like that was crystal meth and it was like it was ground up and I was like\n\n01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:38.960\ngood why do I want to go home and like like violate my sofa like like I don't want to talk to anyone\n\n01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:44.800\nabout improv but I want to build a rocket I don't know what I want it was just a different thing\n\n01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.040\nand it didn't really matter if it was better or worse it was just the fact that it kind of made\n\n01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:55.840\nthe other thing obsolete and and I because I read and I remember what Twitter it was like it was\n\n01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.320\nlike oh micro blogging and I was like I noticed I was like tweeting and people were making fun of\n\n01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.560\nTwitter and they're like oh you know because Twitter would say what's going on and then you'd\n\n01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.280\nanswer going uh I don't know and everyone was like tweet I don't know what the fuck is this what's\n\n01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:15.600\nthis shit what is the funny um and and then it was like you just noticed I was like oh I'm not\n\n01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:22.880\nblogging anymore I why would I when there was this rush like like who was I kidding about why I was\n\n01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:30.000\nblogging and yet the irony is that the the the discipline was more admirable also also the\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.280\nblogging thing was a way of micro writing where you could have been putting down things on paper\n\n01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:40.560\nin there could they could have been novels or short stories or diaristic the big catch 22 is\n\n01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:46.560\nthat no you know this is where I want to let all of us off the hook it's like I mean like we got to\n\n01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.160\nwe got to accept that the fact is that we're motivated by by a lot more than craftsmanship\n\n01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.920\nwe just simply it is really hard to tell somebody to keep a journal and put it under their bed\n\n01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.960\nevery night there's a couple people out here maybe are like what do you mean that's the easiest\n\n01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.640\nthing in the world I love doing it you fucking won the neurological lottery because there is this\n\n01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:15.280\nlike like insidious like weird like lobe of your brain that is goes back to when you're a chimp I\n\n01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.920\nthink that's just like yeah but when you're a kid and there's no internet writing in a in a spiral\n\n01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:28.320\nnotebook about how your day went I have five spiral notebooks filled with my dumb ass 16-year-old\n\n01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:35.840\nthoughts because there wasn't enough internet back then for me to be that narcissistic in in in digital\n\n01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:41.200\nform and if there was Twitter when I was that age I wouldn't have written these obnoxious essays\n\n01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:45.840\nis it about the immediacy of it like if you I think it's just well I think it's just what we're\n\n01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:52.160\nseeking like if you get a job writing a tv show or a film and you go okay I have to work on this I\n\n01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:59.040\nget notes it all goes it takes months and months maybe years and years for you for you and Rob to\n\n01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:04.480\nwrite a thing together or you alone to write a thing is it the immediacy yeah I think it's the\n\n01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:10.480\nratio I think it is it's like like like to take a little piece of what you just said if you get a\n\n01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.960\njob doing something like the like it's like Dorothy Parker said like I I hate writing I love having\n\n01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:24.640\nwritten but also like I like I can't I can't give you I can't give you a first draft but I love\n\n01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.280\nclosing the deal the right one like like that day that you run off of the Warner Brothers a lot and\n\n01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:36.160\nyou're like they fucking bought it what the fuck talking robots meet a spongebob you run out to the\n\n01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.840\nbarn you're like I'm gonna tell spongebob's gonna say this and then this robot dick's gonna come on oh my\n\n01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.680\ngod this is gonna be the best movie ever and then like the and then you're like you wake up the next\n\n01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.480\nday and you're like I got a fucking dopamine rush off of selling that movie I'm not gonna write it\n\n01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:55.040\nif Dorothy if Dorothy Parker or Winston Churchill or Juno Barnes or like like like all these hilarious\n\n01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:01.040\nlike all the Algonquin roundtable writers had Twitter they wouldn't have written shit they\n\n01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.680\nwould just go oh I get the dopamine rush of having said one little epigram and made everybody\n\n01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.120\nfucking freak out and then I can go to bed and do drugs forever it's really what we're good at I mean\n\n01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.720\nagain that's a that's a not to drive it into the ground but that's that sapiens book like it doesn't\n\n01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.680\nmention Twitter I don't think once but it's very it's glaring it's throbbing off of that book when\n\n01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.720\nit talks about like the what I was talking about how we defeated Neanderthals and Homo erectus because\n\n01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:37.280\nof our predilection for gossip like our it's it's it's eerily uplifting and downtrodding to\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.680\nlearn that your species is doing all the things that it's currently doing not as some weird by\n\n01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:50.880\nproduct of sentience which is this like race from animal to god but that exactly what we're doing\n\n01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:57.120\nright now is exactly the thing that we've always been good at and is the we tweeted the Neanderthals\n\n01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:04.400\nout of existence you we expect expect that to be well we have our our our gossip our particular\n\n01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:11.760\nour ability to to to understand things beyond a hundred people is how we beat all of the other\n\n01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.240\nforms of human his technical term for it was that sapiens developed like sentience and then\n\n01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:22.880\nsubjectivity the ability to think abstractly and then when you can relate abstract ideas it's\n\n01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:29.600\ngossip so like if I say to you I go hey did you hear that this guy Jeremy Johnson like like what\n\n01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:36.640\nhe said about like how we should kick the Neanderthals ass like you we we are we our species was able\n\n01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:42.080\nto to reach that Neanderthals couldn't do that they couldn't go like hey you did you hear what\n\n01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:48.240\nUgg said about what it's it's just like like they they they were arguably more intelligent than us\n\n01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:53.600\non like a local level like they like we probably I think we would have really gotten along with them\n\n01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.680\ncould we do a scene where a almost sapiens meets a Neanderthal and tries to try to gossip with\n\n01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:08.160\ntry to gossip with with a Neanderthal okay please give us a music cue\n\n01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:16.560\ndo stand up from the corn do corn husk no no it's more of a scene right i'm coming i'm visiting\n\n01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:24.720\nyour cave i'm coming around and i think i could i suggest could i make a suggestion that the okay\n\n01:15:24.720 -->

that's the that's the weird thing i think that all of we were humans so we\n\n01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.960\nwere all way above chimpanzees and when you look at chimpanzees you're like jesus christ these dudes\n\n01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:20.160\nare really close to like they're so you everybody that was the end of those like you know bob neanderthal\n\n01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:27.120\ngoes up to jill neanderthal and goes hey do you hear about jim over there and then the other one\n\n01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:33.200\nwould go like hey man don't do that well he's like i think i think he's like that was it i no i think\n\n01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.880\ni think i think you got a hundred neanderthal tribe and the one neanderthal goes up the other\n\n01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:42.800\ngoes like hey did you hear about jim and if he has heard about jim and he knows jim he's like\n\n01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:52.480\ngot yeah totally gotcha and and but what we invented was the idea of like hey did you hear about this\n\n01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:59.920\nguy jim who's jim well anyways he's this guy from 30 miles away you maybe you'll meet him one day\n\n01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:05.280\nmaybe you won't but he's like this right and so he's looking at this snake and the snake like\n\n01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.800\ntries to bite him and he grabs it and he fucking eats it jim's a hero pass the word along jim's the\n\n01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:17.440\nfucking best in fact you know the snakes i'm going to give you actually a piece of fabric that has\n\n01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:24.320\nthe word j on it and like it means jim and like if we ever come around and we go like dude jim\n\n01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:28.640\nneeds to fucking muscle up the neanderthals are giving us trouble like can we count on you guys\n\n01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:36.960\nmy my handshakes my bond like we'll leave you in peace these concepts the concept of of of of\n\n01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:46.400\nof it's a shirt don't overreact a shirt fell off my lap but it's it's it's basically that it's our\n\n01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:53.200\nability to believe in things that aren't that are not real weaponizing weaponizing abstract thought\n\n01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.600\nhere's a way that we would have loved that we would love to hang out with neanderthals right now\n\n01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:04.720\nis that neanderthals would be like hey can you hang out tomorrow night and we would say no neanderthal\n\n01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:10.160\ni have to work and the neanderthal would go why i just asked if you want to hang out tomorrow night\n\n01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:17.200\nit's gonna be the best by neanderthal standards and we'd be like i know i can't because even though\n\n01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:24.480\ni'm square right now with american express like i i if i don't keep working i might get fired and if\n\n01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:30.800\ni do get fired i won't be able to pay and the neanderthals like whoa whoa whoa i'm asking if you\n\n01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.840\nwant to hang out tomorrow night like neanderthals basically styles in teen wolf like like like\n\n01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:47.200\nit it's it's it's every it's every um i take offense to that because it's being in the moment\n\n01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.000\ni mean i thought like like we kind of invented being out of the moment it's kind of sad like\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.840\nlike like that we yeah that's we invented we invented the but it's also it's just as good\n\n01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:03.200\ntoo though we invented peter pan and we invented taxes well i mean i got a theory oh yeah we're\n\n01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.080\ndefinitely if you look at the brain patterns and like that type of thing if you take abstract\n\n01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.920\nthought and like things that can distract you from a meditative state for instance right\n\n01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.960\nso like uh regrets what happened yesterday what i'm gonna do tomorrow things that you want to\n\n01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.840\nhappen to stream of consciousness or whatever a lot of monks and a lot of serious motherfuckers\n\n01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.760\ndedicate 50 70 years in a cave to get to that level to even like get rid of that stream we barely\n\n01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:34.160\neven know what that type of a mind is capable of we're best able to do 200 hours certification\n\n01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.280\ni'm in i mean yeah at the very least what was that a yupa light we're a yup nation out there\n\n01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.120\nyou're trying to create a yup army around right here i mean yo i got people i got i got eyes on\n\n01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:49.040\nevery corner you overthrowing my neanderthal tribe go ahead please it is well anyway just\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.080\nlong story short so i've studied the yoga and stuff and it's either bullshit or it's not\n\n01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.080\nbut what these guys say what these guys say is that these high-level motherfucker monks\n\n01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:08.480\ncould do some heavy-duty shit like but everywhere from levitation to laser beams being able to you\n\n01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:14.240\nknow teleport to being able to commune with deities or call things to happen to healings\n\n01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:20.000\nthat's why i that are another mystic traditions like jc laying down the miracles and shit which\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.200\nall happen to be classic yoga master miracles just saying but anyway i'm saying if the fact\n\n01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.880\nthat it was a different brain or a different thought pattern and that we we didn't have access\n\n01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.560\nto uh you know abstract thought and being able to weaponize that i think harari overlooks the\n\n01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:43.840\ncapabilities of like a fully whatever neanderthal or yogic or whatever meditative mind and we have\n\n01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.360\nno way of knowing that but if you want to if you want to get down to the nitty gritty of it what\n\n01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:52.720\ni'm scared of and my takeaway from it was there was major competition or a reason that these species\n\n01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:57.280\nlike one after each other and i think you know it just yeah it's the reason is us you know what\n\n01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.240\nyou know what i'm scared of is like i'm scared that we're gonna meet an alien planet and that the\n\n01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:10.480\nalien planet is gonna it's just gonna have like crab monsters that are like they're like kind of\n\n01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:16.240\nlike 90 iq crab people and they're like we come in peace and we're like okay we can deal you're\n\n01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:22.240\nbasically uh antiques roadshow viewer we're like we're ready to rock i i don't know why i took a\n\n01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.800\nshot at i just picked a random group of people to take a shot at it was the randomest i have no\n\n01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:37.680\nopinion about you if you watch antiques i'm so sorry i went so lateral i'm so gun shy about\n\n01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:44.560\nlike picking fights with anybody that are just like just punched like the basically the the\n\n01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:51.280\ndemographic equivalent of the of the blind melon girl dressed as a bumblebee like pow and it's just\n\n01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:58.240\nlike i don't know where to land this bam antiques roadshow viewers what did they do to deserve this\n\n01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:04.320\ntoday i would i would have gone junior kick bus anyways i like like like like so so like these\n\n01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.160\ncrab creatures go like we come in peace and we're like we come in peace too and they're like we love\n\n01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.640\ncrab stuff and we're like we love crab stuff too like we're down like how about you send some\n\n01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:18.480\ncrab people to our planet like we'll shut down some red lobsters during your visit to avoid\n\n01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.200\nawkwardness and you will probably have monkey restaurants that you need to shut down but\n\n01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:27.760\nlike we'll send some emissaries to your planet i'm worried that our emissaries basically what\n\n01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.760\ni'm learning from the sapiens book is that the thing that will happen i'm not i'm not i'm not\n\n01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:38.560\nreally worried about this happening i'm i'm i'm expressing a concern about our species is that\n\n01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:44.720\nthat we're the kind of species that if that happened and we went to their planet everything\n\n01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:50.880\nwould be kosher until we got to their planet and they were like so anyways here's some flowers\n\n01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:54.960\nthe flowers oh these flowers are nice and the flowers like don't fuck with me motherfucker\n\n01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:00.160\nand we'd be like whoa flower just talked shit and the crab and we're like yeah sometimes the\n\n01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:07.200\nflowers talk shit and and and we'd be like you gotta get your flowers in line bro like and they're\n\n01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.880\nlike no crabs live among the flowers uh they're like okay well who pollinates the thing well the\n\n01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:19.200\nbees do have you met the bees i'm a bee i'm a bee like wait are they smart bees or dumb bees\n\n01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:26.320\nwell we don't really judge uh there's they have brains they're super smart and like and we're just\n\n01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:30.720\nlike we will without even realizing what they're like dude like like it's kind of remember when\n\n01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:34.800\ni told my story of going to fiji and it's like i couldn't just fucking relax like i had these like\n\n01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:43.040\nlike these these people that live in fucking like just they just live in like what i call garbage\n\n01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:50.080\nand have what i call unreasonable smiles on their face and have been trained by a hotel slash like\n\n01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:54.880\ntheir thing and like all i can do is fucking drink their mystical root and like like i think\n\n01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:59.680\ni'm being a good guy by trying to stir up shit i'm like seriously though it's fucked up if the\n\n01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:05.440\narmy runs your island like like i'm like i'm like it's like gossip it's like it's like what i can't\n\n01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:11.760\nfucking like like take it easy like like like maybe shit that doesn't seem i just i fear that\n\n01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:18.240\nhomo sapiens is that's like it's weird now i realize it's weird having read that book that\n\n01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:24.080\nwe are that that there's grizzly bears and brown bears and black bears and there's all these things\n\n01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:29.280\nand it's like nope we're just the only human and that we've actually worked that into our history\n\n01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:35.600\nthat we teach ourselves and he meant we go like yep there can be only one no yeah if you're a\n\n01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:42.160\nserial killer like like there can be only one and that we would react poorly to an intergalactic\n\n01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:47.600\ncommunity that we that they would meet us at a party if if if volkins or anybody came around\n\n01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:53.680\nthey would be like dude these people can't handle spiders talking to them because they they they\n\n01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:59.440\nhave it built into them they believe that every planet has to have a fucking kirk on it that like\n\n01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:06.080\ntells the planet what to do and they they believe that because they're basically like dexter they\n\n01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:11.680\nwere born in blood and they believe that you have to kill in order to live and they they're like\n\n01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:18.400\ngenocidal maniacs and to the point where their pecassos don't know that they're genocidal maniacs\n\n01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:24.000\nlike people that believe in not genocide are genocidal maniacs they just believe in like this\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.800\npyramid structure that we we're unique in the universe in that regard because the the leverage\n\n01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:36.240\nthat we used on some other planet there's like a grasshopper species it's like yeah jump really high\n\n01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:43.200\nand i like i jump so high that eventually i they didn't become sentient like they they just became\n\n01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:50.000\nlike this really like amazing high jumping dominant species that was like so facile that they kind of\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.760\nlike yeah they're arguably in charge of the planet but then they're operating a kind of co\n\n01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:01.120\ncooperation with like a tree that grabs you if you move too fast and eats you with its trunk\n\n01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:06.720\nand we're going to show up and go come on what's the fucking episode here who do i kill and they're\n\n01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:11.920\ngoing to be like whoa whoa flow bill like no one invited you to this wild west show and we're like\n\n01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:17.760\nno no where's the side show who's who do i lasso i i i worry that that's actually i don't worry\n\n01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.040\nthat that's gonna happen because in our wildest dreams we'll ever meet anyone from another planet\n\n01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:26.000\ni'm worried that that's what we are that that's the disease we have that we actually don't even\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.360\nknow we're suffering from it because we have no one to talk to about it let me throw you a counter\n\n01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.000\npoint that's who we were before we got to like a globalized like structure of society that we kind\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nof were approaching but you can't you can't if you kill everybody if you kill everybody you\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000\ncould have talked to we need to we need to clone neanderthals and we need to talk to them that's\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:51.600\nour only hope but the end of dexter's uh ambidextrous what the amb the end of dexter sucks all right\n\n01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.840\nmy thing is think about how many human generations it took to get to the i thought he said the amb\n\n01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:02.800\nthe ambidextrous sex i said i was i was like tell me more and then it was like oh no no\n\n01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:10.720\nwhite white how does dexter end he gets away with it he moves away secretly to uh\n\n01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:15.840\nhe becomes a lumberjack and now another and now he kills wait how is that a bad ending for dexter\n\n01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:25.360\nyou wanted to just keep killing people i expected more from you or are you born i don't know i\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:31.200\nthere's only one way to find out get him if he if he breaks all our necks and and and interpol\n\n01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:36.960\ncan't catch him that was the higgin bottom how would you how would you have an ended dexter\n\n01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:48.560\nlike after you saw him go become a lumberjack you were like well i clearly they should have\n\n01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:53.360\ndone this right i mean what was the you're eating cake well let him answer let him answer\n\n01:34:53.360 --> 01:35:02.320\ni mean i i like that bro something something like actually well we don't have to all right\n\n01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:08.240\nwell i one hand i one hand don't do that to him on the other hand do you know how that feels see\n\n01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:16.560\nto hear fucking humanity while you're just treading water oh oh oh oh oh yeah come on\n\n01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:24.240\nhe becomes a superhero at the end of at the end that's a good way to end\n\n01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.600\nis that he just goes like now but you know what now i know what i need to do and he like gets\n\n01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.040\noff the payphone like neo and he just like flies up another camera look i'm not saying you're wrong\n\n01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:40.800\ni stopped watching after episode six because as with lost i know when i'm being dicked around\n\n01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:49.280\ni know i know when i'm watching improv and when i'm watching\n\n01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:56.160\ni don't like serialization you if you're gonna serialize your show you got a you\n\n01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:02.880\nlike you got another thing you got you you you better make the most of that fucking season\n\n01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:08.720\nyou better blow my fucking gen X mind

01:36:18.720\ncares but like like like like you hear a millennial go pitching they'll go like it's like for better\n\n01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:22.880\nand for worse like in the post netflix world the the millennial writers would be like so\n\n01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:32.640\nthe show i want to do is uh groundhog day meets groundhog day and but here's the thing but but\n\n01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:39.200\nso it meets a first season no groundhog day nothing it's just a guy shaving and then he\n\n01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:44.240\nkeeps shaving every episode two through fourteen he's like his beard keeps like it's like where's\n\n01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.640\nsomething wrong with my beard and like end of that season it's like oh shit saucer comes down\n\n01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.560\nouter space it's groundhog day planet now seasons two through seven i'm like wait what in the\n\n01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:05.120\nfucking entitlement like what you you kids with your serialization like unbelievable i i you already\n\n01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:14.240\nrejected my pitch now this is just this is just me it was bad enough the first time but i want to\n\n01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:21.520\nsay also i'm a convert because i i i talked shit about mind hunter like every episode kept hate\n\n01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:26.240\nwatching mind hunter stupid mind hunter i got to the end of mind hunter like right like the last\n\n01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:33.200\ncouple episodes i started getting sucked in mind mind hunter don't mind hunter he hunts mind don't\n\n01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:41.440\nmind hunter he's just a little bit abrasive don't mind hunter now hunter are you going to behave\n\n01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:48.160\nyourself don't mind hunter is he german i what was his last was mind hunter my point is if you're\n\n01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.120\ngonna if you're gonna serialize your television please like really understand that the reason\n\n01:37:53.120 -->
