WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Zero audio.

00:03.000 --> 00:18.000
I never thought it would happen with me and the girl from Clapham

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
I don't know where to call her, but I thought I had forgotten

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
When she dealt all the wrong

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Hear ye, hear ye, Harmontown is now in session

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm your guest Comptroller Steve A.J.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
And now here's the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hey San Francisco

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Booyah

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Thank you so much, thank you for staying for the movie and the Q&A

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Booyah, we have so much to be grateful for with these fans

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
They watch a two hour movie

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Let's go around the stage and say what we're grateful for

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Early Thanksgiving

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
San Francisco, it's our favorite city, right Steve A.J.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh my God

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
It's the New York

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I was given my choice of cities to Comptroller, guest Comptroller

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
And I said San Francisco, no joke, I love San Francisco

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
It's the New York of California

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Kind of

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
That's what they call it

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
So much so that that offends them

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Just like New Yorkers

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Hey, fuck you, this is the San Diego of California, motherfucker

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
The San Diego of California

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
That's in California, never mind

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Let's see if I have any items to talk about

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
My giant iPhone 6 Plus Plus

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
6 Plus, that is massive

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, I got the 6 Plus Plus

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
People don't even know it exists, me and John Hamm have this

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Okay, alright, here's something

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
I don't cotton to using bodies for letters on billboards

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't think that you should be allowed to use a human body as a letter in the title of your movie

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I won't allow it anymore

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
For example

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh, well, I don't know, John Warrick, whatever that movie is

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Keanu Reeves, it says John Warrick, and then one of the letters is just Keanu Reeves

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
We have to fill that in with our own brains

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
What is it? What is a human being?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Is he an A? Is he an E?

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
You can't just assume, yeah, I figured it out, I looked it up

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
It's John Wick

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
He's an I, motherfucker

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
And then I get really pissed off, because then it says John Wick

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
And then the tagline is, don't set him off

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Don't type set him off

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Thank you, goodnight, we'll be at the bar next door

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Kettle one for everybody

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
Don't set him off because he's a Wick

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
Because bombs use wicks?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
No, they use fuses

03:20.000 --> 03:29.000
His name's not John Fuse, and even if it was, the tagline should be, don't use him to set something off

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
And if he's a Wick, the only thing he can set off is a candle

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Like, don't use him to make the room slightly lighter

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
Don't use him if you shit in someone else's bathroom, and you need to cover it up

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Just call him John Bomb

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
John Explosion, John Booboo

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
It's probably harder for him to make an O in a billboard

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah

03:56.000 --> 04:05.000
But he would have done like a home alone thing, it would be John Bomb and the O would be Keanu Reeves' mouth going, oooooh

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
I'm gonna blow up, don't set me off

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
Steve, today a second man jumped over the fence at the White House and charged headlong at it

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
It's about time

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Why does this happen more?

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Is it a federal offense for us to say, this is awesome?

04:28.000 --> 04:36.000
I mean, we're not saying you should do it, it's just a fun time to be alive

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
All the fucked up shit to be going on, I think it's kind of neat that

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
It's some little rascal shit

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah, it's like the sandlot

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
Like what are these guys doing? The first guy had a knife, and he got up to the, you know

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
He got into the Lincoln bedroom and took a nap, right?

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah, he got, he was by the statue of Martin Sheen with his knife, like stabbing it

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Practicing for the real president

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Did this new guy have anything?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I don't think he, I think he had dog treats in his pocket

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah, weaponized Ebola

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
No, I don't know if he had anything, he jumped over the fence and then the, I guess two dogs got him right away

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
And he kind of punched the dogs a little bit, which got him assault charges

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
So they have guard dogs now instead of like

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Obviously the people were not on the ball

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
The first guy made it into the gift shop

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
So the second guy, yeah, he got, he ran up against the White House's best friend

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't know, I think it's neat, I think if you're going to have a White House and have a fence around it

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
I think it should be a tradition that every once in a while some guy

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
It is crazy that it's low enough to jump

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
It should be like 12 feet high

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
It should be, I mean, they'll probably add like, now it'll like electrocute you if you touch it, right?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Which would be more appropriate, like it feels a little dishonest to be like

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Have this like beautiful house where you have orphans hunt for eggs in the, in the Easter

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
You know, it's like, oh yeah, you're

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
A turkey, everything's giving

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
You know, we're just hanging out, running the country, you know, like come on in if you want, just kidding

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Hey, if you could jump the fence, welcome, come on in

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
It's kind of, kind of appropriate if they have to actually like make it lasers or something that'll like

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Like you put your hand through it and then, yeah, you lose your arm

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
I don't know

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah, speaking of current events, which I know people love to come to this show for

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Because there is no other podcast, if not this podcast, where would people hear about current events?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Where'd you get your news?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Ebola

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
It's tough stuff

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
It's real, it's real

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
It's here

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
I'll tell you guys, like I didn't know that much about Ebola and I didn't know, I wasn't very informed

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
And so I started looking at the articles and what I've learned from the comment sections under them is that

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
Is that this disease is very scary, but on the other hand it's also very overdue

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Like Africanized killer bees

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
Remember, as a kid, they were like, yeah, there's killer bees in South America and they're making their way north

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
And now they're in America

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I want to do that bit again

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Okay

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I wasn't that informed about Ebola

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And then what I've learned from reading the articles and the comment sections under it is that it's a very scary disease

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
But on the other hand, it's very overdue

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Are we supposed to cheer that?

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah, because the people are, I guess my joke is that the people in the comment sections are so dumb

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
You read the article, it doesn't really matter what the article says

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
By the time you get to the bottom of the comment section you're like, fucking yes, make this

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
It is overdue, yeah

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
Wipe us out, cut us down with a machete, take us out, we are so dumb

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
It's like a clearing house for all the weird conspiracy theories and racist shit

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
You see comments where people are like, I saw a comment where a guy said, what a coincidence

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
An African plague after we elect our first African American president

08:11.000 --> 08:18.000
That is fucking classic racism, that's beyond, that's like the lead zeppelin of racism

08:18.000 --> 08:28.000
It doesn't even have anything to do with break dancing or implying that Barack Obama is going to paint the White House with leopard print

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
It's just going straight to the, yeah, he's African American and though it's his fault that there's African

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
And everybody, the gun control people always find a way to start arguing in the middle of a thing

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
No matter what the article's about, there's always the people that come in and go, still, like 14 people killed last week with handguns

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
And then people take that bait and then it's just like, you read these comment sections and you're just like, yeah, bring it in, man

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Bring the White Walkers in

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
What are we doing? Let's get to the moon, let's take San Francisco and put it on the moon

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
I was going to ask you that, I had one of my things to ask you because I haven't heard you mention it in a long time

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I was like, did you bail on the colonizing the moon premise?

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm back to it now, I'm like, we got it and it's not because of Ebola, I'm not scared of Ebola

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
I'm scared of, I'm proud of our country for not, I don't know, like, oh, this guy in New York's now got it

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
He's a doctor, he's for Doctors Without Borders, he was

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
He was there with Ebola, yeah, no wonder

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
I did see, this is one of my favorite comments, this is a very clever comment, like somebody said

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
Don't worry, Republicans, all the people getting the disease so far have been helping people, you're safe

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Oh my God, that is great

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I thought that was fucking awesome

09:45.000 --> 09:52.000
But it is true, I mean, it is so far, that's the way you can be in the first world and get the disease is caring too much

09:52.000 --> 10:01.000
And there's, in these people so far, they're healthcare workers and the idea that their health is, you know, I mean, I'm proud of the fact that we

10:01.000 --> 10:11.000
We grab them and we, you know, we quarantine them and we're doing everything we can and they're okay so far and they got sick trying to help people

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
And it's, we gotta, I think that's gotta be the way to do it

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
You see in these comments, it's just like such a strange world we've entered where people, I don't even think they think of people as people anymore

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
They go like, oh yeah, we gotta seal up the borders and let this thing run its course

10:27.000 --> 10:35.000
Its course is people, its course is other dudes, like what course do you want it to run?

10:35.000 --> 10:45.000
We think we're gonna shut up America, like it's a newsstand and just subsist on our own chewing gum and Mentos and then open it back up

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
And be like, open for business, whoa, we're all our customers and employees

10:51.000 --> 11:05.000
But yeah, I hope that these people are okay, I hope that that New York guy makes it through because he's like, definitely got that disease by giving a huge shit that a lot of us don't give

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
Gooderman's socks

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
You wearing some right now?

11:13.000 --> 11:23.000
Nope, what I'm wearing right now are very threadbare socks where the ankle is all, there's no ankles on any of my socks anymore, they all have holes where the ankles are

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Ankle or heels?

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
You got sharp ankles dude

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Heels, heel, right, heel

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Old razor blade heels, Harmon over there

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
Like where the heel is, like it's just skin and then it's like, so the top of the back of the shoe scrapes there

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
You guys know what I'm talking about

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
I need new socks, we've all been there, what's that?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Wigwams

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah, wear a fucking teepee on your feet Dan

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Is that the new Ugg wigwams?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Wigwams been around forever

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Like Ebola

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
I'll check in with you in a second

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
I'm a man of means, I could procure my own socks like if I wanted to

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
And I just don't do it, we were at it, the community writers were getting a lot done the other day

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
I decided to reward us and incentivize more productivity by taking them to a bar

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
We went to a bar, we were drinking, we were trying to come up with another story

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Oh what if Hobbit does a magic trick, I don't know, who knows

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
And then this guy comes in with a big duffel bag and it's just teeming with all these colorful socks

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And he's going socks, socks

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
In a bar?

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
You know how like a guy will walk into a bar and go like pepperoni or flower for the lady

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
This guy had socks

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Pepperoni?

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
I've seen flowers for a lady, I've never seen the pepperoni guy

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
Well in LA it's tamales and in Milwaukee there was a guy named Frank who would come in and go

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
pepperoni, cannoli

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
And then you'd say I'd like a pepperoni and he'd go spice a mild

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I guess spice

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
What kind of socks was this guy selling?

13:09.000 --> 13:17.000
Just probably stolen, I'm assuming, because they were very cheap and he just had a lot of them

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
And so here's my new philosophical epiphany

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
So Dan Gutterman, one of the writers, he immediately, we're all going like that guy's selling socks in a bar

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Let's all react to that, let's all think of how funny that is

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
What an anomaly that is, why is he selling socks in a bar?

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Dan Gutterman's like, I need socks

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
And he's like, he just interested in a transaction with the guy, Dan Gutterman needs socks

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
So now it's even funnier and we're like, Dan Gutterman's buying socks from the socks guy

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
Not only did the guy selling socks come in, but Dan Gutterman's buying socks, this is the best

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
If you're going to Instagram this, then the guy leaves, I need fucking socks

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
We all need socks

14:02.000 --> 14:11.000
We all need socks, I especially needed socks, I'm walking around with scraped, uncomfortable heels

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Moldy heels, because your feet sweat in your shoes

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
Because I allowed myself to be taken out of the moment by the Matrix

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
Gutterman's socks are thick and plush and because Gutterman saw past the

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
He was like, I'm not going to just enforce social mores and normality

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm just going to, he's selling socks

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I need socks, I'll buy some fucking socks

14:38.000 --> 14:45.000
He made the practical anarchic connection, he didn't run it through some super ego or governmental like regulator

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Of like, oh the queen bee wouldn't like you selling socks right now

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
I should make fun of you, maybe I could get comedy points

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
He's like, my feet need socks, money, socks, transaction, done

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Now Dan Gutterman has socks

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And I don't, I'm walking around like a jackass, I got bloody feet

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
They're not bloody, I'm just making a point

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
I want everyone, I don't think San Francisco is the place you have to say this

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
I think San Francisco is a city full of Guttermans

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
It's sock city, that's what they, they used to be called the city by the bay now, it's called sock city

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
These guys, if they see a Google bus, they'll storm it, they don't care

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
What's a Google bus?

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
There was a thing last year, we were here in San Francisco, somebody tweeted me about this

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
I'll explain this to AG, I'm sure I'll get everything wrong

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
Apparently there's a bit of a gentrification thing happening, San Francisco has been through a lot of phases

15:47.000 --> 15:56.000
There's like, there's, you know, there's, it's a beautiful city full of wonderful people

15:56.000 --> 16:06.000
And also some very affordable housing and it's just like a, it's a big mishmash full of awesome hippies and scientists and whatever you call them

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
And these, there's these people on this hill somewhere outside the city where they make, they make the computers or something

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
And they have, and they make a lot of money and they're kind of like, they have to live in San Francisco

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
And then they like, somehow this gentrification thing happens where people get pushed out of neighborhoods that used to be affordable

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
Or no longer affordable because landlords can make more money off of these, these Silicon Valley types that are like, like, like, like moving in

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
And they have their own transportation or had, I'll use the past tense because I read about this, okay

16:39.000 --> 16:46.000
They have, they have Google buses that take them up to Google Mountain

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
Is Google Mountain, I don't know, is it Google Mountain? Do they really call it Google Mountain?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
No, I don't know about that part

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
It escaped to Google Mountain

16:57.000 --> 17:04.000
And so, and so meanwhile, like, if you park, if you park in the wrong place, if you leave your car in the wrong place

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
You get a ticket, you get like a $70 ticket, whatever, a $700 ticket

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
It's illegal to be poor as it is anywhere else, it's also illegal to be poor in San Francisco

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
It's not illegal to have a Google bus that can use the same bus lanes as regular buses

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
So this is the side of the people, I'm jumping into a whole thing that I don't know nothing about

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
But like, so there was a Google bus incident where there was a Google bus parked in a regular bus lane

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Which technically speaking, a vehicle is not allowed to do, it should get a ticket

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
So like kind of spontaneously a bunch of citizens sort of like blocked the bus

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
And said, you're not leaving until you pay the fucking ticket we would get if our car was occupying our space

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
And they kind of like, and then the picket signs came out and they're like, Google bus pay ticket, Google bus pay

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
We want the cops, give them a ticket

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
And the people inside were like, all I did was like Kubert in college

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
I don't even know what the city is, I've never, I'm from, I'm from Austin

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Google gate

18:05.000 --> 18:12.000
I'm sure I got all of that wrong, but so that's what I got from skimming one USA Today article

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
Is there a Google, Google gate, Google bus gate expert here?

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Somebody that's more intimately acquainted with the hot buttons

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
You guys are bored with it, that's what I'm getting

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Seeing folded arms and rolled eyes

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
They want to get over it

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
That's the other, San Francisco's lived through a lot of phases of like interlopers

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
The city survives these financial vikings

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
You know, everybody wants to live in San Francisco

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
They're always fucking with their beautiful Eden

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And they weather it, they weather it

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
They don't applaud for that being said

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
They're worn out from weathering it

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
And I would never solicit applause

19:00.000 --> 19:08.000
Hey, can I make a request, since this is a very special time of year

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Can we do a Harmontown Sports Corner?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Oh, sure, sure

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Sports Corner!

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
What do you think about what's going on right now?

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
And it's really obvious what I'm talking about

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
It's a very exciting time

19:31.000 --> 19:39.000
No question, I mean this is the time of year that all sports fans look forward to

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
And comment, like this is Christmas for sports fans, is what I call it

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
I don't even call it by its actual name

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
I just call it Christmas for sports fans

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
For America's favorite pastime fans

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Yup, whoa, whoa, yeah

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
That's baseball

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
It's baseball time again

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
And the mother of all baseball

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Who do you favor in this year's World Series, Stan?

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
I mean, you've got a whole planet full of baseball teams

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
All convening into a series of baseball games

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Where they gradually play each other and whittle down to just two teams

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
And then that determines who's the best baseball team on the planet

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
I mean, I know you know that

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
Right now we are at that very specific point in that process

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
We're two games in

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Two games into the beginning of the whole process?

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
I'm not asking a question

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
You know it's not like the Super Bowl, it's a series

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
It's two games into the World Series, which is like fucking like

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
Relative to the World Series duration

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Two games in is the plot point

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Yeah, where in the story circle are we?

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
This is where Kevin McAllister gets left home alone

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I think, I would say

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Maybe

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Or where Catherine Herrera comes back

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I don't know

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh, okay, well, I mean, you must be not much of a sports fan

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
The World Series right now is at a fever pitch

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It's neck and neck

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
We don't know who's going to win

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Who do you like though?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
You've got to be careful being here right now

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
You don't want to say the wrong team

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
I love, I mean, look, this city's team is the best team

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
That's right, yeah

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
You can hear it in their applause

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
You can feel it in their hearts

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Like this city has its team fever

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
They have every reason to be very proud

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
This is a huge corporation that has drafted people from all over

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
And called them San Francisco baseball players

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
And what's not to be proud of

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
The Giants?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Wow

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Sport Master

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
San Francisco Giants

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Two games into the World Series

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Neck and neck with their arch enemy

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
The Mongoose to their Cobra

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
One and one

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Could you ask for a more vicious opponent?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
It doesn't even matter, right?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
You almost don't even need to say the other teams

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
No, no, no

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
I would ignore them

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I don't think they're going to be much of a threat

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
I think the Giants are going to sweep their...

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
I don't know

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
It's going to be tough

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Well, stay tuned, man

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Because they've been getting the hits

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
They've been getting the runs

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
They've been getting the line drives

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And all of the pop-ups

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
And that is the game of baseball

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
People focus on foul balls and strikes

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
It's not about that

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
It's about line drives and pop-ups

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Pay attention to that

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
The Giants are king

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
So good luck

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And we'll see you at the end of the World Series

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Hope you beat that other team

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
That's it for Sports Corner!

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Fuck the Kansas City Royals

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh, the Royals? Oh, okay

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I saw a thing on Twitter now

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
That makes sense that there was...

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
The radio station banned the play of the Lord song

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
You were just like, I think Ebola's in Kansas City

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I'm not going to follow up on this

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
When you said that, Royals, I'm like,

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Okay, that makes sense, the Lord song

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Okay, that's why that radio station banned the...

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah, okay, that makes sense

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Yeah

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
No, it doesn't

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Does it make sense?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
No, not really

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
Maybe think about putting a band on top 40 songs

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Before they have a potential to get that out of control

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
It's like book burning, almost

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
San Francisco's hard to pimp for applause

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
They've heard it all

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
That's what they like, and they will only applaud for that

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
You can't just come up here and go,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Yeah, I got my dick pierced the other day

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Yeah, apparently you can't

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I don't even know why, I just felt like it

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Took a trolley over to the...

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Heroine shop

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
It's not a trolley

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I think it's a cable car, Dan

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Wait, it's not called a trolley?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I'm so sorry, guys

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
What the fuck is a trolley?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
The difference is...

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Mr. Rogers shit

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Well, okay, so wait a minute, I do have a question about that

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
Because I passed one of those, I saw it going up a hill, a cable car

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
But there was no cable

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
It's underneath now, or was it always underneath?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Okay, so it's the other cities that are there overhead

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And they got the things hooked up to them

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Okay, those are trolleys

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
If they're electric, they have the wires above them

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
This is a cable car, there's not literally a...

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Pulling it like a Goonies device?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah, that's straight up little rascals right there

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
That's insane

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
A bunch of ducks in a pond pulling them under the street

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Jesus, that is the dick piercing of mass transit

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
This city has got it all

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
They're not the New York of California

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
They're the Portland of the Bay

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Portland of the Bay

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
You guys won't be happy until I say this city was made by God

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
They built this city on rock and roll

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Alright, well, let's bring it

26:09.000 --> 26:16.000
I mean, obviously, it would be folly for me to sit here

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
and try to talk about San Francisco

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
when you and our Dungeon Master spent all day

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
really seeing the sights

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
We hit all the sights

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Can we bring up Spencer Crintenden?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Spencer!

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Oh my God, he's running

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
He always runs

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Wow

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Hey, hey guys

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Oh, he ran, he ran up here

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I'm really...

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Spencer, you and AG, you guys got here hours before I did

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
and you guys really saw the real San Francisco

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
We saw the realest

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Man, we found the finest little lunch nook

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
It was called, what do they call it?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Chipotle

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Real down bone cuisine

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
And then got drinks at Starbucks afterwards

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
and then dessert at Cold Stone Creamery

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
This isn't a joke, that's exactly what they did

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
All these fine artisanal craftsmen

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
Everything we could have done in Los Angeles

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
in the airport

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Just really soaking in the culture

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah, but you guys partook so much, Spencer

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
You got a little sick, right?

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
I mean, I don't have a great stomach before Harmontown shows

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
It's documented fact

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
You still get a little queasy?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Oh yeah

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
From Superstaritis?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
No, that's not why

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
What is it, Spencer?

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
It's just not Superstaritis

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Yeah, well can you counter that with something...

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Anxiety?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
No, anxiety, that's the one

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Do you still, do you puke?

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
No, no, I probably will

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Someday?

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I mean, in a couple of minutes

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It'll be fine, it'll just get this guy

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
He knows, he knows

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Yeah, you know last time we were in San Francisco

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Me and A.G. hung out, it was like the first time

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
I had really, you know, talked to the guy in person, I think

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
And we hung out and got pizzas, it was good times

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah, we went to Domino's

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Got an authentic slice

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Then got drinks at a 7-Eleven

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
You guys make a good pair

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
I would be comfortable trusting a murder case to the two of you

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
I don't know if it would get solved, but I would like to watch you try to solve it

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
So comical

29:01.000 --> 29:07.000
It would all be like centered around how we just see clues that are higher up than everyone else can see

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
Just be like, oh, actually on top of the door jam, there's fingerprints

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
Or we find clues in food, like bite into a hamburger with a ring in it

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
McDonald's usually doesn't have these kinds of additives, it's 100% beef

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
Seasoned with salt and pepper during cooking

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
They told me that on their Twitter account today

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Did they tweet at you?

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah, because they were like 100% beef in every patty

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
You put salt and pepper in it, there's grease in it, those things aren't beef

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
You can't say it's 100% beef if there's things that aren't beef comprising 100% of the object

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
And then they were like, it is 100% beef, we just add these things

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
And I was like, that doesn't refute my point at all

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
Was it San Francisco we were at, it was Sketchfest where that guy, was it, was that, was that where the

30:08.000 --> 30:14.000
No, Sketchfest was here, sure, but that's not necessarily where this guy was, calm down

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
Well, you San Francisco podcast listeners, was that where the guy that said he broke up with his girlfriend

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
And then there was the, then the girl in the audience was like, he's a liar

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I don't remember that

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
It was insane, it was so titillating and weird

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
It was just like a one guy going like, I got dumped by this girl and I'm totally broken hearted

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
And then just like, two minutes into it, you just keep hearing, liar, liar

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
By the girl he supposedly broke up with

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
No, just a stranger

30:46.000 --> 30:52.000
But not a stranger, somebody who then came up and said, I think she was a barista at a place that he frequents

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
And she says, he's a character at our place

30:54.000 --> 31:01.000
And like he says, I think her beef was that he, he's kind of a dramatic personality

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
And that he's always talking about this girl leaving him, but she's never seen him

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I really couldn't figure out what the hell was going on

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
It was like, it was very interesting how it fed on the human compulsion to like figure out what's right and what's wrong

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
What's just and what's, what's unjust

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
It was like, what is that, the Mori show

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
But if everyone was just guessing instead of actually having

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
You are probably not the father, Spencer

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I thought maybe

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
Isn't that kind of amazing about our species that you can put us in a situation where there's absolutely nothing at stake

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
But someone saying, bad person

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
And then the other person was like, no good person

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
And it kind of draws you in, you're like, I'm going to figure this out

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Because the objective truth is who gives a shit

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
But the answer is all of us, because we're all chimpanzees

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
We're all like, we got to figure this out

31:55.000 --> 32:01.000
We got to, I guess our instinct is we got to figure out which of these chimps is the bad person

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
And we got to deny them further figs and bananas and send them into the forest

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
Where they will die and stop contributing reproductively to the species

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
That's what's in our, that's what's in our gut, I guess

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Is when we tweet and hashtag and things

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
We're like, we're trying to expunge injustice

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
We want to create a good monkey species and like get rid of the bad people

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I love that she was just like, liar

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
In my head, even if I knew I'd be in the back of the room going, that guy's a fucking liar

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
To my friend, I wouldn't say it out loud

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
Yeah, it was really, from my perspective it was absolutely impossible to tell which of them was a hero or a villain

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
And who, what's that?

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
Oh yeah, are you just, is that just your objective opinion?

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
Okay, because if he had insider information, boom

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
Like we create our own little gamer gate right here in San Francisco

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Trying to unravel that shit

33:00.000 --> 33:07.000
Yeah, I don't know, well I was, I'm up here and sometimes I'm seeing things through a fog

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
Alright, well why don't we meet some San Franciscans, huh?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Oh, I'd love to

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
We should get to the bottom of them as people

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Should we find some people who are hurting tonight?

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Do we follow the pain? I don't know what else to follow

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Can't follow the joy

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Yeah, let's try to follow the joy

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Okay

33:26.000 --> 33:32.000
Let's see, is there...

33:32.000 --> 33:38.000
Who that is coincidentally within reach of my microphone cord

33:38.000 --> 33:46.000
Feels like they're kind of, they're kind of so high in terms of biorhythmic victories

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
That they're waiting for the other shoe to drop

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Like they're actually kind of nervous that they're going to jinx it by bragging

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
There's a hand back there waving back and forth

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
Let's just take a flyer and you come down because I can't reach back there

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
So we'll just trust you and...

34:00.000 --> 34:07.000
Is that right?

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Going on

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
It feels too Q&A-ish for him to be standing down there

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Can you climb up here?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Oh yeah, there's a seat up here

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Yeah!

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Alright

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
What's your name, young man?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Shame

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
What, shame?

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Jesus

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Shame

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Alright, here you grab that, I'll move

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
I'll move

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
We're following the joy

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I'll move the bottle

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Yeah, you're following the shame

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Yes

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
If your parents' name you shame, yeah, they're kind of set to move up to it

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Yeah, Hebrew means life in Hebrew

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Oh really?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Yeah, C-H-A-I-M

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Shame means life in Hebrew?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I-M, that's the pronunciation

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Oh, oh, I-M

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, I'm not just a cool guy, so it's shame

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
Oh, so you're just pronouncing it like the way we, when we meet up with Chris Anwich

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Exactly

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
So many people...

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
It's an Americanization of...

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
So many people say it wrong that I just say shame, so it makes it everything good

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
Alright, shame, I-M, you're feeling on top of things right now?

35:05.000 --> 35:12.000
Oh yeah, I'm literally high, and I'm here to see you, so I'm really good

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
And I'm on stage, so this is what I've been talking about with my friends

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
I told them that I was going to come up here because I'm black

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Oh, it's not a bad reason

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And that's actually not why we brought him up here

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I can tell he was black when he was waving at us

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
I was like, yeah, I'll take the black guy

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
I was going to yell out white guilt, but I didn't need to

35:34.000 --> 35:44.000
I get a high off of black people, and I suck stem cells out of the blackness

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
And I use it to revitalize my whiteness

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
I knew I was winning when I walked in this room and I was being black, yeah, definitely

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
So, what's it like being black with a Jewish name?

35:57.000 --> 36:02.000
No, let's just get to know you, what do you-

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
Can we ask how old you are? You seem kinda young

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
I'm 23

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Okay, right?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Yeah, I just turned 23 in June

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
We can still ask him

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
Yeah, so that means I can drink vodka whenever I want to

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Oh yeah, you can have it, you want to drink?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Hint, hint

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Wink, wink, right?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Yeah, you shouldn't have to ask, I'm sorry

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
Here, I don't want to dig, here, alright, I'll do that

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
I don't want to dig my-

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Man-harming hand juice will be awesome

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Untweetable

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Right

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Appreciate it, appreciate it

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
I'm drinking Kettle One, you guys, on the podcast

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
He's you

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
Oh, to you

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Oh, thanks, thanks, thanks

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
I just hear you man-harming guys on the podcast

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
So what do you- what's your- I would ask what you do

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
But you're 23, so you-

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
I work two full-time jobs and one part-time job right now

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Alright, run down the- run down them

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I work at Panera Bread as a baker

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
I actually have to go in a couple hours at midnight

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
And then I work at a grocery store during the day

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
And then I help out at a garden

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
A church garden for my grandmother

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
A church garden for your grandmother?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Yes, yes

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
You just cashed a sex check with every-

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah, exactly

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Single woman in the room

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
That's like San Francisco-

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Or at least with every grandmother in the room

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
Oh my god, he's adorable

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
Are you- can we ask about your sexual preference?

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Oh yes, I love when my girlfriend is in the audience

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Oh god, it's girlfriend's here, okay

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Crystal Cooper, I love you baby

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
So try to ignore the fact that the shame-heim-

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
It works part-time in a garden for his grandma

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Yeah

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Cause my underwear got a little wet when you said that

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Nice, nice, nice

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
It's very sexy

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Can I see?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
No

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Came out the wrong end

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
So how do you- how do you juggle on stuff?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Did you put a loaf of bread in the oven at the bakery

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
And then you came here and you're like-

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
I wish, I go in from midnight to eight

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
So then I turn around and go from nine thirty to six

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
And my other job

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
So I'll work all day on Friday

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Doesn't make any sense, are you on speed?

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
Just a lot of weed

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
When do you sleep?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
You said midnight to eight

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
I had an off day at my second job today

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
From like ten to about two when my homie called me

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
To come up here, I've been here since four thirty

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Jesus Christ

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I was the first person in line

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Are you a San Francisco native?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I am an Oakland native

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Oh Dan, since I'm up here in Oakland

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
We say yay, can I get a yee?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
Now I feel like I'm in a morning zoo show

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Dan, Dan, can we get a rap about the pinch of the pump?

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
Oh, we can rap together all day long

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Oh, I love that

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
My goodness, I didn't want to bring it up first

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Let's rap about it

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
It would have been racist of me to be the one to bring it up

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Would you like to rap with me young man?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
That's what I wanted to tell you

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Saying in word is not racist

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
It's like the best thing I've ever heard in my life

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
In rap form with the-

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Period, period, just

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Hey, in word, that's hilarious to me

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Like, that does not offend me whatsoever

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Well, I mean, I'm sure

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Yeah, that's up to you

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
You get to make the choice of what offends you

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Fuck those guys

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
What do you mean those guys?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Whoever has a problem

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Black people, fuck black people

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I say it, I say it

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I say it so much

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Yeah

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
But I never, I wouldn't say it to my black friends

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Because it's like

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
That's racist

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Well, it kinda is

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
It is, that's the problem is it puts up a wall

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
It's like there is things I'm saying

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
Now I am, it's actual technical discrimination

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
By the actual definition of word

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
You guys are not calling it in word

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Well, because, yeah, exactly

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
So it's either like I have to stop doing this thing

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
That's really fun

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Because it's like this fun, amazing, cultural, powerful thing

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
It's like there's a really great word

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
It's like super califragilistic

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Yeah, it's the best, when I heard it

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I was just like in word, yeah

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
So, I'm like when I'm making a sandwich

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I'm like, yeah, this inward needs a mustard

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Putting the inward on the bread

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
But I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna say

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
I would not subject any of my

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
African American friends

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
That's how I say it, because I'm so liberal

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
That's also racist

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I wouldn't subject them to that social pressure

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
Because then if I would say something like that

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Then they have to go, they're like

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
Okay, now I'm a representative of something

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
So things that it's not fair to

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
No, you're overthinking it

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I have to overthink it

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Of course, you'd have to

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
It's my job as a white man

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Yeah, white guilt, it goes back to that

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Yeah, I will end racism

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
I began it, I'll take care of it

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Don't worry, it'll be fine

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Clean up in aisle three

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
It's as simple as that

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
Well, how do we do, so are we both

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I kind of like the idea of like we find somebody else

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
In San Francisco that can bust a good beat

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
Beat boxers, and then you and I just trade off

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Oh yeah, we're good

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
We're like a team

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Dustin's also got beats down there

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Oh, you have beats?

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Oh, okay, fuck it

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Uh-oh

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Spencer, how you doing, man?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
I'd say play that shit down

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
I'm fucked up, man

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
Yeah, I feel you, I feel you

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
You guys see any of that Bay Area weed yet?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
No

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Wait, what?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
No

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Oh, man, what do we after?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Uh-oh

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
Yo, then fuck your mama, then fuck your mama

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Then fuck your mama, real good

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
Then fuck your mama, then fuck your mama

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
Then fuck your mama, real good, uh, damn

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Fuck your mama, real good

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
Damn, fuck your mama, real good

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Put them down

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
Yo, yo, yo, San Francisco

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Took a cable car to your mama's house

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
I put my dick in her vagina

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
And it hid like a mouse to put inside the hole

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
And it wouldn't come out

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
And then after a while

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I put it back in her mouth

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Uh, no new taxes

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
No new taxes, no new, no new taxes

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
No new, no new taxes, no new

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Bay Area, coming on strong

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
I fucked your mama like I was short and long

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
I did it in the summer and fall

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
I fucked your mama, but it didn't matter at all

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
San Francisco, San Francisco

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
San Francisco

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Alcatraz

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
What?

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Oh, shit

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
We fucked your money, gentlemen

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Vincent Price, Vincent Price

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
Deep in the powls of your mother's vagina

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
Come stand, Harmon

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
We fucked your mama on a Monday

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
We fucked your mama on a Tuesday

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
On a Wednesday

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
Every day of the week she's gettin' it deep

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Alright, okay

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Alright, we were re-wrapped

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Shame

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
Shout out to Pat

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Shamewrapped

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
That was awesome

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
That music was so intense

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Yeah, what was that? Where did that come from?

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
That was really...

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
How do we...

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
That was the fight club song

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
We should've just beat each other's asses

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
It's been a long time since you've rapped

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah, that's why I wanted to make them do it

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
I was like gettin' on a bike

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
It felt misogynistic now, though

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
It feels like the world's changing underneath her feet

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I started by fuckin' mamas

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Now I have this filter in my head

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
You put your dick in her mouth

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Give her some agency

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
But mothers like to be fucked, though

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It doesn't pass the...

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
What's the Bechtel test?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I don't think any male...

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
I wanna rap now about how your mama chose to fuck me

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
That still doesn't pass the Bechtel test

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
No, it's true

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Mama was at the store

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
She had a nice flower with her friend

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Bring the beat back

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
That's it, that's Bechtel

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Bechtel

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
A flower with her friend

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
A flower with her friend

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Yo, yo, your mama went out

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
And had a nice day

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Got together with some friends

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
In a feminine way

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
They weren't defined by their gender at all

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
They went and tried some things at the ball

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
But not in an elegant Cinderella way

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
It was more like just a ball for people

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
It wasn't like people were twirling and...

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Yo, yo, yo

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Yo mama fuck this

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Yo mama, yo mama

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Yo mama fuck this

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Well, she did later, but...

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
But this is the story about how before that

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
She was an activated woman

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Your mama woke up at 10 and said

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I need some food

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
She ate some crackers and wasn't in a good mood

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
She got in her Prius and drove to the mall

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
She said, I'm not defined by my gender at all

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
Your mama had a good time with her friends

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
She drove from the south to the other

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
And she did some job interviews

46:18.000 --> 46:26.000
And every boss she met refused to see her as a person

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
So she refused to work there

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
And she started her own business

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Entrepreneurship

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
On Google Mountain

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
I like that my idea of feminism

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
Is straight out of the movie 9 to 5

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
I can't... you can't really...

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
You can convince me to be a good person

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
But I will still... I'm just Dabney Coleman

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
And then she had her own little job

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Entrepreneurship is the way to go

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Well, we got no choice left

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
We're not putting any money into education

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
And we're not treating the people that get the pay for the education

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
They're entitled to anything

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
We're not providing daycare

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
We're not providing medical care

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
So we better reward entrepreneurship

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
Or rather I should say everybody should go be an entrepreneur

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Who's that guy that was offering

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
He'll give you $10,000 if you drop out of college

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Because he was like a...

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
That was an episode of Silicon Valley

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
It sounds like something maybe Rupert Murdoch would do

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
I'll give you $10,000 if you drop out of college

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I need to find him

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
It was like some guy who early adopted eBay stock

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Or something like that

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
Alright

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
All I hear is electric eel

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
You guys see that documentary about the student debt

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
And stuff like that

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
It's a very interesting documentary

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
I can't remember what it's called

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Aaron was watching it

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
It's fucked up, man

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Ivory Tower?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
That I heard

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
It's because one person was...

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Because they're real words

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
That guy's name is like

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Shimmer me, me, me, Erl

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Say Harry Potter

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I'll understand it, motherfucker

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Shit

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Alright

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
So shame

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
I always lose track of time on these foreign gigs

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Foreign

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
We're jet lagged

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
We don't know how long we've been here

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
We're not jet lagged

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Foreign

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
How long we've been here?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
We're jet lagged

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
40 minutes

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
40 minutes

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
To a foreign land

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
You flew over Google mountain

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
And landed in the land of clam chowder bread bowls

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Alright, so shame

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Here's the thing

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Here's the elephant in the room though

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
You've got three jobs

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Two full time, two part

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
I hope the answer isn't

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
You just wanted to be on stage

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I said who's on top of the...

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Who's on top of the world right now

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Who's really...

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
You really are happy even though you're...

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
It's a little bit of both

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Me just wanting to be on stage

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Like I told you

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
I told my friends I'm going to get on stage

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
Because I'm black

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
But I wanted to be on stage

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Because I'm very happy right now

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Just for the simple fact

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I just saw your documentary

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
And I gave you a handshake

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
While I'm waiting for the bathroom

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Oh, I remember you

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
And now I'm on the stage

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
Drinking vodka with you

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
This is a dream come true right now

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
That just puts all this pressure on me

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
I thought, okay

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Alright, well I'm glad you could be...

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Oh yeah, I want to put all the pressure on you, Dan

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Well, I want to...

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
Okay, but will you stay here for a second?

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
I'll definitely stay

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
I'm not going anywhere

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Actually, I'm going home with you

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
You just adopted me

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Aaron, you're my mom now

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
We did it

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I want to try an experiment

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Who is...

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Who is miserable?

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
That hand went up the fact

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
That hand shot up in the...

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Yeah, you pointed it yourself

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Yeah

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Yeah, you come up

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Okay, we have a miserable person coming up

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Nice

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
I want to see...

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Maybe we can create some kind of human emotion battery

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
If we put a wire between his mouth and yours

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
And then we can run a city on it or something

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Yeah, can you...

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Human skin type hat, kind of thing

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
However you think you can do it

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Just don't sue us if it goes wrong

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
It's going on, man

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Oh, yeah

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Your turn now

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Okay, you take that

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
What's your name, young man?

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
My name is Austin

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Austin?

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
Okay

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Destination of the next Harmontown

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Wow

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Shaman Austin, okay

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
That's my life

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
True detective, season two, right here

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Oh, wow

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I'm Matthew McConaughey

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
That's fine

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
All right, cool

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Do you want to be like...

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Like 2006 Matthew McConaughey?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I'm like a failure to launch

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Matthew McConaughey, was it your name movie?

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Yeah

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
Yeah, I'm that guy

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Isn't it Vince Vaughn and Colin Farrell this season?

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
I heard that

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Yes, it is

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
I hope that

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
It's a fucking goddammit

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Well, you don't...

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Yeah, that's how I feel about it

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Yeah, but if you heard McConaughey and Woody Harrelson

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
What would you have been like?

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
No, because that's it

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I mean, when I hear Vince Vaughn

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
I have that same response to the McConaughey

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Because it's like Vince Vaughn is...

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Yeah, I'll watch that whatever happens

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
That sounds interesting

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
But Colin Farrell

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
I don't know

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Yeah, you know what, you're right

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
You're right

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
I'm trying to spit and polish it

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Yeah

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Like Vince Vaughn is that guy for you?

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Really?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
No, not because he's amazing

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
But because that's so fucking weird

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
It's like whatever happens is gonna be interesting

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
I didn't expect McConaughey to be all like

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
I'm in a Lincoln, by a Lincoln

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Or whatever

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
But it was interesting to watch happen

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Vince Vaughn, I think, he's just like

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
I don't know, man, he just always looks so tired

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
So I just feel bad for him

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
You know, he puts in the hours

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Well, obviously

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
Yeah, he needs a nap

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
I don't know, man

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
In this case, I feel like you would have to be Vince Vaughn

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Because you don't ever sleep

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Yeah, I do need a nap

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Which is cool

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
I'm definitely Vince Vaughn

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
So we're season two, I'm Vince Vaughn

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
Colin Farrell, you have to be Colin Farrell?

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
We don't have to figure this out tonight

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
The show opens in two hours

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
The logistics are really tough

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
But like, you know, we'll bring it

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Austin, why are you miserable?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
There's a lot of reasons

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Top three

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Top three

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I was in a relationship for like six years

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
That just ended maybe a month ago

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Liar!

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Me and Dan on the same page

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
I knew it, I knew it was coming

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Truth or, truth or on that

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
It ended, and that sucks

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Straight relationship?

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Yeah, yeah

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
The best kind

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Jesus

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Wow

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
That just sunk in

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I actually heard that it's just being

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Like kind of absurdly obtuse

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Like I was just random

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
And then I just realized, oh my god, that's horrible

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Yeah, I mean

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Well, you asked like that was important

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Or somehow the answer that

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I wanted to picture it and for

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Reverse homophobic reasons

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Like I'm reverse racist and reverse homophobic

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Is equally probably bad

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
You just love gay people so much you want everyone to be gay?

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I thought in my head

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
As I asked that, I was like, why did you ask that

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
And I realized the answer is

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
If you were gay, it's more tragic

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
It's more tragic when gay men break up

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Than when a man just breaks up with a woman

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Sorry

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Way more emotional

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I don't know that that's true

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
It's hard for them to find each other

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Facts, facts

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
And if they can find each other

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
And be in a relationship, it's a beautiful thing

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
It's more beautiful than two straight people

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
And if they break up, it's more tragic

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Thank you, San Francisco

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I may have to buy property here soon

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I just want to try to see if I can lower the house price

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
You have to because I live here

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
And now you're my father so

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
You have to have a house for me

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Alright, so yeah, I just

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I don't know, I just wanted a mental image

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I don't know, I wanted to know

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
So a young lady

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
You broke it off six months ago

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
So that's enough right there

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
No, it was a six year relationship

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
That ended about a month ago

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I don't listen

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
It's cool, it's fine, I don't expect you to

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I'm not that important

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
I'm going to try though

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
There's that, you're fresh

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I feel a little bad about number two

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Because I feel like it should take more precedence

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Because it's been around longer

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
But I don't really have a relationship

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
With a family who I live with

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I have a huge family too

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I have like seven brothers

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
And I'm a right in the middle

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
And I just don't have that relationship

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
That people have with their family

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
And you live with all of them currently?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Not all of them currently

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
One lives in San Diego

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
The San Francisco of California

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
And one of them lives

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
In Tacoma, Washington

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
The San Diego of Washington

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And he just got back from Afghanistan

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
The Army

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
I got it

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I got it

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
The Portland of the Middle East

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Where young people go to

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
retire in the Middle East

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I would assume, I don't know

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
And then

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
My other brothers are

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
One of them lives on like a fucking ranch

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Or something, not far

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
And then the rest of them are younger than me

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
So they do in fact live with me

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
But is the general thing, do you feel a little bit

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Like you just like there's something

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
There's like a circuit broken in you

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Or you're like, wait, why am I not like one of these people on TV

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Where I'm kind of like automatically enchanted by my family

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Yeah, totally, I actually said that the other day

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
When

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
When me and my girlfriend were breaking up

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I said, why isn't everything like a TV show

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I don't, I don't get it

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I don't have that frame of reference

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
That everyone has where it's like, well you know it'll be cool

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I'm always just like, why don't I feel

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Like I have that with anyone

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I'm fully qualified to diagnose you

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
But I have one more question

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Do you have a snow globe

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
With the cast of an entire hospital drama

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Inside of it

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Wow, that is an old

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Ass reference dude

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
That is an old

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Ass reference

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
I got my middle aged San Franciscans

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Are in the house

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Say it elsewhere

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Also I think there's like

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Then there's 30% trickle of people who just know that as a reference

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Yeah, I feel like that's

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
That's me

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I've never seen

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Gone with the wind, but I know that

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
He doesn't give a damn

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
About my dear or something

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
I've never made it

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Through Wizard of Oz, but I know her shoes are red

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
And she had them the whole time or something

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
And the trees are monkeys

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Those are the hard

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Plot points of that mostly

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
The

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Okay, so, but yeah

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
That's how I feel

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
That scares me

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
My mom and dad are not coming to my wedding

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
And I feel like it's because

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
There's something wrong with me

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Because you just finished watching a movie

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Where of course there's a big plot point in the movie

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Where I'm like, oh my mom hit me

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
And my dad spanked me and I think they're kind of sick of it

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I don't think they want to come to a wedding

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Where Joel McHale's there

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
And just watched a movie about how they hit me

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I think they're like, I'm assuming

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
All these things because they're very polite

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I would say reptilian

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Did they say why

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
No, they didn't

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
We'd love to see pictures and we'll hook up soon

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
And I was like

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I just projected under that silence

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I'm like, you know what, they're just fucking sick of it

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
They have a 41-year-old child

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Who is in his 35th year

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Of

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Making money by talking about how they beat him

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
And they're like, I'm not going to that wedding

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
It's going to be uncomfortable

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Jack Wax is going to be like

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Looking over at us and whispering

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Yeah

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
So I don't blame them

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Which makes me feel bad because

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
I think about my extended family

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I do nothing but fumble balls there

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Just out of like

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I don't care

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I have that exact thing

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Where they try

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Well, I don't even know that they try to engage me genuinely

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
But I just, I don't care

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
I hold family to the same standard

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
To which I hold strangers

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
And they don't measure up

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
They don't, because they're like

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
You should come over for Christmas

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
So that we can fight

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
If a stranger offered that

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I'd be like, fuck you

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
If a TV show offered that

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I'd be like, no, I'm not going to tune in

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
To watch the Christmas episode and see you fight

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Well, that is what we do

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
But I just kind of like

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I think it's

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
I don't know what it is

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
It makes me feel bad

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
It makes me feel like I'm a shitty person

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
If the chickens are going to come home to roost

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
You're going to be 70 in the Stanley Kubrick

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Third Act bed

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
With the tubes in your nose

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
And you're going to be like

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Where, everyone, where is everyone

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
And they're going to be like

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
We're gone, because you didn't care

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
You articulate that really well

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
You should tell them McKenna's solution

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
To your parents not coming to your

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Oh, yeah, he wants me to hire actors to play my parents

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Which I think is really interesting

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Like have Tom scare

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
That's doable in Los Angeles

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
It is totally like you could get

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
You could go to Central Casting and just have people

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
That just look like your dad

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
But also, I have a crack, I could maybe get

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
You know, who knows, I could see if

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Like Tom Scarrett or Brian Cranston would like

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
You know, like maybe get

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
An A-list guy to be my dad

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Morgan Freeman

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Get Gilbert Godfrey to fly out

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
And be your dad

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I'm so proud of

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Of my dad and my son

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Yesterday

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I'm supposed to say something

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Now Harmon's in session

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Danny, treat it

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
That's a good, you do a good Gilbert

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
He's a hero of mine

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
I haven't talked about this yet

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I don't know if it's appropriate to talk about it

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Because I don't know the guy, and I don't know

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Like when I was backstage, I met him

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
And I was like, hey, I'm such an honor to have you here

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So great that you were here, and he's like, okay

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
And I go like, actually

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
You're not so much a guest as you are

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
He introduced me, okay

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And he just kept saying, okay

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And it was like, oh god, I really fucked up

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Like he doesn't know me, and he does it

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
This is too much to ask of somebody, and he's bummed out

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And he's lethargic, and he doesn't care

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And he just kept going, okay

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And then

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
He kind of like, I didn't feel like I had the right

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
To tell him to go out

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
So you can hear in the recording, people are spontaneously erupting

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Into chicken noodle songs

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Because I'm backstage, like standing next to him

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And kind of waiting for him to go out

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
But afraid to ask him to go out

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
So then eventually I go, okay, so let's go do it

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And then he comes out, and he just

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
He starts like pumping

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
He just like, comes out, completely changes his posture

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Turns into this completely different person

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And the audience is like screaming for him

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And he's like milking the crowd

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And then he sits down and goes like, I'm your Gilbert Gottfried

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And does this whole thing, does it for two hours

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
It's a great show, we get off stage

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And I'm like, oh my god, that was so great, thank you

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And he's like, okay

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And then he disappeared into the night

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Like Starman

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
He just turned into cosmic dust

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And went up and

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
That's where Saturn's rings come from

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
He's a lights up performer

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
That's what they call it

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
What I really wanted to ask him is

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Is that like, because we're friends with Bobcat

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
So we know that Bobcat thinks of that voice

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
That he would do

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Like, you know, that guy, that's a character

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And I

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I don't know Gilbert Gottfried

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Well enough to ask him, I wanted to ask him

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Is that, do you call that a character

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Or is that how you speak

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
When you're projecting your voice

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Because I think there's a subtle

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
But important difference, like I really wanted to know

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
But I didn't have the balls to ask him

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And I thought I'd share

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Just what's going on in my life

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
In the lowest stakes

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Which always, wow, you gotta hear

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
The San Francisco show, Dan talks about

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
The previous show

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
He really gets to the bottom of

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Nothing

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Just asks questions

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And puts things, he remembers

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
He needs butter

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
It was a great use of San Francisco's time

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
We watched a two hour movie

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
About him

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
And then we watched him think about things

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
So how do we

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Alright, what do we do here

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
We got Misery

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And we got shame

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Totally illogical happiness

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
On James' part

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Illogical happiness

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Anybody that's shoveling bread

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
He said he was high

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Is that how they make bread?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
We shovel it out of dirt

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Come to Panera bread, guys

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
We shovel it out of dirt

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I base everything on Minecraft

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
That's how you make bread in Minecraft

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
You have to

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I mean

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
You got lots to complain about

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Shame

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I have a hell of a lot to complain about

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But you got a girlfriend

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I had a girlfriend

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That's what it is

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
It's the women in our lives

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It's the women

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
When you don't feel like you have somebody to share your life with

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Right, Spencer?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I woke up at 4 in the morning

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Because I had a nightmare

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
About a giant dog sized spider

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And then I went back to sleep

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And had a nightmare where my ex came back

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And then disappeared like a ghost

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And then I couldn't get back to sleep

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Which one was scarier?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
The spider was scarier

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
In terms of shitty

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I think I could have handled the spider a bit better

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Jesus Christ

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
The trick is to quickly

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Snap off one or two limbs

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
From there it's just easy

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Pickens

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And it comes to monstrous spiders

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Spencer, how would you fight a unicorn?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Oh, you don't fight a unicorn

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
You just don't enter their sacred forest

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
In the first place

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
That's kind of a cop-out answer

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
What if you found yourself in it?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
What if you were drugged and woke up in their sacred forest?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
That's not a unicorn

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
That would be some sort of doppelganger trick

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
What about a Kebler elf?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
You know what Kebler elves are?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Yeah, they make cookies

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
How would you fight three of those?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
The same way you'd fight any three infants, I guess

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Infants

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I'd be so offended

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
If I was an elf

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
A Kebler elf

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
If you're a Kebler elf, we're very sorry

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I can't believe those fucking cable cars

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Are tied to ropes

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Are you people insane?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
What a kind of Rube Goldberg

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Is the whole thing powered?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
In the morning, does a chicken

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Get startled by a balloon popping?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And make all of your mass transit go?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
That's...

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
You're taking the green thing too seriously

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Can we...

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I don't know how close she is to being able to be down here

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Are you in the back, Erin?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
She's in the back

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Okay, can you come down here?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Erin McGathy

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
My betrothed

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Future Mrs. Harmon

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
My other half, Erin McGathy

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Yeah

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Yeah

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Yeah

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I'll stand over here at the Q&A mic

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And I'll give this mic to Erin

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Here, take this

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
We got double mics

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Thank you

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So, yeah, Erin, you're my mom now

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Tough breaks

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Don't say that too many times

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
You're my mom

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
You're my mom

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
It's like Beetlejuice

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Yeah

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Shame I'm worried you're working a little too much

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Yeah, probably, yeah

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I want to move to Australia, that's why I'm doing it

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Shame, you can't leave us

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I know, but I didn't know you were going to be my mom

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Do you know someone in Australia?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I do not know anyone in Australia

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I know Australians are in Australia

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
You just want to go to Australia?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Yeah, I want to live there and not be in America

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Smart guy, right?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
It's just full of murderous creatures and plants

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
That was America

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I mean, not creatures and plants, no

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
There are herds of Spencer's ex-girlfriend

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
There's grass in...

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
No, there's grass in Australia that'll give you chlamydia

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Oh wow, that's cool

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
You just sit, having a nice picnic

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Bam, the clap

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Wait, is chlamydia the clap?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I don't know

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Is that what your girlfriend told you?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Yeah

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
It's the grass, Spencer

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Spencer, remember that picnic?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Remember that picnic we had?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Yeah

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Spencer, remember that picnic in Australia

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
That's how it happened

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I got sand crabs

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
They're big

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Just sand crabs

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Aaron is my long-suffering fiancée

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
As described in various movie reviews

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
That's a virtue, it's a good thing to describe someone else

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
It means patient

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That's how I'd describe her

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Long suffering

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Yeah, no, it's very flattering

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
It's a funny reading

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
It's a biblical word

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Long suffering

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
So if I was to go to a Starbucks

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
and order a coffee and they're like, how are you?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Long suffering

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Is that what biblical words are?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Yeah

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I am

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
A Bible

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I am a Bible

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
So Aaron, do you have any suggestions on how to...

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I brought shame up

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
He said he was happy

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Happy enough

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
for right now, at this very moment

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I'm happy

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
He has three jobs and he's really only happy because

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
we're here with him and he's up here

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Then I brought Austin up

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
He's unhappy because his woman

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
done run off

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Well, you mentioned creating a human battery

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
earlier

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And in order to create a battery, you need energy

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
going back and forth, I would be curious to see

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
like a 30 second

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
rapid-fire word association

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
between

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
shame and Austin

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Locked eyes

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
at each other, no judgment

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
No holding back

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Nice

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Alright, you want to do this, Austin?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I'm down, I'm totally down

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Are you guys going to say the words

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
or do we say the words? Oh no, you say the words

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
You say the words, Austin, come on

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Locked eyes

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Yeah, let's put our pocket down

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
It's important to say, if we're really committing to

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
this exercise, that nobody

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
in this room is allowed to judge anybody for

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
saying anything

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Because they have to know that they're safe in order to

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
actually do this properly, otherwise it's just a shtick

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
They're not here, Austin, it's just us

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Just us

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Just us

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
And Steve A.G. because he's right behind you

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
So to that, for that

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
to keep that from happening

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
or to make that happen, let's all be

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
totally silent during the word association

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and then we'll talk about it

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
So you guys would pretend that you were alone

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
in a cave

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
How do we know when it ends? Who's stopping it?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Does someone have a timer?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Alright, Spencer will stop it

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And Stan's going to throw out the first word

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Oh, okay

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And we'll start with shame

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Tomato

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Tomato

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Ketchup

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Vodka

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Pure

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Oh, shit, white

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Black

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Gray

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Interracial

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Fine

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Harmontown

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Podcast

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Erin McGathy

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Erin Carter

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
How I Beat Check

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Ah, fucking Kobe Bryant

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And time

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
How do we do?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
You did well, shame

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I feel like

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
it was a pitch and catch situation

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
instead of a mutual throwing and catching

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
So let's do it one more time

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
and his word inspires your word

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Nice, let's do that

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Who won the first round?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Who won?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
The audience is the winner

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I think Erin Carter won the first round

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Erin Carter did

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
because he hasn't been relevant in years

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
He needs this, he's welcome

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I love Erin Carter

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I knew too, he had an awesome album

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
He beat Shaq

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
He did beat Shaq, that's why I said it

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And that's how I beat Shaq

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Stop talking about sports

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Sports corner is over

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
My only rule

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Let's do, so we'll do

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
15 seconds

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Don't hold back, don't judge yourself

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Just say the first word that comes to mind

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
from the other person

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Alright, and this time

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
we will start with Austin

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And Dan, the word is

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
And no sentences, and if you say um

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
you're a bad person

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
No, you're not out, you're just a bad person

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I'm a bad person already

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Go ahead and say um and just note that you're a bad person

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
and then Val next time you will not say um

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Okay

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Dan, what's their word?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
First word is

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
dog

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Wolf

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Fox

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Mew

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Go

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Yeah

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Cool

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Red version

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Yellow version

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And time

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Did you guys feel that power

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
that that battery created?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
We made a soul battery

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
What are we learning for this?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
It's definitely a new regular segment

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I really like it

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
It's part electric company

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
part uh

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I really like it, I just don't know

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I think we're starting a religion, right?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
We're going to really carefully tiptoe down that road

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Because you guys saw the master, right?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Isn't that kind of what they're doing a little bit?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
We're going to start, next week I'm going to have them

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
hold tin cans

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Will they do this?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Yeah, I don't know, I guess we know

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
they both like Pokemon

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Pokemon is pretty dope

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
For real

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I like that you guys didn't say um

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Okay, now, okay, now we're going to do

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
a scene

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Shame, you are a

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
shopkeeper

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
You have a story that only

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
sells pickles

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
That's perfect, I fucking love pickles

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Oh, we went in then

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
But Austin, you are

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
a

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
you are a

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
a shopkeeper

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
who in a store that only sells

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
uh

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
asparagus

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
and you

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
you're coming in pretending to be a customer

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
because you want to buy

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
his shop

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Like the property

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Like the property of his shop, yeah

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
To expand or just to move him

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
You want a better location

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
You want a better location because you blame

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
you don't believe that people like pickles

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
more than asparagus

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
and if this is failing

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
you want his place, so you're exploring him

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
for weaknesses, but you're pretending to just

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
shop for pickles

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And Austin, this morning you received a mysterious

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
telegram in the mail

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
When is this taking place?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
1942

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
August

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
August 15th

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
If it was 1942, I wouldn't have a shop

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And you

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
That is

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
part of it

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Let that inform your choices

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
But Austin, you received a telegram

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
this morning from a family member

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and that telegram read

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Uh, help me

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Nazi war machine encroaching

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Stop

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
And uh, shame has pyrokinesis

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
That

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
mean I can say things

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
with your brain

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Okay, alright, and I'll do sound effects

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Nice

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Now these things can just inform

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
all of your choices or you can make it

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
about it, but this is your life

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Also allergic to penicillin

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Both of you

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
That's really shitty

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Yeah, but you live in a world

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
where allergy to penicillin is a crime

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Oh wow

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
You can be arrested for it

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
So we're just itching all the time about stuff

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And shame you don't know it yet, but you're David Allen Greer's

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
great uncle

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
What

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Let it just inform

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
something I've ever heard

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I'm David Allen Greer's great

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
uncle

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
He made a blank man

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
But you don't know that

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I don't know he made a blank man, that's an awesome movie

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
You barely know television

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Yeah, 1942

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
No blank man

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
By proxy

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Alright, here we go

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
San Francisco, we present to you the magic of theater

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Uh, nah

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I've been setting all these pickles on fire with my mind

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And it's awesome

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
What am I going to do today besides

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
set stuff on fire with my mind

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
You should've known a shop

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Who said that

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Bullshit

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Who said that

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Are you in my shop now?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Ding ding ding

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Oh hey

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Take a number

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Take a number

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Ding ding ding

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I'm looking at 60

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
What number are you on?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I'm on number two

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
You have to wait

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
There's nobody here, but you still have to wait

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Uh

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I just wanted some pickles, man

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
What do you sell? Pickles

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
How much do you rent this place for?

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
How much do I rent this place?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I own this spot

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
This is my place in 1942

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
That's depressing

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
It's not depressing

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
It's surprising

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Oh, it's both

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
A little for me, I guess

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
What kind of pickles do you want?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
The pickled kind

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
The kind that you would soak in a brine

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I don't do that

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I only set pickles on fire with my mind

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
The kind that used to be cucumbers

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
So like, cooked ones is what you have?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
So when I set the cucumbers on fire

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
One hour later

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Alright

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
What kind of pickles do you want?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You're allergic to penicillin also?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Yeah, I have this rash that won't go away

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I'm scratching myself

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
This small business owner is allergic to penicillin

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I heard it from his mouth

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Oh, well then

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
We ought to take you off the line

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Oh

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I don't want to mess anything up

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
No, it's your duty to report such things

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
See, that's what I thought

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Yeah

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
We have a couple of trouble makers

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Officer O'Malley

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Oh, hey Stacey, how are you?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Just doing my beat

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And I heard some fracas

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Turns out we got a penicillin allergy over here

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Officer O'Malley, it sounds like

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Your wife's got your balls in a vice

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Your voice is very falsetto

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I'm doing what most of the people do

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Back at the precinct, which is make fun of my

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Higher register voice

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I like to think that I overcompensate

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
For it with good police work

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
But it's good to see you jumping out a pretty easy

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Bandwagon

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Yeah, remember what they told us

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
In Ireland

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
If it's easy to say what you're saying

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
It ain't brave

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Alright, well I'm not a creative, I'm a cop

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I'm gonna go ahead and move along

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And you deal with these two young men

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
That was weird

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Back to the pickles

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
What kind of pickles do you want?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
You seem awfully obtuse about this

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Can you just get some regular mustard pickles

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I heard about you, you want my shop, don't you?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I don't

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Yes you do, don't lie to me

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Don't lie to me, I got the pickles

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I just think that asparagus

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Much like

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
The white, blonde, blue-eyed race

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Which I hope to one day be a part of

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Is

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Is

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Just so superior

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I am white with blue eyes, what are you trying to say?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I'm color blind, I don't see race

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Well I'm white with blue eyes

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I believe you

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
But

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I'm very trusting

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Which some people think is a character flaw

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I feel like you shouldn't take advantage of me

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I want to bring asparagus

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
To the people in the most

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Healthy

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And excrementally stinky way

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Because I think it's important

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
What do you think smells better, pickles or asparagus?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
In or out?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
In

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Well, pickles for sure

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Pickles coming out, probably

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
What a day

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
What a day, fortunately

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
God was watching

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And God took note

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Of the rest of what happened that day

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And now we'll hear from him

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
And he will tell us

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
What happened

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
God?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
It's funny you should mention that

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Because almost immediately

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
You know

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
The white, blue-haired, blue-eyed guy

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Is

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Tyrokinesis went crazy

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And exploded the world

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
That's really a shame

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
What a story

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
That's all these sounds about right

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Alright, let's have a hand

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Shame and Austin

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Alright

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I think we've rung them dry

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
They should take a seat

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
And reap the benefits of their

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Let's give them a hand everybody

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Shame and Austin

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Harmontown

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Harmontown

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
We really

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Sir, do you have a question?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
When you were doing the movie

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Was there anything you wanted to cut out?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
We really

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Wrote those guys hard

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
They

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
They earned it

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Giving Dan Harmon a hug guys

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I feel like this guy doesn't work hard enough

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
At the bakery

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
At the Panini shop

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
He's getting high fives all the way up the aisle

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
His grandma fucking

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Riding him in that vegetable garden

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Pick more

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Basil

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Shame

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Nailed it

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Hahaha

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Uncaring

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
That's what gardening is

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
In a day of a gardener

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
What would you do?

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Shame's going

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
His grandma's like I'm so happy you came

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Is the dirt tilled?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Shame, you're the person in charge of the garden

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I'm going to till the dirt

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And then I'm going to poke holes in it

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Drop seeds in the holes, cover over the holes with dirt

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Wait for the seeds to grow into germinated things

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Put water on them

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
The plants are already grown

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
If it's a vegetable gardener, you're just coming in for maintenance

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
That's all he does is water the grass

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
That's what he said

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Is it clapgrass or regular grass?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Australian

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Chlamydia grass

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
If that's real, I would immediately get chlamydia

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Because clapgrass just

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
sounds fun

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
You know

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Come to this park, there's a bunch of clapgrass

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Alright

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Hey Spencer, are you

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Alright

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
What?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Are you

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Are you equipped to do G&D tonight?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I'm always equipped

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
For whatever

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
So we got

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
A Dignity Starzgard

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
We got me

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Agile Play

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Quark, I assume

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And we would need a

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Chris de Burgh

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
We have to

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
It'll have to be based on more than

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Just plain desire

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I want to figure out how to

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
What to base it on

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
How about this guy whose question

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Oh, that guy's in a weekly Pathfinder game

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Oh, you're like an expert role player?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
He didn't say that

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Nobody wants to say that

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And then come up and play

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Doesn't that just make you an associate path?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I can be anyone

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
But you can help us get back on track

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Alright, you come on up, sir

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Your zeal alone

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Should propel you to the stars

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
See ya

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
What is your name, sir?

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Matt A.J.H

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Yeah, I've seen this guy before

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Matt's in a weekly Pathfinder game of his own

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Alright

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Is there anything we didn't cover?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
We covered Ebola

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Mass transit

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
That cable car thing

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Is amazing

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I was here for my Bachelorette party

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
A couple weeks ago

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I fucked the bridge

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Amazing

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Yeah

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
We covered it all

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Ebola and dick piercing

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And mass transit

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And feminism

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I hesitate to ask

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
But do you want to hit Gamergate real quick?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I do not want to hit Gamergate

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
If I'm obligated to ask

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I've been trying to read up on that

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And I continue to read up on it

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I find it very fascinating

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
And I don't dismiss it at all

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And I did not dismiss it

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And I don't dismiss not dismissing it

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I think it's amazing

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
That this new generation

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Is able to create

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Kind of whirlpools

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And I'm not even dismissing it

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
By saying that

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
You're 41 and you go

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
That is

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
You can't get through that

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
You can't just be a casual person

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Coming through an issue

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And get from one side of it to the other

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
And grab a drink from the bar

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And come back through it

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
You will be on one side or the other

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Whatever those sides are

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
In this issue

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
We've done it at outrage

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
We've gotten really good at

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
At shaming each other

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
And you can't

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
You can't say much of anything

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Without

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
There's always going to be the possibility

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Of just like

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
A huge group of people

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Like really on your shit

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
You already lost someone

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
No, she's

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
She hates Gamergate

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
She works in Shamesguard

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Or Shames

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Shift in the morning

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Don't let the last sounds of her leaving

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Be that we've branded her a Gamergator

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
She hates it

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Yeah, I had to

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
As a 41 year old I had to get out my little

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Bifocals and read Gamergator articles

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Just at three times

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And try to figure out like what's the gate

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And where's the gate thing

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
You can't even say that because then someone will go

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Like you said there's no gate

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Fuck you

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I don't care

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
You said you don't care

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Yeah

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
You couldn't even say something like

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
For instance like

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I'm not going to say it

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Here we go

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I was about to say something

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And I know you can't actually say it

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I'm going to wait for it to blow over

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
How's that?

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Does that make you a bad person?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
That's fine

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Let's see if Gamergate's worth it's salt

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Let's see if it can last another three months

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And then I'll weigh in

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Yeah, it can

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
It's just a 15 year old

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
What's happening you guys?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Everyone's just

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
It's just 15 year olds

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
It's 4chan baby

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
It's all kids

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
You just got your credit cards hacked

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I've been dying to see

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I've been dying to see these character sheets

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And to see what's on there for a long time

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Just lies

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
It's all lies

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Just peanut butter and spit

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
That's just yours Erin

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Not a joke

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Yeah

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
There are a few

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Unfortunate very drunk shows that we've had

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Where

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Just like that

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Collected some stuff

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Gamergator hacked your microphone

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
So

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
There's a rope in the street

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And it pulls the car

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
It pulls the car up a hill

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Like a wagon

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
And then it's a cable

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Okay, it's not a rope, that's dismissive

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I'm sorry

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
There's hooks on the

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Right

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And the cable is

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Sort of like a ski lift

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
In principle

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And so it's kind of like

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Do you

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Reverse it at the

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
At a certain time

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
At the bottom of the hill

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Like an escalator

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Dan, have you ever ridden one?

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
No, I've never been in one

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
How late do they run?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Forever

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
It's like an Andy Kaufman show

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
We'll talk about cookies and milk

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Not a trolley

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
It's not like an oscillating thing

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
It goes up and then it goes back down

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Oh, it goes around

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Okay, cool, got it

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Wow, I have so much to learn about cable cars

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
There's a museum

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
And guess what

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
It's boring

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
No, cable gate

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
It's not boring

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
It's only boring to women

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
My period gets in the way of having fun

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
But

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Oh boy, all these hormones

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
What, cables?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Give me chocolate, bring me to a chocolate museum

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
On a Monday

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Maybe

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Maybe that museum's for me

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Maybe I'm like the one guy that museum's been

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Waiting for

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I have a lot of questions about cable cars

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I kind of love it

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I want a cable car

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
No one said anything

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Just let him monologue forever

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
All right, I'll get a Tesla

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
All right, some D&D

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
You need a theme song?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I don't know, it sounds like Dustin has music

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Dustin has music

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I'm going to give Dustin 60 seconds

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
So let's just fill

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Let's do some word associations

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Cable car

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Pulley trolley

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Hot dog

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Bun, man, cancer

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
But, pole

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Why am I doing two words?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Cave

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Mustard

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Mustard seed

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
How's Dustin doing?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
All right, well, we could go acapella

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I mean

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Sure, sure

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
When we last met

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Our heroes had finally escaped

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
From Rose Book

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
After defeating Admiral Dark

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
After defeating Father Tinder

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And dodging the city guards

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
The gang piled into Dignity's horse

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And they charged the police blockade

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Breaking out of the town

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Freed but without direction

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Our heroes came across a small hill

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
With a window

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Peering into the window

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Quark spied a showering lady

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
And framed her

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
But after a terrible excuse

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
The gang entered her home

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
They shared some awkward conversation

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Before leaving

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
But when they left

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
They encountered a crippled fire elemental

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And although they started in anger and rage

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
They came to an understanding

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
And left the fire elemental alone

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
But not before Quark burned his dick off

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
But where would the gang go?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
What would they do?

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
How would they get to the air city?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Did they even care about getting there?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Find out next

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
On an all new

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Harmontown

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
All right, so you guys

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
You guys are on the main road

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Heading out of Rose Book

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
The path this main road is winding its way

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Meandering through the rolling grassy

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Hills of the landscape

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Gently to the northeast

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
This is the path Sharpie decided

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
To go down after he

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
You guys said that you couldn't go farther

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Into the swamp and then you left the lady

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And you didn't want to go back to town

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
So you're just like, I'm going down this road

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
That's where you are

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I've been pushing the limit

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I've been testing the limits of like

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Can you actually just make Spencer

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Turn

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
You can't

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I know I can, but I'll regret it

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I don't know, I'll regret it

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
If I couldn't

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
You'd be, you know

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
It would be because you were a tyrant

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
You're not a tyrant

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
You're a benevolent, impersonal cosmic force

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
That's why I did this

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
You will allow me to walk west

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
In one direction forever

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I will encounter cacti and

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Swamps

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
To the west

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
But if I really want to enjoy myself

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I gotta go back to your narrative

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Well that's not even necessarily true

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
You just have to create your own narrative

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I will

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
So are we still close to the town

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Can we see the town from where we are?

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Yeah, it's pretty far off in the distance

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
But you can still see it

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
It's one of the only landmarks

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
In this kind of hilly area

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I'm curious, can we tell whether Darkstar

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Has gotten through the shield

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
And the town is being totally destroyed

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Darkstar was actually chasing you guys down

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
But then he saw something happening

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Over at the town and then he left

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
There was the skeletons climbing

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
The forest field and then they disappeared

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
In a flash

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
That upset Darkstar

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
You think it might have had something to do

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
With that necromancer frost giant

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
But he's miles away

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Boy, that dot, I'm not connecting

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
The necromancer frost giant

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Yeah, I know, the plot, it just happens

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Wait, but what

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
What I'm saying to you is

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I don't recall, obviously

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
It's not a big surprise that I'm always drunk

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
When we're playing, I don't recall any actual

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Over connections between

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
The necromancer frost giant and that stuff

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Yeah, that would be me a narrator

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Explaining things that you the characters

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Would have no knowledge of

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I didn't say anything about that

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
But you just did now

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
So I thought Darkstar was

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Still going into the city

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And just chasing you guys saw the thing

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Took off

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Gentlemen, I think that we should head

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
To the air city

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Seems like the right idea

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Cocoa is pointed in this direction

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
And like I always say, horses know best

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
We know the rest

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
You do always say that

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Those skeletons back at the city

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
They remind me of that frost giant

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Thank you for sharing

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Your feelings of association

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Let's go to the air city

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
They remind you of the frost giant

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
The shards of power, the frost giant

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Wanted the

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Admiral

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Starsguard

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
So we gave, so you got killed

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
By the frost giant necromancer

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And then we gave him the shard

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
We gave him the shards

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
We keep giving shards away

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
And Father Tender also had a shard

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
He did, but it might have vanished

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
In the scuffle

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Looking for shards is looking to accrue shards

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Got a feeling that Admiral Darkstar

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Getting all those shards ain't best for anybody

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I pull Sharpie aside

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Yes

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Sir, is something going on

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
With you beneath the surface

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
You seem to be questioning everything we're doing

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And I am not well versed

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
In the way of emotions or feelings

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
But it seems that this is

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Pertinent

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Sometimes I feel like someone's controlling me

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
That may or may not be an alcoholic

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
And so I have blackouts

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Where I am motivated

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
By different things

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Sometimes I

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Become conscious

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And I'm halfway down a road that I ran down

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Out of defiance of nothing

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Then I'm a little more sober

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I don't know

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I'm going to ask you the question

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I ask myself every morning in a puddle

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
What do you want out of this day?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I don't want the world

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
To be destroyed by Admiral Darkstar

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I say, hey, what are you guys talking about over there?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
What are our obligations?

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I mean, what are we doing

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
If we're not saving the world

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
If Admiral Darkstar is going to accrue power

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
And become a more powerful admiral

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
With darker stars

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
So it seems like a great idea

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Long term for us to take out Darkstar

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
We've been fighting him for two years now

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
And dignity

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
This is your town

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And it's being swarmed over by skeletons

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
You know me better than I know me

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
So should we not, while we're here

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Go kick the asses of the things

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
That are trying to destroy your town?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I think that is an excellent idea

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
That's a great idea

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Sharpie, let's do it!

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Let's fight!

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And I promise, no matter what happens from now on

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I'm really going to understand

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Why are you doing it?

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I lift Quark up from between his legs

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Which now is nothing

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And put him on my shoulder

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Like a wishbone

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Where my dick used to be really burns

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Be careful

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I just want to carry you, little one

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
So you ride back towards the town

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
And you can't help but notice

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
A conspicuous lack of skeletons

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
As if they'd all disappeared

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
You get closer to the town

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And you see

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Small piles of ash

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Not skeleton size

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
But just small piles of ash

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
That seems to be the only sign

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
That any creatures or anything

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Have been around the town

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Obviously it's still protected by this barrier

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Is it like in the Batman movie

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Where the people are dehydrated?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Nah, nah

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Are these piles of ash outside the town?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Yeah, you haven't entered the town

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Physically as of yet

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
But you're not skeleton size

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
The piles of ash

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
You're saying we don't think these piles of ash

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Are the skeletons disintegrated

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Do we hear screaming and mayhem

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And the sound of combat?

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
It's all peace, you don't see any skeletons

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Just this ash business

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And the dome protecting rose book

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
From all evil

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
We did it, guys

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
As we were leaving

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I saw the skeletons disappear

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I think it was like a

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And that angel

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
The Yoshi angel dark star figures

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Gone too

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
And are we able to enter the city?

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Yeah, if you want

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
But you did like escape

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
From police

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Let's get the fuck out of here

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
There's no one to fight

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Let's go

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
It's important to have these moments

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Quickly before we go

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Can I examine the piles

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Of ash and see if there's anything

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
To that?

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Yeah, you examine the piles of ash

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
And they seem not to be ash at all

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
But actually really finely crushed up

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Onyx dust that's a gemstone

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Associated with necromancy

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
As well as teleportation magic

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Interesting, I wonder who could have sent

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Legions of skeletons

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Well, the cross giant

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I already had a feeling that he was involved

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Gentlemen

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
These piles are deposits that are the

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Residual result of teleportation magic

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
On the part of a necromancing

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Frost giant

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Or just dumped, he's done using them

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
They're no longer valuable, maybe he got

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
He was able to get the shard

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I thought

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
That dark star was commanding the skeletons

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
It sounds like either dark star

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
And this guy are working together

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
The necromancer, they didn't seem to be aligned

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
In the past

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Why are you looking at me?

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
The face that people are looking at me

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Like I'm supposed to do something

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I don't think there's any way that the frost giant

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Is in league with dark star, these are too big

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
You can't have a solar system

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
With two suns, nothing I know what a solar system is

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
But

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
They're both giant ash holes

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
That'll stop at nothing

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
To get fucking dumb ass shards

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I've run across both of them

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I don't think they would work together

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I start gathering up the Onyx dust

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
And I put it in my backpack

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
You do that

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
You gather up several dusts

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Alright, we got to figure out what to do

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Okay, so the skeletons showed up

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
The skeletons have sailed the city

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
It's like, and I remember

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Dark star going like

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
And then getting mad and leaving

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
It's like the skeletons showed up

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
The skeletons represent the frost giant

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
They showed up, then they disappeared

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Then Admiral Darkstar disappeared

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
If we really wanted to get into the fray

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I reckon that means

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
It's back at the

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Ice frost giant's city

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
I don't know why we'd want to go there

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
But

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Except to save the world, eventually

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
But it would have to be in a really unlikely way

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Because we're not an army of skeletons

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Or a giant or a

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Horrible, powerful wizards

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
We're just a ragtag group

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Of occasional rapists

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And murderers

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
You know what lies within us?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
The souls of rapists and murderers

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Skeletons

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
We are a small army of

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Skeletons

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
What?

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
But we have more than bones

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
We have heart

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
We have lungs

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
It's literally a sense of adventure

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
We've also leveled up a lot

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Since the last time we fought that guy

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I have, but I always lose track of my spells

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Yeah, you're outside the city

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I charge a gallop with

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Coco into

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
The city to just see

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
What the climate is

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
There's

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
People, you know, just busy

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
People living their lives

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
There's occasional guards standing

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Around there noticing your

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Horse and pointing at you

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
And starting to yell and grab

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Torches

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Can I look through my blood book

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
For teleportation stuff?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I use diplomacy

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And I approach the villager with

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
The most interesting accent

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Alright

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Teleport, there's no teleporting

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
In that blood book, I'm afraid

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Scoops were wanted by the law

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
In that town

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Yeah, you find this guy with the accent

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
And he's like, you ran me over with the horse

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
When we were trying to find you because

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I'm sorry, sir, I was looking for somebody else

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
You're gonna have to stop

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Get off that horse there

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Alright, I use diplomacy

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And I say

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
No, sorry, just

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Wanted to apologize again

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
And goodbye, I'm gonna go

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
What's the opposite way that we're going?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Uh, east at the moment

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Oh, but I shouldn't lie

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I just

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I kiss the air a million times

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Confusively, and I make a fart noise

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And I say Friday's at six

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
And I just gallop out

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
What's uh

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
I feel like that's like

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Performance or something

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Really, you think that's a performance?

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
It's certainly not diplomacy

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I'm Christopher, I have performance

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I'll start playing the wire saw

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Playing the wire saw

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
It makes her diplomacy

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Seem a lot more so

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Thank you

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
You managed to get out of there

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Okay

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I consult my

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Gem of audience talking to

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Because I'm wondering

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Am I missing something?

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Is there someone in our party

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Have the power to like

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Mass teleport? No

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
We could just go there

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
We could like rest up and head on our way

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I have three scissors

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Do we need to cut something?

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Why do you have three?

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I don't know, that's what's on this

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
That's so funny, you only need one

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
How did you end up with three scissors?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Alright

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Well, I mean, yeah

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Six combs

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Oh, that was from

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Mark looted a barber shop

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
It's all coming back to me

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Can you remember that?

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Well, okay, Spencer

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I'm meta-asking you this question

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Our trail

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
That brought us here

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Back when we were at that frost giant city

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Yeah

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
How many

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Plains, planar

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Jumps did we make

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Or is it a physical

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
You took

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Tylenol with codeine out

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
From there, so it was like a unicorn

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Jaunt

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
My short question is

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Do we know how to get back to that frost giant city?

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Not exactly, you know the general heading

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
It's a mountain range that's well known

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
It's a long shot

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Well, what do you want to do?

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
What do you want to do?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I'm trying to

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Save the cock-sucking world

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
What was the deal with the air city again?

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
What was there?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Oh, you know, just robot baby memories

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Right, okay

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
I mean, there's that too

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
It's like there's tons of possibilities

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
That no one's choosing

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Make a choice

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Let's make our way towards the mountain range

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Let's go towards the frost giants

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
It'll take us some time

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
We haven't slept in literally

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Adventures, like let's camp for the night

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And let's start making it on the horse

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And on our way

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
That's my pitch because the baby upgrade

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Is just selfish, chaotic,

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Evil kind of garbage

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Like we're like, hey, life's a video game

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
And the

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
But on the other hand, the going back

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
To the frost giants city is like

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Kind of almost futile

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Like naive

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Maybe we could help be good

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
You sound like a guy just stuck in his apartment for a year

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
When he moves to LA and he's like

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I should wear his screenplay

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
But movies are so bad now

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And I don't want to follow the main, let's just go

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
First of all, what's a screenplay?

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Second of all, you saw what's a scoops

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Is dignity

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
My sense of righteousness

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Over

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Outweighs my sense of loyalty

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
To this group, which is still great

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
And I start, I pack

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I make motions to move towards

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
The range where I know the frost giants

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I'm with you. Thank you.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Jump on, Christopher, and on the way

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Tell me what's going on. I want in on this.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I also have four knives.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Alright, Quirk. Knives.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
We're safe, I got four knives.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
I'm coming too, it was my idea.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Of course.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
You shamed me for it.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
I have no sense of

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Shaming.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
The only meaning for shame I know

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Is

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Prayer, praying God, praising God.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
L'chaim.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
So we ride, and then we camp.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Yes.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
This is the good part. And at the camp

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Fire

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Guys,

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Let's talk.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I think I'm going to turn in.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
My dad, wait, please stay up.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
My dad used to beat me

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
So hard.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Guys, I know a great song we can sing

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
By the campfire.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Do you?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
I whittle a

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Alligator.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I comb Sharpie's hair.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
What you whittlin' Sharpie?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
It's an alligator.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
It's the shape of an alligator

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
But it doubles as a clothespin.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
The alligator's mouth

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
It's a clothespin thing.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
It's clever.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
It's cool.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
We can use it as a handclothes.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Or just pin them.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I repeat an elvish chant myself

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Telling myself to be strong.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
The subtitles say

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Grace from the rivers of the father

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Tube stones run deep through the dank

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Arrows of flint be flinty

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Ears are pointy

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Hearts are deep

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
In the dank dark dungeons

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Deep

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Sky

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
River

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Horse

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
River

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Tree

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
A man

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Sunset

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Alright, and then we wake up.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Thank God no spiders attacked us.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
And your hair looks great.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I even cut some of those split ends

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
with one of my three scissors.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
We keep traveling.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Oh

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I thought the campfire

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
was going to be some sort of...

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
You keep traveling and you come across

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
a small

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
colorful

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
tent top stand

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
You see a small boy

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
perhaps 13 years of age

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
sitting inside this tent

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
holding a hand-painted sign

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
that says Wilderness Guide

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
20 Gold Beases

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
That's a little high

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Inflation

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Hey man, I'm like 600,000 feet

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
of rope for that

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
You could

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
or you could hire a great guide

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
to the Wilderness

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I'm little Baskins

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
and I'm a Wilderness Guide

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Say there boy

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
boy, what know you

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
of the ice giant city?

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Oh, I know all about

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
all the Wilderness. That's why I guide

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
people through it.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
You there boy, how much for a tour there?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Well, I have this sign

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I'm holding this sign

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
right so you could read it

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
If flint were salt

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
you'd have a supper load

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Man, I don't

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
get your jive speech

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Here's what you will get

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
10 sovereigns, not a penny more

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Sovereigns aren't accepted

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
in the realm here

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
They're gold

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
I asked for 20

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
It's on the sign, clearly marked

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
You look to deserve 40

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I look to deserve

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
40

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Boy, I say boy

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I say boy

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Will you trade for yarn?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I have yarn

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
in my backpack

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I'll give you two copper for some yarn

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
man, if you want yarn

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I mean if you have yarn, I want it

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
She just gave him 40 gold

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
You're spending copper

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
We better get the platinum tour

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
You're getting guided

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
not toured

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Jesus Christ

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
What is your name?

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
What is your name young man?

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I'm Lil Baskins

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Lil Baskins

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Lil Baskins

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I was born in a Baskin

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Boy, I hope you're prepared to go on the adventure of your life

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I hope you're prepared

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
to keep paying me

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Beyond the

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
double price

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
that we paid you?

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
That's the Baskins guarantee

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
That we have to keep paying you?

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
That's the Baskins guarantee

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Boy, how often do we pay you

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
on this?

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
You know, upon completion of the mission

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
we'll feel it out

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Boy

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
We're going to the frost giant city

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
We gave you 40 gold

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Yeah, yeah, we're going

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
We're not giving you anymore anything ever

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Don't we already know where the frost giant city is?

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Not exactly

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I feel like I'm at the cable car museum

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
How long will it take to get there Lil Baskins?

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Several days

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
at least

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Lil Baskins

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
What if you're parentage?

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Oh

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
I was born in a Baskin

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Is there a Mrs. Lil Baskins?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
No, I'm a child

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
It's very

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
I don't know

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
We have a robot baby

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Lil Baskins, let's start this journey

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
post-haste

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Real quick, were you guys

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
listening to great expectations on tape

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
before we arrived here?

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
When you dress a little boy in Dungeons & Dragons

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
you take on a haughty tone

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
You there boy

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Sharpie, will you pay this boy?

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I've paid him

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
and then some

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Well, let's go

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
You there, Lil Baskins, lead the way

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Let me just pack up my tent here

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
and we'll be okay

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
let's go

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
and you set off

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
towards the mountains that I mentioned

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
That's all man

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
We got so much fucking time

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
that we've spent

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
He's just pulling the plug

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I'm just pulling him

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Alright, okay, that's it

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
We're hangers

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Dungeons & Dragons

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Lil Baskins

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
That's a lot of Dungeons & Dragons

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
That's a lot of Hardin

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
That's a lot of town

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
San Francisco

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I do want to say before we

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
thank everybody

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Well, let's thank Rick and the Roxy

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
for having us here

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
San Francisco

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Let's thank the people of San Francisco

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:59.000
