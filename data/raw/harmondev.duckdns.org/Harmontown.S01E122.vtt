What is a human being?\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:38.000\nIs he an A? Is he an E?\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:42.000\nYou can't just assume, yeah, I figured it out, I looked it up\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nIt's John Wick\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nHe's an I, motherfucker\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nAnd then I get really pissed off, because then it says John Wick\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:54.000\nAnd then the tagline is, don't set him off\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:57.000\nDon't type set him off\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:01.000\nThank you, goodnight, we'll be at the bar next door\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nKettle one for everybody\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:11.000\nDon't set him off because he's a Wick\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:17.000\nBecause bombs use wicks?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nNo, they use fuses\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:29.000\nHis name's not John Fuse, and even if it was, the tagline should be, don't use him to set something off\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:34.000\nAnd if he's a Wick, the only thing he can set off is a candle\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:39.000\nLike, don't use him to make the room slightly lighter\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:45.000\nDon't use him if you shit in someone else's bathroom, and you need to cover it up\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nJust call him John Bomb\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nJohn Explosion, John Booboo\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nIt's probably harder for him to make an O in a billboard\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nYeah\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:05.000\nBut he would have done like a home alone thing, it would be John Bomb and the O would be Keanu Reeves' mouth going, oooooh\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:11.000\nI'm gonna blow up, don't set me off\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:19.000\nSteve, today a second man jumped over the fence at the White House and charged headlong at it\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nIt's about time\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nWhy does this happen more?\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:28.000\nIs it a federal offense for us to say, this is awesome?\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:36.000\nI mean, we're not saying you should do it, it's just a fun time to be alive\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.000\nAll the fucked up shit to be going on, I think it's kind of neat that\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nIt's some little rascal shit\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:45.000\nYeah, it's like the sandlot\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:52.000\nLike what are these guys doing? The first guy had a knife, and he got up to the, you know\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nHe got into the Lincoln bedroom and took a nap, right?\n\n04:54.000 --> 05:01.000\nYeah, he got, he was by the statue of Martin Sheen with his knife, like stabbing it\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nPracticing for the real president\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nDid this new guy have anything?\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nI don't think he, I think he had dog treats in his pocket\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nYeah, weaponized Ebola\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:16.000\nNo, I don't know if he had anything, he jumped over the fence and then the, I guess two dogs got him right away\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:20.000\nAnd he kind of punched the dogs a little bit, which got him assault charges\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:23.000\nSo they have guard dogs now instead of like\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nObviously the people were not on the ball\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:26.000\nYeah\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nThe first guy made it into the gift shop\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:35.000\nSo the second guy, yeah, he got, he ran up against the White House's best friend\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:40.000\nI don't know, I think it's neat, I think if you're going to have a White House and have a fence around it\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nI think it should be a tradition that every once in a while some guy\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nIt is crazy that it's low enough to jump\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nIt should be like 12 feet high\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.000\nIt should be, I mean, they'll probably add like, now it'll like electrocute you if you touch it, right?\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\nYeah\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nWhich would be more appropriate, like it feels a little dishonest to be like\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\nHave this like beautiful house where you have orphans hunt for eggs in the, in the Easter\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nYou know, it's like, oh yeah, you're\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nA turkey, everything's giving\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:10.000\nYou know, we're just hanging out, running the country, you know, like come on in if you want, just kidding\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nHey, if you could jump the fence, welcome, come on in\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:19.000\nIt's kind of, kind of appropriate if they have to actually like make it lasers or something that'll like\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nLike you put your hand through it and then, yeah, you lose your arm\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nI don't know\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:29.000\nYeah, speaking of current events, which I know people love to come to this show for\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:34.000\nBecause there is no other podcast, if not this podcast, where would people hear about current events?\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nWhere'd you get your news?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nYeah\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nEbola\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nIt's tough stuff\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nIt's real, it's real\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nIt's here\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:51.000\nI'll tell you guys, like I didn't know that much about Ebola and I didn't know, I wasn't very informed\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:57.000\nAnd so I started looking at the articles and what I've learned from the comment sections under them is that\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:04.000\nIs that this disease is very scary, but on the other hand it's also very overdue\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nLike Africanized killer bees\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:13.000\nRemember, as a kid, they were like, yeah, there's killer bees in South America and they're making their way north\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nAnd now they're in America\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nI want to do that bit again\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.000\nOkay\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nI wasn't that informed about Ebola\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nAnd then what I've learned from reading the articles and the comment sections under it is that it's a very scary disease\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nBut on the other hand, it's very overdue\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nAre we supposed to cheer that?\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:37.000\nYeah, because the people are, I guess my joke is that the people in the comment sections are so dumb\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nYou read the article, it doesn't really matter what the article says\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:44.000\nBy the time you get to the bottom of the comment section you're like, fucking yes, make this\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nIt is overdue, yeah\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:52.000\nWipe us out, cut us down with a machete, take us out, we are so dumb\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:57.000\nIt's like a clearing house for all the weird conspiracy theories and racist shit\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:04.000\nYou see comments where people are like, I saw a comment where a guy said, what a coincidence\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:10.000\nAn African plague after we elect our first African American president\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:18.000\nThat is fucking classic racism, that's beyond, that's like the lead zeppelin of racism\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:28.000\nIt doesn't even have anything to do with break dancing or implying that Barack Obama is going to paint the White House with leopard print\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:37.000\nIt's just going straight to the, yeah, he's African American and though it's his fault that there's African\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:44.000\nAnd everybody, the gun control people always find a way to start arguing in the middle of a thing\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:50.000\nNo matter what the article's about, there's always the people that come in and go, still, like 14 people killed last week with handguns\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:56.000\nAnd then people take that bait and then it's just like, you read these comment sections and you're just like, yeah, bring it in, man\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nBring the White Walkers in\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:03.000\nWhat are we doing? Let's get to the moon, let's take San Francisco and put it on the moon\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:09.000\nI was going to ask you that, I had one of my things to ask you because I haven't heard you mention it in a long time\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nI was like, did you bail on the colonizing the moon premise?\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:18.000\nI'm back to it now, I'm like, we got it and it's not because of Ebola, I'm not scared of Ebola\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:24.000\nI'm scared of, I'm proud of our country for not, I don't know, like, oh, this guy in New York's now got it\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nHe's a doctor, he's for Doctors Without Borders, he was\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:30.000\nHe was there with Ebola, yeah, no wonder\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:35.000\nI did see, this is one of my favorite comments, this is a very clever comment, like somebody said\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:41.000\nDon't worry, Republicans, all the people getting the disease so far have been helping people, you're safe\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nOh my God, that is great\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nI thought that was fucking awesome\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:52.000\nBut it is true, I mean, it is so far, that's the way you can be in the first world and get the disease is caring too much\n\n09:52.000 --> 10:01.000\nAnd there's, in these people so far, they're healthcare workers and the idea that their health is, you know, I mean, I'm proud of the fact that we\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:11.000\nWe grab them and we, you know, we quarantine them and we're doing everything we can and they're okay so far and they got sick trying to help people\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:16.000\nAnd it's, we gotta, I think that's gotta be the way to do it\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:22.000\nYou see in these comments, it's just like such a strange world we've entered where people, I don't even think they think of people as people anymore\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:27.000\nThey go like, oh yeah, we gotta seal up the borders and let this thing run its course\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:35.000\nIts course is people, its course is other dudes, like what course do you want it to run?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:45.000\nWe think we're gonna shut up America, like it's a newsstand and just subsist on our own chewing gum and Mentos and then open it back up\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:51.000\nAnd be like, open for business, whoa, we're all our customers and employees\n\n10:51.000 --> 11:05.000\nBut yeah, I hope that these people are okay, I hope that that New York guy makes it through because he's like, definitely got that disease by giving a huge shit that a lot of us don't give\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nGooderman's socks\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:13.000\nYou wearing some right now?\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:23.000\nNope, what I'm wearing right now are very threadbare socks where the ankle is all, there's no ankles on any of my socks anymore, they all have holes where the ankles are\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:26.000\nAnkle or heels?\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.000\nYou got sharp ankles dude\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nHeels, heel, right, heel\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nOld razor blade heels, Harmon over there\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:41.000\nLike where the heel is, like it's just skin and then it's like, so the top of the back of the shoe scrapes there\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nYou guys know what I'm talking about\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:48.000\nI need new socks, we've all been there, what's that?\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nWigwams\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nYeah, wear a fucking teepee on your feet Dan\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nIs that the new Ugg wigwams?\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nWigwams been around forever\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nLike Ebola\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:03.000\nI'll check in with you in a second\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:08.000\nI'm a man of means, I could procure my own socks like if I wanted to\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:15.000\nAnd I just don't do it, we were at it, the community writers were getting a lot done the other day\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:19.000\nI decided to reward us and incentivize more productivity by taking them to a bar\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:23.000\nWe went to a bar, we were drinking, we were trying to come up with another story\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:27.000\nOh what if Hobbit does a magic trick, I don't know, who knows\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:33.000\nAnd then this guy comes in with a big duffel bag and it's just teeming with all these colorful socks\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nAnd he's going socks, socks\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nIn a bar?\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:40.000\nYou know how like a guy will walk into a bar and go like pepperoni or flower for the lady\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nThis guy had socks\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nPepperoni?\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:48.000\nI've seen flowers for a lady, I've never seen the pepperoni guy\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:55.000\nWell in LA it's tamales and in Milwaukee there was a guy named Frank who would come in and go\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:58.000\npepperoni, cannoli\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:03.000\nAnd then you'd say I'd like a pepperoni and he'd go spice a mild\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:07.000\nI guess spice\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nWhat kind of socks was this guy selling?\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:17.000\nJust probably stolen, I'm assuming, because they were very cheap and he just had a lot of them\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:23.000\nAnd so here's my new philosophical epiphany\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:30.000\nSo Dan Gutterman, one of the writers, he immediately, we're all going like that guy's selling socks in a bar\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:34.000\nLet's all react to that, let's all think of how funny that is\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:38.000\nWhat an anomaly that is, why is he selling socks in a bar?\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\nDan Gutterman's like, I need socks\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:46.000\nAnd he's like, he just interested in a transaction with the guy, Dan Gutterman needs socks\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:51.000\nSo now it's even funnier and we're like, Dan Gutterman's buying socks from the socks guy\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:55.000\nNot only did the guy selling socks come in, but Dan Gutterman's buying socks, this is the best\n\n13:55.000 --> 14:00.000\nIf you're going to Instagram this, then the guy leaves, I need fucking socks\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nWe all need socks\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:11.000\nWe all need socks, I especially needed socks, I'm walking around with scraped, uncomfortable heels\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:14.000\nMoldy heels, because your feet sweat in your shoes\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:20.000\nBecause I allowed myself to be taken out of the moment by the Matrix\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:27.000\nGutterman's socks are thick and plush and because Gutterman saw past the\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:32.000\nHe was like, I'm not going to just enforce social mores and normality\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nI'm just going to, he's selling socks\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nI need socks, I'll buy some fucking socks\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:45.000\nHe made the practical anarchic connection, he didn't run it through some super ego or governmental like regulator\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.000\nOf like, oh the queen bee wouldn't like you selling socks right now\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:53.000\nI should make fun of you, maybe I could get comedy points\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:58.000\nHe's like, my feet need socks, money, socks, transaction, done\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nNow Dan Gutterman has socks\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nAnd I don't, I'm walking around like a jackass, I got bloody feet\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:08.000\nThey're not bloody, I'm just making a point\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:13.000\nI want everyone, I don't think San Francisco is the place you have to say this\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:16.000\nI think San Francisco is a city full of Guttermans\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:23.000\nIt's sock city, that's what they, they used to be called the city by the bay now, it's called sock city\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:29.000\nThese guys, if they see a Google bus, they'll storm it, they don't care\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:32.000\nWhat's a Google bus?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:37.000\nThere was a thing last year, we were here in San Francisco, somebody tweeted me about this\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:41.000\nI'll explain this to AG, I'm sure I'll get everything wrong\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:47.000\nApparently there's a bit of a gentrification thing happening, San Francisco has been through a lot of phases\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:56.000\nThere's like, there's, you know, there's, it's a beautiful city full of wonderful people\n\n15:56.000 --> 16:06.000\nAnd also some very affordable housing and it's just like a, it's a big mishmash full of awesome hippies and scientists and whatever you call them\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:14.000\nAnd these, there's these people on this hill somewhere outside the city where they make, they make the computers or something\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:20.000\nAnd they have, and they make a lot of money and they're kind of like, they have to live in San Francisco\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:26.000\nAnd then they like, somehow this gentrification thing happens where people get pushed out of neighborhoods that used to be affordable\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:33.000\nOr no longer affordable because landlords can make more money off of these, these Silicon Valley types that are like, like, like, like moving in\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:39.000\nAnd they have their own transportation or had, I'll use the past tense because I read about this, okay\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:46.000\nThey have, they have Google buses that take them up to Google Mountain\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:51.000\nIs Google Mountain, I don't know, is it Google Mountain? Do they really call it Google Mountain?\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:54.000\nNo, I don't know about that part\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:57.000\nIt escaped to Google Mountain\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:04.000\nAnd so, and so meanwhile, like, if you park, if you park in the wrong place, if you leave your car in the wrong place\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:08.000\nYou get a ticket, you get like a $70 ticket, whatever, a $700 ticket\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:13.000\nIt's illegal to be poor as it is anywhere else, it's also illegal to be poor in San Francisco\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:18.000\nIt's not illegal to have a Google bus that can use the same bus lanes as regular buses\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:23.000\nSo this is the side of the people, I'm jumping into a whole thing that I don't know nothing about\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:29.000\nBut like, so there was a Google bus incident where there was a Google bus parked in a regular bus lane\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:33.000\nWhich technically speaking, a vehicle is not allowed to do, it should get a ticket\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:38.000\nSo like kind of spontaneously a bunch of citizens sort of like blocked the bus\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:43.000\nAnd said, you're not leaving until you pay the fucking ticket we would get if our car was occupying our space\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:48.000\nAnd they kind of like, and then the picket signs came out and they're like, Google bus pay ticket, Google bus pay\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:51.000\nWe want the cops, give them a ticket\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:58.000\nAnd the people inside were like, all I did was like Kubert in college\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:04.000\nI don't even know what the city is, I've never, I'm from, I'm from Austin\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nGoogle gate\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:12.000\nI'm sure I got all of that wrong, but so that's what I got from skimming one USA Today article\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:19.000\nIs there a Google, Google gate, Google bus gate expert here?\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:23.000\nSomebody that's more intimately acquainted with the hot buttons\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:26.000\nYou guys are bored with it, that's what I'm getting\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nSeeing folded arms and rolled eyes\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nThey want to get over it\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:34.000\nThat's the other, San Francisco's lived through a lot of phases of like interlopers\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:39.000\nThe city survives these financial vikings\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:43.000\nYou know, everybody wants to live in San Francisco\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\nThey're always fucking with their beautiful Eden\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nAnd they weather it, they weather it\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nThey don't applaud for that being said\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nThey're worn out from weathering it\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:00.000\nAnd I would never solicit applause\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:08.000\nHey, can I make a request, since this is a very special time of year\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nCan we do a Harmontown Sports Corner?\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nOh, sure, sure\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nSports Corner!\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:23.000\nWhat do you think about what's going on right now?\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:28.000\nAnd it's really obvious what I'm talking about\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nIt's a very exciting time\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:39.000\nNo question, I mean this is the time of year that all sports fans look forward to\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:43.000\nAnd comment, like this is Christmas for sports fans, is what I call it\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:46.000\nI don't even call it by its actual name\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nI just call it Christmas for sports fans\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:52.000\nFor America's favorite pastime fans\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nYup, whoa, whoa, yeah\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nThat's baseball\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:03.000\nIt's baseball time again\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nAnd the mother of all baseball\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:12.000\nWho do you favor in this year's World Series, Stan?\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:16.000\nI mean, you've got a whole planet full of baseball teams\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:21.000\nAll convening into a series of baseball games\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:25.000\nWhere they gradually play each other and whittle down to just two teams\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:29.000\nAnd then that determines who's the best baseball team on the planet\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nI mean, I know you know that\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:37.000\nRight now we are at that very specific point in that process\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nWe're two games in\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:42.000\nTwo games into the beginning of the whole process?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nI'm not asking a question\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nYou know it's not like the Super Bowl, it's a series\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:51.000\nIt's two games into the World Series, which is like fucking like\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:57.000\nRelative to the World Series duration\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nTwo games in is the plot point\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nYeah, where in the story circle are we?\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:06.000\nThis is where Kevin McAllister gets left home alone\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nI think, I would say\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nMaybe\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:14.000\nOr where Catherine Herrera comes back\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nI don't know\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:20.000\nOh, okay, well, I mean, you must be not much of a sports fan\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:25.000\nThe World Series right now is at a fever pitch\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nIt's neck and neck\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nWe don't know who's going to win\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nWho do you like though?\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nYou've got to be careful being here right now\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nYou don't want to say the wrong team\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:40.000\nI love, I mean, look, this city's team is the best team\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nThat's right, yeah\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nYou can hear it in their applause\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nYou can feel it in their hearts\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nLike this city has its team fever\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:58.000\nThey have every reason to be very proud\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:02.000\nThis is a huge corporation that has drafted people from all over\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:06.000\nAnd called them San Francisco baseball players\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:10.000\nAnd what's not to be proud of\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nThe Giants?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nYeah\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nWow\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nSport Master\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nSan Francisco Giants\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nTwo games into the World Series\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nNeck and neck with their arch enemy\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nThe Mongoose to their Cobra\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nOne and one\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nCould you ask for a more vicious opponent?\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nIt doesn't even matter, right?\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nYou almost don't even need to say the other teams\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nNo, no, no\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nI would ignore them\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nI don't think they're going to be much of a threat\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:43.000\nI think the Giants are going to sweep their...\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nI don't know\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nIt's going to be tough\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nWell, stay tuned, man\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:52.000\nBecause they've been getting the hits\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nThey've been getting the runs\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nThey've been getting the line drives\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nAnd all of the pop-ups\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:02.000\nAnd that is the game of baseball\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:06.000\nPeople focus on foul balls and strikes\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nIt's not about that\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:11.000\nIt's about line drives and pop-ups\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nPay attention to that\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nThe Giants are king\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nSo good luck\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nAnd we'll see you at the end of the World Series\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:20.000\nHope you beat that other team\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nThat's it for Sports Corner!\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nFuck the Kansas City Royals\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nOh, the Royals? Oh, okay\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nI saw a thing on Twitter now\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nThat makes sense that there was...\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:42.000\nThe radio station banned the play of the Lord song\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:46.000\nYou were just like, I think Ebola's in Kansas City\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nI'm not going to follow up on this\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nWhen you said that, Royals, I'm like,\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:51.000\nOkay, that makes sense, the Lord song\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:54.000\nOkay, that's why that radio station banned the...\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nYeah, okay, that makes sense\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nYeah\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nNo, it doesn't\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nDoes it make sense?\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nNo, not really\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:09.000\nMaybe think about putting a band on top 40 songs\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:13.000\nBefore they have a potential to get that out of control\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nIt's like book burning, almost\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:21.000\nSan Francisco's hard to pimp for applause\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nThey've heard it all\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nThat's what they like, and they will only applaud for that\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nYou can't just come up here and go,\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nYeah, I got my dick pierced the other day\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nYeah, apparently you can't\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nI don't even know why, I just felt like it\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nTook a trolley over to the...\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nHeroine shop\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nIt's not a trolley\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nI think it's a cable car, Dan\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nWait, it's not called a trolley?\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nI'm so sorry, guys\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nWhat the fuck is a trolley?\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nThe difference is...\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nMr. Rogers shit\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nWell, okay, so wait a minute, I do have a question about that\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:05.000\nBecause I passed one of those, I saw it going up a hill, a cable car\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nBut there was no cable\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:10.000\nIt's underneath now, or was it always underneath?\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nOkay, so it's the other cities that are there overhead\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nAnd they got the things hooked up to them\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nOkay, those are trolleys\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nIf they're electric, they have the wires above them\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:22.000\nThis is a cable car, there's not literally a...\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:27.000\nPulling it like a Goonies device?\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:33.000\nYeah, that's straight up little rascals right there\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nThat's insane\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:38.000\nA bunch of ducks in a pond pulling them under the street\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:41.000\nJesus, that is the dick piercing of mass transit\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nThis city has got it all\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nThey're not the New York of California\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:51.000\nThey're the Portland of the Bay\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nPortland of the Bay\n\n25:55.000 --> 26:00.000\nYou guys won't be happy until I say this city was made by God\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nThey built this city on rock and roll\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nAlright, well, let's bring it\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:16.000\nI mean, obviously, it would be folly for me to sit here\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:19.000\nand try to talk about San Francisco\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:23.000\nwhen you and our Dungeon Master spent all day\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nreally seeing the sights\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:26.000\nWe hit all the sights\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nCan we bring up Spencer Crintenden?\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:29.000\nSpencer!\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nOh my God, he's running\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nHe always runs\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nWow\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nHey, hey guys\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nOh, he ran, he ran up here\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nI'm really...\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:51.000\nSpencer, you and AG, you guys got here hours before I did\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:54.000\nand you guys really saw the real San Francisco\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nWe saw the realest\n\n26:56.000 --> 27:00.000\nMan, we found the finest little lunch nook\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nIt was called, what do they call it?\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nChipotle\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:08.000\nReal down bone cuisine\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:11.000\nAnd then got drinks at Starbucks afterwards\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:14.000\nand then dessert at Cold Stone Creamery\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:17.000\nThis isn't a joke, that's exactly what they did\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:20.000\nAll these fine artisanal craftsmen\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:23.000\nEverything we could have done in Los Angeles\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nin the airport\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nJust really soaking in the culture\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:37.000\nYeah, but you guys partook so much, Spencer\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nYou got a little sick, right?\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:43.000\nI mean, I don't have a great stomach before Harmontown shows\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nIt's documented fact\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nYou still get a little queasy?\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:48.000\nOh yeah\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nFrom Superstaritis?\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nNo, that's not why\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:54.000\nWhat is it, Spencer?\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:57.000\nIt's just not Superstaritis\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:00.000\nYeah, well can you counter that with something...\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nAnxiety?\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nNo, anxiety, that's the one\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:09.000\nDo you still, do you puke?\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:13.000\nNo, no, I probably will\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nSomeday?\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:20.000\nI mean, in a couple of minutes\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nIt'll be fine, it'll just get this guy\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nHe knows, he knows\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:29.000\nYeah, you know last time we were in San Francisco\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nMe and A.G. hung out, it was like the first time\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:34.000\nI had really, you know, talked to the guy in person, I think\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:37.000\nAnd we hung out and got pizzas, it was good times\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nYeah, we went to Domino's\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nGot an authentic slice\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nThen got drinks at a 7-Eleven\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nYou guys make a good pair\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:53.000\nI would be comfortable trusting a murder case to the two of you\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:58.000\nI don't know if it would get solved, but I would like to watch you try to solve it\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nSo comical\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:07.000\nIt would all be like centered around how we just see clues that are higher up than everyone else can see\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:12.000\nJust be like, oh, actually on top of the door jam, there's fingerprints\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:18.000\nOr we find clues in food, like bite into a hamburger with a ring in it\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:23.000\nMcDonald's usually doesn't have these kinds of additives, it's 100% beef\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:27.000\nSeasoned with salt and pepper during cooking\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:31.000\nThey told me that on their Twitter account today\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:32.000\nDid they tweet at you?\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:36.000\nYeah, because they were like 100% beef in every patty\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:42.000\nYou put salt and pepper in it, there's grease in it, those things aren't beef\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:48.000\nYou can't say it's 100% beef if there's things that aren't beef comprising 100% of the object\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:53.000\nAnd then they were like, it is 100% beef, we just add these things\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:57.000\nAnd I was like, that doesn't refute my point at all\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:08.000\nWas it San Francisco we were at, it was Sketchfest where that guy, was it, was that, was that where the\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:14.000\nNo, Sketchfest was here, sure, but that's not necessarily where this guy was, calm down\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:21.000\nWell, you San Francisco podcast listeners, was that where the guy that said he broke up with his girlfriend\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:25.000\nAnd then there was the, then the girl in the audience was like, he's a liar\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nI don't remember that\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:33.000\nIt was insane, it was so titillating and weird\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:37.000\nIt was just like a one guy going like, I got dumped by this girl and I'm totally broken hearted\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:42.000\nAnd then just like, two minutes into it, you just keep hearing, liar, liar\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nBy the girl he supposedly broke up with\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nNo, just a stranger\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:52.000\nBut not a stranger, somebody who then came up and said, I think she was a barista at a place that he frequents\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nAnd she says, he's a character at our place\n\n30:54.000 --> 31:01.000\nAnd like he says, I think her beef was that he, he's kind of a dramatic personality\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:06.000\nAnd that he's always talking about this girl leaving him, but she's never seen him\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nI really couldn't figure out what the hell was going on\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:14.000\nIt was like, it was very interesting how it fed on the human compulsion to like figure out what's right and what's wrong\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:17.000\nWhat's just and what's, what's unjust\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:20.000\nIt was like, what is that, the Mori show\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:23.000\nBut if everyone was just guessing instead of actually having\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:29.000\nYou are probably not the father, Spencer\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nI thought maybe\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:37.000\nIsn't that kind of amazing about our species that you can put us in a situation where there's absolutely nothing at stake\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nBut someone saying, bad person\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:42.000\nAnd then the other person was like, no good person\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:46.000\nAnd it kind of draws you in, you're like, I'm going to figure this out\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:50.000\nBecause the objective truth is who gives a shit\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:53.000\nBut the answer is all of us, because we're all chimpanzees\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nWe're all like, we got to figure this out\n\n31:55.000 --> 32:01.000\nWe got to, I guess our instinct is we got to figure out which of these chimps is the bad person\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:06.000\nAnd we got to deny them further figs and bananas and send them into the forest\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:10.000\nWhere they will die and stop contributing reproductively to the species\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:13.000\nThat's what's in our, that's what's in our gut, I guess\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nIs when we tweet and hashtag and things\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:19.000\nWe're like, we're trying to expunge injustice\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:24.000\nWe want to create a good monkey species and like get rid of the bad people\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nI love that she was just like, liar\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:31.000\nIn my head, even if I knew I'd be in the back of the room going, that guy's a fucking liar\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nTo my friend, I wouldn't say it out loud\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:39.000\nYeah, it was really, from my perspective it was absolutely impossible to tell which of them was a hero or a villain\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:42.000\nAnd who, what's that?\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:46.000\nOh yeah, are you just, is that just your objective opinion?\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:52.000\nOkay, because if he had insider information, boom\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:57.000\nLike we create our own little gamer gate right here in San Francisco\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:00.000\nTrying to unravel that shit\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:07.000\nYeah, I don't know, well I was, I'm up here and sometimes I'm seeing things through a fog\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:12.000\nAlright, well why don't we meet some San Franciscans, huh?\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:13.000\nOh, I'd love to\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:16.000\nWe should get to the bottom of them as people\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nShould we find some people who are hurting tonight?\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:21.000\nDo we follow the pain? I don't know what else to follow\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nCan't follow the joy\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nYeah, let's try to follow the joy\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nOkay\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:32.000\nLet's see, is there...\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:38.000\nWho that is coincidentally within reach of my microphone cord\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:46.000\nFeels like they're kind of, they're kind of so high in terms of biorhythmic victories\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:49.000\nThat they're waiting for the other shoe to drop\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:52.000\nLike they're actually kind of nervous that they're going to jinx it by bragging\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nThere's a hand back there waving back and forth\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:58.000\nLet's just take a flyer and you come down because I can't reach back there\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nSo we'll just trust you and...\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:07.000\nIs that right?\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:08.000\nGoing on\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:11.000\nIt feels too Q&A-ish for him to be standing down there\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nCan you climb up here?\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nOh yeah, there's a seat up here\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nYeah!\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:20.000\nAlright\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nWhat's your name, young man?\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nShame\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nWhat, shame?\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nJesus\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:27.000\nShame\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nAlright, here you grab that, I'll move\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:30.000\nI'll move\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:31.000\nWe're following the joy\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nI'll move the bottle\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nYeah, you're following the shame\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.000\nYes\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nIf your parents' name you shame, yeah, they're kind of set to move up to it\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:39.000\nYeah, Hebrew means life in Hebrew\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:40.000\nOh really?\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:41.000\nYeah, C-H-A-I-M\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nShame means life in Hebrew?\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nI-M, that's the pronunciation\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:46.000\nOh, oh, I-M\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nYeah, I'm not just a cool guy, so it's shame\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:53.000\nOh, so you're just pronouncing it like the way we, when we meet up with Chris Anwich\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:54.000\nExactly\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:55.000\nSo many people...\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:56.000\nIt's an Americanization of...\n\n34:56.000 --> 35:00.000\nSo many people say it wrong that I just say shame, so it makes it everything good\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:05.000\nAlright, shame, I-M, you're feeling on top of things right now?\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:12.000\nOh yeah, I'm literally high, and I'm here to see you, so I'm really good\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:15.000\nAnd I'm on stage, so this is what I've been talking about with my friends\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:18.000\nI told them that I was going to come up here because I'm black\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nOh, it's not a bad reason\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nAnd that's actually not why we brought him up here\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nI can tell he was black when he was waving at us\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:29.000\nI was like, yeah, I'll take the black guy\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:34.000\nI was going to yell out white guilt, but I didn't need to\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:44.000\nI get a high off of black people, and I suck stem cells out of the blackness\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:47.000\nAnd I use it to revitalize my whiteness\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:52.000\nI knew I was winning when I walked in this room and I was being black, yeah, definitely\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:57.000\nSo, what's it like being black with a Jewish name?\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:02.000\nNo, let's just get to know you, what do you-\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:05.000\nCan we ask how old you are?

it in word\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nWell, because, yeah, exactly\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nSo it's either like I have to stop doing this thing\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nThat's really

not gonna say\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:41.000\nI would not subject any of my\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:44.000\nAfrican American friends\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nThat's how I say it, because I'm so liberal\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nThat's also racist\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nI wouldn't subject them to that social pressure\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:53.000\nBecause then if I would say something like that\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nThen they have to go, they're like\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:58.000\nOkay, now I'm a representative of something\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nSo things that it's not

it\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nDon't worry, it'll be fine\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nClean up in aisle three\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nIt's as simple as that\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:23.000\nWell, how

left\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nWe're not putting any money into education\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:12.000\nAnd we're not treating the people that get the pay for the education\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:13.000\nThey're entitled to anything\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nWe're not providing daycare\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nWe're not providing medical care\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nSo we better reward entrepreneurship\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:21.000\nOr rather I should say everybody should go be an entrepreneur\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:24.000\nWho's that guy that was offering\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nHe'll give you $10,000 if you drop out of college\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nBecause he was like a...\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:32.000\nThat was an episode of Silicon Valley\n\n47:32.000 -->

him\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nIt was like some guy who early adopted eBay stock\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nOr something like that\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:47.000\nAlright\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nAll I hear is electric eel\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nYou guys see that documentary about the student debt\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nAnd stuff like that\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:56.000\nIt's a very interesting documentary\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:57.000\nI can't remember what it's called\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:58.000\nAaron was watching it\n\n47:58.000 --> 47:59.000\nIt's fucked up, man\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nIvory Tower?\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nThat I heard\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:04.000\nIt's because one person was...\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:05.000\nBecause they're real words\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:06.000\nThat guy's name is like\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nShimmer me, me, me, Erl\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:12.000\nSay Harry Potter\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nI'll understand it, motherfucker\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nShit\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:18.000\nAlright\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:19.000\nSo shame\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:22.000\nI always lose track of time on these foreign gigs\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nForeign\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:25.000\nWe're jet lagged\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:26.000\nWe don't know how long we've been here\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:27.000\nWe're not jet lagged\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:28.000\nForeign\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:29.000\nHow long we've been here?\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nWe're jet lagged\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\n40 minutes\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\n40 minutes\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nTo a foreign land\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nYou flew over Google mountain\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:45.000\nAnd landed in the land of clam chowder bread bowls\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:48.000\nAlright, so shame\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:49.000\nHere's the thing\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:50.000\nHere's the elephant in the room though\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:51.000\nYou've got three jobs\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nTwo full time, two part\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:56.000\nI hope the answer isn't\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nYou just wanted to be on stage\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nI said who's on top of the...\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:01.000\nWho's on top of the world right now\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\nWho's really...\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:03.000\nYou really are happy even though you're...\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:04.000\nIt's a little bit of both\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nMe just wanting to be on stage\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:07.000\nLike I told you\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:08.000\nI told my friends I'm going to get on stage\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:09.000\nBecause I'm black\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:12.000\nBut I wanted to be on stage\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nBecause I'm very happy right now\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:15.000\nJust for the simple fact\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nI just saw your documentary\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nAnd I gave you a handshake\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nWhile I'm waiting for the bathroom\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:22.000\nOh, I remember you\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:23.000\nAnd now I'm on the stage\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:24.000\nDrinking vodka with you\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nThis is a dream come true right now\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:27.000\nThat just puts all this pressure on me\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:28.000\nI thought, okay\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nAlright, well I'm glad you could be...\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nOh yeah, I want to put all the pressure on you, Dan\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:33.000\nWell, I want to...\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:36.000\nOkay, but will you stay here for a second?\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:37.000\nI'll definitely stay\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:38.000\nI'm not going anywhere\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nActually, I'm going home with you\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:41.000\nYou just adopted me\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:43.000\nAaron, you're my mom now\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:44.000\nWe did it\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nI want to try an experiment\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nWho is...\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nWho is miserable?\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:53.000\nThat hand went up the fact\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:54.000\nThat hand shot up in the...\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:55.000\nYeah, you pointed it yourself\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nYeah\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:58.000\nYeah, you come up\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nOkay, we have a miserable person coming up\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:01.000\nNice\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:02.000\nI want to see...\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:05.000\nMaybe we can create some kind of human emotion battery\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:08.000\nIf we put a wire between his mouth and yours\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nAnd then we can run a city on it or something\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:11.000\nYeah, can you...\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nHuman skin type hat, kind of thing\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nHowever you think you can do it\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nJust don't sue us if it goes wrong\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:19.000\nIt's going on, man\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:21.000\nOh, yeah\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:22.000\nYour turn now\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:23.000\nOkay, you take that\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:24.000\nWhat's your name, young man?\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:25.000\nMy name is Austin\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:26.000\nAustin?\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:27.000\nOkay\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nDestination of the next Harmontown\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:30.000\nWow\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nShaman Austin, okay\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:33.000\nThat's my life\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:34.000\nTrue detective, season two, right here\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:35.000\nOh, wow\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nI'm Matthew McConaughey\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:38.000\nThat's fine\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:39.000\nAll right, cool\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nDo you want to be like...\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nLike 2006 Matthew McConaughey?\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nI'm like a failure to launch\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:47.000\nMatthew McConaughey, was it your name movie?\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:48.000\nYeah\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:49.000\nYeah, I'm that guy\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nIsn't it Vince Vaughn and Colin Farrell this season?\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:52.000\nI heard that\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:53.000\nYes, it is\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:54.000\nI hope that\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:55.000\nIt's a fucking goddammit\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:56.000\nWell, you don't...\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:57.000\nYeah, that's how I feel about it\n\n50:57.000 --> 51:00.000\nYeah, but if you heard McConaughey and Woody Harrelson\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nWhat would you have been like?\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:03.000\nNo, because that's it\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nI mean, when I hear Vince Vaughn\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nI have that same response to the McConaughey\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nBecause it's like Vince Vaughn is...\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nYeah, I'll watch that whatever happens\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:12.000\nThat sounds interesting\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nBut Colin Farrell\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:15.000\nI don't know\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:16.000\nYeah, you know what, you're right\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:17.000\nYou're right\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:18.000\nI'm trying to spit and polish it\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:19.000\nYeah\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:20.000\nLike Vince Vaughn is that guy for you?\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:21.000\nReally?\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:23.000\nNo, not because he's amazing\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nBut because that's so fucking weird\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:28.000\nIt's like whatever happens is gonna be interesting\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:31.000\nI didn't expect McConaughey to be all like\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:34.000\nI'm in a Lincoln, by a Lincoln\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nOr whatever\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:39.000\nBut it was interesting to watch happen\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nVince Vaughn, I think, he's just like\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nI don't know, man, he just always looks so tired\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nSo I just feel bad for him\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nYou know, he puts in the hours\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:48.000\nWell, obviously\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:49.000\nYeah, he needs a nap\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:50.000\nI don't know, man\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nIn this case, I feel like you would have to be Vince Vaughn\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nBecause you don't ever sleep\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:55.000\nYeah, I do need a nap\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:56.000\nWhich is cool\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:57.000\nI'm definitely Vince Vaughn\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nSo we're season two, I'm Vince Vaughn\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:02.000\nColin Farrell, you have to be Colin Farrell?\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nWe don't have to figure this out tonight\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:09.000\nThe show opens in two hours\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nThe logistics are really tough\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nBut like, you know, we'll bring it\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nAustin, why are you miserable?\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nThere's a lot of reasons\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:18.000\nTop three\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nTop three\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nI was in a relationship for like six years\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nThat just ended maybe a month ago\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:26.000\nLiar!\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nMe and Dan on the same page\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nI knew it, I knew it was coming\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nTruth or, truth or on that\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nIt ended, and that sucks\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nStraight relationship?\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nThe best kind\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nJesus\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nWow\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nThat just sunk in\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nI actually heard that it's just being\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nLike kind of absurdly obtuse\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nLike I was just random\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nAnd then I just realized, oh my god, that's horrible\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nYeah, I mean\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:05.000\nWell, you asked like that was important\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nOr somehow the answer that\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nI wanted to picture it and for\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nReverse homophobic reasons\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nLike I'm reverse racist and reverse homophobic\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nIs equally probably bad\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nYou just love gay people so much you want everyone to be gay?\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:19.000\nI thought in my head\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nAs I asked that, I was like, why did you ask that\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nAnd I realized the answer is\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nIf you were gay, it's more tragic\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:28.000\nIt's more tragic when gay men break up\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nThan when a man just breaks up with a woman\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:31.000\nSorry\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nWay more emotional\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nI don't know that that's true\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nIt's hard for them to find each other\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nFacts, facts\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nAnd if they can find each other\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:44.000\nAnd be in a relationship, it's a beautiful thing\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nIt's more beautiful than two straight people\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nAnd if they break up, it's more tragic\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nThank you, San Francisco\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nI may have to buy property here soon\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nI just want to try to see if I can lower the house price\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nYou have to because I live here\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nAnd now you're my father so\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nYou have to have a house for me\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nAlright, so yeah, I just\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nI don't know, I just wanted a mental image\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nI don't know, I wanted to know\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nSo a young lady\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nYou broke it off six months ago\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\nSo that's enough right there\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nNo, it was a six year relationship\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nThat ended about a month ago\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nI don't listen\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nIt's cool, it's fine, I don't expect you to\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nI'm not that important\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\nI'm going to try though\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nThere's that, you're fresh\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nI feel a little bad about number two\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nBecause I feel like it should take more precedence\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nBecause it's been around longer\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nBut I don't really have a relationship\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\nWith a family who I live with\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nI have a huge family too\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nI have like seven brothers\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nAnd I'm a right in the middle\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nAnd I just don't have that relationship\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nThat people have with their family\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nAnd you live with all of them currently?\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nNot all of them currently\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nOne lives in San Diego\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nThe San Francisco of California\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nAnd one of them lives\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nIn Tacoma, Washington\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nThe San Diego of Washington\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nAnd he just got back from Afghanistan\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nThe Army\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nI got it\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nI got it\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nThe Portland of the Middle East\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nWhere young people go to\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nretire in the Middle East\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nI would assume, I don't know\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nAnd then\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nMy other brothers are\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nOne of them lives on like a fucking ranch\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nOr something, not far\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nAnd then the rest of them are younger than me\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nSo they do in fact live with me\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nBut is the general thing, do you feel a little bit\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nLike you just like there's something\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nThere's like a circuit broken in you\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nOr you're like, wait, why am I not like one of these people on TV\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nWhere I'm kind of like automatically enchanted by my family\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nYeah, totally, I actually said that the other day\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nWhen\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nWhen me and my girlfriend were breaking up\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nI said, why isn't everything like a TV show\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nI don't, I don't get it\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nI don't have that frame of reference\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nThat everyone has where it's like, well you know it'll be cool\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nI'm always just like, why don't I feel\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nLike I have that with anyone\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nI'm fully qualified to diagnose you\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nBut I have one more question\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nDo you have a snow globe\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nWith the cast of an entire hospital drama\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nInside of it\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nWow, that is an old\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nAss reference dude\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nThat is an old\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nAss reference\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nI got my middle aged San Franciscans\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nAre in the house\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nSay it elsewhere\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nAlso I think there's like\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nThen there's 30% trickle of people who just know that as a reference\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nYeah, I feel like that's\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nThat's me\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nI've never seen\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nGone with the wind, but I know that\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nHe doesn't give a damn\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nAbout my dear or something\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nI've never made it\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nThrough Wizard of Oz, but I know her shoes are red\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nAnd she had them the whole time or something\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nAnd the trees are monkeys\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nThose are the hard\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nPlot points of that mostly\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nThe\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nOkay, so, but yeah\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:57.000\nThat's how I feel\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:59.000\nThat scares me\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nMy mom and dad are not coming to my wedding\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.000\nAnd I feel like it's because\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nThere's something wrong with me\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nBecause you just finished watching a movie\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nWhere of course there's a big plot point in the movie\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nWhere I'm like, oh my mom hit me\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nAnd my dad spanked me and I think they're kind of sick of it\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nI don't think they want to come to a wedding\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nWhere Joel McHale's there\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nAnd just watched a movie about how they hit me\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nI think they're like, I'm assuming\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nAll these things because they're very polite\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nI would say reptilian\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nDid they say why\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nNo, they didn't\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nWe'd love to see pictures and we'll hook up soon\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nAnd I was like\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nI just projected under that silence\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nI'm like, you know what, they're just fucking sick of it\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nThey have a 41-year-old child\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nWho is in his 35th year\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nOf\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nMaking money by talking about how they beat him\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nAnd they're like, I'm not going to that wedding\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nIt's going to be uncomfortable\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nJack Wax is going to be like\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nLooking over at us and whispering\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nYeah\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nSo I don't blame them\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nWhich makes me feel bad because\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nI think about my extended family\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nI do nothing but fumble balls there\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\nJust out of like\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nI don't care\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nI have that exact thing\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nWhere they try\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nWell, I don't even know that they try to engage me genuinely\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nBut I just, I don't care\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nI hold family to the same standard\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nTo which I hold strangers\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nAnd they don't measure up\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nThey don't, because they're like\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nYou should come over for Christmas\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nSo that we can fight\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nIf a stranger offered that\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nI'd be like, fuck you\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nIf a TV show offered that\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nI'd be like, no, I'm not going to tune in\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nTo watch the Christmas episode and see you fight\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nWell, that is what we do\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nBut I just kind of like\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nI think it's\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nI don't know what it is\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nIt makes me feel bad\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nIt makes me feel like I'm a shitty person\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nIf the chickens are going to come home to roost\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nYou're going to be 70 in the Stanley Kubrick\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nThird Act bed\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nWith the tubes in your nose\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nAnd you're going to be like\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nWhere, everyone, where is everyone\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nAnd they're going to be like\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nWe're gone, because you didn't care\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nYou articulate that really well\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nYou should tell them McKenna's solution\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nTo your parents not coming to your\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nOh, yeah, he wants me to hire actors to play my parents\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nWhich I think is really interesting\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nLike have Tom scare\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nThat's doable in Los Angeles\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nIt is totally like you could get\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nYou could go to Central Casting and just have people\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nThat just look like your dad\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nBut also, I have a crack, I could maybe get\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nYou know, who knows, I could see if\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nLike Tom Scarrett or Brian Cranston would like\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nYou know, like maybe get\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nAn A-list guy to be my dad\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nMorgan Freeman\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nGet Gilbert Godfrey to fly out\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nAnd be your dad\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nI'm so proud of\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nOf my dad and my son\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nYesterday\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nI'm supposed to say something\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nNow Harmon's in session\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nDanny, treat it\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nThat's a good, you do a good Gilbert\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nHe's a hero of mine\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nI haven't talked about this yet\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nI don't know if it's appropriate to talk about it\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nBecause I don't know the guy, and I don't know\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nLike when I was backstage, I met him\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nAnd I was like, hey, I'm such an honor to have you here\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nSo great that you were here, and he's like, okay\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nAnd I go like, actually\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nYou're not so much a guest as you are\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nHe introduced me, okay\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nAnd he just kept saying, okay\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nAnd it was like, oh god, I really fucked up\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nLike he doesn't know me, and he does it\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nThis is too much to ask of somebody, and he's bummed out\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nAnd he's lethargic, and he doesn't care\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nAnd he just kept going, okay\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nAnd then\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nHe kind of like, I didn't feel like I had the right\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nTo tell him to go out\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nSo you can hear in the recording, people are spontaneously erupting\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nInto chicken noodle songs\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nBecause I'm backstage, like standing next to him\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nAnd kind of waiting for him to go out\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nBut afraid to ask him to go out\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nSo then eventually I go, okay, so let's go do it\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nAnd then he comes out, and he just\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nHe starts like pumping\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nHe just like, comes out, completely changes his posture\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nTurns into this completely different person\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nAnd the audience is like screaming for him\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nAnd he's like milking the crowd\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nAnd then he sits down and goes like, I'm your Gilbert Gottfried\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nAnd does this whole thing, does it for two hours\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nIt's a great show, we get off stage\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nAnd I'm like, oh my god, that was so great, thank you\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nAnd he's like, okay\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nAnd then he disappeared into the night\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nLike Starman\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nHe just turned into cosmic dust\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nAnd went up and\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nThat's where Saturn's rings come from\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nHe's a lights up performer\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nThat's what they call it\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nWhat I really wanted to ask him is\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nIs that like, because we're friends with Bobcat\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nSo we know that Bobcat thinks of that voice\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nThat he would do\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nLike, you know, that guy, that's a character\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nAnd I\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nI don't know Gilbert Gottfried\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nWell enough to ask him, I wanted to ask him\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nIs that, do you call that a character\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nOr is that how you speak\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nWhen you're projecting your voice\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nBecause I think there's a subtle\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nBut important difference, like I really wanted to know\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nBut I didn't have the balls to ask him\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nAnd I thought I'd share\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nJust what's going on in my life\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nIn the lowest stakes\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nWhich always, wow, you gotta hear\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nThe San Francisco show, Dan talks about\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nThe previous show\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nHe really gets to the bottom of\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nNothing\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nJust asks questions\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nAnd puts things, he remembers\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nHe needs butter\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nIt was a great use of San Francisco's time\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nWe watched a two hour movie\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nAbout him\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nAnd then we watched him think about things\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nSo how do we\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nAlright, what do we do here\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nWe got Misery\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nAnd we got shame\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nTotally illogical happiness\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nOn James' part\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nIllogical happiness\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nAnybody that's shoveling bread\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nHe said he was high\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nIs that how they make bread?\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nWe shovel it out of dirt\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nCome to Panera bread, guys\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nWe shovel it out of dirt\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nI base everything on Minecraft\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nThat's how you make bread in Minecraft\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nYou have to\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nI mean\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nYou got lots to complain about\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nShame\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nI have a hell of a lot to complain about\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nBut you got a girlfriend\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nI had a girlfriend\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nThat's what it is\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nIt's the women in our lives\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nIt's the women\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nWhen you don't feel like you have somebody to share your life with\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nRight, Spencer?\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nI woke up at 4 in the morning\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nBecause I had a nightmare\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nAbout a giant dog sized spider\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nAnd then I went back to sleep\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nAnd had a nightmare where my ex came back\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nAnd then disappeared like a ghost\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nAnd then I couldn't get back to sleep\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nWhich one was scarier?\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nThe spider was scarier\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nIn terms of shitty\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nI think I could have handled the spider a bit better\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nJesus Christ\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nThe trick is to quickly\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nSnap off one or two limbs\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nAnd\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nFrom there it's just easy\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nPickens\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nAnd it comes to monstrous spiders\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nSpencer, how would you fight a unicorn?\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nOh, you don't fight a unicorn\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nYou just don't enter their sacred forest\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nIn the first place\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nThat's kind of a cop-out answer\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nWhat if you found yourself in it?\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nWhat if you were drugged and woke up in their sacred forest?\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nThat's not a unicorn\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nThat would be some sort of doppelganger trick\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nWhat about a Kebler elf?\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nYou know what Kebler elves are?\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nYeah, they make cookies\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nHow would you fight three of those?\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nThe same way you'd fight any three infants, I guess\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nInfants\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nI'd be so offended\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nIf I was an elf\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nA Kebler elf\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nIf you're a Kebler elf, we're very sorry\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nI can't believe those fucking cable cars\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nAre tied to ropes\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nAre you people insane?\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nWhat a kind of Rube Goldberg\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nIs the whole thing powered?\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nIn the morning, does a chicken\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nGet startled by a balloon popping?\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nAnd make all of your mass transit go?\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nThat's...\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nYou're taking the green thing too seriously\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nCan we...\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nI don't know how close she is to being able to be down here\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nAre you in the back, Erin?\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nShe's in the back\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nOkay, can you come down here?\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nErin McGathy\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nMy betrothed\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nFuture Mrs. Harmon\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nMy other half, Erin McGathy\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nYeah\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nYeah\n\n01:05:15.000 -->

Erin, you're my mom now\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nTough breaks\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nDon't say that too many times\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nYou're my mom\n\n01:05:37.000

little too much\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nYeah, probably, yeah\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nI want to move to Australia, that's why I'm doing it\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nShame, you can't leave us\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nI know, but I didn't know you were going to be my mom\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nDo you know someone in Australia?\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nI do not know anyone in Australia\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nI know Australians are in Australia\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nYou just want to go to Australia?\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nYeah, I want to live there and not be in America\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nSmart guy, right?\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nIt's just full of murderous creatures and plants\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nThat was America\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nI mean, not creatures and plants, no\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nThere are herds of Spencer's ex-girlfriend\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nThere's grass in...\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nNo, there's grass in Australia that'll give you chlamydia\n\n01:06:17.000 -->

chlamydia the clap?\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nI don't know\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nIs that what your girlfriend told you?\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nYeah\n\n01:06:31.000 -->

crabs\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nThey're big\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nJust sand crabs\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nAaron is my long-suffering fiancée\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nAs described in various movie reviews\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nThat's a virtue, it's a good thing to describe someone else\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nIt means patient\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nThat's how I'd describe her\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nLong suffering\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nYeah, no, it's very flattering\n\n01:07:05.000

words are?\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nYeah\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nI am\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nA Bible\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nI am a Bible\n\n01:07:27.000 -->

01:15:35.000\nI'm on number two\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nYou have to wait\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nThere's nobody here, but you still have to wait\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nUh\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nI just wanted some pickles, man\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nWhat do you sell? Pickles\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nHow much do you rent this place for?\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nHow much do I rent this place?\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nI own this spot\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nThis is my place in 1942\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nThat's depressing\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nIt's not depressing\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nIt's surprising\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nOh, it's both\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nA little for me, I guess\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nWhat kind of pickles do you want?\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nThe pickled kind\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nThe kind that you would soak in a brine\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nI don't do that\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nI only set pickles on fire with my mind\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nThe kind that used to be cucumbers\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nSo like, cooked ones is what you have?\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nSo when I set the cucumbers on fire\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nOne hour later\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nAlright\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nWhat kind of pickles do you want?\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nYou're allergic to penicillin also?\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nYeah, I have this rash that won't go away\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nI'm scratching myself\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nThis small business owner is allergic to penicillin\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nI heard it from his mouth\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nOh, well then\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nWe ought to take you off the line\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nOh\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nI don't want to mess anything up\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nNo, it's your duty to report such things\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nSee, that's what I thought\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nYeah\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nWe have a couple of trouble makers\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nOfficer O'Malley\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nOh, hey Stacey, how are you?\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nJust doing my beat\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nAnd I heard some fracas\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nTurns out we got a penicillin allergy over here\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nOfficer O'Malley, it sounds like\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nYour wife's got your balls in a vice\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nYour voice is very falsetto\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nI'm doing what most of the people do\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nBack at the precinct, which is make fun of my\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nHigher register voice\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nI like to think that I overcompensate\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nFor it with good police work\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nBut it's good to see you jumping out a pretty easy\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nBandwagon\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nYeah, remember what they told us\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nIn Ireland\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nIf it's easy to say what you're saying\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nIt ain't brave\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nAlright, well I'm not a creative, I'm a cop\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nI'm gonna go ahead and move along\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nAnd you deal with these two young men\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nThat was weird\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nBack to the pickles\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nWhat kind of pickles do you want?\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nYou seem awfully obtuse about this\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nCan you just get some regular mustard pickles\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nI heard about you, you want my shop, don't you?\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nI don't\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nYes you do, don't lie to me\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nDon't lie to me, I got the pickles\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nI just think that asparagus\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nMuch like\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nThe white, blonde, blue-eyed race\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nWhich I hope to one day be a part of\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nIs\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nIs\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nJust so superior\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nI am white with blue eyes, what are you trying to say?\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nI'm color blind, I don't see race\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nWell I'm white with blue eyes\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nI believe you\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nBut\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nI'm very trusting\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nWhich some people think is a character flaw\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nI feel like you shouldn't take advantage of me\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nI want to bring asparagus\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nTo the people in the most\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nHealthy\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nAnd excrementally stinky way\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nBecause I think it's important\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nWhat do you think smells better, pickles or asparagus?\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nIn or out?\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nIn\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nWell, pickles for sure\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nPickles coming out, probably\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nWhat a day\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nWhat a day, fortunately\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nGod was watching\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nAnd God took note\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nOf the rest of what happened that day\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nAnd now we'll hear from him\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nAnd he will tell us\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nWhat happened\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nGod?\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nIt's funny you should mention that\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nBecause almost immediately\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nYou know\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nThe white, blue-haired, blue-eyed guy\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nIs\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nTyrokinesis went crazy\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nAnd exploded the world\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nThat's really a shame\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nWhat a story\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nThat's all these sounds about right\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nAlright, let's have a hand\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nShame and Austin\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nAlright\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nI think we've rung them dry\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nThey should take a seat\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nAnd reap the benefits of their\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nLet's give them a hand everybody\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nShame and Austin\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nHarmontown\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nHarmontown\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nWe really\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nSir, do you have a question?\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nWhen you were doing the movie\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nWas there anything you wanted to cut out?\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nWe really\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nWrote those guys hard\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nThey\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nThey earned it\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nGiving Dan Harmon a hug guys\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nI feel like this guy doesn't work hard enough\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nAt the bakery\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nAt the Panini shop\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nHe's getting high fives all the way up the aisle\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nHis grandma fucking\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nRiding him in that vegetable garden\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nPick more\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nBasil\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nShame\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nNailed it\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nHahaha\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nUncaring\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nThat's what gardening is\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nIn a day of a gardener\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nWhat would you do?\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nShame's going\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nHis grandma's like I'm so happy you came\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nIs the dirt tilled?\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nShame, you're the person in charge of the garden\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nI'm going to till the dirt\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nAnd then I'm going to poke holes in it\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nDrop seeds in the holes, cover over the holes with dirt\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nWait for the seeds to grow into germinated things\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nPut water on them\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nThe plants are already grown\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nIf it's a vegetable gardener, you're just coming in for maintenance\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nThat's all he does is water the grass\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nThat's what he said\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nIs it clapgrass or regular grass?\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nAustralian\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nChlamydia grass\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nIf that's real, I would immediately get chlamydia\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nBecause clapgrass just\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nsounds fun\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nYou know\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nCome to this park, there's a bunch of clapgrass\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nAlright\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nHey Spencer, are you\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nAlright\n\n01:21:31.000 -->

equipped\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nFor whatever\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nSo we got\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nA Dignity Starzgard\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nWe got me\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nAgile Play\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nQuark, I assume\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nAnd we would need a\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nChris de Burgh\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nWe have to\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nIt'll have to be based on more than\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nJust plain desire\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nI want to figure out how to\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nWhat to base it on\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nHow about this guy whose question\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nOh, that guy's in a weekly Pathfinder game\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nOh, you're like an expert role player?\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nHe didn't say that\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nNobody wants to say that\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nAnd then come up and play\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nDoesn't that just make you an associate path?\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nI can be anyone\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nBut you can help us get back on track\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nAlright, you come on up, sir\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nYour zeal alone\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000\nShould propel you to the stars\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nSee ya\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nWhat is your name, sir?\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nMatt A.J.H\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nYeah, I've seen this guy before\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nMatt's in a weekly Pathfinder game of his own\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nAlright\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nIs there anything we didn't cover?\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nWe covered Ebola\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nMass transit\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nThat cable car thing\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nIs amazing\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nI was here for my Bachelorette party\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nA couple weeks ago\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nI fucked the bridge\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nAmazing\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nYeah\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nWe covered it all\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nEbola and dick piercing\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nAnd mass transit\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nAnd feminism\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nI hesitate to ask\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nBut do you want to hit Gamergate real quick?\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nI do not want to hit Gamergate\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nIf I'm obligated to ask\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nI've been trying to read up on that\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nAnd I continue to read up on it\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nI find it very fascinating\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nAnd I don't dismiss it at all\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nAnd I did not dismiss it\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nAnd I don't dismiss not dismissing it\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nI think it's amazing\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nThat this new generation\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nIs able to create\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nKind of whirlpools\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nAnd I'm not even dismissing it\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nBy saying that\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nYou're 41 and you go\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nThat is\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nYou can't get through that\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nYou can't just be a casual person\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nComing through an issue\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nAnd get from one side of it to the other\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nAnd grab a drink from the bar\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nAnd come back through it\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nYou will be on one side or the other\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nWhatever those sides are\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nIn this issue\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nWe've done it at outrage\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nWe've gotten really good at\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nAt shaming each other\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nAnd you can't\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nYou can't say much of anything\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nWithout\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nThere's always going to be the possibility\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nOf just like\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nA huge group of people\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nLike really on your shit\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nYou already lost someone\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nNo, she's\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nShe hates Gamergate\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nShe works in Shamesguard\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nOr Shames\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nShift in the morning\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nDon't let the last sounds of her leaving\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000\nBe that we've branded her a Gamergator\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nShe hates it\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nYeah, I had to\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nAs a 41 year old I had to get out my little\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nBifocals and read Gamergator articles\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nJust at three times\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nAnd try to figure out like what's the gate\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nAnd where's the gate thing\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nYou can't even say that because then someone will go\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nLike you said there's no gate\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nFuck you\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nI don't care\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nYou said you don't care\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nYeah\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nYou couldn't even say something like\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nFor instance like\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nI'm not going to say it\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nHere we go\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nI was about to say something\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nAnd I know you can't actually say it\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nI'm going to wait for it to blow over\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nHow's that?\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nDoes that make you a bad person?\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nThat's fine\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nLet's see if Gamergate's worth it's salt\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nLet's see if it can last another three months\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nAnd then I'll weigh in\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nYeah, it can\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nIt's just a 15 year old\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nWhat's happening you guys?\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nEveryone's just\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nIt's just 15 year olds\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nIt's 4chan baby\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nIt's all kids\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nYou just got your credit cards hacked\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nI've been dying to see\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nI've been dying to see these character sheets\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nAnd to see what's on there for a long time\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nJust lies\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000\nIt's all lies\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nJust peanut butter and spit\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nThat's just yours Erin\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nNot a joke\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nYeah\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nThere are a few\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nUnfortunate very drunk shows that we've had\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nWhere\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nJust like that\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nCollected some stuff\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nGamergator hacked your microphone\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nSo\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nThere's a rope in the street\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nAnd it pulls the car\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nIt pulls the car up a hill\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nLike a wagon\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nAnd then it's a cable\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nOkay, it's not a rope, that's dismissive\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nI'm sorry\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nThere's hooks on the\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nRight\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nAnd the cable is\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nSort of like a ski lift\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nIn principle\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nAnd so it's kind of like\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nDo you\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nReverse it at the\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nAt a certain time\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nAt the bottom of the hill\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nLike an escalator\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nDan, have you ever ridden one?\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nNo, I've never been in one\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nHow late do they run?\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nForever\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nIt's like an Andy Kaufman show\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nWe'll talk about cookies and milk\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nNot a trolley\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nIt's not like an oscillating thing\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nIt goes up and then it goes back down\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nOh, it goes around\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nOkay, cool, got it\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nWow, I have so much to learn about cable cars\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nThere's a museum\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nAnd guess what\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nIt's boring\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nNo, cable gate\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nIt's not boring\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nIt's only boring to women\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nMy period gets in the way of having fun\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nBut\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nOh boy, all these hormones\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nWhat, cables?\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nGive me chocolate, bring me to a chocolate museum\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nOn a Monday\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nMaybe\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nMaybe that museum's for me\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nMaybe I'm like the one guy that museum's been\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nWaiting for\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nI have a lot of questions about cable cars\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nI kind of love it\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nI want a cable car\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nNo one said anything\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nJust let him monologue forever\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nAll right, I'll get a Tesla\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nAll right, some D&D\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nYou need a theme song?\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nI don't know, it sounds like Dustin has music\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nDustin has music\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nI'm going to give Dustin 60 seconds\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nSo let's just fill\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nLet's do some word associations\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nCable car\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nPulley trolley\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nHot dog\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nBun, man, cancer\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nBut, pole\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nWhy am I doing two words?\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nCave\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nMustard\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nMustard seed\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nHow's Dustin doing?\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nAll right, well, we could go acapella\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nI mean\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nSure, sure\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nWhen we last met\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nOur heroes had finally escaped\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nFrom Rose Book\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nAfter defeating Admiral Dark\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nAfter defeating Father Tinder\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nAnd dodging the city guards\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nThe gang piled into Dignity's horse\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nAnd they charged the police blockade\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nBreaking out of the town\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nFreed but without direction\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nOur heroes came across a small hill\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nWith a window\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nPeering into the window\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nQuark spied a showering lady\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nAnd framed her\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nBut after a terrible excuse\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nThe gang entered her home\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nThey shared some awkward conversation\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nBefore leaving\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nBut when they left\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nThey encountered a crippled fire elemental\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nAnd although they started in anger and rage\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nThey came to an understanding\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nAnd left the fire elemental alone\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nBut not before Quark burned his dick off\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nBut where would the gang go?\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nWhat would they do?\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nHow would they get to the air city?\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nDid they even care about getting there?\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nFind out next\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nOn an all new\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nHarmontown\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nAll right, so you guys\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nYou guys are on the main road\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nHeading out of Rose Book\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nThe path this main road is winding its way\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nMeandering through the rolling grassy\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nHills of the landscape\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nGently to the northeast\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nThis is the path Sharpie decided\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nTo go down after he\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nYou guys said that you couldn't go farther\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nInto the swamp and then you left the lady\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nAnd you didn't want to go back to town\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nSo you're just like, I'm going down this road\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nThat's where you are\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nI've been pushing the limit\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nI've been testing the limits of like\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nCan you actually just make Spencer\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nTurn\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nYou can't\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nI know I can, but I'll regret it\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nI don't know, I'll regret it\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nIf I couldn't\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nYou'd be, you know\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nIt would be because you were a tyrant\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nYou're not a tyrant\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nYou're a benevolent, impersonal cosmic force\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nThat's why I did this\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nYou will allow me to walk west\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nIn one direction forever\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nI will encounter cacti and\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nSwamps\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nTo the west\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nBut if I really want to enjoy myself\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nI gotta go back to your narrative\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nWell that's not even necessarily true\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nYou just have to create your own narrative\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nI will\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nSo are we still close to the town\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nCan we see the town from where we are?\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nYeah, it's pretty far off in the distance\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nBut you can still see it\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nIt's one of the only landmarks\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nIn this kind of hilly area\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nI'm curious, can we tell whether Darkstar\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nHas gotten through the shield\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nAnd the town is being totally destroyed\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nDarkstar was actually chasing you guys down\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nBut then he saw something happening\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nOver at the town and then he left\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nThere was the skeletons climbing\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nThe forest field and then they disappeared\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nIn a flash\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nThat upset Darkstar\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nYou think it might have had something to do\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nWith that necromancer frost giant\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nBut he's miles away\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nBoy, that dot, I'm not connecting\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nThe necromancer frost giant\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nYeah, I know, the plot, it just happens\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nWait, but what\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nWhat I'm saying to you is\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nI don't recall, obviously\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nIt's not a big surprise that I'm always drunk\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nWhen we're playing, I don't recall any actual\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nOver connections between\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nThe necromancer frost giant and that stuff\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nYeah, that would be me a narrator\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nExplaining things that you the characters\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nWould have no knowledge of\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nI didn't say anything about that\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nBut you just did now\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nSo I thought Darkstar was\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nStill going into the city\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nAnd just chasing you guys saw the thing\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nTook off\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nGentlemen, I think that we should head\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nTo the air city\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nSeems like the right idea\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nCocoa is pointed in this direction\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nAnd like I always say, horses know best\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000\nWe know the rest\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nYou do always say that\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nThose skeletons back at the city\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000\nThey remind me of that frost giant\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nThank you for sharing\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000\nYour feelings of association\n\n01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nLet's go to the air city\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nThey remind you of the frost giant\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nThe shards of power, the frost giant\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nWanted the\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nAdmiral\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nStarsguard\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nSo we gave, so you got killed\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nBy the frost giant necromancer\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nAnd then we gave him the shard\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nWe gave him the shards\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nWe keep giving shards away\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nAnd Father Tender also had a shard\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nHe did, but it might have vanished\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nIn the scuffle\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nLooking for shards is looking to accrue shards\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nGot a feeling that Admiral Darkstar\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nGetting all those shards ain't best for anybody\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nI pull Sharpie aside\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nYes\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nSir, is something going on\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nWith you beneath the surface\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nYou seem to be questioning everything we're doing\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nAnd I am not well versed\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nIn the way of emotions or feelings\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nBut it seems that this is\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nPertinent\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nSometimes I feel like someone's controlling me\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nThat may or may not be an alcoholic\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nAnd so I have blackouts\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nWhere I am motivated\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nBy different things\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nSometimes I\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nBecome conscious\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nAnd I'm halfway down a road that I ran down\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nOut of defiance of nothing\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nThen I'm a little more sober\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nI don't know\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nI'm going to ask you the question\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nI ask myself every morning in a puddle\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nWhat do you want out of this day?\n\n01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nI don't want the world\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000\nTo be destroyed by Admiral Darkstar\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nI say, hey, what are you guys talking about over there?\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nWhat are our obligations?\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nI mean, what are we doing\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nIf we're not saving the world\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nIf Admiral Darkstar is going to accrue power\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nAnd become a more powerful admiral\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nWith darker stars\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nSo it seems like a great idea\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nLong term for us to take out Darkstar\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nWe've been fighting him for two years now\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nAnd dignity\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nThis is your town\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nAnd it's being swarmed over by skeletons\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nYou know me better than I know me\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nSo should we not, while we're here\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nGo kick the asses of the things\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nThat are trying to destroy your town?\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nI think that is an excellent idea\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nThat's a great idea\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nSharpie, let's do it!\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nLet's fight!\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nAnd I promise, no matter what happens from now on\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nI'm really going to understand\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nWhy are you doing it?\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nI lift Quark up from between his legs\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nWhich now is nothing\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nAnd put him on my shoulder\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nLike a wishbone\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nWhere my dick used to be really burns\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nBe careful\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nI just want to carry you, little one\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nSo you ride back towards the town\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nAnd you can't help but notice\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nA conspicuous lack of skeletons\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nAs if they'd all disappeared\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nYou get closer to the town\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nAnd you see\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nSmall piles of ash\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nNot skeleton size\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nBut just small piles of ash\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nThat seems to be the only sign\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nThat any creatures or anything\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nHave been around the town\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nObviously it's still protected by this barrier\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nIs it like in the Batman movie\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nWhere the people are dehydrated?\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nNah, nah\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nAre these piles of ash outside the town?\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nYeah, you haven't entered the town\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nPhysically as of yet\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nBut you're not skeleton size\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nThe piles of ash\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nYou're saying we don't think these piles of ash\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nAre the skeletons disintegrated\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nDo we hear screaming and mayhem\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nAnd the sound of combat?\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nIt's all peace, you don't see any skeletons\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nJust this ash business\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nAnd the dome protecting rose book\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nFrom all evil\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nWe did it, guys\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nAs we were leaving\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nI saw the skeletons disappear\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nI think it was like a\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nAnd that angel\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nThe Yoshi angel dark star figures\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nGone too\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nAnd are we able to enter the city?\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nYeah, if you want\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nBut you did like escape\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nFrom police\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nLet's get the fuck out of here\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nThere's no one to fight\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nLet's go\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nIt's important to have these moments\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000\nQuickly before we go\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nCan I examine the piles\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000\nOf ash and see if there's anything\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nTo that?\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nYeah, you examine the piles of ash\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nAnd they seem not to be ash at all\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nBut actually really finely crushed up\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nOnyx dust that's a gemstone\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nAssociated with necromancy\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nAs well as teleportation magic\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nInteresting, I wonder who could have sent\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nLegions of skeletons\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nWell, the cross giant\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000\nI already had a feeling that he was involved\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nGentlemen\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nThese piles are deposits that are the\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nResidual result of teleportation magic\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nOn the part of a necromancing\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nFrost giant\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nOr just dumped, he's done using them\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nThey're no longer valuable, maybe he got\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nHe was able to get the shard\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nI thought\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nThat dark star was commanding the skeletons\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nIt sounds like either dark star\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nAnd this guy are working together\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nThe necromancer, they didn't seem to be aligned\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nIn the past\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nWhy are you looking at me?\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nThe face that people are looking at me\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nLike I'm supposed to do something\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nI don't think there's any way that the frost giant\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nIs in league with dark star, these are too big\n\n01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nYou can't have a solar system\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nWith two suns, nothing I know what a solar system is\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nBut\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nThey're both giant ash holes\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nThat'll stop at nothing\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nTo get fucking dumb ass shards\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nI've run across both of them\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nI don't think they would work together\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nI start gathering up the Onyx dust\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nAnd I put it in my backpack\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nYou do that\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000\nYou gather up several dusts\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nAlright, we got to figure out what to do\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nOkay, so the skeletons showed up\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nThe skeletons have sailed the city\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000\nIt's like, and I remember\n\n01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nDark star going like\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nAnd then getting mad and leaving\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nIt's like the skeletons showed up\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nThe skeletons represent the frost giant\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000\nThey showed up, then they disappeared\n\n01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nThen Admiral Darkstar disappeared\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000\nIf we really wanted to get into the fray\n\n01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000\nI reckon that means\n\n01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nIt's back at the\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nIce frost giant's city\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nI don't know why we'd want to go there\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000\nBut\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000\nExcept to save the world, eventually\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nBut it would have to be in a really unlikely way\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nBecause we're not an army of skeletons\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nOr a giant or a\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nHorrible, powerful wizards\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nWe're just a ragtag group\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nOf occasional rapists\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nAnd murderers\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nYou know what lies within us?\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nThe souls of rapists and murderers\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nSkeletons\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nWe are a small army of\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nSkeletons\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nWhat?\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nBut we have more than bones\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000\nWe have heart\n\n01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000\nWe have lungs\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nIt's literally a sense of adventure\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000\nWe've also leveled up a lot\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nSince the last time we fought that guy\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000\nI have, but I always lose track of my spells\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000\nYeah, you're outside the city\n\n01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nI charge a gallop with\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000\nCoco into\n\n01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000\nThe city to just see\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nWhat the climate is\n\n01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nThere's\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nPeople, you know, just busy\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nPeople living their lives\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nThere's occasional guards standing\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nAround there noticing your\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000\nHorse and pointing at you\n\n01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nAnd starting to yell and grab\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nTorches\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nCan I look through my blood book\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000\nFor teleportation stuff?\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nI use diplomacy\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nAnd I approach the villager with\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nThe most interesting accent\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nAlright\n\n01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nTeleport, there's no teleporting\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nIn that blood book, I'm afraid\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000\nScoops were wanted by the law\n\n01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000\nIn that town\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nYeah, you find this guy with the accent\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000\nAnd he's like, you ran me over with the horse\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nWhen we were trying to find you because\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nI'm sorry, sir, I was looking for somebody else\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nYou're gonna have to stop\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nGet off that horse there\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nAlright, I use diplomacy\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000\nAnd I say\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000\nNo, sorry, just\n\n01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000\nWanted to apologize again\n\n01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000\nAnd goodbye, I'm gonna go\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nWhat's the opposite way that we're going?\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000\nUh, east at the moment\n\n01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000\nOh, but I shouldn't lie\n\n01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nI just\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000\nI kiss the air a million times\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000\nConfusively, and I make a fart noise\n\n01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nAnd I say Friday's at six\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nAnd I just gallop out\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nWhat's uh\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nI feel like that's like\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nPerformance or something\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000\nReally, you think that's a performance?\n\n01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000\nIt's certainly not diplomacy\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000\nI'm Christopher, I have performance\n\n01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000\nI'll start playing the wire saw\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000\nPlaying the wire saw\n\n01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000\nIt makes her diplomacy\n\n01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000\nSeem a lot more so\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000\nThank you\n\n01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nYou managed to get out of there\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000\nOkay\n\n01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nI consult my\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000\nGem of audience talking to\n\n01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nBecause I'm
