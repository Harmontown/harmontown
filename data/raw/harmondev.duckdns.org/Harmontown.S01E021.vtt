00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Harmontown is once again in session, everybody.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Oh, yeah.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
That's right.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Welcome once again to Hollywood, California, the Nerdmelt Theater.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
And thank you for listening out there in Podcast Universe.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Please put your hands together for the groove master, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Freestylin', freestylin', rappin' wild, rappin' wild.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Freestylin', not rhymin', rappin' wild, rappin' wild.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Yo, freestyle, freestyle, freestyle.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
I saw your mama saw her the other day.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Saw your mama, I supported the gays.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I saw your mama, I told her that.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
She said, fuck them. What'd you think about that?

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Your mama's not an advocate. She doesn't think they should vote.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Or get married.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
I said, bitch.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
It's politically hairy. You're in California.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
You gotta be open-minded.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
And here's what your mama said.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
She said, you know what?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I didn't find that to be the case.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And she started rattling off all kinds of right-wing bullshit at me.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I fucked your mama.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
That was a little bit of a...

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I felt like that was a little bit of a...

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I don't know, what do you call that?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I felt like it was a little bit of a...

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It's experimental.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
That was kind of a populist smoke, I think, I was spewing there.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I knew my crowd. I knew where they land.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I mean, yeah, I think what we're doing right now is, you know,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
we have a giant tour coming up that's looming.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
And are we recording?

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I hope you can hear the sound of the crickets that are in this building.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Actual literal crickets.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
If you ever want to really just lay a stinker of a joke out there,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
the crickets will be there to add high relief.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm kind of excited, and I don't mean this sarcastically.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
I really am excited about how already, I think we just kind of started in earnest,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
to sort of think of this as a movie that we're going to be shooting

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
about the tour that we're going on.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
And the big question is, like, how do you shoot a movie about a tour that you're going on?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
How do you shoot a movie about anything?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
If there's no script and all these things, you bring cameras,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
and you hope not to affect anything.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
But it's like already our awesome director, Neal,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
who does not want to be spoken about on camera.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
So this will not be in the movie.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
But he's like Bob Vila already, but when that camera came out,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
I was like, rip that curtain down.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
But that curtain is the thing that, stand by the light, get over there,

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
it's good, like I'm more comfortable knowing that I'm in the hands of someone

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
who's not, like if I say something particularly profound by the refrigerator.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Which is almost, I don't want to find out later that if I had stepped three inches back,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I would have looked awesome and sounded awesome.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
So he's like, move, and it's like, it's definitely going to affect everything,

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
which is kind of an interesting thing, because if it wasn't, it would be weird.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
But it wasn't affecting everything. We had to rip that curtain that was starting the show.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
That curtain's there to block light from the comic book store, from spilling into here.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
It's also to block your vision of me, because we go by the bridal rules of what constitutes.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
If you see me before the show, the mystique is blown.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Most of you are responding for most of these nights to like,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
well, is that what he looks like?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
He's so beautiful.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
He's hard as a rock.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
It's just a special day.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Apparently that curtain was also there to keep crickets out of the building.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah, I'm a little embarrassed about the crickets.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
We have to get a microphone on those crickets, so we can just add cricket sounds.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Do you have a lot of art imitating life, imitating art, imitating things?

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
It's going to be very exciting to just get in a bus and go for 20 days and 20 nights.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
I never understood that expression. Why do you have to add that there's no, nothing has ever,

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
like, what is that from menorah times?

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Is there like a Jewish thing that happened where something happened for eight days

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
that didn't happen for eight nights, and that was a miracle, and we need to keep track of that,

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
so every else, like your bank tells you, well, this is for eight days and eight nights.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
This isn't a fucking menorah.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm making up the menorah thing. I'm just grabbing it, something that might have...

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
See, I always think of it, because I got to guest-announce at Price is Right for a couple months,

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
and you and a guest will go to Cancun, Mexico for three days and four nights.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
You're covered on the water slide, Parks, for the last two days, but fuck if you're getting a hotel.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
That's where the expression comes from. It's a capitalist expression.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
We never had to differentiate days and nights until they started costing money.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
Six $80 days and four $80 nights.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
You know, out of pocket, you can do whatever you want, Gladys.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
That's the typical Price is Right winner, I'm sure.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Uh-oh.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
No, I just do that to hope that I come up with something else to say.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
AIDS. AIDS. Who's aware of AIDS?

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Scraping the barrel.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Who has it?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Oh boy, those Muppet movies, overrated.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
That new Batman movie stinks.

05:38.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, what you should be asking yourself is why a bad guy would sound like this.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Seems counter-torner.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
I realize I'm the last person to see this movie, and I'm so thankful for that.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
What movie are you talking about?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Batman's Risings.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
That's my new form of protest.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I figured out old people because I'm becoming one of them.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
That's why they do it. They're doing it to fuck with you.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
What are you watching at?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Like you're wearing a Nike shirt.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
What are you, Nick?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Is that your name on your shirt?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Nick?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Says Nike.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Nike?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
What? It's a kind of shoe.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
What do you work for them? I don't get it.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I don't get anything. That's my protest.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
It's kind of cool.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
It's a lot less energy and a lot more result because you just thrive on all the young people going,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Fuck you!

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Fuck you!

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
No, I could explain it to fuck you, old man.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
You don't get bubble gum?

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Are you going to, if you're chewing it, why don't you swallow it?

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
You know what? I'll wait till you figure it out.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Maybe you'll get your big break one day, bubble gum.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Sounds like a great idea.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Candy, you don't swallow. Good. Call me in the morning.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
I got to figure out this goddamn Tivo.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Well, if nightrider's on when it's on, why do I got to wait for it?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
That's going to be me.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
It's already me.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
What was I talking about?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
AIDS.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
It's a bitch AIDS.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
It'll kill you.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
In seconds.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
You were talking about Batman, somebody.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
And it's contagious through air.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I'm making it up.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Don't listen to me.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Batman sucks, also.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
But hey, I'm the guy that said you could get AIDS by breathing.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
What do I know?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Make your own opinion.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
Or if you want to make your opinion based on fear, listen to this guy.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
My name's Bane.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm the villain for 90% of Batman Rising.

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
This is the voice you'll be expected to fear for most of the movie.

08:04.000 --> 08:13.000
A lot of people have pointed out that I sound like Daryl Hammond's Sean Connery.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
Still others postulate I'm a dog poem era Jimmy Stewart.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
In any case, not a villainous sounding man.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Can I hear some villainous dog poem?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Could you do a villain, Jimmy Stewart, Batman dog poem?

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
My old friend comes to me.

08:36.000 --> 08:47.000
After rabbit chasing dreams.

08:47.000 --> 08:57.000
I reach down and can still feel his now dead hair.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
This is a work in progress.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm workshopping this.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
I haven't for my dog just died.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Thought you'd appreciate the passion.

09:08.000 --> 09:18.000
If you want something overworked, go down the street to E.E. Cummings.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Gets to a point where you're using exclamation points in your poem.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Figure you've been thinking about it too much.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Figured my dog died.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You might want to fucking hear about it.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Fuck me, I'll leave the tonight show.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
No, wild stuff, stay.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
Oh, yes!

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Hey, it's Doc Severza.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
All of you are out, you're all out.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
You're like, what part of Arsenio is this?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
That's nostalgia for you, it was the woof-woofs.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I worshiped Johnny Carson.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I actually predate, when I was a kid and I was watching people perform for people,

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
my first hero, I believe, was Johnny Carson in terms of coming out and talking to people.

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
I was right on the bubble because I was probably 10 or 11 when Letterman got his show

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
and it was this young, spry, weirdo with this gap in his teeth and bright red hair

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
and wrestling shoes and dunking himself in one or with Alka-Seltzer suits on and stuff.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
You guys know the drill.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
You're required to know a certain amount of comedy history.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
We weren't actually there at what I call comedy stock.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
It was that one episode where he dunked himself with Alka-Seltzer.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It's probably the worst episode of Letterman ever.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I don't know.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Can we get back on track?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I want to streamline tonight.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Stand target.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
I don't want to get off on a lot of tangents tonight.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
But I love Johnny Carson and I used to put on little shows and I would tap my little pencil

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
and I had a thermos cup lid and if it was Mother's Day, instead of giving my mom a Mother's Day gift,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
I would put on a Mother's Day show and I would say it's a Mother's Day show

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
and then I would sit there and I would just emulate Johnny Carson and I would tap my pencil.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
My mom's in back right now, just drunk off her.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
You can hear her stumbling around.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
She did not take to LA well.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
She found out there's more than margaritas.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
She's six smack sheets to the wind.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
I don't know drug terminology.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I think smack comes in sheets.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Is she a heroin using sailor?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
She does a mellow.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
She just shoots up.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
This is like Kenny Loggins on the marina.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
So I don't know where I'm going with that.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I used to perform.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
And then I realized at a certain point, well this is very difficult.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
It was our documentary crew stumbling around the chairs maybe.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
That's funny too.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
We should have a documentary crew following the documentary crew.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
Don't start. I'll get fired.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Enough of that.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Let's do something for the nice people for once in a while.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
Let's pretend someone's watching other than a person that makes shows.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
You elitist meta asshole.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Enough.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
I don't want to go to the museum and see paintings of frames.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So clever Dan Harmon.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
You're so goddamn clever.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Oh a painting of a thing that's supposed to be around a pet.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Oh maybe I'm part of that.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Actually that's pretty cool.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I should give that an M.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
What do you think the final product is going to be?

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
When you and I have come home, there's been two attempts in our lives.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
We will have gone through a lot together.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
What do you think the final product is?

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
Obviously it's in the hands of our shy Neil Berkeley director who doesn't want to be mentioned.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Yet we will persist in mentioning him as often as possible.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Shy in front of the camera but a real George S. Patton behind it.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
No son of a bitch don't!

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
This curtain goes!

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I had to talk him into doing the movie again.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
After he came up here, it took three Amstels to get him to really actually say,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
No I'm doing it.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Because he came and saw the show.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
He had a yes.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Frankly yes.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
But no he didn't say as much.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I'm insecure obviously.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I think he's insecure.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Conversation between two guys whose job is to try to receive people and figure them out.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
It was like taking two saucers and trying to make them stick.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
We need the China wear equivalent of a penis in here.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Or we need to start mixing metaphors.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
But I don't want to insult women by saying we were two vaginas.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Scissoring.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
I just want to edit all this out of the movie.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
Also I think what it all came down to is I had to promise him,

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
It's your movie.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I'm not the kind of guy that's going to go,

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
Hey okay so remember when we got our drive through food and it was wrong.

14:14.000 --> 14:23.000
And I just revealed that my true feelings about just all black people.

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
Is there any way you could change the N word to N word?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Instead of the N word?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Because it just doesn't, I don't think, you don't think it's going to make a good movie?

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
No I'm sure it'll make a good movie for you but I would really like to be able to go back home

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
and get to Marco.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
Well I'm looking at whatever this kind of film equivalent of a Pulitzer is.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
No but he's, she should be allowed to.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
It's got to be a word within the comp.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
It must be.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
It's got to be some kind of word for a film award.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
This is going to work well on the road.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
When I can't think of what state we're in.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Where are we? New Mexico and Phoenix people just get over and rape me.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
We're not going to have any time to be in any of these towns.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
We're going to be in Nashville, Tennessee and we will have seen nothing.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
We will be on stage and we might as well be here.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
So when I go out in Phoenix on January 10th like I'm going to go,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Okay think of something Phoenix related, get them on your side and I'm going to go,

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
Hey birds should stay on fire.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
You know what you do?

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
They shouldn't be, they shouldn't be ashes and they're all going to go.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
You know what you do?

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
We should think of the list of the cities we know we're going to.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Ask if anybody here is from there or has lived there.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
And get some sweet little local nuggets.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Alright.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Anybody from Arizona here? See?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
We're going through the curtain at night on this tour.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
What I was thinking is like, is there a way to train?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Like can I train?

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
The two things that make me the most phobic are like audience reaction.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Like I'm used to these guys.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
They love each other.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
They love me.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
They're very good people.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
And they're racist.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
They're from Los Angeles.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
They share a culture.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I've lived here for 15 years or more.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
And I don't know.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
They're my people.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
We're in the back of a comic book store.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Like then you know something's going to be fundamentally different.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Besides just barometric pressure, which is a huge thing.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It's not to be quibbled with.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I've been in Denver.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I got a nosebleed at the airport.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
And I forgot to take the pot out of my girlfriend's purse.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And we were there for an extra six hours.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
It was like, all because of the little, little, little altitude.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
And I wasn't performing.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
I was just trying to get some pot back home.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
Now do you know that there's a hard, fast rule that you cannot take a shit on the tour bus?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
You know that, right?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
That's a rule.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
I mean, I know that Dave Matthews Band broke that rule.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I heard that story about the Dave Matthews Band.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Like, I guess there's a hose that comes off the bus.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
It's like a poop hose that you can just like, I don't know, the tour manager.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Like, just was like, all right, we're breaking a minor rule.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
But there's so much poop in there.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I mean, it's the Dave Matthews Band.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
They work hard.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
They poop harder.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Oh, I've heard that music.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's some of this pressure off.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Let's give the kids a break.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
They've earned it.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And they just kind of hit the release valve.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
And I guess it just sprayed all over some, some boat passing by where a guy was like,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
here's another thing, huh?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
They were going over the river.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
There was a ferry underneath it.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
And they emptied it and hit all those people on the ferry.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
My description was pretty accurate.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
She said they were on the Chicago, there was a Chicago river and they were on a bridge

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
and they dumped it over the bridge and they said, hey, ferry, it landed on the ferry.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Yeah.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
Or as I call it, a record release by the Dave Matthews Band.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Hit all over your head.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
They did, they did set one Dave Matthews record.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Those people will all be remembering that release for years.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Dave Matthews Band and Blues Traveler can get in a fucking boat and die.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
They're the fucking worst.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
No, no.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Stand up Blues Traveler supporters.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Show yourself.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Adam Goldberg, I knew that.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
You fucking.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yes.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Praise her Caesar.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Did you, did you see the weird stance that Adam just made?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm going to, I'm going to do.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't know how to differentiate weird from not weird stances with that.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm going to just, I'm going to describe it first and then do it.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
He did.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Adam stood up and did that.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
He stood up for the Dave Matthews Band.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
And then, and then while people jeered, he, he did a stance that I'm going to the label

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
and diagnose.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I'll come up if you want me to come up.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
He went, he went.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
So, so do the, do the Dave Matthews thing and then I'll stand up and be Adam Goldberg

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
and do what he did.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Dave Matthews can go fuck themselves.

18:55.000 --> 19:06.000
You kind of, you kind of did like Peter Pan flying like waiting for the wires to do their trick.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Kind of a snack.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
You same bolts in the starting blocks.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Ready to come up.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
All right.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Maybe later, Adam.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Wait, so, wait, Dave Matthews.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
I'm not saying it's, you can't poop on the tour bus because you're not supposed to release

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
it on tourist's heads as you're going over.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Everyone's in the bathroom.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
No, no, because you live on a bus and you poop on a bus and it smells like poop forever

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
for the rest of the trip.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
There's no going backwards from that.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
You are now living in a Chevron men's restroom and you're not supposed to do it.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
You have to ask the driver to pull over and say, I'm going to go make it, you know, make

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
a tutu.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Can they make a tutu?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
I don't know.

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
We got to make Saskatchewan by 1300 to her talk.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
But I got to make a tutu.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
A tutu is going to have to make a kazoo.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
When we get to, when we get to Flagstaff.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
He's bounding down loaded with a van trucker.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
He thinks Saskatchewan's in the US.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I really am that.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I don't.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
I'm about to take my lack of...

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Where do you think Saskatchewan is?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Do you know where Saskatchewan is?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
It's in Canada.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Where though?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Precisely.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
It's right above the US.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I've lived here my whole life.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I know where Saskatchewan is.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
My bed.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
My bed.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
You go like, I was like, Chicago's down, Saskatchewan's up.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
From Milwaukee.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
But for some reason you go through Michigan,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
even though it's also down.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Where's Belgium?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
That's, that's, that's East.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
For sure.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Oh, he's good.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
All right.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
But if you go West long enough, I also know you can go everything's also West.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Because it's like Pac-Man.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I know that you will...

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
It's not the most efficient thing,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
but it could be the most strategic in a pinch.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
You take the, take the tunnel.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Sometimes you got to do it.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Pac-Man fans.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Well, didn't you self-anoint yourself as Pac-Man?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Wasn't that your nickname for a while?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
In the 80s, like how many people, I don't know,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
you don't have to applaud or anything, but like,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
there's like a thing, I think this is like an American thing, like,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
because we're so capitalist and like consumerist,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
whatever you call it, a snobby languageist.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Like, you are defined by what you consume and like,

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
you know, there's not a ton of roller-ranks or anything to it.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
You start buying, you know, you're like,

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
oh, I'm into Shira.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
That's my thing.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Like, I'm the Shira person.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Like, you look for an identity.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I think it's a lot easier.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I think that's why kids seem cooler now.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
It's not just because I'm getting old.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It's because they have like a subscriber base.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
They can just be into like bands that they, you know,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
that a normal kid would never have heard of.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
But now you kind of have to, as a kid, you have to survive.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
You have to kind of pick through scraps and like,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
pick your own bird food.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
You can't just wait for mama to pop in your mouth.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
Dave Matthews in your mouth.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Can't wait for that tour bus to pull up,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
put his hose down here, down your little baby bird billet.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
That's so great.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Hey guys.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
You know.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
You're going to miss this when we're gone.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Yeah.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Yeah, we'll be back.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
Are we going to have a triumphant return back here?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Our last show should be here, right?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
That's what Neil was asking in the green room.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
He was saying like, so you're going on tour.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Neil, who shall remain unnamed.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Neil Berkeley filmmaker.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Mr. Fly on the Wall.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Right.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Mr. Wizard.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Mr. Dumbledore.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Was that the good guy?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
We went through this.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't know the person.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
No tangents.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Zero tangent show tonight.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Zero tangent show.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
We got a lot to talk about.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
He said, he was saying something that was interesting.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I was like, do you, well, do you, you know,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
you're going out on a big 20 city tour or whatever it is.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I keep saying 20.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
I'm making it up.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
But you have an opportunity to come up with a theme at the top of it.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I was like, I think he was just, he wasn't,

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
he didn't really mean that.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
He just knew that that would make me launch into a thing

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
about how the theme wouldn't, we just have to go out there

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and do nothing and hope for the best.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Then he said, this is, I had not considered,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I think this is a valid point.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
He being my dad, if this isn't the movie,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
we'll pretend that it wasn't Neil that said this.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
But I thought it was profound.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
He said, well, what about these people out here?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
You're going to be gone for all that time.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
They're going to be listening to you every night

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
because we're going to podcast.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
We're taking Dustin Marshall, our producer with us out there.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
And we're going to be pumping out the jams every night.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
I don't expect you to listen to it every night,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
but do you guys like nightly jams?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Do you like them pumped out?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
All over your face underneath a bridge?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Yeah.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
That's what we're talking about.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
We're going to Dave Matthews this shit.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
What a word you say.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Don't look up too much.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
What a fairy truth.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Is that one of their songs?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
I don't know if they got it.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Then they get these poor people.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
They start out, if I know my fairy terminology,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
like a fairy takes you from one place to another.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
So you're like, yeah.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
People are just like, well, there's only one way

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
to get from Racine to Sheboygan.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Let's get on this here contraption.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
And so there are people on there with a legitimate,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
they're like, I drove my car into this thing

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
because I prefer driving, thank you.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Oh, father, stop it.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
You're just on a boat for a goddamn minute.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
It's not the Poseidon adventure.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Just relax.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
What's the worst thing you can do?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I don't know why I can't get in my old station wagon

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
and just drive to Sheboygan and stuff.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Sid, will you always do this when we're on?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm just telling you that change is bad.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Oh, brother.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
What a word you say.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Into the remnant.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
How does that help here?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I'm down in Seattle.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Because at least it was like,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
it was like, ZZ Top Shit idea.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah, it's kind of cool.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
It's something for dad to enjoy.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
That was David Lee Roth.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Oh, all right.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Loved Panama.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Lost my virginity to it.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Who's Dave Matthews?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Hey, dad, I'll play something for you.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Well, now I got shit on twice.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Easy target, easy fishing about.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Oh, no, fuck them. They're the worst.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
You know that they had to,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
they were like, fuck, this is not a good dot

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
for people to be able to connect.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
We are now famous for taking a shit on people.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
It's like when you name your show,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
worst show ever.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I'm sure that like, I'm sure.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Everything you and I have said

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
has been well-tilled soiled by comics

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
ever since that happened.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I just don't know, but holy fuck.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Also, in the same boat accident where they all died,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Smash Mouth isn't that boat, too.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Smash Mouth may automatically

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
go fuck off and disappear forever,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
because they're the worst.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Did you ever hear the thing on the YouTube?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You can go on.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
It seems to be systematically

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
like it's getting redacted, but there was a thing.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
First of all, you can hear

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
David Lee Roth doing like,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I can't remember what song it is.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Is it Panama?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
It's David Lee Roth just as vocals.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
That's a very awkward thing

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
to subject a vocal artist to.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Like, that is not there.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Nobody wants to be heard that way necessarily,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
but it just goes to shit.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Like, David Lee Roth's got some pipes.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It's amazing. He sounds silly.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
He sounds like an amazing, silly man

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
with an amazing, silly throat,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
capable of hitting amazing, silly notes,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
and like, is totally into his job

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
and got hired for that job for a reason.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
And there's another one that's exactly like it.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
That's the Smash Mouth guy,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and it's such a fucking like, it's such a trip.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
It's such a bummer.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
If anybody can find that, let's play it.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Can anybody pull it up on their phone

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
and we can play it through the mic right now?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Nah, don't worry about it. Just Google it.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Last week here at the space,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
we called Chevy on the phone.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Chevy Chase.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And asked him, asked him if he could come play.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
He got the voicemail.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
He got his voicemail and left a message asking

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
if he could come play Judges and Dragons

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
with us here this week.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
He called me back promptly the next day

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
and was very, very sweet and cool.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And he and I have always gotten along,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
really? Yeah, I just hated working with him.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I just, I tell you,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
when it comes to like understanding a person,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
like, oh, God help me.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I've never understood a man better.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Just my time with him in the trailer,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
like hearing him like talk about

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
how my show wasn't funny and stuff like that.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
In between that stuff though,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
he was saying things that I understood.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I was like, yeah, I know how you feel.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Like, I don't want to die either.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And I want to punch God in the face

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
and everyone that represents

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
is sloppy work too, you know?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I deserve better than this too.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Like, I, but,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
so he and I have always, I mean,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I honestly, I would,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
do you have his voicemail?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I do use the term loosely,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
but I would call him a friend.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Did you answer the phone or do you have his reply

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
on your phone? Oh, no, no.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
He and I talked for like 20 minutes.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
He, I don't think he knows what voicemail is

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
but I said, I said,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
did you hear the voicemail and he said

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
he was going to go listen to it.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
But I texted him this morning because it was like,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
but he's in New York. He was going to come.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
You should know that he's,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
well, actually that bums you out, doesn't it?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
But,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
well, not to throw him under the bus,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
but the idea of him coming

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
was about as good as it was going to get.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I think he would have walked out

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
and you would have gone like, holy shit!

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And then he would have started talking

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
and he would have been like, shit!

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Hello, what you see?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
It's just the layman's opinion.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
He's said worse about my

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
acumen, so we're even Stephen.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
We can both take it.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
But anyways, he, I wanted to point that out

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
that Charlie Chase after all this.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
But he may come. He still may come, right?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Not tonight. No, no, no. Not tonight, but like, eventually.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Oh, yeah. No, he's more likely

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
to come than anybody, because he's like,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I don't know, he loves, like, I'll tell you one thing

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
about him that's really amazing.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
He's never been a refuse nick in terms of like,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
he loves people loving him.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
And people who run up

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
to him on the street

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
and just go, holy shit!

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
You were fletched. Like, he does not go.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Yeah, go fuck yourself. Like, I'm sick of that shit.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
He goes like, yeah, I was.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I was.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
And like,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I was on the set

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
once there was a guy making hot dogs

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
and like, then he was like, you know,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
he's like, holy shit, fucking Chevy Chase,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
give it to Chevy Chase, a hot dog, man,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
it's fucking crazy. And I was like, standing

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
in line behind Chevy, going like, ah, come on,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
don't be tacky hot dog guy.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
You know, the culture, like, treat him like a living ghost

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
or you might lose your job, you never know it.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Like, like, like, like half of the,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
90% of the actors might walk away and go like,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
hot dog vendor, acknowledge to my fame.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Uh, lose it, you know.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Uh, but Chevy was like,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
like, I mean, he just plays, like,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
like everything that would be in that guy's

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
fantasy, everything in his head that was

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
telling him, just say something

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
better that you do than if you don't.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Like, Chevy affirms that

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
all the time and anybody that, like,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
like, accosts him. And he was like,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
he's like, can I call my sister?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
My sister's not going to believe this. And I'm like, again, pushing it.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Come on, you got the thing. Chevy takes the

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
phone and goes like, hey, who is this?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Who is this? He starts fucking around with

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
the guy's sister, like, walked away

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
with the phone, talked to her for 20 minutes, came back.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
The guy was, like, pissing,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
like, hot dog, uh,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
vendor, Pete. He was pissing

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
regular urine. They're human.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Shame on you.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
But Dan, isn't

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
the show...

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
They don't piss hot dogs.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
They're human

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
beings.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
This is why I gotta get out of L.A.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
You guys just immediately

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
think a hot dog vendor. I bet they pee hot dogs.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
No. They vote.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Not in Nashville, they don't.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
You're going to learn that the hard way.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
No, come on. Nashville's great.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Yeah.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Just practicing for Nashville, guys.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
But isn't this

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
show kind of one long call to your friends,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
to a stranger's girlfriend?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Wouldn't he, like, the

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
non-refusinic part of him, wouldn't he love this?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
No, because he doesn't like

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
the people he works with. He doesn't like...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Is that what you're asking?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Isn't this a good setup for him?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's what I'm saying.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
He'll be here for sure. But will he be good here?

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
It sounds like he'll pee. No.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
He won't pee. He'll freak people out.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
He'll be like, oh, what's going on?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
What's happening?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
And then everyone will go, oh, that's a bit.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
And then you'll...

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
He'll call me Doug Herman.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
And you'll be like, fucking classic.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Always forgets the name.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
And then he'll...

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I don't know, man. I'm telling you.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I think it's a coin toss.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I think if you're going to be a bummer,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
like you think, or some sort of weird,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
magical breakthrough will happen.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
That would be cool. I've learned

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
one thing for sure. Keep it above

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
board. Keep calling

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
him out. Don't

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
chuckle nervously and go,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
okay, Doug, we gotta...

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Just go like, what the fuck are you talking about?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
No, that he has a chance

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
to respond. I will go to my grave

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
a happy little asshole

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
if we can get Chevy

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
to either play Dungeons & Dragons

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
with us, or

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
freestyle rap.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I think he's got a rap in him.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Well, you know, he actually, classically does.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
He had a rap album like when he was like

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
in his 20s. No, he did.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Google it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Google it.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Our website, we should have a link.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
You should be able to click on that moment

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
on the podcast. We will. We will have a website.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
You can click on all this stuff.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
It's true.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It's true.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
No, we won't, but never will.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Never will. No, Shahruz, our webmaster,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
had a...

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
He had some kind of family, or no, personal...

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
He had a...

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Shahruz is what? What were you...

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I was just laughing at some kind of family.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Oh, Shahruz has got some kind of family.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I don't know.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I guess it's an Indian name.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
It's probably like a thousand people.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Hey, what's going on over there?

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
No, that's racist horrible

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
shitty edited out.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Wait, watch it.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
The Shahruz, our

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
web genius,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I think he...

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Something happened, like it was doubled up.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
He ripped something in his leg

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
so his leg was useless, and then he got in a car accident

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
or the other way around.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
They weren't related. There were two things that

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
should go together, but... Is he okay?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Yeah, he's fine. I mean, fuck him.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Get back to work.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Where is our website?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
He had a lot of shit happening,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
and we're probably not paying him

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
very much, if anything.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Well, I'm not.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I don't check my own books, so...

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
He may have embezzled millions of dollars.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Are we paying

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Neal Berkeley?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah, well, Neal is...

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Neal doesn't exist, first of all.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Neal doesn't exist.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
No, he's fucking behind me right now.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
He's like Drop Dead Fred

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
or any of the characters from

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Inside Herman's Head

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
or Right's Head Fred

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
or...

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Thank you, Harmon.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I tried to string

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
three rhyming 80s references.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
You almost got there.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Third one wasn't about an imaginary character, though.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Neal is...

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Neal, this is a labor of love for him.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
He's in it for the art.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
He's not getting paid? Well, if the movie

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
makes money, we'll give him some.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Am I getting paid?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
You will be a salaried employee

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
of Harmontown Incorporated, which is just formed.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I just want to sit in the bus

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
and sit in my pajamas

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
and play ukulele and sing Pringles Dick

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
and just be alive for the ride.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Pringles is in the writer, by the way.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
We're having Pringles cans on the tour bus.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
We've got to drop a budget.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
We've got to deal with these things.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Neal and I were talking and Neal, who does not exist

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
and is not affecting the movie at all.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
After three Amstels

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
getting him to agree to do the thing

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
and further talking about what we could do,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Neal Berkeley did almost anything after

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
three Amstels.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
He said that...

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
What a work, dude, sir!

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
He will shit up a bridge in your head.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
That's called an

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
ultra Danny Thomas.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
There's a giant coffee table

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
under the...

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
over the ferry.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
You've got three people

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
on that reference.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
At Kansas Deli, Danny Thomas,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
comedian, father-in-nose best, Lebanese descent,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
great comedian, lovely man,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
apparently like to poop on coffee tables.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
People poop on coffee tables above him.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
That was his thing.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Apparently, who knows, it could be the Richard Gere,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
gerbil thing, like we don't know.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
But at Kansas Deli,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
and I'm almost certain this is the truth, I remember this,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
there's the...

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
The number one is the Jackie Gleason,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
the number three is the Bob Hope,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
that's the corned beef or whatever.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
The number two was the Danny Thomas.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
And it was a hot roast beef salad,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
which looks like a

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
turd on a bun.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
And it was the fucking number two,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
and I know a woman whose family

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
or as a part owner of Kansas,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
and they cannot verify if that was a happy accident

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
or just a

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
mischief.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Men you mischief.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
The number two.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
He liked to be shit up.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Anyways, this guy who doesn't exist

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
that I was talking to about the show

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
and the possibilities of going on tour

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
did point out that he felt that his colleagues

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
who came to the show for the first time

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
who don't know Dan Harmon from Fuck All

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
nor Harmontown, and they're just professionals

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
coming to a show, they said above and beyond

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
that D&D was the highlight of the show

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and that it would be a crime to not do D&D

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
on the road when we go to these different cities.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
So Spencer is asking

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
off of work,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
which is a decision he'll forever go.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
APPLAUSE

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
And Dustin's coming with us,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
which means that we will be

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
a mobile D&D pumping

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
like, uh,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Mobisode.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Mobisode.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
My dream

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
is to start a Mobisode company

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
but approach the Mobisodes

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
as if they're Webisodes.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I'm tired

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
of Mobisodes having their own

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
standard. I want,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
like, why did we stop thinking of them

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
as Webisodes? Why did we stop

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
thinking of them as Webisodes?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
There's things that you do for a Webisode.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
You put a minimal amount of the money

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
left over from your TV show into them.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
You hire a non-union crew.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
You, uh,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
you do almost nothing. Why can't you do

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
that for Mobisodes?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Did you make up Mobisodes?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
No, I did not.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
No? Somebody's already said that?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
No, that and the word Webinar

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
exists.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
They get to go on the Smash Mouth boat.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
They just made the boat.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Webinar. Webinar.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
So if you watch the Webinar,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
it's like a Webinar on the Web.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
It's a...

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I worked with, uh,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
what the fuck is his name?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Webinar with Donaldson.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Steve O'Donnell, a writer,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
he was a Letterman's writer forever.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
He and I had a love of,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
kind of a love-hate relationship

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
with word combinations.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Snacketizers,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
like you hate them.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Or appetizers,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
or stuff like that.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
He used to give me voicemails.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
He goes, hey, Jeff, it's Steve O'Donnell.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Steve O'Donnell?

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I'm on a plane right now, taxing in LaGuardia,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
and I'm looking through the SkyMall magazine,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
and I'm reading about an electric

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
blanket that boasts of its stimulaxing

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
qualities.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Stimulax.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
The only good one I've ever heard.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
The only one that actually can sign off on

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
is that my brother used to be a bartender

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
at the chart house, the seafood restaurant.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
And every year, they would have their annual

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Xcrabaganza.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And that's a fucking goodie.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
That's a goodie.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
You come up with Xcrabaganza, I'm in your corner.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Also, the only, spooktacular is good.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
A haunted house. Spooktacular is so good

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
that there's no such thing as a spectacular anymore.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I don't think anyone,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
has anyone here been to a spectacular

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
since 98?

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
It's only spooktaculars now.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
But not fucking Webinar.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
No Webinar. Webinar is dumb.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Mobisode. Here's the difference between Xcrabaganza

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
and

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Spooktacular and Webinar.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
No one wants to go to a fucking seminar.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
No one wants to be on the web. No one wants you

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
combining anything in that area. No wonder how much

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
you combine, you're not going to make it fascinating.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Fuck you. It's just a shitty

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
guy telling me how to do my job.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I don't want nutraceuticals either.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
We don't need it. You can do all the

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
dandying you want with all the syllables

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
in the world, but a boring job

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
is a boring job.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
It's not a

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
adventure-tunity.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I knew somebody that worked at a camp and they were

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
their title and they had a business card.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
The poor fucker.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Director of edutainment.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Why not?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
No.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Absolutely not.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
We'll just give you a taste.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
You guys be

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Phoenix.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Just run me through some scenarios.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I want to start training for the tour.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
This show and then the next show we do

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
and then I believe the next time

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I go on stage in front of a microphone

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
I will be in front of a sober

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
sober jury of

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Phoenician eyes.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
They're called Phoenicians, right?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Yes.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Or Carthaginians.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Depending on if they're loyal.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Sorry about that.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I don't know.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I just want to run through the ringer

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
a little bit. I can't prepare for everything,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
but you guys are so loving all the time.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Can you just boom me?

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Have Jeff introduce me and then just...

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
All right, well try this.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Do this. Be unimpressed with me

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and then

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
whatever thought I launch into

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
let it hit a button for you.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
You want me to do like fake intros

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
where you come on, say hello Phoenix

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
and like do a couple and do you want to

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
just be in the middle of it?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Yeah, fire something up. Do it exactly as you can.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
So I'm going to come up just basically

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
just sit in silence. Like you're a crowd

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
you paid ten dollars.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
This is some bullshit. Or pretend you paid

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
a thousand.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
And no one's going to pay a thousand.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I'm just saying like get yourself in the zone.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
And you're like

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
who's this guy?

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I came to the chuckle back

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
steakhouse.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Even from the name, I'm in a bad mood

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
because it doesn't rhyme

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
with anything.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
All right everybody, welcome to the chuckle back

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
steakhouse. Phoenix, Arizona, put your hands together

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
for the mayor of Harmontown.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Dan Harmon!

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Yo

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I fucked your mama in the north and the south.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I fucked your mama.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I fucked her good.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I fucked your mama in her neighborhood.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I said fuck your mama. Fuck your mama until she dies.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I fucked your mama because I love

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
pizza pies.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Alright cool, alright cool cool cool.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Now Dan you had him, you had him.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Phoenix, how you doing everybody?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Alright guys, take it easy guys.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Take it easy.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Phoenix, I love you guys.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I love it here

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
in New Mexico.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I'm not prepared for it.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Alright.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I don't know how to get them back when that happens.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Austin, Texas, put your hands together

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
for the mayor of Harmontown.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
It's first time at the Taj Mahal.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Welcome

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Dan Harmon!

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Texas!

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Not starting with a rap.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Learned my lesson in Phoenix. Fuck Phoenix, right?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Fuck Phoenix!

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah!

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I fucked your mama

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
because the bitch is from Phoenix.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I fucked her in her mouth and her penis.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
She's got a penis.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I fucked the bitch is from Phoenix.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Transgender awareness is keenest.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Oh no, I'm sorry, I forgot

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I forgot Austin is

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
the transgender capital of the

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
south

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I'm sorry.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Nashville, Tennessee

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Nashville, Tennessee

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Welcome to Chuckle Muffins

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Put your hands together

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
for the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Harmon!

44:52.000 --> 45:05.440
Tennessee, yo, my dick is big and it's big as Tennessee, everyone's dick is in Tennessee

45:05.440 --> 45:14.520
as big as mine, fuck your mamas, fuck, fuck, alright, Tennessee, Tennessee, let's not rap

45:14.520 --> 45:19.800
in Tennessee, Tennessee, thank you so much for having me, it's so fucking great to be

45:19.800 --> 45:34.440
here, I'm so sorry about the election results, you know what, it was a squeaker and my audience

45:34.440 --> 45:42.440
is liberal, I meant I was sorry about them because of how much of a squeaker it was,

45:42.440 --> 45:46.920
it shouldn't have been, you should have been right because you guys voted for the right

45:46.920 --> 45:55.480
person, Tennessee, I heard I wanted too much from a Tennessean and the, alright, hey fuck

45:55.480 --> 46:11.720
you Tennessee, fuck you, fuck you buddy, it's not worth it, it's not worth it, nobody, nobody

46:11.720 --> 46:22.560
leaves with a camera, lock the doors, send them to the assassination trench, that's when

46:22.560 --> 46:30.000
you find out I got billions of dollars, there's just hover copters come down, now based on

46:30.000 --> 46:37.120
what you've learned on your first three stops, I don't know what I've learned, let it wash

46:37.120 --> 46:44.480
over you, now let's just thrust ourselves right into the middle of Tallahassee, Florida,

46:44.480 --> 46:54.680
this is the second act, the meeting with the goddess of Tallahassee, my dad beat me real

46:54.680 --> 47:08.000
hard, that's why I drink, I drink in the backyard, I'm trying to open myself up to you, Tallahassee,

47:08.000 --> 47:17.840
what you saying, we're gonna do, we're gonna get everyone up on stage, Tallahassee get

47:17.840 --> 47:32.000
everybody off stage, I say everyone, you get everybody off stage, Tallahassee, fuck you

47:32.000 --> 47:45.640
Tallahassee, come and fuck with us, put it away, fuck you guys, fuck you guys, fuck you

47:45.640 --> 47:50.880
But I grabbed him for a second and I was like we gotta go out and have a drink and talk

47:50.880 --> 47:53.920
because he did the comedians a comedy thing and it's like there's gotta be something

47:53.920 --> 47:55.520
to learn from Patton Oswald.

47:55.520 --> 48:03.760
This is not all the more so because we're not doing comedy.

48:03.760 --> 48:10.080
So we're not comedians of comedy, we're comedians of deception.

48:10.080 --> 48:16.640
We can't play musical instruments and I don't mean to say we, you'll be fine.

48:16.640 --> 48:25.120
Ladies and gentlemen, Boston, Massachusetts, midway through the show, the very Boston Adam

48:25.120 --> 48:26.480
Goldberg comes up on stage.

48:26.480 --> 48:27.480
Hey!

48:27.480 --> 48:28.480
Hey!

48:28.480 --> 48:29.480
Wait, wait!

48:29.480 --> 48:30.480
Hey!

48:30.480 --> 48:31.480
Fuck you!

48:31.480 --> 48:32.480
You don't know me, man!

48:32.480 --> 48:33.480
Adam!

48:33.480 --> 48:34.480
Adam!

48:34.480 --> 48:35.480
Adam!

48:35.480 --> 48:36.480
Adam!

48:36.480 --> 48:37.480
Adam!

48:37.480 --> 48:38.480
How did you know I was gonna fucking do that?

48:38.480 --> 48:42.400
We bring up the Boston Cliff Clayton version of Adam Goldberg, and you were already on

48:42.400 --> 48:45.400
your fucking feet.

48:45.400 --> 48:50.240
We were coming at the same joke from different angles, it's like, if you were gonna say Boston,

48:50.240 --> 48:52.240
I'm thinking I'm gonna sneak into Boston.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.240
That's uncanny.

48:53.240 --> 48:56.960
But I really was gonna do a bit, we're gonna bring up the Boston U, and you were half-wit.

48:56.960 --> 48:57.960
Oh, the Boston May.

48:57.960 --> 48:58.960
Oh, the Boston May.

48:58.960 --> 48:59.960
I sure love 2009.

48:59.960 --> 49:00.960
What up?

49:00.960 --> 49:01.960
How did you know?

49:01.960 --> 49:02.960
It's so weird.

49:02.960 --> 49:08.960
You just fucking knew.

49:08.960 --> 49:13.960
Dan, did you have to get your own vodka?

49:13.960 --> 49:15.960
I was actually getting Adams.

49:15.960 --> 49:16.960
Oh, yeah, right.

49:16.960 --> 49:17.960
I'm trained now.

49:17.960 --> 49:18.960
Boston vodka.

49:18.960 --> 49:22.960
I know it makes them tick, and I know it makes them sleepy.

49:22.960 --> 49:28.960
I'm learning bad parenting lessons already.

49:28.960 --> 49:33.640
And that is why the Statue of Liberty is not a big deal.

49:33.640 --> 49:38.960
That's why the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island, and Governor's Island, not so great.

49:38.960 --> 49:42.960
Look, you're supposed to be doing this on a Boston accent right now.

49:42.960 --> 49:48.960
Sorry, I stuttered instead of laughing at that really good joke.

49:48.960 --> 49:50.960
It's quite solid.

49:50.960 --> 49:52.960
Hey, Aaron said you're not allowed to drink on your medicine.

49:52.960 --> 49:57.960
No, Aaron says I get really drunk really easily when I drink on my medicine.

49:57.960 --> 49:58.960
All right.

49:58.960 --> 49:59.960
Don't snitch.

49:59.960 --> 50:00.960
Don't snitch.

50:00.960 --> 50:01.960
Don't snitch.

50:01.960 --> 50:05.960
Take your roommates' lies and appreciate having said them.

50:05.960 --> 50:06.960
Wow.

50:06.960 --> 50:07.960
That's it.

50:07.960 --> 50:10.960
You know what?

50:10.960 --> 50:11.960
It's like fucking big.

50:11.960 --> 50:13.960
It's just like being in Boston, actually.

50:13.960 --> 50:16.960
This is the wickedest return in this show.

50:16.960 --> 50:17.960
You take that.

50:17.960 --> 50:18.960
Fuck it.

50:18.960 --> 50:19.960
Bride the tea on that thing.

50:19.960 --> 50:20.960
Boston is in that.

50:20.960 --> 50:21.960
Boston can be very angry.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.960
Anyone from here from Boston?

50:23.960 --> 50:24.960
Anybody?

50:24.960 --> 50:25.960
No?

50:25.960 --> 50:26.960
Really?

50:26.960 --> 50:27.960
That's just what the fuck is going on.

50:27.960 --> 50:29.960
Boston can be kind of an angry town.

50:29.960 --> 50:30.960
They're in Jocular.

50:30.960 --> 50:31.960
They're in Jocular.

50:31.960 --> 50:32.960
And really, really racist.

50:32.960 --> 50:37.960
Like, that's our reputation just because we had severe busing riots.

50:37.960 --> 50:38.960
Well, you're from there?

50:38.960 --> 50:39.960
Yeah.

50:39.960 --> 50:40.960
When you can't do the accent?

50:40.960 --> 50:42.960
I was born when I'm tired.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.960
I can do the accent when...

50:44.960 --> 50:52.960
Jeff, Jeff, you're like Davis, like the square, right?

50:52.960 --> 50:53.960
Jeff Davis Square.

50:53.960 --> 50:55.960
You ride the tea in that thing.

50:55.960 --> 50:56.960
Oh, my God.

50:56.960 --> 50:59.960
You lay-skinned motherfucker.

50:59.960 --> 51:03.960
You lay-skinned motherfucker coming in, calling Somerville past, and that's retarded.

51:03.960 --> 51:04.960
That's good.

51:04.960 --> 51:05.960
There we have it.

51:05.960 --> 51:06.960
Adam Goldberg, everybody.

51:06.960 --> 51:07.960
All right.

51:07.960 --> 51:12.960
Spencer, get up and start setting up your D&D equipment.

51:12.960 --> 51:15.960
Wait, Dan, Dan, did you notice that?

51:15.960 --> 51:18.960
I said Adam Goldberg, and he actually walked off the stage.

51:18.960 --> 51:19.960
Yeah, he's not.

51:19.960 --> 51:20.960
Yeah.

51:20.960 --> 51:21.960
No, wait a minute.

51:21.960 --> 51:22.960
We're training him like Shamu.

51:22.960 --> 51:23.960
Yeah, yeah.

51:23.960 --> 51:27.960
But slowly his little flipper, his fins are going to start to droop over, and he's going

51:27.960 --> 51:28.960
to lose all spirit.

51:28.960 --> 51:29.960
Yeah.

51:29.960 --> 51:30.960
Woo!

51:30.960 --> 51:31.960
He's...

51:31.960 --> 51:33.960
Somebody just, woo!

51:33.960 --> 51:38.960
Lose that spirit!

51:38.960 --> 51:44.960
We have to take a secret ballot of whether people are on or not on Adam's side at some point.

51:44.960 --> 51:47.960
Well, we had that conversation with Dustin, and I, when we were editing it, Dustin was

51:47.960 --> 51:48.960
like, what do you think?

51:48.960 --> 51:52.960
And I was like, because we actually, we cut out for those of you...

51:52.960 --> 51:56.960
And I feel a little bit bad about this, only in the sense of like, I put myself in Adam's

51:56.960 --> 52:00.960
shoes listening to the most recent recording, where it was basically the only thing I had

52:00.960 --> 52:03.960
time to cut out was all of Adam.

52:03.960 --> 52:07.960
I was so behind schedule because we skipped Thanksgiving, and people are like clamoring

52:07.960 --> 52:11.960
that your most important fans are the people that can do without you the least.

52:11.960 --> 52:15.960
You want to let them down the least, and I know they're the craziest, but they're the

52:15.960 --> 52:16.960
most important.

52:16.960 --> 52:21.960
You want to keep feeding them, or your audience will hate you.

52:21.960 --> 52:26.960
So I have so much shit to do right now, I'm trying to write a CBS thing and a Fox thing

52:26.960 --> 52:32.960
and I'm so behind, I got to leave on the 17th for Europe.

52:32.960 --> 52:34.960
My life is a nightmare.

52:34.960 --> 52:39.960
I got these Pat Noswell parties to go to, and I just...

52:39.960 --> 52:44.960
I don't know why that made me gay.

52:44.960 --> 52:47.960
That was a bad choice.

52:47.960 --> 52:50.960
I was trying to be fancy, not gay.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.960
I wasn't doing a thing.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.960
But I pumped it out.

52:55.960 --> 52:57.960
I pumped out the jam.

52:57.960 --> 53:00.960
Like, just Dave Matthews did all over the fucking airwaves.

53:00.960 --> 53:05.960
But the one thing I did have time to cut out was Adam Goldberg coming up and reading his

53:05.960 --> 53:06.960
journals.

53:06.960 --> 53:09.960
I read my journals, and then Adam comes up and reads his journals.

53:09.960 --> 53:10.960
Adam was 24.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.960
He read his journals from his phone from when he was 20.

53:13.960 --> 53:16.960
It didn't have the same panache.

53:16.960 --> 53:21.960
It wasn't the... but there was other stuff I could have edited over time.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.960
But I didn't get surgical about the backup because I just ran out of time.

53:24.960 --> 53:29.960
So it's me and Jesus Diaz talking about the woes of being creative and not fulfilling it.

53:29.960 --> 53:30.960
That's unedited.

53:30.960 --> 53:36.960
But anyways, the big question is, yeah, and it's not a question I want you guys to answer

53:36.960 --> 53:40.960
necessarily because, again, I say it's a coin landing on its edge.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.960
Like, when are we on Adam's side and when are we against him?

53:42.960 --> 53:46.960
I was very fascinated by his journals from four years ago because it was a glimpse into

53:46.960 --> 53:49.960
a time when Barack Obama was still in office.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.960
It was really an amazing flashback.

53:52.960 --> 53:57.960
When Adam was journaling with his phone back then.

53:57.960 --> 53:58.960
Yeah, I don't know.

53:58.960 --> 53:59.960
I don't know, man.

53:59.960 --> 54:05.960
I know that sometimes I feel like when we bring Adam up and then I try to ride the line,

54:05.960 --> 54:08.960
like, I want the audience to know, it's like, look, this guy doesn't have a golden ticket

54:08.960 --> 54:09.960
or anything.

54:09.960 --> 54:11.960
Don't get mad at him.

54:11.960 --> 54:13.960
We'll make fun of him.

54:13.960 --> 54:16.960
But then he sits down and then sometimes I feel like, oh, did we just make fun?

54:16.960 --> 54:17.960
What am I?

54:17.960 --> 54:18.960
Howard Stern?

54:18.960 --> 54:19.960
I got like a whack pack?

54:19.960 --> 54:21.960
Like, now what am I doing?

54:21.960 --> 54:24.960
Like, remember when the guy that was sitting there, where's Big Red?

54:24.960 --> 54:25.960
Big Red?

54:25.960 --> 54:26.960
He's not here?

54:26.960 --> 54:27.960
Yeah.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.960
I took care of Big Red.

54:29.960 --> 54:37.960
Adam, if we find out that Big Red has been killed, you're under indictments immediately.

54:37.960 --> 54:41.960
Last week, Adam just said, I took care of Big Red from the audience.

54:41.960 --> 54:43.960
I love Big Red.

54:43.960 --> 54:44.960
Come back, Big Red.

54:44.960 --> 54:49.960
Last week, there was this guy sitting over here, this huge laugh, super giggly, like really

54:49.960 --> 54:51.960
infectious, and everyone loved him.

54:51.960 --> 54:54.960
And it was like, there's a big guy with red hair, and his name was Big Red, and we brought

54:54.960 --> 54:56.960
him up, and he was, sorry, I'm Big Red.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.960
And every question he answered, it's like, what's your name?

54:58.960 --> 55:00.960
I go, you can call me Big Red.

55:00.960 --> 55:02.960
And I go, are you from the area?

55:02.960 --> 55:03.960
No, no, sir.

55:03.960 --> 55:08.960
He had a laugh like a big Viking dolphin.

55:08.960 --> 55:09.960
It was amazing.

55:09.960 --> 55:16.960
Yeah, like a helium, helium, helium zeppelin full of Norse warriors.

55:16.960 --> 55:19.960
Helium.

55:19.960 --> 55:23.960
But then, this is where I started to feel like a bully, because I was like, we have Big Red

55:23.960 --> 55:25.960
up, so I was like, oh, it's a new character.

55:25.960 --> 55:28.960
And then I started doing the bid of like, oh, I bet Adam Goldberg's really jealous.

55:28.960 --> 55:29.960
We brought Adam up.

55:29.960 --> 55:34.960
And then at one point, Adam, of course, he goes like, oh, fuck Big Red, or he mocked

55:34.960 --> 55:37.960
Big Red's laugh or something, like, Adam's not a hateful person.

55:37.960 --> 55:38.960
He's diabolical.

55:38.960 --> 55:39.960
He's calculating.

55:39.960 --> 55:43.960
He's anything but human.

55:43.960 --> 55:47.960
But he's robotic.

55:47.960 --> 55:55.960
He's a million flaws, fundamental ones, fundamental ones, like carbon-based flaws.

55:55.960 --> 55:58.960
But I don't think he is a hateful person.

55:58.960 --> 55:59.960
I don't think he's like petty.

55:59.960 --> 56:03.960
I think all of us are kind of like in a big worm nerd hug here, kind of.

56:03.960 --> 56:08.960
The point is that you're not a bully.

56:08.960 --> 56:11.960
But I felt like I was pitting.

56:11.960 --> 56:15.960
I had a flashback that I didn't share with everybody, like the back of the school bus.

56:15.960 --> 56:17.960
I was like, well, that was a bullying technique.

56:17.960 --> 56:21.960
When bullies would pick on me, I remember sometimes then another thing they'd do is they'd go,

56:21.960 --> 56:24.960
hey, Dan, what do you think of so-and-so?

56:24.960 --> 56:25.960
You know what I mean?

56:25.960 --> 56:26.960
It's like a bullying technique.

56:26.960 --> 56:28.960
It made me feel like...

56:28.960 --> 56:30.960
Because then one person goes like, I don't know.

56:30.960 --> 56:31.960
He's wearing a hat.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.960
You go, oh, shit.

56:33.960 --> 56:34.960
Oh, shit.

56:34.960 --> 56:37.960
You're going to take that from him?

56:37.960 --> 56:39.960
And it's just, it's such bullshit.

56:39.960 --> 56:40.960
It's like Nazi bullshit.

56:40.960 --> 56:41.960
I don't like it.

56:41.960 --> 56:44.960
Anyways, I mistakenly crossed that line.

56:44.960 --> 56:45.960
It wasn't intentional.

56:45.960 --> 56:47.960
I just think it was behavioral and not intentional.

56:47.960 --> 56:48.960
I wasn't thinking about it.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.960
It made me to pit Adam against Big Red.

56:50.960 --> 56:54.960
But Adam, if you killed Big Red, that's fucked up.

56:54.960 --> 56:57.960
But, like, I don't know.

56:57.960 --> 56:58.960
Can we have a little...

56:58.960 --> 56:59.960
You have to admire the loyalty.

56:59.960 --> 57:03.960
When Charuse, when Charuse as well again, can we get a little link of maybe it's like

57:03.960 --> 57:04.960
a little Easter egg?

57:04.960 --> 57:06.960
You have to search our website.

57:06.960 --> 57:07.960
For Adam?

57:07.960 --> 57:08.960
Yeah.

57:08.960 --> 57:11.960
It's a really gothy design and music where he's just reading his journal.

57:11.960 --> 57:15.960
Can Adam just come up as a flash animation about the thing?

57:15.960 --> 57:19.960
Are you using Safari?

57:19.960 --> 57:23.960
This website will function in that web browser, but it would work much better in a Linux-based

57:23.960 --> 57:24.960
environment.

57:24.960 --> 57:25.960
Ladies and gentlemen...

57:25.960 --> 57:30.960
Meet me down at the bottom and I'll tell you more.

57:30.960 --> 57:31.960
Let's reintroduce...

57:31.960 --> 57:32.960
This is the tour section.

57:32.960 --> 57:40.960
You'll find all kinds of concert information and ticket links for all available dates.

57:40.960 --> 57:45.960
See you on the next page.

57:45.960 --> 57:46.960
I found the Goldbug.

57:46.960 --> 57:51.960
Remember the Richard Scarry books and the Goldbug?

57:51.960 --> 57:52.960
Goldberg, Goldbug?

57:52.960 --> 57:53.960
Adam Goldbug.

57:53.960 --> 57:54.960
It can't be.

57:54.960 --> 57:55.960
It can't be a coincidence.

57:55.960 --> 57:58.960
Do you know he calls his car the Goldsmobile?

57:58.960 --> 58:03.960
That's riveting.

58:03.960 --> 58:08.960
He also does better than Chevy would up here.

58:08.960 --> 58:09.960
I'm telling you that.

58:09.960 --> 58:10.960
Huh?

58:10.960 --> 58:11.960
I'm telling you.

58:11.960 --> 58:12.960
Oh, get them of her together.

58:12.960 --> 58:13.960
Yeah.

58:13.960 --> 58:17.960
Chevy would just burst into flames.

58:17.960 --> 58:18.960
Can we like...

58:18.960 --> 58:20.960
Are you a queer or...

58:20.960 --> 58:22.960
Can we do like a mock-up of...

58:22.960 --> 58:23.960
Fuckface.

58:23.960 --> 58:28.960
Let's do a mock-up of family feud and make them play each other.

58:28.960 --> 58:35.960
My targeting system's offline again.

58:35.960 --> 58:44.960
Let's introduce our Dungeon Master who has been patiently sitting at her Spencer, everyone.

58:44.960 --> 58:50.960
The Ayatollah of 20-sided Rola.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.960
I don't know.

58:53.960 --> 58:58.960
The Duke of Dice.

58:58.960 --> 58:59.960
That's the only one.

58:59.960 --> 59:00.960
That's it.

59:00.960 --> 59:05.960
The King of the Caliph of Character Sheet.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.960
The Prince of Pencils.

59:07.960 --> 59:10.960
There's always a Sultan of something.

59:10.960 --> 59:14.960
Sultan of...

59:14.960 --> 59:15.960
I like saving throws.

59:15.960 --> 59:16.960
The Sultan of saving throws.

59:16.960 --> 59:17.960
Thank you.

59:17.960 --> 59:18.960
Nerd alert.

59:18.960 --> 59:20.960
Oh wait, that doesn't work here.

59:20.960 --> 59:21.960
Nerd alert.

59:21.960 --> 59:27.960
Spencer, if you would be so kind, bring us up to date on the campaign.

59:27.960 --> 59:31.960
Alright, let me just let this come down a bit.

59:31.960 --> 59:36.960
When we last met, our heroes had come upon a new old village.

59:36.960 --> 59:41.960
While contemplating their next move, the party was ambushed by Yerch the Knoll.

59:41.960 --> 59:45.960
The Knoll identified himself as an allied Knoll of the Blackpaw tribe

59:45.960 --> 59:48.960
and temporary second in command of the Butts Barbarians.

59:48.960 --> 59:53.960
Yerch told the heroes that this camp belonged to the vile white school Knolls

59:53.960 --> 59:56.960
and Quark talked to squirrels and shit.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.960
Soon our heroes found themselves in a pit trap facing a deadly gelatinous cube.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:05.960
Through the magic of unnatural male enhancement and a critical stomp,

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.960
the foe was felled and the friends found freedom.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:16.960
The Knoll encampment lie ahead and Sharpie's blood-tracking spell pulled them ever forward.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.960
Now you should get her up here.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.960
Do you want to bring Erin?

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960
Erin McGathy?

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.960
Alright, well there's a character secret ahead.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.960
Thank you.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.960
No, I know, I know.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.960
Spencer has become Erin's guardian in D&D.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.960
There's nothing to apologize, I sleep with her.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.960
I understand the instinct to protect her.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.960
I can't see enough of her.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.960
Welcome Erin McGathy to the stage.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.960
For better or for worse?

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.960
I just spilled vodka all over my face.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.960
For worse?

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.960
I was pinching the cup and I squirted vodka in my face.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:12.960
I will hide the ring a week longer.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.960
No biggie.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.960
Was that a don't joke about that?

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.960
This feels terrible.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.960
The right response is don't fucking joke about marrying your girlfriend, it's not funny.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.960
It's irresistible sometimes.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.960
Women love jokes about pretending to not want to marry them.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.960
It's their favorite thing.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.960
Or just teeing up like, yeah, I was married, always hilarious, always helps your relationship.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.960
Good news, I squirted vodka all over my face because I'm wasted, so I won't remember anything.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.960
I always do remember, we make the mistake of playing D&D at the last point in the show,

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.960
so no matter how sober I am when I come up here, I'm always like,

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.960
I'm wrapped by Spencer's description of what we did last week.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:05.960
Blackpaw Knowles, you say.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960
Where are we standing, Spencer?

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:14.960
You guys just got out of the pit that you escaped from and now you're running again towards the village.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.960
So it's me, the village where my dad was going to meet these...

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.960
You came upon the village after casting a blood spell and it pulled you towards your father.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.960
And it led you here and then you encountered Yurch and fell in the hole.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.960
And these are the bad noles.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960
I just read all this stuff.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.960
The camp is the bad noles, right?

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960
It's a bad nole camp.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960
Bad nole camp, yes.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.960
But we're with a good nole guide.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960
Yeah, he ran away though.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.960
Remember, you pulled a sword on him and then he ran away.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960
We pulled a sword on him?

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.960
Yeah.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.960
Were we drunk?

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.960
Yeah, probably.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960
Do you remember pulling a sword on our guide?

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.960
Dude, all I remember was talking to squirrels.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960
It was good.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.960
It was terrible.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.960
So we know these are bad noles, but what's the reason that we want to go in there?

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.960
Well, my dad is...

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.960
Is he a captive in there or something?

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960
Well, here's what I remember.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960
My dad had a deal with the dwarves where...

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.960
Not the dwarves.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.960
My dad had a deal with the good noles that they were going to go take out bad noles along the way.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.960
This is what our good nole guide said.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.960
And they were going to take out a bad nole camp and that was going to be kind of like a quid pro quo thing.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.960
I'll say it right later.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.960
In ADR.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.960
And then Neil will insist on it.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.960
He's a very rigorous, post-productive director.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.960
Neil Berkeley, everybody.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960
A famous filmmaker.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.960
Documentary.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.960
Did you know that Wayne White wasn't even in Beauty is Embarrassing?

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960
I didn't know that.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960
Neil made that character up.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.960
Really?

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.960
He wore a fake beard.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.960
And pretended to have worked on Pee-wee Herman.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.960
And just shot himself the whole way.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.960
He loves being on camera.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.960
He loves being involved.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.960
He's the Dan Harmon of Documentarians.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.960
He ends up making everything about himself.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.960
He just rolls around in a bed of mirrors.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.960
So many cuts.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960
So many cuts all over his body.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.960
If Neil Berkeley ain't in it, it ain't a Neil Berkeley feature.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960
He chomps a cigar and says that.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960
That's all in his car.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960
All right.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.960
Stop it.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.960
Can I use move silently to go into the cave?

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.960
Yeah, you can try and move silently.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960
Yeah.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.960
Let's roll for it.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.960
Ha-ha!

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.960
Silence.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.960
No, thanks, sir.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.960
You can't say things out loud when you're moving silently.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960
You just wasted a move silently.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.960
You're making a bunch of ruckus.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.960
Indeed, you do make a bunch of ruckus as you make your way towards the Knoll Village.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960
Here we go.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.960
Even still, no one seems to take notice of you.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.960
All right.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.960
You do notice flames licking the skins of the dwellings of the Knolls.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960
And smoke billows out into the sky.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.960
You can hear the sounds of screaming and shouting and the ringing of clashing blades.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.960
Oh, your dad's in there kicking ass right now.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960
He's been here.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.960
Let's go in and help.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.960
These licking flames remind me a lot of the belt that used to lick my ass.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.960
Wait.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.960
Your dad licked your ass?

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.960
No, his belt did.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.960
His belt?

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.960
How do you know it was his belt?

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.960
It's a magical belt.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:17.960
Because it was hard and held his pants up.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.960
That's called his dick.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.960
His dad hit him with a belt.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.960
You weren't there.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.960
I'm just going on what you give me.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.960
Sharpie, I must confess.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:35.960
I am 4,000 years old and I was there.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960
Jesus.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.960
Her face is covered in vodka.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:48.960
I feel like there's a battle going on and we owe it to the memory at least of the kinship of your father to go in there and help in this battle.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.960
Alright, let's head towards the fray.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.960
Yes, I have many arrows.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.960
Let's go.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.960
Shoot him one at a time.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.960
Arriving at the village, you're met with a grisly scene.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:08.960
Flames consume the tall grasses surrounding the bone dwellings and wooden furniture, animal hides and all sorts are on fire.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.960
A few of the huts are collapsed as if devastated by a single blow and the corpses.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.960
Knolls lie slain in pools of their own blood, some with vicious gashes.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:22.960
Others with broken backs and necks and still others torn asunder or cleft in twain.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.960
You hear the pounding of massive feet shaking the earth and then you see him.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.960
Lord Mango Buttsalot.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.960
Mango.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:41.960
Can I cheat up his entrance and just let me keep looking at the corpses and then I go, what dire force wrought this?

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.960
And then you hear the, and the puddles of blood shiver, you know?

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.960
Yeah.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.960
And then he's coming.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:07:01.960
Your chief of the Butz Barbarian, standing seven feet tall, boasting 380 pounds of raw muscle. The barbarian chief's body is burning red with a bloodlust of a barbarian rage.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:10.960
Clad in studded leather armor and wearing a dazzling and magnificent multicolored dream cloak, red, blue and yellow, the colors of the Buttsalot tribe.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.960
He also wears a great horned helmet and a dazzling magic belt.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.960
Upon seeing you, he just...

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.960
I think I know where this is going.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:31.960
Upon seeing you, he charges, barreling at inhuman speeds towards you, swinging a massive anchor as easily as with a were of small wood hatchet and wild dangerous arcs.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960
He gets like this.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.960
Run!

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.960
We have to wait for his berserker rage to settle out.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:48.960
And the fellow barbarian recognize him and jump in the way of Lord Buttsalot and Sharpie and say, no! This is Sharpie!

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:56.960
I will say that realizing you are a barbarian and you realize that you don't think you can stop a barbarian with words, but you can try that if you'd like.

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.960
It's like telling Adam Goldberg to come up on stage later.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:07.960
Like it's not a...

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960
I can't use my words.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.960
You definitely can.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:15.960
I mean, I'm just telling you that you know barbarians being a barbarian and they get mindless.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.960
I'm saying get out of it as quickly as I can.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.960
I'm saying he gets like this.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.960
I was raised by a barbarian and I get it.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.960
Let him peter out.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.960
He's in a rage.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.960
He's not going to understand anybody.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.960
You get it, but you're also always fighting against it.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.960
Fighting against what? Him?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960
You.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.960
What?

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.960
And him.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.960
Not by bothered by your idle chit chat.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.960
He charges, pulling into the group of the three of you.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:56.960
He manages to knock Dan and Jeff high up into the air and they land flat on their backs.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.960
You guys each take two damage.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960
What?

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960
Motherfucker.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960
Can I use my bird?

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960
That would have killed me at level one.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.960
Spencer, may I use my bird to deliver a message to Mango?

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.960
I don't think you have a bird.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960
I have a bird.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960
It says one bird.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960
Oh, that's a token.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960
Yeah, yeah, you could.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.960
She's talking about Quall's feather token, you guys.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.960
It's a magical item that summons a bird that can deliver a message.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.960
That's what's happening right here.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.960
Where's your behind the scenes?

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.960
I'm sorry.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960
No, no, no.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.960
I'm just explaining the game because it's hard.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:30.960
You're frustrated.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.960
Oh, I just sound like a little bitch sometimes.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.960
I'm sorry.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:34.960
No, no, no, no.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.960
You're my biggest advocate.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.960
You know I sound like a bad guy.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.960
Mulraine is a perfect time to summon a bird.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.960
Two of your friends lie flat on their backs.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.960
Yeah, go get that bird.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:52.960
Well, I wanted to deliver a message to Mango and let him know that that's a lot is his

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.960
son with the bird.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.960
Use your mouth to deliver that message.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.960
Shut up, Adam.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:05.960
I mean, if my face doesn't deliver that message, my next available turn, I'll use my mouth

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.960
to deliver the message.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:14.960
It's your turn by going, Dad, your noises make no impact on his fragile brain.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:15.960
Fragile?

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.960
So my bird, did my bird never go?

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.960
You didn't say a message, so do you want to say a message and then it'll happen?

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.960
Yes, yes.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:34.960
The man that you see before you, the bearded, kind-eyed.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:49.960
Speed it up.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:58.960
His face looks like you could swear into it.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:07.960
The kind-eyed, steel-dicked man that you see before you is your son.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.960
Is that what Ian McKellen whispered to that moth?

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.960
I always wondered what he would say to that moth and learn of the rings.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960
He said some shit and then it went away.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960
He came back and it's like, what did he say?

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.960
Go get the eagles.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.960
Tell them to come by at just the right time.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.960
I can't believe Adam killed big red.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:37.960
His lips are like soft valleys that giants roll in after long nights to massage their backs

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.960
because they're so soft.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960
Sorry, guys.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.960
There's a limit of 100 words on the spell.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.960
The person that you see is your son.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.960
That's your son, that little beardy.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960
She said it.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960
She clicked send.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.960
She did it.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.960
She clicked send.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:00.960
The coin transforms into a beautiful dove and flies right into the ear of Lord Mango Butzalut.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:08.960
You hear it tweeting softly and then he claps the side of his face and crumples and falls to the ground.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.960
Are you going to kill your dad?

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.960
The dad just killed the bird.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960
He heard your message.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:20.960
You thought the tad crumbled to the ground?

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.960
Why would he kill a bird that talks?

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.960
He's crazy.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.960
He's in a berserker rage, you guys.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.960
Butzalut, can we just kill your dad?

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.960
He seems shitty.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.960
He just killed a bird who tried to talk to him.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.960
I cast Mage Armor.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.960
You cast Mage Armor.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.960
I stand up and I look him right in the eye.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960
Prom night style.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.960
I don't get the reference.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.960
I don't see things.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.960
I'm sorry, Sharpie, you sure you don't want to send another bird up there?

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:57.960
Not the movie prom night.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:06.960
I mean the actual ritual prom night in all adolescents' lives when you finally bear it out and you're fucking dad because he won't give you the keys to the car because he didn't clean your room and you're not supposed to go to prom.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:15.960
Oh yeah, actual looking gangly and ridiculous and having your first pubescent showdown with your alcoholic shitty...

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:24.960
Pubescent showdown is my favorite band.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960
Alright, you cast Mage Armor.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.960
You have a lot of favorite bands there.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.960
Get it out of your system, old man.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.960
You couldn't kill me when I was a kid.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.960
Maybe you could finish the job now.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:43.960
Glowing with magic light, he turns and charges directly at you.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.960
Right eyes, bloodshot.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.960
I hold my ground and squint my eyes because I'm a coward but I've made my decision.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.960
This is how I would like to die.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:54.960
He hits the axe.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.960
No, I'm sorry, it's an anchor.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.960
He swings the anchor in a wild arc and it strikes you directly in the chest.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.960
He fights with an anchor?

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.960
It's like a belt for a boat.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.960
Jesus Christ, my dad.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.960
It strikes you with such force that it shatters your Mage Armor, dissipating it.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.960
I go into a berserker rage and I attack him to defend my friend's honor.

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.960
It makes adorable.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.960
So you just jump on him with your sword?

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.960
What's my crazy sword one, my flaming sword?

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.960
I use my flaming sword and go into a rage and attack.

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.960
Pulling out your flaming sword from its sheath, you go into a rage.

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.960
It's real great.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:47.960
Flying into an angry rage, you launch yourself full of adrenaline towards the barbarian warlord

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:52.960
and swing in a masterful, clean stroke.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.960
You miss.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.960
Shit, harmlessly.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.960
There's got to be some item from my childhood that I can show him in a movie.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.960
Cast Magic Scrapbook.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.960
He never participated in my sticker collection.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.960
That's half the reason I left.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.960
Sharpie, didn't you hang out in his basement a lot?

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.960
His own work lair?

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.960
Isn't there some token or memory from that that you could summon?

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.960
That's where you got hit by a belt.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.960
That's the place where it happened.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.960
What did my mom call him?

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.960
Mango?

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.960
Are there some magazines?

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:40.960
When he hit me and you said my mage armor dispersed, was there any other effect to just take out the mage armor?

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.960
You didn't die, right?

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.960
Did it hurt me?

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960
It did not.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.960
No, the mage armor took the brunt of your attack there.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.960
So I say, hit me again! I'm your son!

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.960
He doesn't respond to your words. He's in a mindless rage.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:01.960
His tongue lulls and his eyes roll around in his sockets and he unleashes a mighty roar.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:09.960
Okay, I shoot an arrow at Mango.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.960
You shoot an arrow from your bow. You strike Mango right in the chest.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.960
You guys know this as my dad.

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:25.960
I wanted to say in a different area other than his chest, but he has a big chest, right?

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.960
Where are my spells, do I?

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.960
Oh, there they are. I found him.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.960
Come on, don't bully me.

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.960
So is Mango willing to talk now?

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.960
No, he's not.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.960
He charges like a wounded animal despite taking 14 non-lethal damage.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.960
It's just like Dan's dad. Hard skin for no reason, Mango.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.960
Charm person!

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.960
Charm person fails to affect mindless ragers.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960
I use diplomacy.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.960
You can use diplomacy.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:02.960
I get diplomatic all over him.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.960
You fail to get diplomatic all over him.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.960
I'm sorry, you guys. The dice are sucking.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.960
Guys, I'm sorry. I'm a real piece of shit today.

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:16.960
You shoot an arrow at his feet, like both of his feet. I wait until I'm parallel.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.960
So I can shoot both of his feet with the same arrow.

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.960
Yes, and then to the other foot.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:29.960
Like it's a little real-world road-wheels challenge where your feet are tied together.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.960
That's a pretty tough shot to nail there.

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.960
Yeah, I'm pretty shitty reference, but yeah.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.960
You fail to meet your mindless.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.960
Hypnotism!

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.960
Is that one of your things that you just want to talk about?

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.960
Can I reject that?

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.960
Okay. Do you like how they drive through?

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.960
Sleep.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.960
Sleep. He's entitled to a will save.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.960
Oh shit. He falls asleep.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.960
I had to learn to do that.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.960
That's my origin story.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:08.960
Take his belt off while he's sleeping.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.960
Jesus, you guys, that's my dad.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.960
You shot arrows at his chest.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.960
So Manko's asleep right now?

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:15.960
He's asleep.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.960
I run up and take his anchor away from him.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.960
Wait, don't do anything.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.960
I'm just disarming him.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.960
He's got friends that are going to think we're trying to kill him.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.960
I run up and I thrust at his head like I'm humping him.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.960
And then I giggle and I run away and I'm embarrassed.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.960
I look around for allies of my father.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.960
I take a post-it note, draw dick and balls, put it on his forehead.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.960
You succeed.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:43.960
Nice.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.960
I put his hand in a cup of warm water.

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:47.960
No, no, no, no, no.

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960
No, I'm not going to fly.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:54.960
I put some dog shit on his finger and tickle his nose.

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.960
There's no dog shit.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.960
Just write racist on his forehead.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.960
Check out Instagram.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.960
Sharpie, do you want us to defeat him or do you want him to join us?

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.960
My first order of business was to get him to stop killing us.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.960
Second on that list, though, is not have us kill him.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.960
That's my dad.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.960
He came here to meet him.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.960
Of course.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.960
I'm looking around for his attendants.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.960
You don't see any attendants.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.960
The burning Nolan campman seems rather barren.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.960
It seems like everyone who could die is already dead.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.960
Can I give Mango Betsalup my bedroll?

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.960
Yeah, well, he's unconscious, so he can't accept it.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.960
Like, you could place it on him or something.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.960
Yeah, I'm going to...

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.960
Or you could tuck him in, I guess.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.960
Mulrainee, Mulrainee, put a bedroll on him.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.960
Here's my sincere advice.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960
He was in a berserker rage.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.960
That's why everyone here is dead.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960
That's why he's the leader of his tribe.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.960
He's not himself when he's in that mode.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.960
If we tie him up and take all his shit when he wakes up,

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.960
he'll actually be pissed at us normal, like sober.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.960
If we just let him have his shit, he'll wake up normal.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.960
He's not going to be in a berserker rage when he wakes up.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:08.960
Like, he'll be normal.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:09.960
He's still my dad.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.960
He's not going to kill us when he wakes up.

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.960
Sharpie, when was the last time that you and your dad

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.960
had a really nice time together?

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:16.960
Should we try to recreate that?

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.960
Well, I don't want to play the blame game.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.960
I don't come from that school of therapy.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.960
It wasn't a positive relationship.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.960
I left and became a wizard, but, you know...

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.960
But if he was there a time like your last good memory with him,

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.960
like, can we position him in a certain way?

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.960
I don't think there's any manipulating this guy.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.960
I think he's kind of salt of the earth type,

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.960
and manipulation is more...

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.960
Well, like, can we eat his organs?

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:47.960
I feel like I'm talking to, like, an artificial intelligence.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:50.960
I don't know what you're saying has to do with what I'm...

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.960
But what my recommendation is that we prop the guy up

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.960
in a comfortable position with his weapons in hand

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.960
and wait for him to wake up a normal guy.

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960
He's not going to like me when he wakes up,

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.960
but he's not going to try to kill us.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.960
He's my dad.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.960
I summon a squirrel.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:11.960
It's the same day as the last day we met,

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.960
and you can only cast Speak with Animals once per day.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.960
I'll bite my time.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.960
I have a flashback.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.960
You have a flashback to when?

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.960
Ten years old.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.960
Ten years old.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:32.960
I choose Jeff Davis to play the role of young Lord Buttsalot,

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:39.960
a barbarian in the tower of wherever I grew up when I was 10.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.960
I'll play the tower.

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:47.960
It's like, why is there a phone call over this tower?

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.960
God damn it, I've been working all day,

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.960
but kicking Noel's asses instead of a bit.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960
Father.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.960
What?

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.960
I've been thinking about what you said.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.960
I don't give two shits.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.960
I don't pay you to think.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.960
I don't even pay you.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.960
You said that I'd never make a good barbarian.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960
I know that.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.960
Look at you.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.960
You don't have the forearms.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.960
What of magic, Father?

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.960
Magic.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.960
La-di-da.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.960
I like magic.

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.960
I'm going to go hang out with Patton Oswald at magic parties.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.960
Magic can be used to defeat monsters and gain treasure,

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.960
same as churrism.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960
Show me some magic.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.960
Right now, prove it to me.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:44.960
You just pooped in the carpet.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.960
That's not magic.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.960
That's disgusting.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.960
Anyone can poop in the carpet.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.960
Look, I cast magic fart.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.960
I need to go abroad and study it.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.960
That's what I'm saying.

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.960
Being a barbarian is not good enough for you, huh?

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:02.960
I didn't say that.

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:03.960
I'm not good enough.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.960
You always say I'm not good enough.

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.960
You're not good enough.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.960
Let me be good enough.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.960
Let me do what I'm good at.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:16.960
I'm made of stone.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.960
We live in a magic tower.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.960
Why can't I go to a magic place and apply my train?

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:22.960
You know what?

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.960
Do it.

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:24.960
You go.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.960
You go.

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.960
Just leave.

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:35.960
And I'll see you in about 15 years, 20 years.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960
Don't be proud of me.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960
Oh, yeah.

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.960
Well, maybe I won't.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:39.960
Maybe I won't.

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:40.960
Maybe I'll be too busy.

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.960
You've got to save the world from the evil mole ganks.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.960
And maybe I won't care about magic,

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.960
because maybe magic doesn't put bread on the table.

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.960
Maybe sometimes using your big forearms does.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.960
Magic can totally put bread on the table.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.960
Do it.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.960
Show me.

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:57.960
Show me right now.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:58.960
Show me right now.

01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.960
Show me right now.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:02.960
Don't poop on this table, son.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.960
Get out of my weird drunk castle.

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.960
I cast I hate you.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.960
I never want to see you again.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.960
Again.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.960
Again.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.960
Again.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.960
Again.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.960
You snap back into the real world.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.960
You feel in a confusing mix of emotions,

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.960
of passions, of adrenaline, of memories,

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:30.960
of timelines weaving past and present.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:31.960
You level up.

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:32.960
What?

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:33.960
Oh!

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.960
Flashback, level up.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.960
Flashback, level up.

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.960
You can level up by having a memory.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.960
That's the best D&D game ever.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.960
All right.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960
Let's have it for Spencer.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.960
Let's end there when we level up.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960
That's right.

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.960
Stop in a video game when we level up.

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.960
Take our time to pick those new skills.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.960
Absolutely.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960
Spencer, everybody.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960
All right.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.960
Erin McAfee.

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960
I didn't know.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.960
You know, Neil, who doesn't exist,

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.960
had to say to me,

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960
I think D&D's the highlight.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.960
I think you gotta figure out a way

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.960
to play D&D on the road.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960
You mean Neil Berkeley,

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.960
the megalomaniac filmmaker?

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.960
The Dennis Hopper of documentaries.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.960
The Morgan Sperlock of our movie.

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.960
Man, I don't know what you intended to do,

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960
but I'm in this thing.

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.960
It's about me now.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.960
I mean,

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.960
I wish my name was Neil Berkeley.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.960
Because it's got me in it.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.960
And I.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.960
There's no Neil in team.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.960
There's some of it,

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.960
but you have to deconstruct it.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.960
That's all I'm gonna do.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:49.960
I'm just saying,

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.960
as an example,

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.960
he's sitting at his three Amstels.

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.960
I'm still trying to get him

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960
to agree to do the thing.

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.960
He immediately mentions,

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.960
D&D's the thing.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.960
It gave me a renewed vigor.

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.960
I think we played better D&D tonight.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:02.960
Because.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.960
Stacks are higher.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960
And like, yeah, it's like.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.960
Because we're going in an actual campaign.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.960
He may not.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.960
You and I are going in an actual.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.960
Campaign.

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:10.960
Campaign across the front.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:11.960
Across the front.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.960
In search of riches and glory.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:14.960
Yeah.

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.960
Can I describe it dramatically?

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:17.960
Oh, I wish you would.

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:18.960
Yes.

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:19.960
Well, not like,

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.960
I'm just in general.

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.960
Not right now.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:22.960
Oh, I thought you.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.960
Play the D&D queue.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.960
In a cramped tour bus

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.960
on a state highway somewhere.

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:28.960
Yeah.

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:29.960
See you later.

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:30.960
All right.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.960
I hit the wrong button.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960
It's come that.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.960
It's come that time in the Harmontown Show.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960
Oh, that sounded like.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960
That sounded like a good.

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960
It was like.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960
That's what we lack in our show.

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960
Like where it has that kind of like.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.960
Hey, bring it at home.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:45.960
Kind of like.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:46.960
So the audience.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960
Okay.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.960
It shows fucking over.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:49.960
I don't have.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:50.960
I don't have to steal myself

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:51.960
against the possibility of this being

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:52.960
three and a half hours long.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.960
The good thing about the show

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.960
is that the energy is freewheeling,

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.960
but the only downside of that is always

01:26:58.960 --> 01:26:59.960
the paying the paper at the end

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:00.960
because they go like,

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.960
who's going to end it?

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:02.960
He's a loser.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.960
You are Dan.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.960
So what have we learned?

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:12.960
What have we learned at tonight's Harmontown?

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:18.960
We learned.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:19.960
We learned that Neil,

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.960
Neil doesn't want to be in the movie

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.960
that he's shooting,

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.960
but that he will be the star of it

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.960
by not being in it.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.960
We learned that Adam.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.960
We didn't learn shit about Adam.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.960
We didn't learn anything about Adam,

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:37.960
but we learned to be afraid of him

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.960
if we didn't know that already.

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.960
We learned that women and gay people

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.960
and black people are the best people

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:44.960
in the world.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.960
Right, Tennessee?

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.960
Fuck you, buddy.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.960
Motherfucker, I'm sure you shit over your fucking head.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.960
We learned that Greg Barrett is our Marvel enemy.

01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:58.960
We learned that I have a lot to learn

01:27:58.960 --> 01:27:59.960
about going on the road,

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.960
that I still have one more week to prepare.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.960
We learned that Dave Mathews will happily shit in your head

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.960
because they have no regard for human safety.

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:08.960
Yeah.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.960
And we learned that we learned to fuck your mama.

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:15.960
No, no, no.

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:20.960
No.

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.960
Wait.

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:26.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.960
Yo, end of the show.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.960
Yo, yeah.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.960
Yo, end of the show.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.960
Fuck your mama, gonna learn and grow.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.960
Fuck your mama and her knee and her foot.

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:42.960
Fuck your mama's chimney, got the soot on my dick.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.960
Fuck your mama's wick.

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.960
Here's the candle and I'm gonna get sick.

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.960
Keep your mama up out of my mouth.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.960
Fuck your mama in the east, west, north and south.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.960
Fuck your mama from the salt to the pepper.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.960
Fuck your mama and I'm not a pepper.

01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.960
It's not a word.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.960
That's why I'm not it.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:02.960
It's not a word.

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.960
Fuck your mama in the butt and the head.

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.960
Fuck your mama and your daddy instead.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.960
Started fucking your daddy to even it out.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.960
Fuck your daddy in his nose and his mouth.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.960
Apostrophe T.

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.960
Mouth.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.960
C'mon, let me get...

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.960
Yo, I need a topic.

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.960
I need a topic, yo.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.960
Eyes.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:25.960
I fucked your mama's eyes.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.960
I fucked your mama and it was a big surprise.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.960
I fucked your mama in her brow and her nose.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.960
I fucked your mama cause that's how the eyes goes.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.960
