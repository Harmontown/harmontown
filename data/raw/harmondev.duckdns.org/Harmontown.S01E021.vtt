What'd you think about that?\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:02.000\nYour mama's not an advocate. She doesn't think they should vote.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.000\nOr get married.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:07.000\nI said, bitch.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:11.000\nIt's politically hairy. You're in California.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:14.000\nYou gotta be open-minded.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nAnd here's what your mama said.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nShe said, you know what?\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nI didn't find that to be the case.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:24.000\nAnd she started rattling off all kinds of right-wing bullshit at me.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:26.000\nI fucked your mama.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nDan Harmon, everybody.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:33.000\nThat was a little bit of a...\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nI felt like that was a little bit of a...\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:38.000\nI don't know, what do you call that?\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nI felt like it was a little bit of a...\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:41.000\nIt's experimental.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nThat was kind of a populist smoke, I think, I was spewing there.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:46.000\nI knew my crowd. I knew where they land.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nI mean, yeah, I think what we're doing right now is, you know,\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\nwe have a giant tour coming up that's looming.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nAnd are we recording?\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:57.000\nI hope you can hear the sound of the crickets that are in this building.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nActual literal crickets.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nIf you ever want to really just lay a stinker of a joke out there,\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nthe crickets will be there to add high relief.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\nI'm kind of excited, and I don't mean this sarcastically.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:12.000\nI really am excited about how already, I think we just kind of started in earnest,\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:16.000\nto sort of think of this as a movie that we're going to be shooting\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nabout the tour that we're going on.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:21.000\nAnd the big question is, like, how do you shoot a movie about a tour that you're going on?\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nHow do you shoot a movie about anything?\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nIf there's no script and all these things, you bring cameras,\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nand you hope not to affect anything.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:31.000\nBut it's like already our awesome director, Neal,\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nwho does not want to be spoken about on camera.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nSo this will not be in the movie.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:42.000\nBut he's like Bob Vila already, but when that camera came out,\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:43.000\nI was like, rip that curtain down.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:47.000\nBut that curtain is the thing that, stand by the light, get over there,\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:52.000\nit's good, like I'm more comfortable knowing that I'm in the hands of someone\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:58.000\nwho's not, like if I say something particularly profound by the refrigerator.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:03.000\nWhich is almost, I don't want to find out later that if I had stepped three inches back,\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:06.000\nI would have looked awesome and sounded awesome.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nSo he's like, move, and it's like, it's definitely going to affect everything,\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:14.000\nwhich is kind of an interesting thing, because if it wasn't, it would be weird.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:17.000\nBut it wasn't affecting everything. We had to rip that curtain that was starting the show.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:21.000\nThat curtain's there to block light from the comic book store, from spilling into here.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nIt's also to block your vision of me, because we go by the bridal rules of what constitutes.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:30.000\nIf you see me before the show, the mystique is blown.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nMost of you are responding for most of these nights to like,\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nwell, is that what he looks like?\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nHe's so beautiful.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nHe's hard as a rock.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nIt's just a special day.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:48.000\nApparently that curtain was also there to keep crickets out of the building.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:51.000\nYeah, I'm a little embarrassed about the crickets.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nWe have to get a microphone on those crickets, so we can just add cricket sounds.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nDo you have a lot of art imitating life, imitating art, imitating things?\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:02.000\nIt's going to be very exciting to just get in a bus and go for 20 days and 20 nights.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:07.000\nI never understood that expression. Why do you have to add that there's no, nothing has ever,\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:12.000\nlike, what is that from menorah times?\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:17.000\nIs there like a Jewish thing that happened where something happened for eight days\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:21.000\nthat didn't happen for eight nights, and that was a miracle, and we need to keep track of that,\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:25.000\nso every else, like your bank tells you, well, this is for eight days and eight nights.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nThis isn't a fucking menorah.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:31.000\nI'm making up the menorah thing. I'm just grabbing it, something that might have...\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:36.000\nSee, I always think of it, because I got to guest-announce at Price is Right for a couple months,\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:41.000\nand you and a guest will go to Cancun, Mexico for three days and four nights.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:48.000\nYou're covered on the water slide, Parks, for the last two days, but fuck if you're getting a hotel.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nThat's where the expression comes from. It's a capitalist expression.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nWe never had to differentiate days and nights until they started costing money.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:03.000\nSix $80 days and four $80 nights.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:09.000\nYou know, out of pocket, you can do whatever you want, Gladys.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:15.000\nThat's the typical Price is Right winner, I'm sure.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nUh-oh.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:22.000\nNo, I just do that to hope that I come up with something else to say.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.000\nAIDS. AIDS. Who's aware of AIDS?\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nScraping the barrel.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nWho has it?\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nOh boy, those Muppet movies, overrated.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:38.000\nThat new Batman movie stinks.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:48.000\nOh, what you should be asking yourself is why a bad guy would sound like this.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\nSeems counter-torner.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:58.000\nI realize I'm the last person to see this movie, and I'm so thankful for that.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nWhat movie are you talking about?\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nBatman's Risings.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nThat's my new form of protest.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:07.000\nI figured out old people because I'm becoming one of them.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nThat's why they do it. They're doing it to fuck with you.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nWhat are you watching at?\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nLike you're wearing a Nike shirt.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nWhat are you, Nick?\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nIs that your name on your shirt?\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nNick?\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nSays Nike.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:21.000\nNike?\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nWhat? It's a kind of shoe.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nWhat do you work for them? I don't get it.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nI don't get anything. That's my protest.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nIt's kind of cool.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:35.000\nIt's a lot less energy and a lot more result because you just thrive on all the young people going,\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nFuck you!\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:38.000\nFuck you!\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nNo, I could explain it to fuck you, old man.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nYou don't get bubble gum?\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nAre you going to, if you're chewing it, why don't you swallow it?\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:51.000\nYou know what? I'll wait till you figure it out.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:54.000\nMaybe you'll get your big break one day, bubble gum.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nSounds like a great idea.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nCandy, you don't swallow. Good.

I'll get fired.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nEnough of that.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nLet's do something for the nice people for once in a while.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:15.000\nLet's pretend someone's watching other than a person that makes shows.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nYou elitist meta asshole.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nEnough.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:26.000\nI don't want to go to the museum and see paintings of frames.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nSo clever Dan Harmon.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nYou're so goddamn clever.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nOh a painting of a thing that's supposed to be around a pet.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nOh maybe I'm part of that.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nActually that's pretty cool.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nI should give that an M.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nWhat do you think the final product is going to be?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:47.000\nWhen you and I have come home, there's been two attempts in our lives.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nWe will have gone through a lot together.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nWhat do you think the final product is?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:58.000\nObviously it's in the hands of our shy Neil Berkeley director who doesn't want to be mentioned.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nYet we will persist in mentioning him as often as possible.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nShy in front of the camera but a real George S. Patton behind it.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:08.000\nNo son of a bitch don't!\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:12.000\nThis curtain goes!\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nI had to talk him into doing the movie again.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:20.000\nAfter he came up here, it took three Amstels to get him to really actually say,\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\nNo I'm doing it.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:22.000\nBecause he came and saw the show.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nHe had a yes.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nFrankly yes.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nBut no he didn't say as much.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nI'm insecure obviously.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nI think he's insecure.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:36.000\nConversation between two guys whose job is to try to receive people and figure them out.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:41.000\nIt was like taking two saucers and trying to make them stick.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:48.000\nWe need the China wear equivalent of a penis in here.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nOr we need to start mixing metaphors.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:53.000\nBut I don't want to insult women by saying we were two vaginas.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nScissoring.\n\n13:55.000 --> 14:00.000\nI just want to edit all this out of the movie.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:05.000\nAlso I think what it all came down to is I had to promise him,\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nIt's your movie.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nI'm not the kind of guy that's going to go,\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:14.000\nHey okay so remember when we got our drive through food and it was wrong.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:23.000\nAnd I just revealed that my true feelings about just all black people.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:30.000\nIs there any way you could change the N word to N word?\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nInstead of the N word?\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nBecause it just doesn't, I don't think, you don't think it's going to make a good movie?\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:40.000\nNo I'm sure it'll make a good movie for you but I would really like to be able to go back home\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:41.000\nand get to Marco.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:46.000\nWell I'm looking at whatever this kind of film equivalent of a Pulitzer is.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nNo but he's, she should be allowed to.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.000\nIt's got to be a word within the comp.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:51.000\nIt must be.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:58.000\nIt's got to be some kind of word for a film award.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nThis is going to work well on the road.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nWhen I can't think of what state we're in.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:07.000\nWhere are we? New Mexico and Phoenix people just get over and rape me.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nWe're not going to have any time to be in any of these towns.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\nWe're going to be in Nashville, Tennessee and we will have seen nothing.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nWe will be on stage and we might as well be here.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nSo when I go out in Phoenix on January 10th like I'm going to go,\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:21.000\nOkay think of something Phoenix related, get them on your side and I'm going to go,\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:26.000\nHey birds should stay on fire.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nYou know what you do?\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:32.000\nThey shouldn't be, they shouldn't be ashes and they're all going to go.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nYou know what you do?\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:37.000\nWe should think of the list of the cities we know we're going to.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:40.000\nAsk if anybody here is from there or has lived there.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nAnd get some sweet little local nuggets.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:44.000\nAlright.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:47.000\nAnybody from Arizona here? See?\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nWe're going through the curtain at night on this tour.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:53.000\nWhat I was thinking is like, is there a way to train?\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:54.000\nLike can I train?\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:58.000\nThe two things that make me the most phobic are like audience reaction.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nLike I'm used to these guys.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nThey love each other.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nThey love me.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nThey're very good people.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nAnd they're racist.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nThey're from Los Angeles.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nThey share a culture.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nI've lived here for 15 years or more.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nAnd I don't know.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nThey're my people.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:16.000\nWe're in the back of a comic book store.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:20.000\nLike then you know something's going to be fundamentally different.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nBesides just barometric pressure, which is a huge thing.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nIt's not to be quibbled with.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nI've been in Denver.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nI got a nosebleed at the airport.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nAnd I forgot to take the pot out of my girlfriend's purse.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nAnd we were there for an extra six hours.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nIt was like, all because of the little, little, little altitude.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nAnd I wasn't performing.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:41.000\nI was just trying to get some pot back home.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:47.000\nNow do you know that there's a hard, fast rule that you cannot take a shit on the tour bus?\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:48.000\nYou know that, right?\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nThat's a rule.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:53.000\nI mean, I know that Dave Matthews Band broke that rule.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nI heard that story about the Dave Matthews Band.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nLike, I guess there's a hose that comes off the bus.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:02.000\nIt's like a poop hose that you can just like, I don't know, the tour manager.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:05.000\nLike, just was like, all right, we're breaking a minor rule.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nBut there's so much poop in there.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nI mean, it's the Dave Matthews Band.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nThey work hard.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nThey poop harder.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:14.000\nOh, I've heard that music.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\nLet's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's some of this pressure off.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nLet's give the kids a break.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nThey've earned it.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nAnd they just kind of hit the release valve.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:25.000\nAnd I guess it just sprayed all over some, some boat passing by where a guy was like,\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nhere's another thing, huh?\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.000\nThey were going over the river.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nThere was a ferry underneath it.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:34.000\nAnd they emptied it and hit all those people on the ferry.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:37.000\nMy description was pretty accurate.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nShe said they were on the Chicago, there was a Chicago river and they were on a bridge\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nand they dumped it over the bridge and they said, hey, ferry, it landed on the ferry.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nYeah.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:49.000\nOr as I call it, a record release by the Dave Matthews Band.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nHit all over your head.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:55.000\nThey did, they did set one Dave Matthews record.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:59.000\nThose people will all be remembering that release for years.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:03.000\nDave Matthews Band and Blues Traveler can get in a fucking boat and die.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nThey're the fucking worst.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nNo, no.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nStand up Blues Traveler supporters.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nShow yourself.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nAdam Goldberg, I knew that.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nYou fucking.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nYeah.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nYes.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nPraise her Caesar.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nDid you, did you see the weird stance that Adam just made?\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nI'm going to, I'm going to do.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nI don't know how to differentiate weird from not weird stances with that.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nI'm going to just, I'm going to describe it first and then do it.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nHe did.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nAdam stood up and did that.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nHe stood up for the Dave Matthews Band.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:39.000\nAnd then, and then while people jeered, he, he did a stance that I'm going to the label\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:43.000\nand diagnose.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\nI'll come up if you want me to come up.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nHe went, he went.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:52.000\nSo, so do the, do the Dave Matthews thing and then I'll stand up and be Adam Goldberg\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nand do what he did.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nDave Matthews can go fuck themselves.\n\n18:55.000 --> 19:06.000\nYou kind of, you kind of did like Peter Pan flying like waiting for the wires to do their trick.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nKind of a snack.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nYou same bolts in the starting blocks.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nReady to come up.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nAll right.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:18.000\nMaybe later, Adam.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:21.000\nWait, so, wait, Dave Matthews.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:25.000\nI'm not saying it's, you can't poop on the tour bus because you're not supposed to release\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nit on tourist's heads as you're going over.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nEveryone's in the bathroom.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:33.000\nNo, no, because you live on a bus and you poop on a bus and it smells like poop forever\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nfor the rest of the trip.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nThere's no going backwards from that.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:42.000\nYou are now living in a Chevron men's restroom and you're not supposed to do it.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:47.000\nYou have to ask the driver to pull over and say, I'm going to go make it, you know, make\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\na tutu.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nCan they make a tutu?\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:57.000\nWe got to make Saskatchewan by 1300 to her talk.\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:00.000\nBut I got to make a tutu.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:03.000\nA tutu is going to have to make a kazoo.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:06.000\nWhen we get to, when we get to Flagstaff.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:10.000\nHe's bounding down loaded with a van trucker.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:14.000\nHe thinks Saskatchewan's in the US.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nI really am that.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nI don't.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:20.000\nI'm about to take my lack of...\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nWhere do you think Saskatchewan is?\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nDo you know where Saskatchewan is?\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nIt's in Canada.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nWhere though?\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nPrecisely.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nIt's right above the US.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nI've lived here my whole life.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nI know where Saskatchewan is.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nMy bed.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nMy bed.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nYou go like, I was like, Chicago's down, Saskatchewan's up.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nFrom Milwaukee.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:41.000\nBut for some reason you go through Michigan,\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\neven though it's also down.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nWhere's Belgium?\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:49.000\nThat's, that's, that's East.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nFor sure.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nOh, he's good.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nYeah.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nAll right.\n\n20:56.000 --> 21:00.000\nBut if you go West long enough, I also know you can go everything's also West.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nBecause it's like Pac-Man.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nI know that you will...\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nIt's not the most efficient thing,\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nbut it could be the most strategic in a pinch.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nYou take the, take the tunnel.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nSometimes you got to do it.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nPac-Man fans.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:17.000\nWell, didn't you self-anoint yourself as Pac-Man?\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nWasn't that your nickname for a while?\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nIn the 80s, like how many people, I don't know,\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nyou don't have to applaud or anything, but like,\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:28.000\nthere's like a thing, I think this is like an American thing, like,\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nbecause we're so capitalist and like consumerist,\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:34.000\nwhatever you call it, a snobby languageist.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nLike, you are defined by what you consume and like,\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nyou know, there's not a ton of roller-ranks or anything to it.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:46.000\nYou start buying, you know, you're like,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\noh, I'm into Shira.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.000\nThat's my thing.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:49.000\nLike, I'm the Shira person.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nLike, you look for an identity.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nI think it's a lot easier.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nI think that's why kids seem cooler now.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nIt's not just because I'm getting old.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt's because they have like a subscriber base.\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:01.000\nThey can just be into like bands that they, you know,\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nthat a normal kid would never have heard of.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nBut now you kind of have to, as a kid, you have to survive.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nYou have to kind of pick through scraps and like,\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\npick your own bird food.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:12.000\nYou can't just wait for mama to pop in your mouth.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:15.000\nDave Matthews in your mouth.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nCan't wait for that tour bus to pull up,\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:22.000\nput his hose down here, down your little baby bird billet.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nThat's so great.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nHey guys.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nYou know.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nYou're going to miss this when we're gone.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.000\nYeah.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nYeah, we'll be back.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:36.000\nAre we going to have a triumphant return back here?\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nOur last show should be here, right?\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nThat's what Neil was asking in the green room.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nHe was saying like, so you're going on tour.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:45.000\nNeil, who shall remain unnamed.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nNeil Berkeley filmmaker.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nMr. Fly on the Wall.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nRight.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nMr. Wizard.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nMr. Dumbledore.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nWas that the good guy?\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nWe went through this.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nI don't know the person.\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nNo tangents.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nZero tangent show tonight.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nZero tangent show.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:06.000\nWe got a lot to talk about.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\nHe said, he was saying something that was interesting.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nI was like, do you, well, do you, you know,\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nyou're going out on a big 20 city tour or whatever it is.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nI keep saying 20.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:15.000\nI'm making it up.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:18.000\nBut you have an opportunity to come up with a theme at the top of it.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nI was like, I think he was just, he wasn't,\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nhe didn't really mean that.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nHe just knew that that would make me launch into a thing\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:26.000\nabout how the theme wouldn't, we just have to go out there\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nand do nothing and hope for the best.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nThen he said, this is, I had not considered,\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nI think this is a valid point.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nHe being my dad, if this isn't the movie,\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nwe'll pretend that it wasn't Neil that said this.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nBut I thought it was profound.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nHe said, well, what about these people out here?\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nYou're going to be gone for all that time.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nThey're going to be listening to you every night\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nbecause we're going to podcast.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nWe're taking Dustin Marshall, our producer with us out there.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:50.000\nAnd we're going to be pumping out the jams every night.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:53.000\nI don't expect you to listen to it every night,\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nbut do you guys like nightly jams?\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nYeah.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:59.000\nDo you like them pumped out?\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nAll over your face underneath a bridge?\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nYeah.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nWe're going to Dave Matthews this shit.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nYeah.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nWhat a word you

know if they got it.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:23.000\nThen they get these poor people.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nThey start out, if I know my fairy terminology,\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:28.000\nlike a fairy

24:50.000\nYou're just on a boat for a goddamn minute.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nIt's not the Poseidon adventure.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nJust relax.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nWhat's the worst thing you can do?\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nI don't know why I can't get in my old station wagon\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nand just drive to Sheboygan and stuff.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nSid,

only in the sense of like, I put myself in Adam's\n\n51:56.960 --> 52:00.960\nshoes listening to the most recent recording, where it was basically the only thing I had\n\n52:00.960 --> 52:03.960\ntime to cut out was all of Adam.\n\n52:03.960 --> 52:07.960\nI was so behind schedule because we skipped Thanksgiving, and people are like clamoring\n\n52:07.960 --> 52:11.960\nthat your most important fans are the people that can do without you the least.\n\n52:11.960 --> 52:15.960\nYou want to let them down the least, and I know they're the craziest, but they're the\n\n52:15.960 --> 52:16.960\nmost important.\n\n52:16.960 --> 52:21.960\nYou want to keep feeding them, or your audience will hate you.\n\n52:21.960 --> 52:26.960\nSo I have so much shit to do right now, I'm trying to write a CBS thing and a Fox thing\n\n52:26.960 --> 52:32.960\nand I'm so behind, I got to leave on the 17th for Europe.\n\n52:32.960 --> 52:34.960\nMy life is a nightmare.\n\n52:34.960 --> 52:39.960\nI got these Pat Noswell parties to go to, and I just...\n\n52:39.960 --> 52:44.960\nI don't know why that made me gay.\n\n52:44.960 --> 52:47.960\nThat was a bad choice.\n\n52:47.960 --> 52:50.960\nI was trying to be fancy, not gay.\n\n52:50.960 --> 52:52.960\nI wasn't doing a thing.\n\n52:52.960 --> 52:55.960\nBut I pumped it out.\n\n52:55.960 --> 52:57.960\nI pumped out the jam.\n\n52:57.960 --> 53:00.960\nLike, just Dave Matthews did all over the fucking airwaves.\n\n53:00.960 --> 53:05.960\nBut the one thing I did have time to cut out was Adam Goldberg coming up and reading his\n\n53:05.960 --> 53:06.960\njournals.\n\n53:06.960 --> 53:09.960\nI read my journals, and then Adam comes up and reads his journals.\n\n53:09.960 --> 53:10.960\nAdam was 24.\n\n53:10.960 --> 53:13.960\nHe read his journals from his phone from when he was 20.\n\n53:13.960 --> 53:16.960\nIt didn't have the same panache.\n\n53:16.960 --> 53:21.960\nIt wasn't the... but there was other stuff I could have edited over time.\n\n53:21.960 --> 53:24.960\nBut I didn't get surgical about the backup because I just ran out of time.\n\n53:24.960 --> 53:29.960\nSo it's me and Jesus Diaz talking about the woes of being creative and not fulfilling it.\n\n53:29.960 --> 53:30.960\nThat's unedited.\n\n53:30.960 --> 53:36.960\nBut anyways, the big question is, yeah, and it's not a question I want you guys to answer\n\n53:36.960 --> 53:40.960\nnecessarily because, again, I say it's a coin landing on its edge.\n\n53:40.960 --> 53:42.960\nLike, when are we on Adam's side and when are we against him?\n\n53:42.960 --> 53:46.960\nI was very fascinated by his journals from four years ago because it was a glimpse into\n\n53:46.960 --> 53:49.960\na time when Barack Obama was still in office.\n\n53:49.960 --> 53:52.960\nIt was really an amazing flashback.\n\n53:52.960 --> 53:57.960\nWhen Adam was journaling with his phone back then.\n\n53:57.960 --> 53:58.960\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n53:58.960 --> 53:59.960\nI don't know, man.\n\n53:59.960 --> 54:05.960\nI know that sometimes I feel like when we bring Adam up and then I try to ride the line,\n\n54:05.960 --> 54:08.960\nlike, I want the audience to know, it's like, look, this guy doesn't have a golden ticket\n\n54:08.960 --> 54:09.960\nor anything.\n\n54:09.960 --> 54:11.960\nDon't get mad at him.\n\n54:11.960 --> 54:13.960\nWe'll make fun of him.\n\n54:13.960 --> 54:16.960\nBut then he sits down and then sometimes I feel like, oh, did we just make fun?\n\n54:16.960 --> 54:17.960\nWhat am I?\n\n54:17.960 --> 54:18.960\nHoward Stern?\n\n54:18.960 --> 54:19.960\nI got like a whack pack?\n\n54:19.960 --> 54:21.960\nLike, now what am I doing?\n\n54:21.960 --> 54:24.960\nLike, remember when the guy that was sitting there, where's Big Red?\n\n54:24.960 --> 54:25.960\nBig Red?\n\n54:25.960 --> 54:26.960\nHe's not here?\n\n54:26.960 --> 54:27.960\nYeah.\n\n54:27.960 --> 54:29.960\nI took care of Big Red.\n\n54:29.960 --> 54:37.960\nAdam, if we find out that Big Red has been killed, you're under indictments immediately.\n\n54:37.960 --> 54:41.960\nLast week, Adam just said, I took care of Big Red from the audience.\n\n54:41.960 --> 54:43.960\nI love Big Red.\n\n54:43.960 --> 54:44.960\nCome back, Big Red.\n\n54:44.960 --> 54:49.960\nLast week, there was this guy sitting over here, this huge laugh, super giggly, like really\n\n54:49.960 --> 54:51.960\ninfectious, and everyone loved him.\n\n54:51.960 --> 54:54.960\nAnd it was like, there's a big guy with red hair, and his name was Big Red, and we brought\n\n54:54.960 --> 54:56.960\nhim up, and he was, sorry, I'm Big Red.\n\n54:56.960 --> 54:58.960\nAnd every question he answered, it's like, what's your name?\n\n54:58.960 --> 55:00.960\nI go, you can call me Big Red.\n\n55:00.960 --> 55:02.960\nAnd I go, are you from the area?\n\n55:02.960 --> 55:03.960\nNo, no, sir.\n\n55:03.960 --> 55:08.960\nHe had a laugh like a big Viking dolphin.\n\n55:08.960 --> 55:09.960\nIt was amazing.\n\n55:09.960 --> 55:16.960\nYeah, like a helium, helium, helium zeppelin full of Norse warriors.\n\n55:16.960 --> 55:19.960\nHelium.\n\n55:19.960 --> 55:23.960\nBut then, this is where I started to feel like a bully, because I was like, we have Big Red\n\n55:23.960 --> 55:25.960\nup, so I was like, oh, it's a new character.\n\n55:25.960 --> 55:28.960\nAnd then I started doing the bid of like, oh, I bet Adam Goldberg's really jealous.\n\n55:28.960 --> 55:29.960\nWe brought Adam up.\n\n55:29.960 --> 55:34.960\nAnd then at one point, Adam, of course, he goes like, oh, fuck Big Red, or he mocked\n\n55:34.960 --> 55:37.960\nBig Red's laugh or something, like, Adam's not a hateful person.\n\n55:37.960 --> 55:38.960\nHe's diabolical.\n\n55:38.960 --> 55:39.960\nHe's calculating.\n\n55:39.960 --> 55:43.960\nHe's anything but human.\n\n55:43.960 --> 55:47.960\nBut he's robotic.\n\n55:47.960 --> 55:55.960\nHe's a million flaws, fundamental ones, fundamental ones, like carbon-based flaws.\n\n55:55.960 --> 55:58.960\nBut I don't think he is a hateful person.\n\n55:58.960 --> 55:59.960\nI don't think he's like petty.\n\n55:59.960 --> 56:03.960\nI think all of us are kind of like in a big worm nerd hug here, kind of.\n\n56:03.960 --> 56:08.960\nThe point is that you're not a bully.\n\n56:08.960 --> 56:11.960\nBut I felt like I was pitting.\n\n56:11.960 --> 56:15.960\nI had a flashback that I didn't share with everybody, like the back of the school bus.\n\n56:15.960 --> 56:17.960\nI was like, well, that was a bullying technique.\n\n56:17.960 --> 56:21.960\nWhen bullies would pick on me, I remember sometimes then another thing they'd do is they'd go,\n\n56:21.960 --> 56:24.960\nhey, Dan, what do you think of so-and-so?\n\n56:24.960 --> 56:25.960\nYou know what I mean?\n\n56:25.960 --> 56:26.960\nIt's like a bullying technique.\n\n56:26.960 --> 56:28.960\nIt made me feel like...\n\n56:28.960 --> 56:30.960\nBecause then one person goes like, I don't know.\n\n56:30.960 --> 56:31.960\nHe's wearing a hat.\n\n56:31.960 --> 56:33.960\nYou go, oh, shit.\n\n56:33.960 --> 56:34.960\nOh, shit.\n\n56:34.960 --> 56:37.960\nYou're going to take that from him?\n\n56:37.960 --> 56:39.960\nAnd it's just, it's such bullshit.\n\n56:39.960 --> 56:40.960\nIt's like Nazi bullshit.\n\n56:40.960 --> 56:41.960\nI don't like it.\n\n56:41.960 --> 56:44.960\nAnyways, I mistakenly crossed that line.\n\n56:44.960 --> 56:45.960\nIt wasn't intentional.\n\n56:45.960 --> 56:47.960\nI just think it was behavioral and not intentional.\n\n56:47.960 --> 56:48.960\nI wasn't thinking about it.\n\n56:48.960 --> 56:50.960\nIt made me to pit Adam against Big Red.\n\n56:50.960 --> 56:54.960\nBut Adam, if you killed Big Red, that's fucked up.\n\n56:54.960 --> 56:57.960\nBut, like, I don't know.\n\n56:57.960 --> 56:58.960\nCan we have a little...\n\n56:58.960 --> 56:59.960\nYou have to admire the loyalty.\n\n56:59.960 --> 57:03.960\nWhen Charuse, when Charuse as well again, can we get a little link of maybe it's like\n\n57:03.960 --> 57:04.960\na little Easter egg?\n\n57:04.960 --> 57:06.960\nYou have to search our website.\n\n57:06.960 --> 57:07.960\nFor Adam?\n\n57:07.960 --> 57:08.960\nYeah.\n\n57:08.960 --> 57:11.960\nIt's a really gothy design and music where he's just reading his journal.\n\n57:11.960 --> 57:15.960\nCan Adam just come up as a flash animation about the thing?\n\n57:15.960 --> 57:19.960\nAre you using Safari?\n\n57:19.960 --> 57:23.960\nThis website will function in that web browser, but it would work much better in a Linux-based\n\n57:23.960 --> 57:24.960\nenvironment.\n\n57:24.960 --> 57:25.960\nLadies and gentlemen...\n\n57:25.960 --> 57:30.960\nMeet me down at the bottom and I'll tell you more.\n\n57:30.960 --> 57:31.960\nLet's reintroduce...\n\n57:31.960 --> 57:32.960\nThis is the tour section.\n\n57:32.960 --> 57:40.960\nYou'll find all kinds of concert information and ticket links for all available dates.\n\n57:40.960 --> 57:45.960\nSee you on the next page.\n\n57:45.960 --> 57:46.960\nI found the Goldbug.\n\n57:46.960 --> 57:51.960\nRemember the Richard Scarry books and the Goldbug?\n\n57:51.960 --> 57:52.960\nGoldberg, Goldbug?\n\n57:52.960 --> 57:53.960\nAdam Goldbug.\n\n57:53.960 --> 57:54.960\nIt can't be.\n\n57:54.960 --> 57:55.960\nIt can't be a coincidence.\n\n57:55.960 --> 57:58.960\nDo you know he calls his car the Goldsmobile?\n\n57:58.960 --> 58:03.960\nThat's riveting.\n\n58:03.960 --> 58:08.960\nHe also does better than Chevy would up here.\n\n58:08.960 --> 58:09.960\nI'm telling you that.\n\n58:09.960 --> 58:10.960\nHuh?\n\n58:10.960 --> 58:11.960\nI'm telling you.\n\n58:11.960 --> 58:12.960\nOh, get them of her together.\n\n58:12.960 --> 58:13.960\nYeah.\n\n58:13.960 --> 58:17.960\nChevy would just burst into flames.\n\n58:17.960 --> 58:18.960\nCan we like...\n\n58:18.960 --> 58:20.960\nAre you a queer or...\n\n58:20.960 --> 58:22.960\nCan we do like a mock-up of...\n\n58:22.960 --> 58:23.960\nFuckface.\n\n58:23.960 --> 58:28.960\nLet's do a mock-up of family feud and make them play each other.\n\n58:28.960 --> 58:35.960\nMy targeting system's offline again.\n\n58:35.960 --> 58:44.960\nLet's introduce our Dungeon Master who has been patiently sitting at her Spencer, everyone.\n\n58:44.960 --> 58:50.960\nThe Ayatollah of 20-sided Rola.\n\n58:50.960 --> 58:53.960\nI don't know.\n\n58:53.960 --> 58:58.960\nThe Duke of Dice.\n\n58:58.960 --> 58:59.960\nThat's the only one.\n\n58:59.960 --> 59:00.960\nThat's it.\n\n59:00.960 --> 59:05.960\nThe King of the Caliph of Character Sheet.\n\n59:05.960 --> 59:07.960\nThe Prince of Pencils.\n\n59:07.960 --> 59:10.960\nThere's always a Sultan of something.\n\n59:10.960 --> 59:14.960\nSultan of...\n\n59:14.960 --> 59:15.960\nI like saving throws.\n\n59:15.960 --> 59:16.960\nThe Sultan of saving throws.\n\n59:16.960 --> 59:17.960\nThank you.\n\n59:17.960 --> 59:18.960\nNerd alert.\n\n59:18.960 --> 59:20.960\nOh wait, that doesn't work here.\n\n59:20.960 --> 59:21.960\nNerd alert.\n\n59:21.960 --> 59:27.960\nSpencer, if you would be so kind, bring us up to date on the campaign.\n\n59:27.960 --> 59:31.960\nAlright, let me just let this come down a bit.\n\n59:31.960 --> 59:36.960\nWhen we last met, our heroes had come upon a new old village.\n\n59:36.960 --> 59:41.960\nWhile contemplating their next move, the party was ambushed by Yerch the Knoll.\n\n59:41.960 --> 59:45.960\nThe Knoll identified himself as an allied Knoll of the Blackpaw tribe\n\n59:45.960 --> 59:48.960\nand temporary second in command of the Butts Barbarians.\n\n59:48.960 --> 59:53.960\nYerch told the heroes that this camp belonged to the vile white school Knolls\n\n59:53.960 --> 59:56.960\nand Quark talked to squirrels and shit.\n\n59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.960\nSoon our heroes found themselves in a pit trap facing a deadly gelatinous cube.\n\n01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:05.960\nThrough the magic of unnatural male enhancement and a critical stomp,\n\n01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.960\nthe foe was felled and the friends found freedom.\n\n01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:16.960\nThe Knoll encampment lie ahead and Sharpie's blood-tracking spell pulled them ever forward.\n\n01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.960\nNow you should get her up here.\n\n01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.960\nDo you want to bring Erin?\n\n01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960\nErin McGathy?\n\n01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.960\nAlright, well there's a character secret ahead.\n\n01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.960\nThank you.\n\n01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.960\nNo, I know, I know.\n\n01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.960\nSpencer has become Erin's guardian in D&D.\n\n01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.960\nThere's nothing to apologize, I sleep with her.\n\n01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.960\nI understand the instinct to protect her.\n\n01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.960\nI can't see enough of her.\n\n01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.960\nWelcome Erin McGathy to the stage.\n\n01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.960\nFor better or for worse?\n\n01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.960\nI just spilled vodka all over my face.\n\n01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.960\nFor worse?\n\n01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.960\nI was pinching the cup and I squirted vodka in my face.\n\n01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:12.960\nI will hide the ring a week longer.\n\n01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.960\nNo biggie.\n\n01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.960\nWas that a don't joke about that?\n\n01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.960\nThis feels terrible.\n\n01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.960\nThe right response is don't fucking joke about marrying your girlfriend, it's not funny.\n\n01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.960\nIt's irresistible sometimes.\n\n01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.960\nWomen love jokes about pretending to not want to marry them.\n\n01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.960\nIt's their favorite thing.\n\n01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.960\nOr just teeing up like, yeah, I was married, always hilarious, always helps your relationship.\n\n01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.960\nGood news, I squirted vodka all over my face because I'm wasted, so I won't remember anything.\n\n01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.960\nI always do remember, we make the mistake of playing D&D at the last point in the show,\n\n01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.960\nso no matter how sober I am when I come up here, I'm always like,\n\n01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.960\nI'm wrapped by Spencer's description of what we did last week.\n\n01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:05.960\nBlackpaw Knowles, you say.\n\n01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960\nWhere are we standing, Spencer?\n\n01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:14.960\nYou guys just got out of the pit that you escaped from and now you're running again towards the village.\n\n01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.960\nSo it's me, the village where my dad was going to meet these...\n\n01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.960\nYou came upon the village after casting a blood spell and it pulled you towards your father.\n\n01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.960\nAnd it led you here and then you encountered Yurch and fell in the hole.\n\n01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.960\nAnd these are the bad noles.\n\n01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960\nI just read all this stuff.\n\n01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.960\nThe camp is the bad noles, right?\n\n01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960\nIt's a bad nole camp.\n\n01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960\nBad nole camp, yes.\n\n01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.960\nBut we're with a good nole guide.\n\n01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960\nYeah, he ran away though.\n\n01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.960\nRemember, you pulled a sword on him and then he ran away.\n\n01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960\nWe pulled a sword on him?\n\n01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.960\nYeah.\n\n01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.960\nWere we drunk?\n\n01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.960\nYeah, probably.\n\n01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960\nDo you remember pulling a sword on our guide?\n\n01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.960\nDude, all I remember was talking to squirrels.\n\n01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960\nIt was good.\n\n01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.960\nIt was terrible.\n\n01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.960\nSo we know these are bad noles, but what's the reason that we want to go in there?\n\n01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.960\nWell, my dad is...\n\n01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.960\nIs he a captive in there or something?\n\n01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960\nWell, here's what I remember.\n\n01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960\nMy dad had a deal with the dwarves where...\n\n01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.960\nNot the dwarves.\n\n01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.960\nMy dad had a deal with the good noles that they were going to go take out bad noles along the way.\n\n01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.960\nThis is what our good nole guide said.\n\n01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.960\nAnd they were going to take out a bad nole camp and that was going to be kind of like a quid pro quo thing.\n\n01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.960\nI'll say it right later.\n\n01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.960\nIn ADR.\n\n01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.960\nAnd then Neil will insist on it.\n\n01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.960\nHe's a very rigorous, post-productive director.\n\n01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.960\nNeil Berkeley, everybody.\n\n01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960\nA famous filmmaker.\n\n01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.960\nDocumentary.\n\n01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.960\nDid you know that Wayne White wasn't even in Beauty is Embarrassing?\n\n01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960\nNeil made that character up.\n\n01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.960\nReally?\n\n01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.960\nHe wore a fake beard.\n\n01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.960\nAnd pretended to have worked on Pee-wee Herman.\n\n01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.960\nAnd just shot himself the whole way.\n\n01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.960\nHe loves being on camera.\n\n01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.960\nHe loves being involved.\n\n01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.960\nHe's the Dan Harmon of Documentarians.\n\n01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.960\nHe ends up making everything about himself.\n\n01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.960\nHe just rolls around in a bed of mirrors.\n\n01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.960\nSo many cuts.\n\n01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960\nSo many cuts all over his body.\n\n01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.960\nIf Neil Berkeley ain't in it, it ain't a Neil Berkeley feature.\n\n01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960\nHe chomps a cigar and says that.\n\n01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960\nThat's all in his car.\n\n01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960\nAll right.\n\n01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.960\nStop it.\n\n01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.960\nCan I use move silently to go into the cave?\n\n01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.960\nYeah, you can try and move silently.\n\n01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960\nYeah.\n\n01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.960\nLet's roll for it.\n\n01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.960\nHa-ha!\n\n01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.960\nSilence.\n\n01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.960\nNo, thanks, sir.\n\n01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.960\nYou can't say things out loud when you're moving silently.\n\n01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960\nYou just wasted a move silently.\n\n01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.960\nYou're making a bunch of ruckus.\n\n01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.960\nIndeed, you do make a bunch of ruckus as you make your way towards the Knoll Village.\n\n01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960\nHere we go.\n\n01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.960\nEven still, no one seems to take notice of you.\n\n01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.960\nAll right.\n\n01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.960\nYou do notice flames licking the skins of the dwellings of the Knolls.\n\n01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960\nAnd smoke billows out into the sky.\n\n01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.960\nYou can hear the sounds of screaming and shouting and the ringing of clashing blades.\n\n01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.960\nOh, your dad's in there kicking ass right now.\n\n01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960\nHe's been here.\n\n01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.960\nLet's go in and help.\n\n01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.960\nThese licking flames remind me a lot of the belt that used to lick my ass.\n\n01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.960\nWait.\n\n01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.960\nYour dad licked your ass?\n\n01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.960\nNo, his belt did.\n\n01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.960\nHis belt?\n\n01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.960\nHow do you know it was his belt?\n\n01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.960\nIt's a magical belt.\n\n01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:17.960\nBecause it was hard and held his pants up.\n\n01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.960\nThat's called his dick.\n\n01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.960\nHis dad hit him with a belt.\n\n01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.960\nYou weren't there.\n\n01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.960\nI'm just going on what you give me.\n\n01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.960\nSharpie, I must confess.\n\n01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:35.960\nI am 4,000 years old and I was there.\n\n01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960\nJesus.\n\n01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.960\nHer face is covered in vodka.\n\n01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:48.960\nI feel like there's a battle going on and we owe it to the memory at least of the kinship of your father to go in there and help in this battle.\n\n01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.960\nAlright, let's head towards the fray.\n\n01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.960\nYes, I have many arrows.\n\n01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.960\nLet's go.\n\n01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.960\nShoot him one at a time.\n\n01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.960\nArriving at the village, you're met with a grisly scene.\n\n01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:08.960\nFlames consume the tall grasses surrounding the bone dwellings and wooden furniture, animal hides and all sorts are on fire.\n\n01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.960\nA few of the huts are collapsed as if devastated by a single blow and the corpses.\n\n01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.960\nKnolls lie slain in pools of their own blood, some with vicious gashes.\n\n01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:22.960\nOthers with broken backs and necks and still others torn asunder or cleft in twain.\n\n01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.960\nYou hear the pounding of massive feet shaking the earth and then you see him.\n\n01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.960\nLord Mango Buttsalot.\n\n01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.960\nMango.\n\n01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:41.960\nCan I cheat up his entrance and just let me keep looking at the corpses and then I go, what dire force wrought this?\n\n01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.960\nAnd then you hear the, and the puddles of blood shiver, you know?\n\n01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.960\nYeah.\n\n01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.960\nAnd then he's coming.\n\n01:06:49.960 --> 01:07:01.960\nYour chief of the Butz Barbarian, standing seven feet tall, boasting 380 pounds of raw muscle. The barbarian chief's body is burning red with a bloodlust of a barbarian rage.\n\n01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:10.960\nClad in studded leather armor and wearing a dazzling and magnificent multicolored dream cloak, red, blue and yellow, the colors of the Buttsalot tribe.\n\n01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.960\nHe also wears a great horned helmet and a dazzling magic belt.\n\n01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.960\nUpon seeing you, he just...\n\n01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.960\nI think I know where this is going.\n\n01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:31.960\nUpon seeing you, he charges, barreling at inhuman speeds towards you, swinging a massive anchor as easily as with a were of small wood hatchet and wild dangerous arcs.\n\n01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960\nHe gets like this.\n\n01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.960\nRun!\n\n01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.960\nWe have to wait for his berserker rage to settle out.\n\n01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:48.960\nAnd the fellow barbarian recognize him and jump in the way of Lord Buttsalot and Sharpie and say, no! This is Sharpie!\n\n01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:56.960\nI will say that realizing you are a barbarian and you realize that you don't think you can stop a barbarian with words, but you can try that if you'd like.\n\n01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.960\nIt's like telling Adam Goldberg to come up on stage later.\n\n01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:07.960\nLike it's not a...\n\n01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960\nI can't use my words.\n\n01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.960\nYou definitely can.\n\n01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:15.960\nI mean, I'm just telling you that you know barbarians being a barbarian and they get mindless.\n\n01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.960\nI'm saying get out of it as quickly as I can.\n\n01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.960\nI'm saying he gets like this.\n\n01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.960\nI was raised by a barbarian and I get it.\n\n01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.960\nLet him peter out.\n\n01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.960\nHe's in a rage.\n\n01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.960\nHe's not going to understand anybody.\n\n01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.960\nYou get it, but you're also always fighting against it.\n\n01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.960\nFighting against what? Him?\n\n01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960\nYou.\n\n01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.960\nWhat?\n\n01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.960\nAnd him.\n\n01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.960\nNot by bothered by your idle chit chat.\n\n01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.960\nHe charges, pulling into the group of the three of you.\n\n01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:56.960\nHe manages to knock Dan and Jeff high up into the air and they land flat on their backs.\n\n01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.960\nYou guys each take two damage.\n\n01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960\nWhat?\n\n01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960\nMotherfucker.\n\n01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960\nCan I use my bird?\n\n01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960\nThat would have killed me at level one.\n\n01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.960\nSpencer, may I use my bird to deliver a message to Mango?\n\n01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.960\nI don't think you have a bird.\n\n01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960\nI have a bird.\n\n01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960\nIt says one bird.\n\n01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960\nOh, that's a token.\n\n01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960\nYeah, yeah, you could.\n\n01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.960\nShe's talking about Quall's feather token, you guys.\n\n01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.960\nIt's a magical item that summons a bird that can deliver a message.\n\n01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.960\nThat's what's happening right here.\n\n01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.960\nWhere's your behind the scenes?\n\n01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.960\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.960\nI'm just explaining the game because it's hard.\n\n01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:30.960\nYou're frustrated.\n\n01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.960\nOh, I just sound like a little bitch sometimes.\n\n01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.960\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:34.960\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.960\nYou're my biggest advocate.\n\n01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.960\nYou know I sound like a bad guy.\n\n01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.960\nMulraine is a perfect time to summon a bird.\n\n01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.960\nTwo of your friends lie flat on their backs.\n\n01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.960\nYeah, go get that bird.\n\n01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:52.960\nWell, I wanted to deliver a message to Mango and let him know that that's a lot is his\n\n01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.960\nson with the bird.\n\n01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.960\nUse your mouth to deliver that message.\n\n01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.960\nShut up, Adam.\n\n01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:05.960\nI mean, if my face doesn't deliver that message, my next available turn, I'll use my mouth\n\n01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.960\nto deliver the message.\n\n01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:14.960\nIt's your turn by going, Dad, your noises make no impact on his fragile brain.\n\n01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:15.960\nFragile?\n\n01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.960\nSo my bird, did my bird never go?\n\n01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.960\nYou didn't say a message, so do you want to say a message and then it'll happen?\n\n01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.960\nYes, yes.\n\n01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:34.960\nThe man that you see before you, the bearded, kind-eyed.\n\n01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:49.960\nSpeed it up.\n\n01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:58.960\nHis face looks like you could swear into it.\n\n01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:07.960\nThe kind-eyed, steel-dicked man that you see before you is your son.\n\n01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.960\nIs that what Ian McKellen whispered to that moth?\n\n01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.960\nI always wondered what he would say to that moth and learn of the rings.\n\n01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960\nHe said some shit and then it went away.\n\n01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960\nHe came back and it's like, what did he say?\n\n01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.960\nGo get the eagles.\n\n01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.960\nTell them to come by at just the right time.\n\n01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.960\nI can't believe Adam killed big red.\n\n01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:37.960\nHis lips are like soft valleys that giants roll in after long nights to massage their backs\n\n01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.960\nbecause they're so soft.\n\n01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960\nSorry, guys.\n\n01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.960\nThere's a limit of 100 words on the spell.\n\n01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.960\nThe person that you see is your son.\n\n01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.960\nThat's your son, that little beardy.\n\n01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960\nShe said it.\n\n01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960\nShe clicked send.\n\n01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.960\nShe did it.\n\n01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.960\nShe clicked send.\n\n01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:00.960\nThe coin transforms into a beautiful dove and flies right into the ear of Lord Mango Butzalut.\n\n01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:08.960\nYou hear it tweeting softly and then he claps the side of his face and crumples and falls to the ground.\n\n01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.960\nAre you going to kill your dad?\n\n01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.960\nThe dad just killed the bird.\n\n01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960\nHe heard your message.\n\n01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:20.960\nYou thought the tad crumbled to the ground?\n\n01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.960\nWhy would he kill a bird that talks?\n\n01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.960\nHe's crazy.\n\n01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.960\nHe's in a berserker rage, you guys.\n\n01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.960\nButzalut, can we just kill your dad?\n\n01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.960\nHe seems shitty.\n\n01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.960\nHe just killed a bird who tried to talk to him.\n\n01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.960\nI cast Mage Armor.\n\n01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.960\nYou cast Mage Armor.\n\n01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.960\nI stand up and I look him right in the eye.\n\n01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960\nProm night style.\n\n01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.960\nI don't get the reference.\n\n01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.960\nI don't see things.\n\n01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.960\nI'm sorry, Sharpie, you sure you don't want to send another bird up there?\n\n01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:57.960\nNot the movie prom night.\n\n01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:06.960\nI mean the actual ritual prom night in all adolescents' lives when you finally bear it out and you're fucking dad because he won't give you the keys to the car because he didn't clean your room and you're not supposed to go to prom.\n\n01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:15.960\nOh yeah, actual looking gangly and ridiculous and having your first pubescent showdown with your alcoholic shitty...\n\n01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:24.960\nPubescent showdown is my favorite band.\n\n01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960\nAlright, you cast Mage Armor.\n\n01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.960\nYou have a lot of favorite bands there.\n\n01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.960\nGet it out of your system, old man.\n\n01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.960\nYou couldn't kill me when I was a kid.\n\n01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.960\nMaybe you could finish the job now.\n\n01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:43.960\nGlowing with magic light, he turns and charges directly at you.\n\n01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.960\nRight eyes, bloodshot.\n\n01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.960\nI hold my ground and squint my eyes because I'm a coward but I've made my decision.\n\n01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.960\nThis is how I would like to die.\n\n01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:54.960\nHe hits the axe.\n\n01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.960\nNo, I'm sorry, it's an anchor.\n\n01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.960\nHe swings the anchor in a wild arc and it strikes you directly in the chest.\n\n01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.960\nHe fights with an anchor?\n\n01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.960\nIt's like a belt for a boat.\n\n01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.960\nJesus Christ, my dad.\n\n01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.960\nIt strikes you with such force that it shatters your Mage Armor, dissipating it.\n\n01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.960\nI go into a berserker rage and I attack him to defend my friend's honor.\n\n01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.960\nIt makes adorable.\n\n01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.960\nSo you just jump on him with your sword?\n\n01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.960\nWhat's my crazy sword one, my flaming sword?\n\n01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.960\nI use my flaming sword and go into a rage and attack.\n\n01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.960\nPulling out your flaming sword from its sheath, you go into a rage.\n\n01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.960\nIt's real great.\n\n01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:47.960\nFlying into an angry rage, you launch yourself full of adrenaline towards the barbarian warlord\n\n01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:52.960\nand swing in a masterful, clean stroke.\n\n01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.960\nYou miss.\n\n01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.960\nShit, harmlessly.\n\n01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.960\nThere's got to be some item from my childhood that I can show him in a movie.\n\n01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.960\nCast Magic Scrapbook.\n\n01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.960\nHe never participated in my sticker collection.\n\n01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.960\nThat's half the reason I left.\n\n01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.960\nSharpie, didn't you hang out in his basement a lot?\n\n01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.960\nHis own work lair?\n\n01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.960\nIsn't there some token or memory from that that you could summon?\n\n01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.960\nThat's where you got hit by a belt.\n\n01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.960\nThat's the place where it happened.\n\n01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.960\nWhat did my mom call him?\n\n01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.960\nMango?\n\n01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.960\nAre there some magazines?\n\n01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:40.960\nWhen he hit me and you said my mage armor dispersed, was there any other effect to just take out the mage armor?\n\n01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.960\nYou didn't die, right?\n\n01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.960\nDid it hurt me?\n\n01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960\nIt did not.\n\n01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.960\nNo, the mage armor took the brunt of your attack there.\n\n01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.960\nSo I say, hit me again! I'm your son!\n\n01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.960\nHe doesn't respond to your words. He's in a mindless rage.\n\n01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:01.960\nHis tongue lulls and his eyes roll around in his sockets and he unleashes a mighty roar.\n\n01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:09.960\nOkay, I shoot an arrow at Mango.\n\n01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.960\nYou shoot an arrow from your bow. You strike Mango right in the chest.\n\n01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.960\nYou guys know this as my dad.\n\n01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:25.960\nI wanted to say in a different area other than his chest, but he has a big chest, right?\n\n01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.960\nWhere are my spells, do I?\n\n01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.960\nOh, there they are. I found him.\n\n01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.960\nCome on, don't bully me.\n\n01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.960\nSo is Mango willing to talk now?\n\n01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.960\nNo, he's not.\n\n01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.960\nHe charges like a wounded animal despite taking 14 non-lethal damage.\n\n01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.960\nIt's just like Dan's dad. Hard skin for no reason, Mango.\n\n01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.960\nCharm person!\n\n01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.960\nCharm person fails to affect mindless ragers.\n\n01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960\nI use diplomacy.\n\n01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.960\nYou can use diplomacy.\n\n01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:02.960\nI get diplomatic all over him.\n\n01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.960\nYou fail to get diplomatic all over him.\n\n01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.960\nI'm sorry, you guys. The dice are sucking.\n\n01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.960\nGuys, I'm sorry. I'm a real piece of shit today.\n\n01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:16.960\nYou shoot an arrow at his feet, like both of his feet. I wait until I'm parallel.\n\n01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.960\nSo I can shoot both of his feet with the same arrow.\n\n01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.960\nYes, and then to the other foot.\n\n01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:29.960\nLike it's a little real-world road-wheels challenge where your feet are tied together.\n\n01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.960\nThat's a pretty tough shot to nail there.\n\n01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.960\nYeah, I'm pretty shitty reference, but yeah.\n\n01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.960\nYou fail to meet your mindless.\n\n01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.960\nHypnotism!\n\n01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.960\nIs that one of your things that you just want to talk about?\n\n01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.960\nCan I reject that?\n\n01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.960\nOkay. Do you like how they drive through?\n\n01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.960\nSleep.\n\n01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.960\nSleep. He's entitled to a will save.\n\n01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.960\nOh shit. He falls asleep.\n\n01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.960\nI had to learn to do that.\n\n01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.960\nThat's my origin story.\n\n01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:08.960\nTake his belt off while he's sleeping.\n\n01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.960\nJesus, you guys, that's my dad.\n\n01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.960\nYou shot arrows at his chest.\n\n01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.960\nSo Manko's asleep right now?\n\n01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:15.960\nHe's asleep.\n\n01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.960\nI run up and take his anchor away from him.\n\n01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.960\nWait, don't do anything.\n\n01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.960\nI'm just disarming him.\n\n01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.960\nHe's got friends that are going to think we're trying to kill him.\n\n01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.960\nI run up and I thrust at his head like I'm humping him.\n\n01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.960\nAnd then I giggle and I run away and I'm embarrassed.\n\n01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.960\nI look around for allies of my father.\n\n01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.960\nI take a post-it note, draw dick and balls, put it on his forehead.\n\n01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.960\nYou succeed.\n\n01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:43.960\nNice.\n\n01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.960\nI put his hand in a cup of warm water.\n\n01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:47.960\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960\nNo, I'm not going to fly.\n\n01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:54.960\nI put some dog shit on his finger and tickle his nose.\n\n01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.960\nThere's no dog shit.\n\n01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.960\nJust write racist on his forehead.\n\n01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.960\nCheck out Instagram.\n\n01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.960\nSharpie, do you want us to defeat him or do you want him to join us?\n\n01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.960\nMy first order of business was to get him to stop killing us.\n\n01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.960\nSecond on that list, though, is not have us kill him.\n\n01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.960\nThat's my dad.\n\n01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.960\nHe came here to meet him.\n\n01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.960\nOf course.\n\n01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.960\nI'm looking around for his attendants.\n\n01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.960\nYou don't see any attendants.\n\n01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.960\nThe burning Nolan campman seems rather barren.\n\n01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.960\nIt seems like everyone who could die is already dead.\n\n01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.960\nCan I give Mango Betsalup my bedroll?\n\n01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.960\nYeah, well, he's unconscious, so he can't accept it.\n\n01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.960\nLike, you could place it on him or something.\n\n01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.960\nYeah, I'm going to...\n\n01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.960\nOr you could tuck him in, I guess.\n\n01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.960\nMulrainee, Mulrainee, put a bedroll on him.\n\n01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.960\nHere's my sincere advice.\n\n01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960\nHe was in a berserker rage.\n\n01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.960\nThat's why everyone here is dead.\n\n01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960\nThat's why he's the leader of his tribe.\n\n01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.960\nHe's not himself when he's in that mode.\n\n01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.960\nIf we tie him up and take all his shit when he wakes up,\n\n01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.960\nhe'll actually be pissed at us normal, like sober.\n\n01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.960\nIf we just let him have his shit, he'll wake up normal.\n\n01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.960\nHe's not going to be in a berserker rage when he wakes up.\n\n01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:08.960\nLike, he'll be normal.\n\n01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:09.960\nHe's still my dad.\n\n01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.960\nHe's not going to kill us when he wakes up.\n\n01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.960\nSharpie, when was the last time that you and your dad\n\n01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.960\nhad a really nice time together?\n\n01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:16.960\nShould we try to recreate that?\n\n01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.960\nWell, I don't want to play the blame game.\n\n01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.960\nI don't come from that school of therapy.\n\n01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.960\nIt wasn't a positive relationship.\n\n01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.960\nI left and became a wizard, but, you know...\n\n01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.960\nBut if he was there a time like your last good memory with him,\n\n01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.960\nlike, can we position him in a certain way?\n\n01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.960\nI don't think there's any manipulating this guy.\n\n01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.960\nI think he's kind of salt of the earth type,\n\n01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.960\nand manipulation is more...\n\n01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.960\nWell, like, can we eat his organs?\n\n01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:47.960\nI feel like I'm talking to, like, an artificial intelligence.\n\n01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:50.960\nI don't know what you're saying has to do with what I'm...\n\n01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.960\nBut what my recommendation is that we prop the guy up\n\n01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.960\nin a comfortable position with his weapons in hand\n\n01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.960\nand wait for him to wake up a normal guy.\n\n01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960\nHe's not going to like me when he wakes up,\n\n01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.960\nbut he's not going to try to kill us.\n\n01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.960\nHe's my dad.\n\n01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.960\nI summon a squirrel.\n\n01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:11.960\nIt's the same day as the last day we met,\n\n01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.960\nand you can only cast Speak with Animals once per day.\n\n01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.960\nI'll bite my time.\n\n01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.960\nI have a flashback.\n\n01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.960\nYou have a flashback to when?\n\n01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.960\nTen years old.\n\n01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.960\nTen years old.\n\n01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:32.960\nI choose Jeff Davis to play the role of young Lord Buttsalot,\n\n01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:39.960\na barbarian in the tower of wherever I grew up when I was 10.\n\n01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.960\nI'll play the tower.\n\n01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:47.960\nIt's like, why is there a phone call over this tower?\n\n01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.960\nGod damn it, I've been working all day,\n\n01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.960\nbut kicking Noel's asses instead of a bit.\n\n01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960\nFather.\n\n01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.960\nWhat?\n\n01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.960\nI've been thinking about what you said.\n\n01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.960\nI don't give two shits.\n\n01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.960\nI don't pay you to think.\n\n01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.960\nI don't even pay you.\n\n01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.960\nYou said that I'd never make a good barbarian.\n\n01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960\nI know that.\n\n01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.960\nLook at you.\n\n01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.960\nYou don't have the forearms.\n\n01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.960\nWhat of magic, Father?\n\n01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.960\nMagic.\n\n01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.960\nLa-di-da.\n\n01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.960\nI like magic.\n\n01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.960\nI'm going to go hang out with Patton Oswald at magic parties.\n\n01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.960\nMagic can be used to defeat monsters and gain treasure,\n\n01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.960\nsame as churrism.\n\n01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960\nShow me some magic.\n\n01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.960\nRight now, prove it to me.\n\n01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:44.960\nYou just pooped in the carpet.\n\n01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.960\nThat's not magic.\n\n01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.960\nThat's disgusting.\n\n01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.960\nAnyone can poop in the carpet.\n\n01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.960\nLook, I cast magic fart.\n\n01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.960\nI need to go abroad and study it.\n\n01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.960\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.960\nBeing a barbarian is not good enough for you, huh?\n\n01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:02.960\nI didn't say that.\n\n01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:03.960\nI'm not good enough.\n\n01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.960\nYou always say I'm not good enough.\n\n01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.960\nYou're not good enough.\n\n01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.960\nLet me be good enough.\n\n01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.960\nLet me do what I'm good at.\n\n01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:16.960\nI'm made of stone.\n\n01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.960\nWe live in a magic tower.\n\n01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.960\nWhy can't I go to a magic place and apply my train?\n\n01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:22.960\nYou know what?\n\n01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.960\nDo it.\n\n01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:24.960\nYou go.\n\n01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.960\nYou go.\n\n01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.960\nJust leave.\n\n01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:35.960\nAnd I'll see you in about 15 years, 20 years.\n\n01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960\nDon't be proud of me.\n\n01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.960\nWell, maybe I won't.\n\n01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:39.960\nMaybe I won't.\n\n01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:40.960\nMaybe I'll be too busy.\n\n01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.960\nYou've got to save the world from the evil mole ganks.\n\n01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.960\nAnd maybe I won't care about magic,\n\n01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.960\nbecause maybe magic doesn't put bread on the table.\n\n01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.960\nMaybe sometimes using your big forearms does.\n\n01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.960\nMagic can totally put bread on the table.\n\n01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.960\nDo it.\n\n01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.960\nShow me.\n\n01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:57.960\nShow me right now.\n\n01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:58.960\nShow me right now.\n\n01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.960\nShow me right now.\n\n01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:02.960\nDon't poop on this table, son.\n\n01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.960\nGet out of my weird drunk castle.\n\n01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.960\nI cast I hate you.\n\n01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.960\nI never want to see you again.\n\n01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.960\nAgain.\n\n01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.960\nAgain.\n\n01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.960\nAgain.\n\n01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.960\nAgain.\n\n01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.960\nYou snap back into the real world.\n\n01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.960\nYou feel in a confusing mix of emotions,\n\n01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.960\nof passions, of adrenaline, of memories,\n\n01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:30.960\nof timelines weaving past and present.\n\n01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:31.960\nYou level up.\n\n01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:32.960\nWhat?\n\n01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:33.960\nOh!\n\n01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.960\nFlashback, level up.\n\n01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.960\nFlashback, level up.\n\n01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.960\nYou can level up by having a memory.\n\n01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.960\nThat's the best D&D game ever.\n\n01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.960\nAll right.\n\n01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960\nLet's have it for Spencer.\n\n01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.960\nLet's end there when we level up.\n\n01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960\nThat's right.\n\n01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.960\nStop in a video game when we level up.\n\n01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.960\nTake our time to pick those new skills.\n\n01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.960\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960\nSpencer, everybody.\n\n01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960\nAll right.\n\n01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.960\nErin McAfee.\n\n01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960\nI didn't know.\n\n01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.960\nYou know, Neil, who doesn't exist,\n\n01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.960\nhad to say to me,\n\n01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960\nI think D&D's the highlight.\n\n01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.960\nI think you gotta figure out a way\n\n01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.960\nto play D&D on the road.\n\n01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960\nYou mean Neil Berkeley,\n\n01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.960\nthe megalomaniac filmmaker?\n\n01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.960\nThe Dennis Hopper of documentaries.\n\n01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.960\nThe Morgan Sperlock of our movie.\n\n01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.960\nMan, I don't know what you intended to do,\n\n01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960\nbut I'm in this thing.\n\n01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.960\nIt's about me now.\n\n01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.960\nI mean,\n\n01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.960\nI wish my name was Neil Berkeley.\n\n01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.960\nBecause it's got me in it.\n\n01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.960\nAnd I.\n\n01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.960\nThere's no Neil in team.\n\n01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.960\nThere's some of it,\n\n01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.960\nbut you have to deconstruct it.\n\n01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.960\nThat's all I'm gonna do.\n\n01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:49.960\nI'm just saying,\n\n01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.960\nas an example,\n\n01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.960\nhe's sitting at his three Amstels.\n\n01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.960\nI'm still trying to get him\n\n01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960\nto agree to do the thing.\n\n01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.960\nHe immediately mentions,\n\n01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.960\nD&D's the thing.\n\n01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.960\nIt gave me a renewed vigor.\n\n01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.960\nI think we played better D&D tonight.\n\n01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:02.960\nBecause.\n\n01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.960\nStacks are higher.\n\n01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960\nAnd like, yeah, it's like.\n\n01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.960\nBecause we're going in an actual campaign.\n\n01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.960\nHe may not.\n\n01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.960\nYou and I are going in an actual.\n\n01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.960\nCampaign.\n\n01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:10.960\nCampaign across the front.\n\n01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:11.960\nAcross the front.\n\n01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.960\nIn search of riches and glory.\n\n01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:14.960\nYeah.\n\n01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.960\nCan I describe it dramatically?\n\n01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:17.960\nOh, I wish you would.\n\n01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:18.960\nYes.\n\n01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:19.960\nWell, not like,\n\n01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.960\nI'm

01:26:25.960\nIn a cramped tour bus\n\n01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.960\non a state highway somewhere.\n\n01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:28.960\nYeah.\n\n01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:29.960\nSee you later.\n\n01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:30.960\nAll right.\n\n01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.960\nI hit the wrong button.\n\n01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960\nIt's come that.\n\n01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.960\nIt's come that time in the Harmontown Show.\n\n01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960\nOh, that sounded like.\n\n01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960\nThat sounded like a good.\n\n01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960\nIt was like.\n\n01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960\nThat's what we lack in our show.\n\n01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960\nLike where it has that kind of like.\n\n01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.960\nHey, bring it at home.\n\n01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:45.960\nKind of like.\n\n01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:46.960\nSo the audience.\n\n01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960\nOkay.\n\n01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.960\nIt shows fucking

being\n\n01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:52.960\nthree and a half hours long.\n\n01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.960\nThe good thing about the show\n\n01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.960\nis that the energy is freewheeling,\n\n01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.960\nbut the only downside of that is always\n\n01:26:58.960 --> 01:26:59.960\nthe paying the paper at the end\n\n01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:00.960\nbecause they go like,\n\n01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.960\nwho's going to end it?\n\n01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:02.960\nHe's a loser.\n\n01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.960\nYou are Dan.\n\n01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.960\nSo

it\n\n01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.960\nby not being in it.\n\n01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.960\nWe learned that Adam.\n\n01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.960\nWe didn't learn shit about Adam.\n\n01:27:32.960 -->
