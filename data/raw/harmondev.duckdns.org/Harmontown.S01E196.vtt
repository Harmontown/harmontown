{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:27.000\nFrom Hollywood, California at Meltdown Comics, the Nerdist leader Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:41.000\nSpencer Crittenden, everybody. Spencer!\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:50.000\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:53.000\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\n00:53.000 --> 01:00.000\nWhat's up, Dan? I thought I had a new note-taking method, but I don't know if it's working very well.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:04.000\nThanks for coming.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:12.000\nThose of you that did, is it a Mother's Day? We got some late ticket sales, Mother's Day Game of Thrones, maybe?\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.000\nIt's not funny, you guys.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nDid you call your mom today?\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\nI threw her a text.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:21.000\nWhat was your text?\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:30.000\nI just texted her a bunch of Game of Thrones spoilers. She's the season behind, so...\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:33.000\nAnd she's like, what are you doing? You're ruining everything.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nAnd I said, I didn't ask to be born!\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:38.000\nAnd then I hung up, even though it was text.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nAre you Ironborn?\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.000\nI am Ironborn. Thank you for asking.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:52.000\nMan, that Game of Thrones, huh? That's a tough game.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:56.000\nI can't tell who's winning, who's losing. It's hard to keep track.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:00.000\nI think you either win or you die. I don't even think you can lose.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nI like...\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nThe guy, now that...\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:08.000\nWhat's her name? Circe, who has...\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:11.000\nWho's the big fucker that just now heard like her champion?\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:12.000\nThe mountain.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:17.000\nAnd he's like a crazy zombie mountain guy, and he's just smashing dudes.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nIt's the best...\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:23.000\nAs promised, yeah. I mean, I kept thinking, are they really going there with that?\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nAnd yeah, I guess that's what he's going to do.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:30.000\nI told you backstage last week that you asked about Jon Snow.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:32.000\nI said he's going to get smoke-pussied.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:36.000\nAnd smoke-pussied is fucking... Yeah, she did it.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nIt was a little more artisanal than that, but...\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nI don't think that's a spoiler, because even people who...\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nShe got smoke-pussied. He got smoke-pussied.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:51.000\nBut he's been... Kit Harrington's been on the key art and all that stuff, so...\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nHow was your week, Dan? What did you do? I haven't talked to you in a while.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:59.000\nYou know, I've been just... I've been working, man. It's unremarkable.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:02.000\nThis gives me a terrible show, by the way. Terrible show.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:05.000\nAll you do is work now. You work, work, work, work.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:09.000\nThat's why it's going to be terrible. And when I'm not working, I've acquired this horrible habit.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:17.000\nI'm headlong into a horrible, debilitating addiction to incremental tap games.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nNow I know what they're called. That was the first step.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nSomebody said, oh, incremental tappers. And I was like, incremental tappers?\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nThat's these games that I've just descended.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nNow I just have five games. I switch back and forth between them on my iPad.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nIt was just like, you just tap a cookie, and then you make nine cookies,\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:38.000\nand then you can get a super cookie, and then you just keep tapping the super cookie\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nor whatever, you just build a bakery, and then it's just like...\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:46.000\nAnd then if you hit a plateau, it's like, oh, it looks like it's going to take an hour to build\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nto like super, super chocolate chip level, and then you switch over to a thing\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nwhere you're like on a moon, and you just like keep hitting the crater,\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:56.000\nand it's like fucking things, and then you make a bulldozer to like...\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:01.000\nIt's insane. It's insane. There's three games. Tapped Titans.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:07.000\nI keep switching between that, and I think the same people make Tapped Tycoon.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:12.000\nThese are quality tap games, but they're bad for your life,\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:17.000\nand then Tapped Galaxy, which is more of an eight-bit affair, where you just...\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nTalk me through Tapped Tycoon. What goes on there?\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nTapped Tycoon, you're a little guy.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:26.000\nRemember I told you guys about the adventure capitalist where you just hit the buttons\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:29.000\nthat represent the businesses? Well, this one's a little more stylized graphically.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:33.000\nThere's a little guy, and then if you tap the air above him, dollars form,\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:37.000\nand he grabs him and stuffs him in his little pockets,\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:43.000\nand then over time you can buy businesses, and it's really just the same game,\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nbut it's just like there's a little dude jumping around.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nSo you really are just tapping things?\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nYeah, you really do just tap, and obviously if my therapist were here,\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\nas you would say, so in other words, you've found a way to keep your wheels spinning\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:01.000\nwith reduced accountability. There's no chance of choosing right or wrong.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nThere's no humans to interact with or disappoint.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:09.000\nIt's amazing that even a regular video game would be too much.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:13.000\nNow I've been reduced to just... I'm just free-basing dopamine.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:19.000\nI got up in New York through the weekend,\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:23.000\nand I was hungover. I had a wonderful time with my lover,\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:29.000\nand we have a great time, but I sat up, and I looked in the mirror that was next to the bed,\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:36.000\nand I said, oh my god, I'm a gorilla, and someone should just teach me sign language.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:42.000\nI bet it would be easier for me to learn sign language.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:49.000\nSo my chiropractor, every time I miss a session, he texts me...\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nWhat does he say?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nHe texts me too. He texts both of us.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.000\nFor real?\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:56.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nDoes he group text you?\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nNo, no. He texts us both separately.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nLet's see. I'm trying to find his...\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:09.000\nThis is what I got. You can't see this, but it's all the same.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:14.000\nThey all say, hi, Dan, you missed your appointment today at 9.30.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:18.000\nWill you be able to make it up on Thursday at 9.30?\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:23.000\nDoctor, and I wish I could tell you his name, because you'd be like, what?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nIs it a funny name?\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:32.000\nWell, it's his first name, so it's like Dr. Gary, but it's worse.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nIt's like...\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nMinus Dr. Doug.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nHe looks like a sexy George Clooney.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:40.000\nWhen did these guys get to...\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nA sexy George Clooney?\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nHe looks sexier than George Clooney.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nHow do you... I can't even picture that.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nI know. And then he cracks your back.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.000\nYou're like, fucking sexy George Clooney, just fucked me up. This is the best.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nHow come these guys get to call themselves doctors as long as they don't use a last name?\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nThat seems problematic.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nOh, by the way, problematic.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:11.000\nI had a delightful conversation with a millennial that brought me another step further into my relationship with atoning with them.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:17.000\nThis person, everything about them on paper, it should have been just a bad evening of talking to them,\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:24.000\nbecause they're getting their degree, and it's just something that suggests that the world is fucked.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:31.000\nActually, it was very interesting. It was transatlantic colonial literature, but I wanted to be funny, and I wasn't.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nBut she was talking about...\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nWe were just talking about...\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:44.000\nBecause she's studying literature, particularly with a view on, because it's the slavery period, it's imperialism, colonialism,\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nand that's what she's mostly interested in.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:52.000\nAnd so we were talking about slavery within literature, mythology, and all this stuff.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:56.000\nAnd she used this verb that I'd never heard before.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:02.000\nShe was like, what I'm trying to do with my latest paper is I'm problematizing this, and this, and that, and problematizing.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:06.000\nAnd I was like, wait, wait, you're problematizing?\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nAnd she's like, yeah. And I'm like, wait, oh, shit.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:14.000\nI got really excited, because she... And I said, I don't ever hear the word problematic.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nAnd she's like, yeah, problematic.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nProblematizing is the act of making something problematic, is figuring out that it is.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, but that's so much better.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:27.000\nAnd she goes, I know, because it's something I do, and not something that you're pointing at and saying that is something.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nI was like, yes, yes. God damn it.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:33.000\nYou can just smile and say, I love problematizing.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nAnd you wouldn't come off like such a fucking jagoff.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:41.000\nYou know? I enjoy problematizing.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:45.000\nThat's why I'm so goddamn happy.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nIt's a thing I like to do.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:53.000\nIt's like the equivalent of vandalism, only instead of a brick wall, it's your buzz, you know?\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nLike, it's fun. I'm going to put my mark on it.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nI like to problematize.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\nAnd it's actually, you know, and I looked it up, you know, it's a real thing.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:09.000\nAnd I was like, wait, okay, yeah, problematization, you can't say it if you've had a single drink.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:18.000\nBut it's to consider the concrete or existential elements of a term, writing, opinion, ideology, identity, or person as challenges,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:23.000\nproblems, that invite people involved to transform those situations.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:27.000\nIt's a method of defamiliarization of common sense.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:32.000\nSee, that sounds punk rock and lateral and inventive and interesting.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nI think it's what we keep...\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\nSo how do I problematize something? What does that mean?\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nWell, let's problematize Mother's Day.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nLike, okay, well, like...\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nFinally.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:49.000\nWell, they list, I mean, it would be problematic to tell you how to problematize, but they...\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nBecause who are you?\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nYou know?\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nOh, Wikipedia is telling me how to problematize.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:00.000\nBut the sort of what process is sort of to ask the questions.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nWho is making this statement?\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nFor whom is he or she making it?\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nWhy is the statement being made here and now?\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nWhom does this statement benefit?\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nWhom does it harm?\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.000\nSorry, that's a good way of picking something apart.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:20.000\nEspecially though, what I really like is the invitation of people involved to transform something.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nAnd I think that's what gets left out a lot.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.000\nI think that if you're... Like, so to problematize Mother's Day, it'd say, like,\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:29.000\nyou'd have to ask, like, well, who came up with Mother's Day?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nYou know?\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nThat would require some research or a bunch of assumptions.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nI think a hallmark, right?\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nYou'd have to look it up.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:42.000\nThat's the other problem, is that a lot of problematization seems to be a kind of hobby.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:47.000\nWhen it's based on zero research, then you're all the way into just kind of saying, like,\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:52.000\nhey, this sketch offended me.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nWho is making this sketch?\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:58.000\nWell, you're either going to say the writers, and then you've got to get into all kinds\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:03.000\nof problematic conversations about, was it a black writer?\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nWas it a white writer?\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:07.000\nIf it was, like, for instance, like a sketch that was like the black news,\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nand it was pointing out that black people have a different point of view.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:17.000\nAnd now you're bringing a bag in there into that airport and, like, unloading it.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:21.000\nOr you have to be so vague that it doesn't sound as provocative.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nLike, you'd have to go, just people.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nOr just the media.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nThe media's at it again.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nThe media's talking to whom?\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:30.000\nThe underclass?\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nThe impressionable?\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:32.000\nBlack people?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:33.000\nWhite people?\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:34.000\nThe audience?\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:35.000\nJust people?\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:40.000\nYou'd have to be subjective and speculate and assume, or you'd have to, like, just be\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.000\nreally vague and say, there's a box in my living room that I don't know how it works.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nAnd I read some stuff online about kind of how it works.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nSo I'm making some assumptions about maybe the intention of this thing,\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nand I'm kind of problematizing it.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:57.000\nI think the danger there is the, obviously, problematizing while fun.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nAnd I think it's great to say I love doing it.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:03.000\nI think that kind of, like, it obviously doesn't invite discourse.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nSo this is the problem that you see online all the time.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nIt's just, like, it's the white redditor going, like, actually, actually, and, like,\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\ntrying to problematize the problematization that's being brought up\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nproblematically.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:18.000\nBecause you can't, if somebody tells you that you're, because remember,\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:22.000\nto problematize something is not to ask a question.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nIt's not to provide any information.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:30.000\nIt's actually, just to put it in the most simple terms, it's to take something that\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\neveryone is assuming in the room, and then to start to ask, why are we assuming\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nthis?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nWhich is very healthy if you're dealing with, for instance, the Catholic Church\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nsaying, like, no, this isn't a pedophile.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nAnd ask the question, is it?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nAnd then you go, oh, look at that.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nIt is.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nBut there's some research involved there, and there's some, and there's that\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:50.000\ninvitation to transform.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nIt's like, what are we going to do about this?\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:57.000\nBut if you, so if you invite somebody to transform circumstances that they're\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:02.000\nassuming in a negative way, that could be somebody sitting in a room and they're\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:07.000\nwearing a hat, and you just go, you should take that hat off, because I'm\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:12.000\nlooking at your hat in a different way, and I've found it problematic.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:16.000\nAnd not only am I just complaining about it, I'm actually also inviting you,\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:20.000\nthe person involved with your hat, to transform, to partake part in its\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\ntransformation.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nAnd the problem there, and maybe your hat has a swastika on it.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:27.000\nSo this is a good thing, maybe, if maybe you're in a synagogue.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:31.000\nLike, there is context, and context, and context.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nMaybe your hat is genuinely problematic.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:39.000\nThe problematic nature of problematization inherently is that if that person\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:42.000\nisn't wearing a swastika on their hat, and you aren't in a synagogue,\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nthey're just a dude with a hat on.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:49.000\nSo if they say anything at all, you're already in a conflict, you set the\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\ntable for conflict.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:54.000\nThat's why it's probably called problematization.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nNot because you're just finding them.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nYou're causing problems.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nYou're saying, take your hat off.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:02.000\nAnd if the person ignores you, they're a fucking asshole.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:06.000\nAnd if they say, I have a problem with your problematization of my hat,\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nthen they're, you know, hat-splaining to you.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:15.000\nAnd if somebody starts problematizing your problematization, what are you\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\ngoing to do?\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nStop and go, you're right.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nProblematization is very problematic.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nStop it immediately.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nNo, you're going to say, stop hat-splaining my problematization.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nI'm trying to do something.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nSo it's not really an activity.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nI'm still confused.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nI still don't know.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:35.000\nWell, it's not a group activity problematization.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:40.000\nBut when you problematize, is it an active thing?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nIt's a method of criticism.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nRight.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.000\nIt's an algorithm for criticism, maybe put it that way.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nIs it good or is it bad?\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:56.000\nI think it's good one time per conversation at the top of it and needs to be heavily\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:01.000\nmitigated with the expectation that somebody might tell you to go fuck yourself because\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:05.000\nyou haven't done any research and don't know what you're talking about.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:10.000\nBecause it takes a really, really, really long time to see a sketch on a television\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:17.000\nshow, to go from there to writing an essay about it, requires more than typing.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:22.000\nI think unless you're going to just make people laugh, if you're really going to try to make\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:28.000\npeople think and provide new information, you're going to have to call somebody at the production\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:31.000\noffice of that show and ask who wrote this?\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nWhat were the circumstances?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nWhere did the sketch originate from?\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nHow was your show structured?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nWhat does your writer's room look like?\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nWas there rewrites on this thing?\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nHow did it end up being this particular sketch?\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:45.000\nThen you have to go around and find out how people received it and what happened.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:50.000\nThen you have to still bring in all kinds of speculation about who benefited and who's\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nsuffering.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nAll those things are going to be really subjective.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:54.000\nNow here's the thing.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:58.000\nThere are situations in which it's not subjective at all and it's really easy.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:02.000\nThose things seem to be our Teflon for problematization.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nLike, god damn it, I hate this fucking word.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:08.000\nDonald Trump comes pre-problematized.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nYou can't fucking touch the guy.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:14.000\nHe's a Rubik's Cube and all the colors are the same on every side.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:25.000\nIf a senator says, arts education is a waste of money in urban schools because urban kids\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:30.000\ntend to get urban shots, you can problematize the shit out of that and start talking about\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:33.000\nhow urban probably means black and blah, blah, blah.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:39.000\nIf someone says all Mexicans are rapists, do you have nothing to do but go fly a kite?\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nHe's like, who's making this statement?\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.000\nDonald Trump.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nWhy is he making it?\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nTrump supporters.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nWhy is he making it?\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nTo get votes.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:48.000\nWho's suffering?\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nMexicans.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nWho's gaining?\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nAngry white people.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\nYou're done.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nThere's nothing to do.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:59.000\nThe danger of that is that if we're addicted as a culture to problematizing as an activity,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:04.000\nit might just be that we think that when we're done doing that, we're done doing everything\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:09.000\nand that we don't then do what Woodward and Bernstein did, which is take down a fucking\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\ndude.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nTake him down.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:14.000\nOpen books, go meet with people in parking garages.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:18.000\nBut how do you take somebody down who takes himself down constantly?\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:22.000\nWell, there's got to be shit that this guy, I mean, it's got to be all the worse.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nThe guy is a pathological liar.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:24.000\nI don't know.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:29.000\nI mean, I saw that vanity fair piece from the 90s.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:31.000\nIt's all out there.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:34.000\nIt's like he had Hitler's speeches next to his bed.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nI guess you're right.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.000\nNo, I don't know what to do.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nThere's got to be a way.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nThere's got to be a way to find out or to figure out that we don't have to.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nI was at Dino's today.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:44.000\nDino had a barbecue and there was these...\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nAnd Donald Trump was there.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nThese directors were there.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:55.000\nAnd one of the directors was saying the guy that's doing the Albert Brooks and Louis C.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:56.000\nK. thing.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:57.000\nAnd these guys were there.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:02.000\nAnd one of the guys says, apparently, Hitler was really into poop.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:08.000\nHe and Eva Braun, their housekeeper had to keep changing their sheets because every time\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nthey got together, there was shit everywhere.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:18.000\nAnd so he was saying, apparently, Hitler was really into scat play and the pooping.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:26.000\nAnd Dino goes, don't ruin Hitler for me.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nMeaning don't dimensionalize him.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nKeep him Dracula for me.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nHe's just like a character.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:38.000\nIt's like the girl with the skunk hair on the arches.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nHitler's here.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nHe wants the band to fail.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nThat's it.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nDon't tell me when he goes home he has interesting things going on.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:49.000\nWe keep finding out that Hitler had a micro penis.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nHe had one testicle.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:53.000\nHe likes to poop on people.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:57.000\nHe was just a bad guy.\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:00.000\nHe peed on his nephew.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:05.000\nHe peed on his nephew, says somebody in the crowd.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:10.000\nIs that verifiable evidence?\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nHe peed on his nephew.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:18.000\nUnder what circumstances?\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:21.000\nAll right, now.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:27.000\nWho is making this statement?\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nDan, are you going to problematize that statement?\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nSome kind of Hitler hater.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nFor whom is he or she making it?\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:38.000\nDo you know why Hitler killed himself?\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nI know.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:46.000\nHe saw his gas bill.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nIt's true.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nIt's true.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:53.000\nHe said he offers up.\n\n19:53.000 --> 20:02.000\nThat's verifiable, unproblematizable fact.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nYeah, whatever.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nThat was a bad Hitler joke.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nIt's a great Hitler joke.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nHere's why.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:15.000\nNo, it takes the actual gas part and it trivializes it.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nThat is problematic.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nSo there.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:26.000\nThe funny Hitler jokes are like, oh, do you know why he never drank?\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\nWhy?\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nHe was an angry drunk.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nNot as funny as the gas one.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:35.000\nWell, I don't tell jokes very well, but it's just like,\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\nwhen you use Hitler as an Abe Lincoln or a Dracula,\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nwhere it's just like, oh, you have to invite him in\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:43.000\nbefore he can come in, Hitler has those little rules.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:46.000\nBut then the actual minutiae of the extermination\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nand then in addition to that, taking that and going like,\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:52.000\noh, what a Monday.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:57.000\nAll right.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nBut with any joke, when you walk through this process,\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nI don't know if this is a flow trick.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nWho is making this statement?\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nSomeone telling a joke.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nFor who are they making it?\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nAn audience.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nWhy is the statement being made?\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nThe person is trying to be funny.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nWho does it hurt?\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nWho does it benefit?\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nAnyone that laughs?\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nWho does it hurt?\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nAnyone that doesn't?\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nI mean, that's kind of been known for a while.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nIt's not going to get you anywhere either, is it?\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nThat's your current favorite joke.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:21.000\nOr all problematization is like, who's problematizing?\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nAcademics.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nFor whom are they doing it?\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nAcademics.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nWhy are they doing it here and now?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:29.000\nFor academia.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:33.000\nPossibly to justify the existence of academia.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nWho does that benefit?\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nAcademics.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nWho does it hurt?\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:45.000\nPeople who would otherwise maybe do shit.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:49.000\nOkay, but that's just me dumb-splaining.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nSpencer, you talked to your mom today?\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nI mean, I texted her.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nSure.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nI said, happy Mother's Day.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nNo, I don't know.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:06.000\nShe texted me a couple days ago was like, am I going to see you on Mother's Day?\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:11.000\nIt was just like one of these things where it's like, oh, I guess I'm not going to text\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nyou for two or three days.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nSo it's just like, I don't want that, man.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:17.000\nI don't need that.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.000\nYou're texting me.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nAm I going to see you texting me?\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nAnd you know, that's what I want to know.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:25.000\nI don't want to know that.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nI don't know.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nIt just sucks, man.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nIt sucks.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:29.000\nI hate my parents.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.000\nI hate my family.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nI hate everything.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nIt's no good.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nMy grandpa's dead.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nHe's fine.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nNo.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nI mean, he's dead, but he's fine.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:40.000\nLike, no, it's fine.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:43.000\nWas he fine before he was dead or he's fine now that he is dead?\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nHe's fine now that he's dead.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nYeah.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nSo, I don't know.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nYou're not pals with your parents at all?\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nNo, no.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:53.000\nThey were, they were, no, no.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:57.000\nThey were, no, no.\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nYeah, no.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:03.000\nDo you think there's a day that you might be like, come back around to be friends with\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nthem?\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:09.000\nThese are the times that it would be happening and I'm really going in the opposite direction.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:13.000\nSo, I mean, I got to figure that out if I want that to happen.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nWhat would have to happen for you to become friends with them?\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:16.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:20.560\nIt's just, it's so much, so much, it's all like nickel and dime shit, you know?\n\n23:20.560 --> 23:22.800\nIt's not like some big falling out happened.\n\n23:22.800 --> 23:25.720\nIt's just like, this happens all the time and this happens all the time.\n\n23:25.720 --> 23:28.560\nAnd at the end of the day, it's like, I don't want most of that.\n\n23:28.560 --> 23:32.160\nSo I'm, I'm, I'm here, you know, that's why I'm here.\n\n23:32.160 --> 23:36.920\nI think like back in the old days when we first met you that you felt like kind of responsible\n\n23:36.920 --> 23:41.320\nfor their relationship and kind of like you're kind of a caretaker, right?\n\n23:41.320 --> 23:42.320\nSure.\n\n23:42.320 --> 23:43.320\nYeah.\n\n23:43.320 --> 23:44.320\nI think I said that.\n\n23:44.320 --> 23:45.320\nIs that, is that still the case or no?\n\n23:45.320 --> 23:46.320\nNo.\n\n23:46.320 --> 23:47.320\nI mean, well, my dad lives in Columbia.\n\n23:47.320 --> 23:50.080\nI mean, he probably has a girlfriend or something right now.\n\n23:50.080 --> 23:55.440\nHe's, he's taking care of himself and my mom, she's like a hobo or something.\n\n23:55.440 --> 23:58.520\nShe's a, she's like couchsurfing and traveling and stuff.\n\n23:58.520 --> 24:01.600\nShe doesn't have a stable residence as far as I'm aware.\n\n24:01.600 --> 24:05.960\nSo I mean, who knows, who knows, right?\n\n24:05.960 --> 24:10.360\nYou know what my big thing with family is, you don't like them.\n\n24:10.360 --> 24:13.800\nAt some point this, there was this syndrome that started happening where it was like,\n\n24:13.800 --> 24:16.840\nwell, I haven't talked to these people in a while.\n\n24:16.840 --> 24:19.120\nAnd then it's like, now I'm 43.\n\n24:19.120 --> 24:22.440\nSo they're getting long on the tooth.\n\n24:22.440 --> 24:30.080\nLike we're getting to the point where after a long life of like fruitfulness and tradition\n\n24:30.080 --> 24:35.280\nand stuff, you're supposed to like partake of this tragic like third act where it's like\n\n24:35.280 --> 24:37.360\nbittersweet, you know?\n\n24:37.360 --> 24:38.360\nYeah.\n\n24:38.360 --> 24:43.040\nI don't want to, you know, I don't want, part of me, like just because of our kind of stigma\n\n24:43.040 --> 24:48.040\nagainst like, you know, sickness and stuff like a, I don't want to say certain words\n\n24:48.040 --> 24:52.840\nout loud because I'll sound like just the epitome of evil, but, but like, I just have\n\n24:52.840 --> 24:57.640\nthis like weird feeling about like, like, well, I don't even know these people at this\n\n24:57.640 --> 24:58.640\npoint.\n\n24:58.640 --> 24:59.640\nYeah.\n\n24:59.640 --> 25:00.640\nSo it's like start now.\n\n25:00.640 --> 25:01.640\nYeah.\n\n25:01.640 --> 25:03.160\nBecause now is a bad time to start.\n\n25:03.160 --> 25:04.560\nAnd it's like, and for what?\n\n25:04.560 --> 25:09.120\nFor the benefits of family, because I feel like I've been cruising without that just\n\n25:09.120 --> 25:12.520\nfine all this time and, you know, it's all, it's all been good.\n\n25:12.520 --> 25:17.280\nSo now I want to go into that more ass just because that's what happens on television\n\n25:17.280 --> 25:18.800\nlike it seems dumb.\n\n25:18.800 --> 25:20.560\nAnd a little bit of a slight, right?\n\n25:20.560 --> 25:26.600\nIf you didn't get like the whole like other side of it where it's like, your family means\n\n25:26.600 --> 25:36.320\na lot to you, throwing the ball in the yard, Thanksgiving times, AT&T wants you to be there.\n\n25:36.320 --> 25:41.920\nThis holiday season when the gravy's up and the stockings are out, bring your nuzzles\n\n25:41.920 --> 25:43.440\naround the Christmas tree.\n\n25:43.440 --> 25:47.000\nIt's like, like when it's really just more dysfunctional than that, you just kind of\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:52.440\nlike, then the, then you're supposed to get that like the cable knit sweaters and the golden\n\n25:52.440 --> 25:58.120\nretrievers and the like, God, dad, dad's going to do his chaplain impression again.\n\n25:58.120 --> 26:05.600\nLike, I love it when we come up to this cabin in the Hamptons of every, every winter and\n\n26:05.600 --> 26:07.280\nsure we have our problems.\n\n26:07.280 --> 26:15.800\nAnd remember when Gloria smoked weed and sent her to rehab, but now she's okay to the McClannahan\n\n26:15.800 --> 26:19.720\nclan who keeps getting bigger and happier.\n\n26:19.720 --> 26:24.880\nAnd then if you've got, if you've had all that, then, then bring on the fucking diagnoses\n\n26:24.880 --> 26:32.240\nand the, uh-oh, I got to go away for the weekend, beep, beep, like, I always wanted to do more.\n\n26:32.240 --> 26:38.080\nI know, but you did, Uncle Herman.\n\n26:38.080 --> 26:43.560\nBut if Uncle Herman was like, you know, why get on board right before the meet, meet?\n\n26:43.560 --> 26:44.560\nYeah.\n\n26:44.560 --> 26:50.320\nExactly, because it's just been, it's like just a flat line up until that point.\n\n26:50.320 --> 26:55.100\nIt's like, how, how, what, what is the peak that we're hoping to achieve before the inevitable\n\n26:55.100 --> 26:56.100\npitfall?\n\n26:56.100 --> 26:57.100\nYeah.\n\n26:57.100 --> 26:58.100\nWhat is this day new mod that I'm getting?\n\n26:58.100 --> 27:02.640\nIt's, it's, it's like, it's like, yeah, it's like, if you went to see a matrix movie\n\n27:02.640 --> 27:07.720\nand it was just about Keanu Reeves, like fighting a million agent Smiths and you'd be like,\n\n27:07.720 --> 27:09.680\nwhat's this weird educational video?\n\n27:09.680 --> 27:14.000\nLike, someone would have to explain to you, there was a first movie and it was kind of\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:19.160\nfun.\n\n27:19.160 --> 27:24.320\nIf you met Dan, like if you met your mother or your father at a bar, like there were strangers,\n\n27:24.320 --> 27:26.000\ndo you think that you would have anything to talk about?\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:29.920\nLike if, if you just met them, face value as strangers.\n\n27:29.920 --> 27:35.280\nYeah, I think I'd, I think I'd like my dad, you know, you could have a chat.\n\n27:35.280 --> 27:37.520\nYou could enjoy each other's company.\n\n27:37.520 --> 27:38.520\nYeah.\n\n27:38.520 --> 27:41.640\nIt's a bad way to spend Mother's Day talking about it.\n\n27:41.640 --> 27:45.400\nI think my dad's a cool guy.\n\n27:45.400 --> 27:46.400\nNot your mom though?\n\n27:46.400 --> 27:49.560\nWell, with my mom, but my mom, it's more important to be like, I mean, it's like, this is, and\n\n27:49.560 --> 27:50.880\nI think moms get a bum rap.\n\n27:50.880 --> 27:54.400\nI think it's the, I think it's an opposite gender kid kind of thing too.\n\n27:54.400 --> 27:59.280\nIt's also, but like, you know, I think moms get a bum rap from the male kids because they\n\n27:59.280 --> 28:04.680\nnurture and they, they, they, they, they are there.\n\n28:04.680 --> 28:09.880\nAnd then ironically, you kind of, you know, you cut the strings and you kind of, you don't\n\n28:09.880 --> 28:11.880\nlook back and go like, what a pal.\n\n28:11.880 --> 28:18.080\nYou look back and go like, you know, goddess, monster, you know, in any case, not a human,\n\n28:18.080 --> 28:22.840\nyou know, like you really need to, you really need to have like a human relationship with\n\n28:22.840 --> 28:26.560\nyour family or, or it's, or you're not going to have one.\n\n28:26.560 --> 28:30.280\nAnd that's a statement that's really powerful.\n\n28:30.280 --> 28:33.240\nBut then again, you know, and that's everybody I talked to always goes like, we always end\n\n28:33.240 --> 28:34.240\nthis conversation.\n\n28:34.240 --> 28:36.960\nWe go like, yeah, but have you met those people with the, like the loving Norman Rockwell\n\n28:36.960 --> 28:37.960\nfamily?\n\n28:37.960 --> 28:38.960\nYeah.\n\n28:38.960 --> 28:42.440\nLike, like just, just really annoying.\n\n28:42.440 --> 28:47.400\nWhen your mom passes away, uh, what, what, do you feel like there'll be a loss?\n\n28:47.400 --> 28:50.280\nLike what, like something will be subtracted from you?\n\n28:50.280 --> 28:53.560\nI think this is a bad day to say anything, but yes.\n\n28:53.560 --> 28:54.560\nWell, what?\n\n28:54.560 --> 28:58.280\nLike, well, cause just on the off chance that she's like, well, it's mother's day, he'll\n\n28:58.280 --> 28:59.880\nprobably say something about me.\n\n28:59.880 --> 29:03.320\nAnd then you're like, when she dies, will you feel anything?\n\n29:03.320 --> 29:05.320\nHmm.\n\n29:05.320 --> 29:06.320\nSo yes.\n\n29:06.320 --> 29:10.520\nIt'll, it'll, it'll be different than when you, than when your father passes away.\n\n29:10.520 --> 29:14.080\nLike there'll be a complicated feelings either way.\n\n29:14.080 --> 29:17.240\nBut I do acknowledge that they're going to be more narcissistically centered.\n\n29:17.240 --> 29:20.840\nYou know, they're not, they're going to be like unresolved shit that I haven't worked\n\n29:20.840 --> 29:21.840\non.\n\n29:21.840 --> 29:27.960\nMy mom, my mom died when I was 13 and it's like that was like kind of the perfect time\n\n29:27.960 --> 29:30.760\nfor that to happen because I wasn't so young.\n\n29:30.760 --> 29:35.060\nI didn't know her, but I wasn't so old that it meant a lot more.\n\n29:35.060 --> 29:41.800\nBut when I look at, when I remember my mother, she's so much of who I am.\n\n29:41.800 --> 29:47.520\nLike as much as I'm genetically my father, I look just like my dad, I am intellectually\n\n29:47.520 --> 29:48.520\nmy mother.\n\n29:48.520 --> 29:53.000\nLike, like I have all of her emotions, like her brain.\n\n29:53.000 --> 30:00.440\nAnd it's like, it's like, when I think of my mom today, it's like, she was so fucking\n\n30:00.440 --> 30:01.440\nfunny.\n\n30:01.440 --> 30:02.640\nShe was so cool.\n\n30:02.640 --> 30:06.640\nAnd I didn't know her long enough, like, you know, I was 13.\n\n30:06.640 --> 30:09.440\nSo she was kind of hardgoing.\n\n30:09.440 --> 30:14.520\nLike it was a little bit heavy to be around my mom because she was that intense.\n\n30:14.520 --> 30:19.880\nBut I wish she was still around because she was like the funniest person I ever knew.\n\n30:19.880 --> 30:26.240\nMy mom got me my first typewriter, my first Commodore 64.\n\n30:26.240 --> 30:30.980\nShe always made sure she told me whenever I said, what, what should I do?\n\n30:30.980 --> 30:33.080\nShe always said, do whatever you want.\n\n30:33.080 --> 30:38.960\nShe never said, you have to be this or that, you know, she never had a career plan for\n\n30:38.960 --> 30:39.960\nme.\n\n30:39.960 --> 30:45.000\nShe always said, just make sure you, you, you do it because you want to do it and make\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.360\nsure you're really good at it.\n\n30:46.360 --> 30:49.920\nIf you're going to be a garbage man, no offense to the garbage men listening, that's the example\n\n30:49.920 --> 30:50.920\nshe would use.\n\n30:50.920 --> 30:54.120\nIf you're going to be a garbage man, just be the best garbage man, you know, that there\n\n30:54.120 --> 30:56.360\nis and, and, and make sure you're happy doing it.\n\n30:56.360 --> 31:02.240\nSo she was super on your side, like what, also she threw things at you.\n\n31:02.240 --> 31:06.560\nShe usually throwing them at my dad and I would get in the way, you know, like my birthday\n\n31:06.560 --> 31:10.480\ncake.\n\n31:10.480 --> 31:11.480\nBut it was carrot cake.\n\n31:11.480 --> 31:14.960\nI didn't even want it.\n\n31:14.960 --> 31:17.720\nCarrot cake is the, is the, is Alexis of cakes.\n\n31:17.720 --> 31:22.000\nI would, I would, I would give, I would give up a thousand birthday cakes for the story\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:27.000\nI got, which is my mom threw my 11th birthday cake at my dad.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:32.960\nLike I would, I would, I would give up cake forever to have that story be true, which\n\n31:32.960 --> 31:33.960\nit is.\n\n31:33.960 --> 31:36.320\nAnd then she's like, here's your D&D books.\n\n31:36.320 --> 31:40.280\nI didn't have time to wrap them and I was like, that's fine, man.\n\n31:40.280 --> 31:41.280\nThis is awesome.\n\n31:41.280 --> 31:42.280\nAll right.\n\n31:42.280 --> 31:44.960\nWell, let's, let's, let's bring out, let's bring out our guests.\n\n31:44.960 --> 31:47.800\nWe can continue to talk about this.\n\n31:47.800 --> 31:51.680\nLet's bring some, some, some, some more, some more dudes out here.\n\n31:51.680 --> 31:53.040\nBut this show is lacking anything.\n\n31:53.040 --> 31:57.440\nIt's, it's due to energy.\n\n31:57.440 --> 32:00.600\nThese guys have a very popular feral audio podcast.\n\n32:00.600 --> 32:03.840\nIt's like, I don't know if you care about such things, but it's number five.\n\n32:03.840 --> 32:04.840\nI happen to know that.\n\n32:04.840 --> 32:07.560\nIt's like the, it's like the fifth most popular feral audio podcast.\n\n32:07.560 --> 32:08.560\nWhere are we?\n\n32:08.560 --> 32:09.560\nI don't know.\n\n32:09.560 --> 32:10.560\nI don't care about these things.\n\n32:10.560 --> 32:11.560\nAre we the top?\n\n32:11.560 --> 32:12.560\nWe're number one.\n\n32:12.560 --> 32:13.560\nOne or two.\n\n32:13.560 --> 32:14.560\nI don't know.\n\n32:14.560 --> 32:15.560\nWho's number one?\n\n32:15.560 --> 32:16.560\nI think it might be Duncan Trussell.\n\n32:16.560 --> 32:17.560\nOh, I'll fucking kill that guy.\n\n32:17.560 --> 32:21.560\nFucking hippie piece of shit.\n\n32:21.560 --> 32:26.200\nAnd probably, yeah, he's probably probably, uh, they're probably counting, uh, uh, astral\n\n32:26.200 --> 32:32.880\npeople in the, in the, in the, in the, in the listeners numbers.\n\n32:32.880 --> 32:40.560\nIt's like Greg and Greg's spirit are both listening to Dan in this lighting right now.\n\n32:40.560 --> 32:41.560\nRight.\n\n32:41.560 --> 32:43.000\nWhat were you standing right in this lighting?\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:46.920\nYou have become more good looking than Russell Crowe.\n\n32:46.920 --> 32:53.360\nHe, he looks like shit.\n\n32:53.360 --> 32:59.200\nYou have, you've crossed over into being better at Russell Crowe.\n\n32:59.200 --> 33:06.000\nOur guests tonight have a podcast called the dough boys on feral audio.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:11.960\nThey, uh, they review, excuse me, what's the worst intro in the world?\n\n33:11.960 --> 33:14.240\nYou can't burp during an intro.\n\n33:14.240 --> 33:19.240\nThey review, uh, franchise restaurants.\n\n33:19.240 --> 33:20.240\nIt's, it's salt of the earth.\n\n33:20.240 --> 33:22.520\nIt was my burp with salt of the earth.\n\n33:22.520 --> 33:27.120\nThey, they, they, they review franchise restaurant chain restaurants, you know, like, uh, Jesus\n\n33:27.120 --> 33:28.120\nChrist.\n\n33:28.120 --> 33:32.720\nUh, we'll, we'll, we'll get to know every little detail about them.\n\n33:32.720 --> 33:35.640\nUh, it's, uh, they're, they're, they're UCB alum.\n\n33:35.640 --> 33:39.120\nThey're, they're, they're very much, uh, they're, they're related to our family by a\n\n33:39.120 --> 33:41.120\nlot of mutual cousins and things.\n\n33:41.120 --> 33:42.520\nWe can talk about that too.\n\n33:42.520 --> 33:43.720\nOh, can we Dan?\n\n33:43.720 --> 33:44.720\nShut up.\n\n33:44.720 --> 33:45.720\nYou fucking millennial puke.\n\n33:45.720 --> 33:48.720\nUm, what did you come here for?\n\n33:48.720 --> 33:52.160\nNorman Lear was coming back.\n\n33:52.160 --> 33:53.160\nNorman Lear.\n\n33:53.160 --> 33:54.720\nThat was the most intense shit in the world.\n\n33:54.720 --> 33:55.720\nI know.\n\n33:55.720 --> 33:59.720\nAnd then, and then remember when Dustin uploaded the podcast and it said normal Lear?\n\n33:59.720 --> 34:00.720\nYeah.\n\n34:00.720 --> 34:07.720\nThis guy, this guy, 93 years old, he's, he's worked in the business for a hundred of those\n\n34:07.720 --> 34:08.720\nyears.\n\n34:08.720 --> 34:14.720\nHis, his, his name is Norman, he's silver leg hippie.\n\n34:14.720 --> 34:20.720\nGet the, get the, get the, get the incense out of your mouth.\n\n34:20.720 --> 34:27.720\nUh, the dough boys are here and we're going to get to know them now.\n\n34:27.720 --> 34:45.920\nThey are Nick Weigar and Mitch Mitchell, the dough boys.\n\n34:45.920 --> 34:47.400\nThat's a Mike Mitchell, right?\n\n34:47.400 --> 34:48.720\nWell, you go, you go by Mitch.\n\n34:48.720 --> 34:49.720\nI go by Mitch.\n\n34:49.720 --> 34:50.720\nYeah.\n\n34:50.720 --> 34:51.720\nSo that's fine.\n\n34:51.720 --> 34:53.160\nWe haven't established canonically what Mitch's name is.\n\n34:53.160 --> 34:54.160\nHe goes by Mike.\n\n34:54.160 --> 34:55.160\nHe goes by Michael.\n\n34:55.160 --> 34:56.160\nAnd he goes by Mitch.\n\n34:56.160 --> 34:57.160\nI'm fine with all of them.\n\n34:57.160 --> 35:01.680\nI'm trying to save work cause it said, the information I got was it's Mike Mitchell.\n\n35:01.680 --> 35:02.680\nHe goes by Mitch.\n\n35:02.680 --> 35:04.680\nAnd I was like, why am I going to share the genealogy?\n\n35:04.680 --> 35:08.360\nI was just like, I introduce myself as Mitch.\n\n35:08.360 --> 35:13.320\nUh, I don't care about myself enough to even care what anyone calls me when they, when\n\n35:13.320 --> 35:15.800\npeople ask me, I'm just like, yeah, Mitch or Mike, I don't care.\n\n35:15.800 --> 35:17.400\nI don't care what they say.\n\n35:17.400 --> 35:18.400\nIt's fine with me.\n\n35:18.400 --> 35:23.120\nSo long as I don't like make anyone angry, which I think I'm doing right now, possibly.\n\n35:23.120 --> 35:28.440\nYeah, no, you have to work harder than that to get on their head side.\n\n35:28.440 --> 35:29.640\nThey're like, I hate myself too.\n\n35:29.640 --> 35:30.640\nGrow up.\n\n35:30.640 --> 35:31.640\nAll right.\n\n35:31.640 --> 35:32.640\nGood, good, good.\n\n35:32.640 --> 35:33.640\nWe're on the, we're on the same side.\n\n35:33.640 --> 35:36.520\nUh, so your, your podcast is, people love it.\n\n35:36.520 --> 35:38.280\nSpencer counts himself among the fans.\n\n35:38.280 --> 35:39.280\nI believe.\n\n35:39.280 --> 35:40.280\nYeah.\n\n35:40.280 --> 35:41.280\nYeah.\n\n35:41.280 --> 35:42.280\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n35:42.280 --> 35:43.280\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n35:43.280 --> 35:44.280\nYeah.\n\n35:44.280 --> 35:45.280\nThanks, Spencer.\n\n35:45.280 --> 35:46.280\nIt's not, it's not a good look to tell people you love their podcast.\n\n35:46.280 --> 35:48.280\nIt's not a good look.\n\n35:48.280 --> 35:49.280\nIt's not.\n\n35:49.280 --> 35:50.280\nWe appreciate it.\n\n35:50.280 --> 35:51.280\nYeah.\n\n35:51.280 --> 35:52.280\nWe like it.\n\n35:52.280 --> 35:53.280\nYeah.\n\n35:53.280 --> 35:54.280\nSo number five, that's pretty, that's not bad.\n\n35:54.280 --> 35:55.280\nRight?\n\n35:55.280 --> 35:56.280\nI got that.\n\n35:56.280 --> 35:57.280\nYou know, that's Dustin.\n\n35:57.280 --> 35:58.280\nHe's a producer.\n\n35:58.280 --> 35:59.280\nHe thinks about these things.\n\n35:59.280 --> 36:00.280\nHe's just going to give a thumbs up or something.\n\n36:00.280 --> 36:01.280\nYeah.\n\n36:01.280 --> 36:02.280\nAll right.\n\n36:02.280 --> 36:03.280\nThere we go.\n\n36:03.280 --> 36:04.280\nWhy is it called?\n\n36:04.280 --> 36:05.280\nDoughboys.\n\n36:05.280 --> 36:08.280\nUh, good question.\n\n36:08.280 --> 36:13.640\nUm, I mean, I would say that we are doughy men eating unhealthy food.\n\n36:13.640 --> 36:19.280\nSo he was, he was fat at one point and I remained fat.\n\n36:19.280 --> 36:21.400\nOh, and I've never not got fat.\n\n36:21.400 --> 36:23.640\nHe was a fat guy at one point.\n\n36:23.640 --> 36:24.640\nHe's thin.\n\n36:24.640 --> 36:25.640\nYou're a thin man now.\n\n36:25.640 --> 36:29.400\nI'd say I'm towards the slender side, but there's still a layer of pudding over everything.\n\n36:29.400 --> 36:32.720\nLike I'm not like, I'm not like cut, you know, I'm in pretty good shape though.\n\n36:32.720 --> 36:33.720\nYeah.\n\n36:33.720 --> 36:34.720\nI used to be a lot fatter.\n\n36:34.720 --> 36:35.720\nYeah.\n\n36:35.720 --> 36:38.480\nUm, but no, it's, it's an, we live an unhealthy lifestyle.\n\n36:38.480 --> 36:42.720\nWe both kind of have the diets of guys who are bulking up for an Academy Award winning\n\n36:42.720 --> 36:43.720\nrole.\n\n36:43.720 --> 36:48.920\nAnd so, and, and so it's just like we're, as far as a comment on that, Doughboys felt\n\n36:48.920 --> 36:49.920\nappropriate.\n\n36:49.920 --> 36:52.280\nLike a runner up with sight of guys.\n\n36:52.280 --> 36:53.280\nWe almost went with that.\n\n36:53.280 --> 36:54.680\nAnd I think we made the right call.\n\n36:54.680 --> 36:55.680\nYeah.\n\n36:55.680 --> 36:57.040\nI went dead silent.\n\n36:57.040 --> 37:00.160\nAre you, are you both under 30?\n\n37:00.160 --> 37:01.160\nI'm 35.\n\n37:01.160 --> 37:02.160\nI'm 33.\n\n37:02.160 --> 37:03.160\nOkay.\n\n37:03.160 --> 37:07.240\nUnder 30, like I couldn't gain a pound.\n\n37:07.240 --> 37:12.680\nThen one day I was sitting at Rob Schrab's with Dan, we would get Benito's tacos every\n\n37:12.680 --> 37:16.320\nnight and I was like, oh fuck, I'm, I'm fat.\n\n37:16.320 --> 37:17.320\nI gained a pound.\n\n37:17.320 --> 37:18.320\nYeah.\n\n37:18.320 --> 37:24.200\nHe put it under his pillow, his first pound.\n\n37:24.200 --> 37:25.200\nHe framed it.\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:31.560\nHe framed it like a car washes dollar.\n\n37:31.560 --> 37:35.320\nJust curiously though, Nick, Nick is the skinny one, right?\n\n37:35.320 --> 37:39.720\nNick, not the one that's named Mike and Mitch.\n\n37:39.720 --> 37:44.880\nNick is a skinny one and there's a part of me that thinks that this is all like a seven\n\n37:44.880 --> 37:50.240\nstyle plot by you to make me fucking fatter and fatter as time goes on.\n\n37:50.240 --> 37:53.480\nDo you think every time you get, wait, well, so, not to, I don't want to derail this too\n\n37:53.480 --> 37:58.640\nmuch, but, but, but I'm just, I am curious if you were fat and you got thin, Nick, was\n\n37:58.640 --> 37:59.920\nthere a method you used?\n\n37:59.920 --> 38:03.840\nBecause a lot of my listeners are always, always looking for a new technique.\n\n38:03.840 --> 38:05.520\nIt's, he told me his technique.\n\n38:05.520 --> 38:06.520\nYeah.\n\n38:06.520 --> 38:09.640\nI mean, like I've been through my weight is yo-yoed a lot through my life.\n\n38:09.640 --> 38:13.960\nI was like a fat kid and then I got skinny late in the, like in early adulthood when\n\n38:13.960 --> 38:17.160\nI was like 18, 19, I was like very thin and the best shape of my life.\n\n38:17.160 --> 38:21.800\nThen I plumped up again throughout my 20s and around 29, I lost some weight again.\n\n38:21.800 --> 38:26.840\nAnd the factor late in life was a diet, like earlier in life when I had that initial weight\n\n38:26.840 --> 38:29.400\nloss, I just started swimming and I just burned off a shitload of calories.\n\n38:29.400 --> 38:32.560\nI think like what, which I'm saying just, just, just that much of activity and having\n\n38:32.560 --> 38:34.160\nthat young metabolism.\n\n38:34.160 --> 38:38.920\nBut as I was older, I found that I had to restrict sugar and restrict carbohydrate intake and\n\n38:38.920 --> 38:42.840\njust have a very strict sort of low carb ish diet.\n\n38:42.840 --> 38:43.920\nBut you're not doing that anymore.\n\n38:43.920 --> 38:49.040\nDo you guys actively, when you, as I listened to a little bit of one of your most recent\n\n38:49.040 --> 38:51.640\npodcasts, I picked the one that had my friend, David Phillips on it.\n\n38:51.640 --> 38:52.640\nOh yeah.\n\n38:52.640 --> 38:53.640\nYou left Philips.\n\n38:53.640 --> 38:54.640\nPhilips is a great guy.\n\n38:54.640 --> 38:57.720\nAnd, but I never got to the part where you actually started talking about the specific\n\n38:57.720 --> 38:58.720\nrestaurant.\n\n38:58.720 --> 39:05.200\nAlthough at the top of the podcast episode, there's this very charming post-karina long\n\n39:05.200 --> 39:12.480\nworth, is that a reference that sticks now, the, the, the very, very academic, just like,\n\n39:12.480 --> 39:15.880\nlike dump of information about the restaurant you're going to be talking about.\n\n39:15.880 --> 39:17.480\nIs that, is that every episode?\n\n39:17.480 --> 39:19.720\nI have a little monologue I start each episode with.\n\n39:19.720 --> 39:24.000\nIt's kind of just loosely plagiarized from Wikipedia, but makes me sound and feel smart.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.400\nSo I like to stay it and sort of gives a little background in the restaurant.\n\n39:26.400 --> 39:29.160\nAnd then we fuck around for like 45 minutes.\n\n39:29.160 --> 39:30.280\nAnd then we finally get to the restaurant.\n\n39:30.280 --> 39:32.640\nWe talk about that for pretty much the balance of the episode.\n\n39:32.640 --> 39:37.480\nYeah, you give a nice little autistic twist on it and you seem to enjoy it.\n\n39:37.480 --> 39:41.400\nAre you just drawing on memories of eating at these places or do you, do you ever have\n\n39:41.400 --> 39:42.400\nto study up?\n\n39:42.400 --> 39:48.000\nMitch and I go before each episode, the two of us go either together independently, sometimes\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:51.560\nwith our guests, to the restaurant in question.\n\n39:51.560 --> 39:54.000\nSo we always have a fresh perspective on whatever we're visiting.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:58.480\nAnd sometimes that involves a draw, a drive to Gardena to visit Long John Silver's.\n\n39:58.480 --> 40:00.120\nThat sucks.\n\n40:00.120 --> 40:10.200\nAnd then some in March we, I ate 18 cheeseburgers in March, please, I'll take it.\n\n40:10.200 --> 40:12.640\nI have nothing else to, I love it.\n\n40:12.640 --> 40:16.400\nYou ate 18 burgers throughout the month of March or you ate them in one day?\n\n40:16.400 --> 40:19.560\nHey, no, God, no, 18 cheeseburgers throughout the month of March.\n\n40:19.560 --> 40:26.880\nThat was not for the podcast though, that was for the podcast.\n\n40:26.880 --> 40:30.080\nSo it's, it was your favorite burger in town, Mitch.\n\n40:30.080 --> 40:35.400\nSo, so this is, we were ranking them and, and it's a point of contention.\n\n40:35.400 --> 40:38.800\nBecause I like Wendy's, he likes in and out burger.\n\n40:38.800 --> 40:43.400\nAnd then I voted in the final, I voted for Shake Shack, was what I voted for.\n\n40:43.400 --> 40:45.280\nShake Shack, I don't think I've ever been there.\n\n40:45.280 --> 40:46.280\nIt's good.\n\n40:46.280 --> 40:47.280\nIt's really good.\n\n40:47.280 --> 40:51.360\nWhat is the, because I mean, it's important to note, you guys aren't snarky about the\n\n40:51.360 --> 40:52.360\nwhole thing.\n\n40:52.360 --> 40:56.240\nLike you're not, you're not foodies that are bashing on these restaurants for being less\n\n40:56.240 --> 40:57.320\nthan gourmet.\n\n40:57.320 --> 41:01.640\nYou're actually partaking in the, you know, you're opening the hood of, of a staple of\n\n41:01.640 --> 41:05.960\nour lives, which is like these giant corporate chains and you're, you're approaching them\n\n41:05.960 --> 41:12.160\nas if, as if you were talking about real food.\n\n41:12.160 --> 41:15.160\nWhere does that, where does that, where did that passion come from?\n\n41:15.160 --> 41:16.680\nWhere did that passion come from?\n\n41:16.680 --> 41:21.000\nHarmon, just go hang yourself.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.040\nWhere did that passion come from?\n\n41:23.040 --> 41:27.840\nYou put it, no, you put a good twist on it because I feel like we just, I mean, we like\n\n41:27.840 --> 41:30.760\nall these restaurants and we want an excuse to eat there every week.\n\n41:30.760 --> 41:33.520\nI feel like, and that was a big part of it.\n\n41:33.520 --> 41:34.520\nAnd then, yeah.\n\n41:34.520 --> 41:39.640\nWell, did you get, so when you guys go to, right here, I mean, turning this into something\n\n41:39.640 --> 41:46.000\nabout me, the, the, the, what I, the big LA thing is there's, there's a new restaurant\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:47.920\nevery day and there's another one closing.\n\n41:47.920 --> 41:51.680\nAnd if you wanted to, every day you could just like, and there are people who want to\n\n41:51.680 --> 41:54.880\ndo this in particular, I feel like it's an age thing.\n\n41:54.880 --> 42:00.400\nLike my younger friends are, have no problem going, let's go eat at this one place.\n\n42:00.400 --> 42:02.200\nI heard great things about it.\n\n42:02.200 --> 42:06.920\nAnd I always know that if you heard great things about it, that means I'm going to be\n\n42:06.920 --> 42:14.640\nsitting in doll furniture, elbow to elbow with strangers and, and, and, and eating, you know,\n\n42:14.640 --> 42:18.680\nnot to get all Tim Allen about it, but also the portions are going to be small and, and\n\n42:18.680 --> 42:25.000\nweird, like in some deliberate way, some off-handedly fucking deliberate way.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:29.120\nAnd whereas then there's just like, holy shit, can I go to Taylor Steakhouse?\n\n42:29.120 --> 42:34.680\nI, I, every time I go to a night in market song, you know, night plus market song, I'm\n\n42:34.680 --> 42:38.040\nalways afraid I'm going to fall through the chair every time I go there.\n\n42:38.040 --> 42:41.200\nLike I'm just truly in back, like nervous and embarrassed, I'm going to fall through\n\n42:41.200 --> 42:42.200\nthe chair.\n\n42:42.200 --> 42:46.600\nBut yeah, I mean, it, it, we talked about that because we do like, I like all types\n\n42:46.600 --> 42:47.600\nof food.\n\n42:47.600 --> 42:48.600\nYeah.\n\n42:48.600 --> 42:49.600\nWe like, we like fine dining too.\n\n42:49.600 --> 42:55.200\nAnd we like like cool hip, you know, individual location places, but there's something inclusive\n\n42:55.200 --> 42:59.360\nand comforting about chains by design, you know, like it's a different experience going\n\n42:59.360 --> 43:04.560\nto a Mimi's cafe or a Chili's and their whole, it's calculated at a corporate level to make\n\n43:04.560 --> 43:06.400\nyou feel included.\n\n43:06.400 --> 43:07.400\nAnd I don't know.\n\n43:07.400 --> 43:10.280\nI mean, we wanted to celebrate that atmosphere and not like make fun of it because it's something\n\n43:10.280 --> 43:14.000\nthat for a lot of people, that's the only, depending on where you live in the country,\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.320\nthat's the only, those are the only restaurants you have access to.\n\n43:16.320 --> 43:17.320\nRight.\n\n43:17.320 --> 43:18.320\nThat's interesting.\n\n43:18.320 --> 43:23.280\nSo in being kind of sewers of chains, so what are the things that you have concluded?\n\n43:23.280 --> 43:24.280\nWhat connects all of them?\n\n43:24.280 --> 43:25.600\nYou've done like 50 episodes of this.\n\n43:25.600 --> 43:30.240\nSo there must be, is there like overriding psychological principles at work in a successful\n\n43:30.240 --> 43:31.240\nchain restaurant?\n\n43:31.240 --> 43:36.360\nI'd say a hundred percent, like a, well, you, you, you're the smarter one of the two.\n\n43:36.360 --> 43:38.240\nSo you go for it.\n\n43:38.240 --> 43:42.680\nWhen you say make you feel included, I think is the phrase you use, make you feel included\n\n43:42.680 --> 43:43.680\nor invited.\n\n43:43.680 --> 43:44.680\nWhat did you say exactly?\n\n43:44.680 --> 43:45.680\nI said included.\n\n43:45.680 --> 43:46.680\nI'm not sure if that was the perfect word choice.\n\n43:46.680 --> 43:48.360\nWhat would you elaborate on that?\n\n43:48.360 --> 43:53.400\nIt's just like, you know, there's, there's, when anytime you're at a restaurant, you're\n\n43:53.400 --> 43:56.720\npaying for the service, you're paying for the food, but you're also paying for the service.\n\n43:56.720 --> 44:00.520\nYou're paying for people to pretend like they're your servants for a little bit.\n\n44:00.520 --> 44:04.480\nAnd like, I feel like the better chain restaurants, fundamentally that's what you're dealing with.\n\n44:04.480 --> 44:07.480\nYou know, you're paying for people to sort of do it on you and take care of your every\n\n44:07.480 --> 44:12.320\nneed and act like, to pretend in this, in this situation, you're a higher status of\n\n44:12.320 --> 44:14.600\nthem, but in the real world, you might not be, you know?\n\n44:14.600 --> 44:20.920\nSo I think the, the effective, the effective chain restaurants kind of just have that experience.\n\n44:20.920 --> 44:25.160\nThey just presented in a way that you would in, in, in, in a good individual location restaurant.\n\n44:25.160 --> 44:26.360\nThey franchise wide.\n\n44:26.360 --> 44:28.480\nThey kind of have, they, they make you feel that way.\n\n44:28.480 --> 44:32.320\nAnd one restaurant we reviewed very highly, I'm just saying Hillstone, it goes by many\n\n44:32.320 --> 44:33.320\nnames.\n\n44:33.320 --> 44:34.720\nHouston's you may know is most popularly.\n\n44:34.720 --> 44:35.720\nYeah.\n\n44:35.720 --> 44:36.720\nHouston's is great.\n\n44:36.720 --> 44:44.120\nBut I mean, that's a place where just the, the level of service, the level of services\n\n44:44.120 --> 44:47.080\nis universally very high in addition to the food quality.\n\n44:47.080 --> 44:55.920\nSo yeah, I guess I, I find Chili's like a reliable in an airport, airports is kind of\n\n44:55.920 --> 44:56.920\na, that's their slogan.\n\n44:56.920 --> 44:57.920\nIt's its own thing.\n\n44:57.920 --> 45:02.560\nLike it's, it's, it's a no man's land in an airport.\n\n45:02.560 --> 45:06.240\nI've never, that's, that's an interesting from a class perspective.\n\n45:06.240 --> 45:13.640\nIt's like, it's, you're talking about a middle class thing, like, and going out to dinner\n\n45:13.640 --> 45:18.600\nbeing not something you do every night, possibly doing it with your family and loved ones.\n\n45:18.600 --> 45:21.880\nAnd there is like, I guess that there is something interesting about that.\n\n45:21.880 --> 45:26.400\nLike they create little worlds as if it's part dinner, part vacation.\n\n45:26.400 --> 45:28.960\nLike you've, you've come to islands.\n\n45:28.960 --> 45:37.000\nYou've got to have a tropical doppelganger doopie doopie, you know, and they have like,\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:40.480\nthey have like little sayings and they have little, and they have outfits and they have\n\n45:40.480 --> 45:41.480\na, the whole theme thing.\n\n45:41.480 --> 45:44.880\nAnd I just realized that that's not, I don't know what I ever thought that was.\n\n45:44.880 --> 45:46.800\nI hadn't problematized it yet.\n\n45:46.800 --> 45:51.040\nI hadn't, I hadn't looked at it like, like, like, like, and I asked myself, I just felt\n\n45:51.040 --> 45:55.360\nlike that was just, but that's what they're trying to do is they're trying to, they're\n\n45:55.360 --> 46:00.360\ncompeting over dollars that are harder earned than to, than to say like, like, they're like\n\n46:00.360 --> 46:07.240\ndollars that are like, holy shit, I, I almost died, like, like, like, like typing for this\n\n46:07.240 --> 46:08.240\ndollar.\n\n46:08.240 --> 46:13.200\nLike my bones are sticking out of my fingertips and I, and I, and I want to make sure I get\n\n46:13.200 --> 46:14.200\ntreated right.\n\n46:14.200 --> 46:17.840\nAnd so that, you know, that's like the, the, the big giant parking lots of the big blinking\n\n46:17.840 --> 46:22.360\nsigns that say like, look, there's plenty of room here, there's a runway.\n\n46:22.360 --> 46:23.360\nYeah.\n\n46:23.360 --> 46:27.840\nI, I feel like, and especially now there's, there's that thing of there's, there's two,\n\n46:27.840 --> 46:32.880\nthere's two things I play to that I feel like that kind of a, will separate the good from\n\n46:32.880 --> 46:33.880\nthe bad.\n\n46:33.880 --> 46:37.080\nAnd it's, it's the quality being good across like all the restaurants, if you can like\n\n46:37.080 --> 46:42.760\nkeep a standard of quality in, in Los Angeles and then somewhere in Wyoming, like everywhere\n\n46:42.760 --> 46:48.080\nyou go, it feels like kind of the same level of food and then that's like, and then the\n\n46:48.080 --> 46:51.080\nchange that have failed have been ones that are, that kind of like, you go to a different\n\n46:51.080 --> 46:53.000\nplace and it'll be good and then it will be bad.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:54.000\nOr they're just bad in general.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:55.000\nOr they're just bad in general.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:56.000\nI mean, those are the worst.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:57.520\nSo it was just places that taste like shit.\n\n46:57.520 --> 47:01.840\nWe went to this place that I had fond memories of from my childhood, um, Keros, which is\n\n47:01.840 --> 47:04.040\na, a West coast chain.\n\n47:04.040 --> 47:05.560\nKeros, Keros.\n\n47:05.560 --> 47:10.680\nYeah, um, and at one point they were pretty, it was pretty big and it was well reviewed\n\n47:10.680 --> 47:11.680\nand it was well revered.\n\n47:11.680 --> 47:13.840\nThat was a place that would be like a treat.\n\n47:13.840 --> 47:15.480\nAnd now it's kind of, it's dying.\n\n47:15.480 --> 47:18.840\nIt got bought off by a larger company and it went from, you know, I think at its peak,\n\n47:18.840 --> 47:20.200\nit had 60 locations.\n\n47:20.200 --> 47:21.840\nNow it's like 12 locations.\n\n47:21.840 --> 47:24.880\nWe went to one in South Pasadena, which was like one of the only ones in the greater\n\n47:24.880 --> 47:25.880\nLA area.\n\n47:25.880 --> 47:28.040\nAnd it was just, it was a real sad, sad scene.\n\n47:28.040 --> 47:30.640\nWe asked the wait, we were like, what do you like to eat at this place?\n\n47:30.640 --> 47:31.920\nAnd she was like, nothing.\n\n47:31.920 --> 47:32.920\nShe said that.\n\n47:32.920 --> 47:34.920\nShe just said nothing at all.\n\n47:34.920 --> 47:41.360\nAnd we were like, oh, um, Keros has rice pudding, by the way, uh, nobody has rice\n\n47:41.360 --> 47:42.360\npudding.\n\n47:42.360 --> 47:43.360\nYeah.\n\n47:43.360 --> 47:44.360\nYou can get a rice pudding at Keros.\n\n47:44.360 --> 47:47.320\nWell, I think that's, I think that's the thing of like the entire clientele, except\n\n47:47.320 --> 47:53.480\nfor us was, uh, was older adults, was seniors who I think it was like, oh, this is my comforting\n\n47:53.480 --> 47:55.000\nplace that I've gotten used to.\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:59.960\nBut I think, you know, do you guys ever go to Sambo's or are you two young Sambo's?\n\n47:59.960 --> 48:00.960\nYeah.\n\n48:00.960 --> 48:01.960\nNo, not me.\n\n48:01.960 --> 48:07.880\nI was about to say, there's a place called Sambo's.\n\n48:07.880 --> 48:10.880\nI think there might be still one that exists.\n\n48:10.880 --> 48:11.880\nSanta Barbara.\n\n48:11.880 --> 48:12.880\nOh my God.\n\n48:12.880 --> 48:13.880\nIt's still there.\n\n48:13.880 --> 48:19.320\nAnd they maintain that's why it's called Sambo's short for Santa Barbara.\n\n48:19.320 --> 48:23.080\nWe know better from the logo.\n\n48:23.080 --> 48:25.680\nThe logo isn't a sunset behind a ship.\n\n48:25.680 --> 48:28.760\nUh, the, the, uh, did you, what about Barnaby's?\n\n48:28.760 --> 48:30.320\nYou guys ever hear Barnaby's?\n\n48:30.320 --> 48:32.680\nNo, we, have you heard of Barnaby's?\n\n48:32.680 --> 48:33.680\nWhere's Barnaby's?\n\n48:33.680 --> 48:37.080\nBarnaby's was, I mean, it was a place, so when I was a kid, I thought there was only\n\n48:37.080 --> 48:38.080\none Barnaby's.\n\n48:38.080 --> 48:39.080\nThat's the other thing.\n\n48:39.080 --> 48:42.200\nWhen you're a kid, you grow up, whatever, but, but, but that's the thing.\n\n48:42.200 --> 48:45.480\nWhen you're a kid, you just want to kill myself.\n\n48:45.480 --> 48:50.640\nUm, I just want to, I want to, I want to kill myself just so I can go to hell and, and have\n\n48:50.640 --> 48:53.440\neveryone there tell me to kill myself.\n\n48:53.440 --> 48:58.720\nMan, we would love to have you on the podcast because we talk like, we talk about fast food,\n\n48:58.720 --> 49:02.880\nbut like 70% of it is talking about killing ourselves.\n\n49:02.880 --> 49:03.880\nYeah.\n\n49:03.880 --> 49:10.200\nIf there isn't a death wish behind a podcast dedicated to reviewing chain restaurant food,\n\n49:10.200 --> 49:12.720\nthen I guess you'd have to go to the Philip Morris happy hour.\n\n49:12.720 --> 49:13.720\nI don't know.\n\n49:13.720 --> 49:17.080\nUm, we, we, we talk about them podcasts and then we get done with the podcast and we text\n\n49:17.080 --> 49:19.040\neach other about how we want to kill ourselves.\n\n49:19.040 --> 49:21.480\nLike never stops happening.\n\n49:21.480 --> 49:25.960\nBy the way, for you 16 year olds listening, that is a sport among us, those of us over\n\n49:25.960 --> 49:28.320\n30, we're professionals.\n\n49:28.320 --> 49:29.320\nDo it.\n\n49:29.320 --> 49:32.480\nIf you, if you, if you have conflicted feelings, talk to somebody that's not the same thing.\n\n49:32.480 --> 49:34.880\nIt's not the same thing that you're feeling.\n\n49:34.880 --> 49:36.880\nHang in there and talk to somebody.\n\n49:36.880 --> 49:37.880\nAll right.\n\n49:37.880 --> 49:40.840\nUh, I want, I want, I want nothing on my hands, man.\n\n49:40.840 --> 49:45.240\nUh, I want to leave only footprints on this world and I already fucked up with that Chevy\n\n49:45.240 --> 49:57.440\nvoicemail and I was like, last thing I need is like, you know, just tumbler note and the\n\n49:57.440 --> 50:03.040\nbar, Barnaby's was a, but also I care if you're listening, the Barnaby's was like this.\n\n50:03.040 --> 50:08.200\nI had this like stained glass, it was an Italian restaurant, kind of Italian restaurant.\n\n50:08.200 --> 50:13.560\nIt was, it was a pizza place and, and, and it was, everything was, everything was like\n\n50:13.560 --> 50:19.400\nvarnished wood and darkness and, and like stained glass chandeliers and stained glass\n\n50:19.400 --> 50:21.600\nwindows that didn't let any light in.\n\n50:21.600 --> 50:25.040\nIf you were eating there during the day and then, and then there was like a little window\n\n50:25.040 --> 50:28.440\nto the kitchen, like some of those places have where you could watch the guys make the\n\n50:28.440 --> 50:29.440\npizza.\n\n50:29.440 --> 50:33.240\nUm, and, uh, I don't know, I don't know why I'm bringing it up because, well, because\n\n50:33.240 --> 50:34.560\nI never knew it was a chain.\n\n50:34.560 --> 50:39.040\nI just thought it was this place that it was in Milwaukee and my family would go there.\n\n50:39.040 --> 50:40.680\nIt was our big, that was our place.\n\n50:40.680 --> 50:47.280\nThat was that meant that like, like beyond let's go to McDonald's because it's a fuck\n\n50:47.280 --> 50:49.040\nit kind of night.\n\n50:49.040 --> 50:51.840\nThis was like, it's, it's special.\n\n50:51.840 --> 50:55.560\nIt's like a fuck it kind of night and, and we're in a good mood.\n\n50:55.560 --> 51:01.000\nUm, we're not, we're, and, and, and, and, and, and like, uh, it closed.\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:06.600\nI got taken over by this place called Tom Fulhery's, um, which was, it was on the heels\n\n51:06.600 --> 51:08.280\nof Chuck E. Cheese.\n\n51:08.280 --> 51:13.600\nIt was Chuck E. Cheese for adults, Tom Fulhery, uh, the logo was in, is it was in Miami Vice\n\n51:13.600 --> 51:19.200\nStyle blue neon and you would go into the idea was that the parents could hang out in\n\n51:19.200 --> 51:25.440\nthis swank 80s swingery kind of dining environment and, and there was a stack of free tokens\n\n51:25.440 --> 51:28.480\nfor the arcade in the corner, which was like this grotto.\n\n51:28.480 --> 51:30.560\nYou would just stuff your kids for the evening.\n\n51:30.560 --> 51:34.520\nAnd then it was like, so it was like pursuing the strange dichotomy.\n\n51:34.520 --> 51:36.560\nIt was like, like, like, hey, it's the 80s.\n\n51:36.560 --> 51:43.280\nMaybe your family's a liability, like, like, like, and Pac-Man's here to solve that problem.\n\n51:43.280 --> 51:46.080\nLike, like, like we've got the shit figured out, right?\n\n51:46.080 --> 51:52.240\nEconomics, man, uh, we, and then, and that, but then my friend Dino took me to a Barnaby's\n\n51:52.240 --> 51:54.920\nin Chicago and it was identical.\n\n51:54.920 --> 51:56.960\nI had so many fucking flashbacks.\n\n51:56.960 --> 51:59.280\nI was like, wait, can I go to the bathroom?\n\n51:59.280 --> 52:00.280\nThe answer is yes.\n\n52:00.280 --> 52:07.280\nUh, but like the entire floor plan of the entire place was identical, which is another crazy\n\n52:07.280 --> 52:10.720\nthing about a chain restaurant is like, you could have, you could have a memory of your\n\n52:10.720 --> 52:16.480\nfavorite eighth birthday and then you could, if they're, if that, if that virus of that\n\n52:16.480 --> 52:20.000\nrestaurant survives in some pocket, even if you have to, you have to go find one somewhere,\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:21.880\nyou could like have all those flashbacks.\n\n52:21.880 --> 52:24.720\nWe just, we just recently, well, he's got something going on.\n\n52:24.720 --> 52:28.960\nUh, we recently went to Chuck E.

Cheese birthday, but I was like,\n\n54:05.640 --> 54:09.880\nthere were no, there was no discretion because those parties were just like, just tell basically\n\n54:09.880 --> 54:10.880\neverybody to come.\n\n54:10.880 --> 54:13.680\nIt's not like people were buying their pizza.\n\n54:13.680 --> 54:16.320\nIt was like, it was like a Midwestern thing was just show up.\n\n54:16.320 --> 54:18.040\nJust, they just didn't want me there.\n\n54:18.040 --> 54:19.040\nWho did?\n\n54:19.040 --> 54:21.040\nThey didn't want me in a public place.\n\n54:21.040 --> 54:24.400\nDan, who did not invite you to a Chuck E. Cheese?\n\n54:24.400 --> 54:25.400\nI said Steve.\n\n54:25.400 --> 54:26.400\nSteve.\n\n54:26.400 --> 54:27.400\nSteve who?\n\n54:27.400 --> 54:29.840\nI'm not going to name his last name.\n\n54:29.840 --> 54:30.840\nSteve?\n\n54:30.840 --> 54:31.840\nHamstack?\n\n54:31.840 --> 54:32.840\nNo.\n\n54:32.840 --> 54:33.840\nNo.\n\n54:33.840 --> 54:36.440\nI mean, the people who wronged me have suffered.\n\n54:36.440 --> 54:37.440\nBelieve me.\n\n54:37.440 --> 54:38.440\nWait.\n\n54:38.440 --> 54:42.440\nWhat did you do?\n\n54:42.440 --> 54:43.640\nI didn't do shit.\n\n54:43.640 --> 54:45.840\nI'm God's hammer and word.\n\n54:45.840 --> 54:54.080\nI'm finding karma just happens.\n\n54:54.080 --> 54:59.400\nSometimes you have the pleasure of, of, of feeling God hammering people using you as\n\n54:59.400 --> 55:00.400\nthe hammer.\n\n55:00.400 --> 55:02.760\nYou know, that's what Facebook's about, right?\n\n55:02.760 --> 55:08.640\nYou feel that nature actually is like tortured them or they actually got their comeuppance?\n\n55:08.640 --> 55:09.640\nI don't know.\n\n55:09.640 --> 55:15.000\nDo you think their goal was to like, just keep loving football and was that supposed to\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:16.960\nmake them like really happy or?\n\n55:16.960 --> 55:19.800\nI mean, did something terrible happen to that person?\n\n55:19.800 --> 55:24.680\nI'd say there's no burnt houses or anything on their Facebook profiles, but I check in\n\n55:24.680 --> 55:38.400\nand I go like, yeah, yeah, told you, told you baseball was dumb.\n\n55:38.400 --> 55:47.880\nI don't post that on their page, but I say it to myself and I masturbate crying fall asleep.\n\n55:47.880 --> 55:49.800\nAnd I don't come a lot.\n\n55:49.800 --> 55:53.080\nI come desperate, sad little droplets.\n\n55:53.080 --> 55:59.520\nWell, after hearing this, just to be clear, Nick and I don't fuck at all.\n\n55:59.520 --> 56:01.360\nWe don't fuck anything.\n\n56:01.360 --> 56:09.840\nBut we went, we went to, I went to Chuck E. Cheese by myself and then a friend for those\n\n56:09.840 --> 56:18.040\nof you who aren't video subscribers, the crowd gasped Mitch, Mitch isn't, Mitch isn't a guy\n\n56:18.040 --> 56:23.040\nyou hope as a parent to see at a Chuck E. Cheese by himself.\n\n56:23.040 --> 56:30.480\nYou'd rather see him there with a kid and a baby Bjorn, a friend, a friend, a grown\n\n56:30.480 --> 56:36.840\nadult friend, joined me, a man, and we, it's getting worse.\n\n56:36.840 --> 56:39.640\nIf he looked like Stanley Tucci, it just makes it worse.\n\n56:39.640 --> 56:43.960\nIt's just like, like you have like an accomplice.\n\n56:43.960 --> 56:45.120\nIt was, it was not good.\n\n56:45.120 --> 56:51.440\nWe sat by the stage and he want, he was like intent on playing Ski Ball afterwards and\n\n56:51.440 --> 56:53.080\nI was like, please, we, I was sweating.\n\n56:53.080 --> 56:56.560\nI was like, we need to get out of here as fast as possible.\n\n56:56.560 --> 56:59.760\nBut we played a little Ski Ball.\n\n56:59.760 --> 57:03.840\nIt's one of those virus restaurants that you were talking of like a virus chain where it's,\n\n57:03.840 --> 57:07.400\nit's, you're like, oh, I remember some of this, but it's not, nothing is right here.\n\n57:07.400 --> 57:08.960\nLike nothing feels right about it.\n\n57:08.960 --> 57:10.720\nI have the strangest, most specific memory.\n\n57:10.720 --> 57:15.640\nI went to, I went to show biz before it was Chuck E. Cheese one time and I think it was\n\n57:15.640 --> 57:19.800\nbecause my parents get so used to me coming home kind of like sad and then dragging it\n\n57:19.800 --> 57:25.320\nout of me that Steve didn't invite me and it was fucking gala again.\n\n57:25.320 --> 57:31.600\nSo at one point they actually took me to show biz, just my parents and me and we sat in\n\n57:31.600 --> 57:36.680\nthe back room and there was a, there was a Billy Bob the bear and he sang songs and stuff.\n\n57:36.680 --> 57:40.520\nI think I've talked about this in the podcast before because I remember it straight.\n\n57:40.520 --> 57:43.640\nI was probably 12 years old, 11.\n\n57:43.640 --> 57:46.280\nAnd they, they did this like letters section.\n\n57:46.280 --> 57:51.000\nThey would sing songs, the animatronic band, and then they did a letter like, oh, here's,\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:52.000\nhere's letters.\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:56.160\nAnd then one of the letters they read was from a kid who said, Billy Bob, how come when\n\n57:56.160 --> 58:03.120\nyou're on stage, you have bear feet with no shoes on and when you're wandering around\n\n58:03.120 --> 58:06.320\nthe arcade, you have sneakers on?\n\n58:06.320 --> 58:07.880\nWhy would they include that?\n\n58:07.880 --> 58:13.440\nTalk about like a weird shame, like fraud complex, like, just like, like, like a telltale heart.\n\n58:13.440 --> 58:19.280\nLike, they're like, we have to address this.\n\n58:19.280 --> 58:25.480\nAnd Billy Bob said, animatronic robot bear answered the question that the kid posed and\n\n58:25.480 --> 58:31.320\nsaid, well, the thing is, when I'm up here on stage, I don't want to fall off the stage.\n\n58:31.320 --> 58:36.120\nSo my bear toe claws help me keep balance up here.\n\n58:36.120 --> 58:40.560\nBut when I'm walking around there, while you're eating your food, no one wants to see my toenails\n\n58:40.560 --> 58:46.160\nout there, meanwhile, you're eating pizza and listening to him talking about his toenails\n\n58:46.160 --> 58:47.160\nand it's gross.\n\n58:47.160 --> 58:50.760\nSo mission not accomplished.\n\n58:50.760 --> 58:52.600\nAnd then they moved on.\n\n58:52.600 --> 58:59.360\nThat's my memory of Chopin's Pizza Place was just weird, like, over piping, like, sometimes\n\n58:59.360 --> 59:01.360\nif it's broke, don't fix it.\n\n59:01.360 --> 59:05.720\nI feel like you can't hear any of that stuff anymore, because it's just like the whirring\n\n59:05.720 --> 59:11.440\nof like a 20 year old robot is all you can hear now, it's just like the stirring of the\n\n59:11.440 --> 59:15.240\nrobots and the flapping of their eyelids and stuff.\n\n59:15.240 --> 59:16.960\nIt's very off-putting.\n\n59:16.960 --> 59:17.960\nThere must be a thing.\n\n59:17.960 --> 59:25.480\nSo it must be at this point, there must be a heavy, like the pie chart of their customer\n\n59:25.480 --> 59:32.280\nbase, a lot, a big slice of it must be nostalgic adults coming in to relive a childhood memory\n\n59:32.280 --> 59:34.200\nwho don't have kids with them.\n\n59:34.200 --> 59:40.720\nJust on my, me and Mitch's anecdotal experience, I would say that's a very small slice.\n\n59:40.720 --> 59:46.280\nIt feels like they're mostly families and if you're adults alone without kids, you're\n\n59:46.280 --> 59:50.640\ndrawing eyeballs for being very, very, I don't know, I don't know how much of the nostalgia\n\n59:50.640 --> 59:54.640\ncrowd that it's attracting among people who don't have kids, maybe people who take their\n\n59:54.640 --> 59:57.920\nkids and like, oh, there's a place I used to go to with a kid.\n\n59:57.920 --> 01:00:04.160\nSo if you are over 30 and you do want to take a nostalgic trip back to an animatronic-themed\n\n01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:10.560\npizza place, take a kid.\n\n01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.720\nMaybe one you know, whatever, just find a kid and have him with you so the other parents\n\n01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.720\ncan be comfortable.\n\n01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.080\nWe were afraid we were going to get stopped.\n\n01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.360\nBut leave with a different kid.\n\n01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.800\nThey have controls in place for that.\n\n01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800\nThey have controls, yeah.\n\n01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.800\nThey have their checks and balances.\n\n01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.320\nWell, yeah, the ball pit, man, tells no tales.\n\n01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.840\nThe ball pit tells no tales.\n\n01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.080\nThat's like the pig pen in Deadwood.\n\n01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.080\nCock sucker.\n\n01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.080\nSwagin'.\n\n01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:45.240\nTake him to the ball pit.\n\n01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:49.160\nWhen you get in there, there's like an airlock system and you have to like, wait in a cattle\n\n01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.440\ncrate and they come over and give you wristbands that are color coordinated so that they know\n\n01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.960\nthat you're leaving with the correct children.\n\n01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.960\nOh, God.\n\n01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.960\nWhat?\n\n01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:58.960\nYeah, it's really, really crazy.\n\n01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.960\nWow.\n\n01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.520\nI mean, that represents some actual crimes.\n\n01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520\nYeah.\n\n01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.040\nThey used to have a hand stamp.\n\n01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.560\nThey used to have this hand stamp, it was like ultraviolet, you know, and so there'd\n\n01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.720\nbe a letter on it.\n\n01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:17.600\nBut then I think they realized you could just like buy those stamps and that's why they\n\n01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600\ndo wristbands.\n\n01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.600\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.600\nThis is a rabbit hole.\n\n01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:26.200\nIt's making it so hard for me to go and just steal children from Chuck E. Cheese.\n\n01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.800\nI just, I showed that, I have to book on this guy, Steve Levy's not here so this will\n\n01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:37.240\nfall on deaf ears, but I want to book on the podcast because I don't want to do any research.\n\n01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:47.160\nI want to know like is the actual, like what the hell is it, what is, is there more terrible\n\n01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:54.080\nthings happening to children per capita or is this like a weird group?\n\n01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.440\nWhat guest is going to solve that problem for you?\n\n01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.000\nA child molester?\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.280\nJanet Jackson.\n\n01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280\nA census taker?\n\n01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280\nI don't fucking know.\n\n01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.560\nYeah, I can't really go back to the same house and they're gone.\n\n01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.000\nNo, I don't know actually.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.240\nSomebody who could actually just say like, no, well here's the thing because I know there's\n\n01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.800\na variety of variables.\n\n01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.040\nFor instance, the population keeps exploding so even if you were to, so sometimes flat\n\n01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.280\nnumbers can be misleading.\n\n01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.880\nI'm just, I'm just, like Duncan was on this podcast and I'm like really, he really, like\n\n01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.720\nwhat he was like saying, oh never mind.\n\n01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.160\nI'm not going to quote him again because it was so funny but it makes him sound like\n\n01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.160\na villain too.\n\n01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.080\nI just like, like, like it's, we're, we've become obsessed.\n\n01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.000\nObviously our national psyche is like doting on this like idea, we can't have a conversation\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.400\nthat involves children without immediately, like it's, it's, it's like a syndrome of like\n\n01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:53.960\nboth comedians have learned it and like actual concern and it's all feeding into itself.\n\n01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:59.120\nIt's like this zeitgeist pocket of like, oh my God, children are just like this, like,\n\n01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.520\nlike, like candy apple just like rolling around and like, they're just, they have targets\n\n01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:10.600\non every side of their body and like the world is made of arrows and I, I'm not interested\n\n01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600\nin them.\n\n01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600\nI think they're gross.\n\n01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.600\nI think they're annoying.\n\n01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.000\nI think they don't know overkill.\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.200\nHave you ever tried to explain to a kid the comedy comes in fucking threes, not nineties?\n\n01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.120\nYeah, I get it.\n\n01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.240\nIt's an airplane.\n\n01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240\nFucking moron.\n\n01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240\nThe stuff they're into.\n\n01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240\nYeah.\n\n01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.240\nYou know what?\n\n01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.240\nSome of them are going to get taken.\n\n01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.240\nNo one will be agree with this side.\n\n01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:38.160\nSome of them are going to get taken sometimes, but a room has showed us that they get back\n\n01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160\nunharmed.\n\n01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.160\nI did.\n\n01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.160\nYeah.\n\n01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.160\nThey find their way back.\n\n01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.680\nI just, I'm just curious like, I was like, yeah, if there's something at work in the\n\n01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.880\nnational psyche, like there's some shift that happened, like we, we changed our perception\n\n01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.440\nof drugs several times.\n\n01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.200\nLike we've made, we made decisions.\n\n01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.240\nYou can trace them, you know, depending on your ideology, maybe it's that you can't\n\n01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.760\nfuck kids anymore.\n\n01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.760\nYou know?\n\n01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760\nMaybe it's impossible.\n\n01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.400\nI feel like through most of human history, people have just been fucking kids left and\n\n01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.400\nright.\n\n01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.400\nRight?\n\n01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.880\nLike the child, you know, like, you know, you'd get married at like 11 or 12 and then\n\n01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.320\nGreeks would fuck little boys is like, oh, it's actually, it's actual.\n\n01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.920\nIt's an actual absence of the legal recourse to do.\n\n01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920\nYeah.\n\n01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920\nI will say this.\n\n01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.840\nAt my confirmation, Cardinal Law was at my confirmation.\n\n01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.840\nHe gave mass.\n\n01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840\nCardinal Law?\n\n01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.880\nCardinal Law, like his name was Cardinal Law.\n\n01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.880\nCardinal Law.\n\n01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.880\nHe's, he's.\n\n01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.640\nWas he with corporal punishment?\n\n01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.280\nYou don't know about Cardinal Law.\n\n01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.120\nHave you, have you seen spotlight?\n\n01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.120\nYeah.\n\n01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.600\nCardinal Law is the Hulk Hogan of, of spotlight.\n\n01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:49.840\nCardinal Law, for real, that's amazing.\n\n01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.840\nGo on.\n\n01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:56.040\nHe's, he, you know, the villain of spotlight was a, gave the mass at my confirmation.\n\n01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.000\nAnd he, he, he asked a question, which I guess my godfather said it was a very easy\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nquestion.\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.040\nAnd he pointed to me and I didn't know the answer to the whole church laughed.\n\n01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:09.280\nSo, so I feel like I got him in some sort of way, you know?\n\n01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:15.520\nUh, yeah, no, Cardinal, Cardinal Law was, uh, was, uh, he, he, I mean, he covered it\n\n01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.520\nall up.\n\n01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.480\nI feel like that's where it all went wrong with the children thing, because when I, when\n\n01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:23.840\nI was in elementary school, I'd walk home from school in elementary school.\n\n01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.600\nLike I feel like third grade, I'd be walking home from school.\n\n01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.400\nIt seems like the shit, that's what, the, the, the, the things that I would do when\n\n01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:38.400\nI was a kid, the territory I occupied, the amount of fencing around it, both figuratively\n\n01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:45.520\nand literally like the amount of hours I was allowed to log unsupervised in the expansive\n\n01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.840\nterritory, et cetera.\n\n01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:53.520\nLike compared to what I, and I'm, does it like not like, if I had a kid right now, eight\n\n01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.180\nyears old, just based on nothing more than just cultural zeitgeist, the, the, the disparity\n\n01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:04.600\nbetween where, what I would let that kid do versus what I did when I was a kid is so vast.\n\n01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:10.560\nIt makes me ask the question, is also the environment actually, is the disparity actually\n\n01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560\nthere?\n\n01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560\nYeah.\n\n01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:17.000\nI would guess it's actually, I, I, I'm, I'm guessing this is based on nothing, no, but\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.040\nI'm guessing that it's both gotten less dangerous for kids, but we've gotten more awareness\n\n01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040\nof it.\n\n01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040\nThe internet.\n\n01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.040\nYeah.\n\n01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.040\nThe internet is everything.\n\n01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040\nAll local news is national news now.\n\n01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:32.280\nSo every horrific, you know, horrific crime that occurs or horrific accident that, that\n\n01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.320\nhappens with a, with a kid in a car seat you hear about, and it, it just feeds that national\n\n01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320\nheart.\n\n01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320\nYeah.\n\n01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.280\nWe're in fascination with, with, you know, not because we're bad people, but because\n\n01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.840\nwe're good people, probably at heart, like we want to, you know, it's like the things\n\n01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.160\nthat are going to pop and sizzle off of a big frying pan full of grease called the internet\n\n01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.480\nare stories about innocence, you know, we get it, getting, getting hurt, you know.\n\n01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480\nOh yeah.\n\n01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.800\nI read a, I read a fucking long ass piece.\n\n01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.080\nI don't know why I do this to myself, but I read really long, like true crime pieces\n\n01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.000\nand I read a long piece of just about kids who were trapped in hot cars.\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.680\nAnd there was like, there's this, this one part that stick, that stuck with me.\n\n01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.040\nIt may, it'll probably stick with you now, so I apologize, but there was a, they'd asked\n\n01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.600\na detective what was the worst thing they'd ever seen involving one of these cases.\n\n01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600\nI've heard this before.\n\n01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600\nShould I not share this?\n\n01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.600\nShould I not?\n\n01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600\nI won't share it.\n\n01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.600\nNo, I do.\n\n01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.280\nWe're all, we're all, no, it's, it's part of our media watchdog segment.\n\n01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280\nWe're all good people.\n\n01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.280\nEverybody.\n\n01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.200\nYou know, buckle your holy shit belts.\n\n01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.000\nThey're, what was the worst thing you ever saw investigating one of these, these cases?\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.840\nAnd I remember it said the detective took a pause to gather themself.\n\n01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:45.640\nYou don't have to include that part.\n\n01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.040\nThere was a little girl who was two, who was trapped in a car.\n\n01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.440\nIt was a hundred degrees.\n\n01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:56.080\nAnd when they found her, she was dead and she had torn all her hair out of her head.\n\n01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:02.640\nWell, that's been our show guys, thanks for, thanks for coming.\n\n01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.640\nHoly shit.\n\n01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.640\nJust a nightmare.\n\n01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.640\nJust a nightmare.\n\n01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:16.240\nThere was a, in the, in the, I think New Yorker magazine, a LAPD homicide detective was asked.\n\n01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:21.480\nThey found like a couple of dead bodies up in Angeles national forest.\n\n01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:26.160\nAnd like, they had been there for, you know, many years.\n\n01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:30.840\nAnd a reporter asked the detective, how many people do you think are buried out here?\n\n01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:36.240\nAnd he said, if I asked everybody buried in national, like Angeles national forest to\n\n01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.040\nstand up, it would look like Venice beach.\n\n01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.560\nIt's like, like, that's where you, that's where you go to bury people.\n\n01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.960\nSo like, when you, when you're driving by on the two freeway, they don't, they don't\n\n01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:59.920\nwant to be silver robots, they all have roller skates, they all have boom boxes in the shoulders.\n\n01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:07.800\nThe amount of caricature art.\n\n01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.720\nWe are surrounded by a forest full of murdered people.\n\n01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.160\nWell, according to that cop, I mean, I, and I have no reason to doubt him, but also Mark\n\n01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.640\nFurman as an example, I don't know, he had information to like, like, like, like cops\n\n01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:27.240\nare, you know, they're not, they don't graduate from cop college to become cops.\n\n01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.200\nThey, they, some of them are, some of them know exactly what they're talking about.\n\n01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.760\nAnd some of them are like, I wish I was Mickey Spillane.\n\n01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.280\nHe was a hard boiled, like kind of writer.\n\n01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.840\nAlso, another, there's also one of Miller lights, all stars.\n\n01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.040\nAnother LAPD cop said that there's probably more dead bodies between us and Catalina right\n\n01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.040\nnow, because if you want to really kill somebody, have a boat.\n\n01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.040\nYeah, man.\n\n01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.040\nDave, don't youp that.\n\n01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.040\nThat's it.\n\n01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.040\nThat was a wrong time to youp.\n\n01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.040\nThat's how you do it.\n\n01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.040\nAll right.\n\n01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:09.280\nI, uh, but you guys, we should, we should all, let's all kill someone tonight and find out\n\n01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280\nwho wins.\n\n01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.560\nBy the way, I thought, where's my clock?\n\n01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.560\nI'm flying blind here.\n\n01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.680\nOh my God.\n\n01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680\nThe cops in Quincy.\n\n01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680\nIt's 9-12.\n\n01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680\nYou see?\n\n01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680\nGod damn it.\n\n01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.680\nI'll explain later.\n\n01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.680\nWe finally forgot.\n\n01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.680\nOh, no.\n\n01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680\nOh, I get it.\n\n01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:37.680\nIt turns out all you had to do is turn a clock off and we can forget.\n\n01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:48.240\nUh, 9-13, what a bummer.\n\n01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.920\nOf the thoughts swirling in my head are, I'm going to, I'm going to, you know, there's\n\n01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:59.080\na good chance what I'm about to do will ruin an episode as, you know, zip.\n\n01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.840\nBut let's just, I'm going to wing it.\n\n01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.960\nBecause of the, uh, we're overrepresented on one side, I'll ask for a female volunteer\n\n01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:17.920\nor someone, someone who, uh, compartmentalizes as such, uh, the, uh, uh, and, uh, anybody\n\n01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:26.360\nwho has, uh, a relationship, positive, negative, anything noteworthy that they're willing\n\n01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.840\nto share their relationship about their mother.\n\n01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.840\nUh, all right, we're going to hand go up pretty quickly here.\n\n01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.840\nCome join us.\n\n01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.840\nCome up.\n\n01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.840\nHello.\n\n01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.840\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.840\nLauren.\n\n01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.840\nLauren?\n\n01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.840\nYes.\n\n01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.840\nI've met you before.\n\n01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.840\nWow.\n\n01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840\nYeah.\n\n01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.840\nNice to meet you again.\n\n01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:48.840\nYes.\n\n01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:49.840\nUh, Lauren, uh, yeah.\n\n01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.840\nSo, uh, did you, did you have a good mother's day?\n\n01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:58.840\nNo, no, I did not.\n\n01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.840\nUh, not, not, is it, okay.\n\n01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.840\nWell, uh, I'll walk down this path of, uh, okay.\n\n01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.840\nSo is it because you don't get along with your mom?\n\n01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.840\nYes.\n\n01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.840\nNever really have actually.\n\n01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.840\nSo it's never been a good mother's day.\n\n01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.840\nShe's always found a way out of it by either getting mad at us.\n\n01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.840\nMy brother and I, uh, or canceling mother's day.\n\n01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.840\nLike today I was going to plan to take her to Monterey because\n\n01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.840\nthat's where her mother is scattered.\n\n01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.840\nAnd she's always, she was never there when her mother got\n\n01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840\nscattered.\n\n01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.840\nSo I wanted to take her there to be with her mom.\n\n01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.840\nAnd maybe a couple of weeks ago, she got mad at my brother and I\n\n01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.840\nand canceled mother's day.\n\n01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.840\nBasically by sending us a text message saying, I want nothing.\n\n01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.840\nDon't do anything for me.\n\n01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.840\nThis is like a refreshingly, not to call your problems refreshing,\n\n01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840\nbut so effervescent.\n\n01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.840\nDelicious.\n\n01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.840\nUh, but like typically somebody, I mean, like, like, I'm, like,\n\n01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.840\nyou're, you're, so you're somebody that's like, like, you're,\n\n01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.840\nyou're, your mom, your mom ruins mother's day by saying,\n\n01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.840\nI don't want anything.\n\n01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.840\nLike, it's like, like this is a generational thing, maybe, or no,\n\n01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.840\nnot to dismiss it.\n\n01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.840\nIt's very personal.\n\n01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:18.840\nOkay.\n\n01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.840\nUh, I just think it's, it's neat.\n\n01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.840\nIt's neat because with my mom and the problem is like, oh shit,\n\n01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.840\nwhat am I supposed to, I don't know.\n\n01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.840\nUm, and with your mom, you're saying like, why am I commenting\n\n01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840\nat it?\n\n01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.840\nHow am I helping?\n\n01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.840\nUm, uh, let's, let's get, let's get to the, to the, to the root of\n\n01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.840\nthis.\n\n01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:38.840\nUh, so your, your mom is how old she's 51.\n\n01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.840\nSo you're a youngster.\n\n01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.840\nI am a youngster.\n\n01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.840\nDid she have you very young?\n\n01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.840\nUh, I don't remember or I don't know.\n\n01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840\nI mean, I'm 25.\n\n01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.840\nSo 25 years ago.\n\n01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840\nOkay.\n\n01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.840\nUm, yeah.\n\n01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.840\nSo well, so you're at the age where your mom had you is what\n\n01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.840\nit sounds like.\n\n01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.840\nDid she live in town or is she out of state?\n\n01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.840\nShe just moved.\n\n01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.840\nI just moved out.\n\n01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.840\nYeah.\n\n01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.840\nSo you're trying to reach out to her and say, let's hang out.\n\n01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840\nLet's go.\n\n01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.840\nLet's go be in Monterey.\n\n01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:14.840\nThat's, that's Monterey Mike.\n\n01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.840\nYou reached out to your mom and she's like, she, she didn't want\n\n01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.840\nany part of that.\n\n01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.840\nI didn't even get to tell her that that's what I was going to do\n\n01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.840\nfor her.\n\n01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.840\nDo you think if, if you told her that she'd be open to that or\n\n01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.840\nno?\n\n01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.840\nNo.\n\n01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.840\nWell, because she said a couple of weeks ago, could you tell her,\n\n01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.840\nyou're comfortable talking about that event?\n\n01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.840\nWhat, what was the conflict that resulted in your mom canceling\n\n01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:36.840\nMother's Day weeks in advance?\n\n01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.840\nTo be honest, I always forget why.\n\n01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.840\nIt's kind of weird.\n\n01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.840\nIt's like an ongoing thing I could do.\n\n01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.840\nI could breathe wrong.\n\n01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.840\nI could come home at a wrong time.\n\n01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:51.840\nI could do one little thing wrong and it's just a constant cycle.\n\n01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.840\nIt's always been like that.\n\n01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.840\nYou said come home.\n\n01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.840\nDo you live with her?\n\n01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.840\nI used to live with her.\n\n01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.840\nYeah.\n\n01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.840\nWhat about other holidays?\n\n01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.840\nIs there also Christmas is canceled.\n\n01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.840\nMother's Day is canceled.\n\n01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.840\nWait from today, just from today.\n\n01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.840\nYeah.\n\n01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.840\nNo, it's, it's a constant thing.\n\n01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.840\nIt's never happy.\n\n01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.840\nIt's always, I have been finding ways to spend holidays with other\n\n01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840\nfamilies.\n\n01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.840\nWas that always the case throughout your childhood?\n\n01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:19.840\nYes.\n\n01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.840\nWhat do you think that's about for her?\n\n01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.840\nI know she says, she likes to say that she's not appreciated.\n\n01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.840\nAnd I, my brother and I have done our best, but we come from\n\n01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.840\ndivorced parents where it wasn't pretty.\n\n01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.840\nAnd it was a weird custody agreement.\n\n01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.840\nAnd we got tossed back and forth between our parents.\n\n01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.840\nAnd it was never kind of, it was a very unstable environment.\n\n01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.840\nSo that plus I also know things were triggered by like her\n\n01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:48.840\nupbringing.\n\n01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.840\nShe wasn't very friendly with her mother.\n\n01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.840\nAnd it's a constant.\n\n01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.840\nIt looks like it's been a cycle for years.\n\n01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.840\nSo it sounds like, yeah, I mean, like, like trauma gets handed\n\n01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.840\ndown.\n\n01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:04.840\nShe, she's not to speculate in either direction, like judging\n\n01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.840\nher or, or, or forgiving her, but just like from what I'm\n\n01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.840\nlearning in therapy, like one might speculate that these\n\n01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:18.840\nholidays represent like the opportunity for crisis.\n\n01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:23.840\nAnd that she's ironically trying to shut them down thinking\n\n01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.840\nthat that's going to solve the problem.\n\n01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.840\nBut of course she's creating new, she's just doing it again.\n\n01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.840\nYeah, that's exactly what I hear in therapy as well.\n\n01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.840\nThat she's like, she's like shutting off.\n\n01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.840\nShe's like, Oh, yeah, I don't want to have a heart attack.\n\n01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:39.840\nSo I'll shut off all blood to my heart, you know, that way\n\n01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.840\nI'll be perfectly immortal forever.\n\n01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.840\nAnd, and so like you're, you're able to know that, but like,\n\n01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.840\nlike, it's like, like, how do you so, and yet you're not\n\n01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.840\ngoing to do that when you have kids.\n\n01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.840\nAre you going to have kids?\n\n01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.840\nI'm going to have kids one day, maybe.\n\n01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.840\nYou're going to have them tonight.\n\n01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.840\nLet's spin the wheel.\n\n01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.840\nThat's the Harmontown guaranteed.\n\n01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:05.840\nProblematic.\n\n01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.840\nEverybody gets impregnated tonight.\n\n01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.840\nI feel like, I feel like that is like a common mom threat\n\n01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.840\nthough, right?\n\n01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.840\nLike that, like, like my mom gets frustrated around the\n\n01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.840\nholidays and then she's like, like, you guys aren't treating\n\n01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.840\nme well.\n\n01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.840\nWe're not going to do Christmas.\n\n01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.840\nLike I feel like that threat is there.\n\n01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:25.840\nDefinitely postponement and cause I learned the word\n\n01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:30.840\npostpone by studying notes left by my mother on Easter\n\n01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.840\nmorning, like, like, and Halloween morning and Christmas\n\n01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.840\nmorning.\n\n01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.840\nWe would, there would be like a big fight the previous\n\n01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.840\nnight and then we'd, we'd wake up and it would be like,\n\n01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.840\nmy brother would go like, there's a note and then we'd\n\n01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.840\nlook and it would say Easter has been postponed.\n\n01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.840\nAnd I remember that we're learning that word because\n\n01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.840\nby going over it with my brother going, does that mean\n\n01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.840\nEaster never will happen or does it mean it will happen\n\n01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.840\nlater? And he's like, I don't, I don't, I think it means it'll\n\n01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.840\nhappen later.\n\n01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.840\nWe'd like look it up.\n\n01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.840\nIt happens three days later.\n\n01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.840\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:07.840\nLike, like, like, so, so yeah, holiday, holiday control.\n\n01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:08.840\nYeah.\n\n01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.840\nIn the parental, I don't want to, I don't want to draw\n\n01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.840\nanalogies that are going to offend anybody, but like,\n\n01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.840\nlike, like, like young women who have eating disorders,\n\n01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.840\nit's like, like, like you're out of control.\n\n01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.840\nEverything in your life.\n\n01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.840\nThere's no, there's no threshold to fucking like, like\n\n01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.840\naccomplish anything like, like, like, that feels like,\n\n01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.840\nlike change and, and like the default place of like, oh,\n\n01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.840\nwell, I can, I can eat or not eat for lunch, you know, I can\n\n01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840\neat less or all these things.\n\n01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.840\nLike, and it kind of spirals into the syndrome of like, oh,\n\n01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.840\nthat makes me feel comfortable that I'm out of control.\n\n01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.840\nI would have like, like her emotional intake.\n\n01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.840\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.840\nWhat is it?\n\n01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.840\nLike, I'm not a therapist.\n\n01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.840\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.840\nLike, like, look, my point, what is my point?\n\n01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.840\nHow do we turn this into show?\n\n01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.840\nI was, I was, I was thinking, looking down the line that we\n\n01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.840\nhad a couple of improv trained guys.\n\n01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:02.840\nNo, I loved what you were saying.\n\n01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:03.840\nI mean, I agree with you.\n\n01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.840\nIt does feel like that kind of like a common thread and it\n\n01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.840\ncomes from a place of my mom not wanting to deal with it.\n\n01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.840\nMaybe it comes from a good place or something like that.\n\n01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.840\nWell, I'm sure like, she's, she implies like, I'm, she's\n\n01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.840\nheard that from a therapist already.\n\n01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.840\nLike it's, it's been dimensionalized and personified.\n\n01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.840\nShe gets it.\n\n01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.840\nYeah.\n\n01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.840\nLauren, like, let's say you had a kid, you know, a boy or girl.\n\n01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.840\nLet's say, let's say you had two.\n\n01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.840\nYou say you had one of each.\n\n01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.840\nDo you think that you would pass any of that on of your,\n\n01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.840\nyour mother's like hangups?\n\n01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.840\nDo you think that you'd be able to not do that?\n\n01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.840\nOr do you think you inherit that too?\n\n01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.840\nI, that's why I'm in therapy for my parent and my parents passed\n\n01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.840\ndown these traits to me and my therapist and I are trying to\n\n01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.840\nbreak those before I get into a relationship or have kids.\n\n01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.840\nSo I know like that I'm not going to pass those traits on and\n\n01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.840\nhopefully I have more of a healthier relationship with my\n\n01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.840\nfuture whoever or my future kids.\n\n01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.840\nCan you tell us like what the language your therapist is using\n\n01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.840\nlike in circling this area?\n\n01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.840\nLike what are some of the tools or things that you've learned\n\n01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.840\nor anything that's causing like an epiphany about it that\n\n01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:11.840\nyou, that sticks out as like, like just like in talking about\n\n01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.840\nyour mom and therapy and her relationship with these holidays\n\n01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.840\nand canceling them and stuff.\n\n01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.840\nHas your therapist said anything where you're like,\n\n01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.840\nOh, I remember this.\n\n01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:22.840\nIt's like she likes to tell me like when your mom gets into\n\n01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.840\nher screaming fits and things just kind of stay calm and\n\n01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.840\ncause normally I would fight back.\n\n01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.840\nI would argue back with her and say like that's not fair or\n\n01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.840\nwhatever.\n\n01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.840\nYou don't understand.\n\n01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.840\nI just would stay calm and like just say like, okay, mom,\n\n01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:39.840\nokay, mom, okay.\n\n01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.840\nAnd you should do that.\n\n01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.840\nWhy?\n\n01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.840\nBecause there's just therapists have a theory about what your\n\n01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.840\nmom's doing and then how it's going to play itself out.\n\n01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.840\nIt's her attention grabbing.\n\n01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.840\nShe's trying to get grab attention because she didn't have\n\n01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.840\nattention when she was younger.\n\n01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.840\nOh, but that's a weird.\n\n01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.840\nI mean, it's like, like, not that something being weird means\n\n01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.840\nit doesn't exist.\n\n01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:08.840\nI mean, look at flamingos knees, but the episode title.\n\n01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.840\nI lifted that from Oh God, the movie Oh God.\n\n01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.840\nI'm not a perfect guy.\n\n01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.840\nLook at flamingos kneecap.\n\n01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840\nThat's George Burns.\n\n01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.840\nOkay.\n\n01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.840\nSo the, but the, but it is just, I mean, it's just weird\n\n01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:26.840\nthinking like here are these days that are demarcated for\n\n01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.840\nspecialness and attention and all these things.\n\n01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:34.840\nAnd but like they're being superseded and your therapist is\n\n01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.840\ncertain like the stories.\n\n01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.840\nAre you sure your mom didn't actually endure trauma like,\n\n01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.840\nlike, like from family?\n\n01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.840\nIt's not, it's not about her needing attention.\n\n01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.840\nIt's about her actually avoiding trauma.\n\n01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.840\nLike, like, like, I think it's more attention.\n\n01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.840\nLike she was, she had like her history and she was the\n\n01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840\nmiddle child.\n\n01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.840\nShe wasn't cared about her brother and her sister were,\n\n01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.840\nyou know, the, oh, they're the best children in the world.\n\n01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.840\nShe had to do all the chores.\n\n01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.840\nI mean, mother's day with your kids.\n\n01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.840\nIt's, there's, there's not a lot of competition for that corner.\n\n01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.840\nIt's like you only have so many kids and it's like,\n\n01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.840\nthey don't have other moms that are like going to box her out.\n\n01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.840\nI could sit like, like, like, but, but in her mind,\n\n01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.840\nit's like maybe festivity and tradition and stuff.\n\n01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:23.840\nIt's all like a ritualistic way of like maybe somehow\n\n01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.840\nminimizing her.\n\n01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.840\nLauren, how much do you, do you think that you like inherit\n\n01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.840\nyour mother's traits?\n\n01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.840\nLike how much of you is she?\n\n01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:39.840\nUm, I would say, like, I share 50-50 of my father and my mom.\n\n01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.840\nLike, I mean, physicality, like, looks and stuff and personality.\n\n01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.840\nAre you close with your dad?\n\n01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.840\nI kind of, I feel like I'm closer with my dad.\n\n01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:51.840\nThen mom?\n\n01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.840\nThen mom, because mom tends to push away a little bit more\n\n01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.840\nbecause she says she's, she's tried enough.\n\n01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:04.840\nAnd my dad, he, he will still reach out.\n\n01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.840\nEven if he's angry at me, though, like time will pass\n\n01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.840\nand then he'll try to reach out.\n\n01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.840\nMy mom says that she's done enough.\n\n01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.840\nShe's tried enough.\n\n01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.840\nThere's like these hints at backstory with your mom.\n\n01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.840\nLike she's somehow been victimized to the past,\n\n01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.840\nnot only by her parents, but actually by you guys.\n\n01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:22.840\nYeah, we, I mean, it was really hard because my dad was,\n\n01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.840\nwhen they got divorced, it was a very ugly divorce.\n\n01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:30.840\nShe felt, oh, she felt, she felt, she felt like she was in a pageant\n\n01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.840\nto like compete as a parent.\n\n01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.840\nYeah, parents do that.\n\n01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:34.840\nThey feel like they need to compete.\n\n01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.840\nMy mom felt like she needed to give us anything and everything we wanted.\n\n01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:43.840\nAnd then we kind of, my dad on the other end was telling us like,\n\n01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.840\noh, your mom, you know, she's a liar.\n\n01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.840\nShe's, you know, she left you guys, she left you with us\n\n01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.840\nor left, left me with you guys.\n\n01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.840\nAnd then like things like child support, like your mom didn't give enough money\n\n01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.840\nfor child support.\n\n01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.840\nAnd so, I mean, it's this really vicious cycle.\n\n01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:03.840\nAre you and your brother close?\n\n01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.840\nKind of, not really.\n\n01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.840\nOur family's kind of broken.\n\n01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.840\nIt's all, it's all fractious.\n\n01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840\nYeah.\n\n01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840\nOkay.\n\n01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.840\nSo, well, so I was going to, I was going to have somebody come up\n\n01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.840\nand then I was going to like maybe fix their problem\n\n01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.840\nin the form of like an improv scene, not doing that.\n\n01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.840\nOh my God.\n\n01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.840\nThat would be, I'm pre-problematizing that.\n\n01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.840\nThank you.\n\n01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:28.840\nI was entertained by the podcast where Laura was just sitting there crying\n\n01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.840\nand while you guys made jokes about the mythologizing her situation.\n\n01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.840\nBut it's amazing that you can come up and talk about that\n\n01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.840\nand be like that open about it.\n\n01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.840\nYeah, thank you so much for bearing that stuff.\n\n01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840\nI was not aware of that.\n\n01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:41.840\nThank you.\n\n01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.840\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.840\nBut stay here for a second.\n\n01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.840\nLife all comes at a price.\n\n01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.840\nWe all pay a price for being ourselves and like, like,\n\n01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.840\nyou didn't, you didn't earn or deserve any of that,\n\n01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.840\nbut you're trying your best to like not pass that along.\n\n01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.840\nAnd we, like clearly if you had a kid,\n\n01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.840\nI think we can all agree that you would be a good mom.\n\n01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.840\nMaybe the, maybe the exercise is to,\n\n01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.840\nis to prove that with a,\n\n01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.840\nUh-oh.\n\n01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.840\nA scene will do a radio play,\n\n01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.840\nimprovised radio play.\n\n01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.840\nOh, no.\n\n01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.840\nAnd your role, don't worry.\n\n01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.840\nYou don't have to be like, like Johnny on the spot or anything.\n\n01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.840\nWe'll just, you can just say,\n\n01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.840\nlike you'll be the matriarch of a family and we'll,\n\n01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.840\nand we'll just, uh,\n\n01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.840\nWe're the kids?\n\n01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.840\nWell, we'll start with like,\n\n01:25:37.840 -->

your husband.\n\n01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.840\nUh, I'm assuming you,\n\n01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.840\nwhen you, when you first see yourself having kids,\n\n01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.840\nyou first see yourself,\n\n01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.840\nI don't want to heteronormatize you or anything.\n\n01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:55.840\nLike, do you see yourself as like married to a dude that has a,\n\n01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.840\nthat you have a kid with them as like a nuclear situation\n\n01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.840\nor is there some other fantasy in your head of like,\n\n01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.840\nof family?\n\n01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:05.840\nJust having kids.\n\n01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.840\nOkay.\n\n01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:07.840\nIt doesn't need to be anything special.\n\n01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.840\nNot with a big, okay.\n\n01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:10.840\nBut, okay.\n\n01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.840\nSo I'm being over cautious.\n\n01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.840\nI just don't want to, like,\n\n01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840\nby the way, I'm a lesbian.\n\n01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840\nYou totally offended me the whole time.\n\n01:26:16.840 -->

01:26:34.840\nwe move through the ages and you and I will grow old together and die as our,\n\n01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.840\nas our family, as our family kind of continues as they have a family of their own\n\n01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.840\nand things and you and I will die of old age,\n\n01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.840\nhappy, assuming that that's part of the fantasy.\n\n01:26:43.840 -->

01:27:36.840\nOne baby kind of an asshole.\n\n01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.840\nWell, they're both going to be special to us.\n\n01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:40.840\nIsn't that right baby?\n\n01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.840\nYes, definitely.\n\n01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:42.840\nOkay.\n\n01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:43.840\nWell, let's bring them in.\n\n01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.840\nWell, they look to me, they look the same.\n\n01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.840\nI think it's great that we had two babies.\n\n01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.840\nMommy, daddy.\n\n01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.840\nThey're already speaking.\n\n01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.840\nWhoa, that's crazy.\n\n01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.840\nAlso, sorry, sorry, Dr. Schwarzman again.\n\n01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.840\nOne of your, one of your babies can already speak English.\n\n01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.840\nWell, you, you're stepping on the second baby's line.\n\n01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:15.840\nAw.\n\n01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.840\nWhat's

01:28:37.840\nI'm assuming there's equipment and things you probably have to,\n\n01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:38.840\nthey probably take a credit card.\n\n01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.840\nAll right.\n\n01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:42.840\nWe'll take, we'll take the two special seats and,\n\n01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.840\nand like the bungee cord and the two bottles, I guess,\n\n01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:50.840\nand what diapers, throw some diapers in.\n\n01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.840\nWho cares?\n\n01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:58.840\nAnything's more comfortable than that pussy I just got out

room.\n\n01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:01.840\nI got a fucking log in my pants.\n\n01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:12.840\nSo me out.\n\n01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.840\nI mean, it's, it's, it's so hard to stay mad at you, but like,\n\n01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.840\ncause you're so, you're so above board about everything, but\n\n01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.840\nhow do you do an angel?\n\n01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:29.840\nTony tried to garret me with the mobile cord.\n\n01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.840\nTony, stay away from my past by a little bitch.\n\n01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.840\nStay on your side of the room.\n\n01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.840\nYou guys are sharing a crib.\n\n01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:38.840\nYou're just a month old.\n\n01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.840\nLike, like, you're not supposed to be first of all talking,\n\n01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:46.840\nsecond of all, garretting, third of all, understanding\n\n01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:47.840\npossession.\n\n01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.840\nWe had, we had hoped to avoid that.\n\n01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.840\nLike, it's like a runaway train.\n\n01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:54.840\nWell, here, let me change your diaper.\n\n01:30:54.840 -->

Jewish and mom's Lutheran and you're our\n\n01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.840\nlittle angel.\n\n01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.840\nSo we felt you were chosen.\n\n01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.840\nAnd so we circumcised you.\n\n01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.840\nIs that the answer you were looking for?\n\n01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:40.840\nIt's an answer.\n\n01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.840\nWhy are you asking the questions, buddy?\n\n01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:51.840\nI'm the one who's going to do all this shmegma and so on.\n\n01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.840\nOh, shit.\n\n01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:57.840\nIt's three

that.\n\n01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.840\nYou know what the secret is for the egg salad?\n\n01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.840\nI use mom's eggs.\n\n01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.840\nI use mom's eggs.\n\n01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.840\nYou're laughing so much while you're saying it.\n\n01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.840\nIt's hard to quite make it out.\n\n01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.840\nYou're saying you use mom's eggs.\n\n01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.840\nThat's what you said.\n\n01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.840\nYou use mom's eggs.\n\n01:34:51.840 --> 01:35:02.840\nIn 2020, you have eschewed internet culture and created a telephone-based deli and have\n\n01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.840\nlearned to harvest eggs in a month.\n\n01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.840\nAnd you're laughing about it.\n\n01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:16.840\nWhat's it do you, buddy?\n\n01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.840\nAngel, you all right?\n\n01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.840\nHave you shit your pants?\n\n01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:26.840\nThe doctor said one of us was special and one of us would be kind of an asshole.\n\n01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:32.840\nAnd I'm starting to wonder, maybe Tony's the one who's special.\n\n01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.840\nAnd maybe I'm the one who's kind of an asshole.\n\n01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.840\nThat's what special people always think.\n\n01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.840\nYou're going to be like me.\n\n01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.840\nYou're going to be a writer.\n\n01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.840\nHello?\n\n01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.840\nDr. Schwarzman

glasses.\n\n01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:30.840\nThis here's the wildest ride in the wilderness.\n\n01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:31.840\nDumbo.\n\n01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.840\nHe's kind of westernized the Dumbo ride.\n\n01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:39.840\nEver since the Will Smith movie.\n\n01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.840\nThey changed the rides to fit the movie.\n\n01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.840\nMain seated,

lot?\n\n01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.840\nI want to go see the baby from Roger Rabbit that's a lot like me.\n\n01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:03.840\nYou know the one I'm talking about.\n\n01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.840\nJust be quiet.\n\n01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:10.840\nAnd watch the show that we're in or the ride that we're on.\n\n01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.840\nWhat are you going to say, Angel, you dumb asshole?\n\n01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:20.840\nTony told me that the real Splash Mountain is...\n\n01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:27.840\nWhat happens to girls' pussies when he's around?\n\n01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.840\nTony, what are you?\n\n01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.840\nA Comedy Central writer?\n\n01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:36.840\nYou're one year old.\n\n01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:41.840\nHey, he's going to learn it sooner or later, you know what I mean?\n\n01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.840\nLauren, can I see you for a moment?\n\n01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:45.840\nKids, stay here.\n\n01:37:45.840 -->

this.\n\n01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.840\nLife happens.\n\n01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.840\nThank you, you brought me strength.\n\n01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.840\nThank you.\n\n01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.840\nMommy, daddy.\n\n01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.840\nHey, Angel, I snuck away from Tony.\n\n01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:41.840\nI have an idea.\n\n01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:52.840\nLet's leave them in a hot monorail car.\n\n01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:55.840\nHey, what's going on over here?\n\n01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.840\nNothing, nothing.\n\n01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:04.840\nWell, let's put a pin in that and let's all take the monorail to a different area of the park.\n\n01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:06.840\nYeah, let's go to the vault.\n\n01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.840\nI want to see some of that anti-juice stuff that Disney loves.\n\n01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:11.840\nYou bet.\n\n01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:14.840\nAs long as the monorail takes us there.\n\n01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.840\nTwo tickets,

door.\n\n01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.840\nOh, I got you.\n\n01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:48.840\nHold on a second.\n\n01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:49.840\nLet me see here.\n\n01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.840\nCome

monorail.\n\n01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.840\nThis sounds like a bad performance, sir.\n\n01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.840\nDid you kill your wife and child?\n\n01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:43.840\nNo, they're

love your mother so fucking much, and I wish that she wasn't so dedicated to being\n\n01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:48.840\na good mother, because now she has to be with that turd for the rest of her life.\n\n01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.840\nCut to the Hot Monorail with Lauren and Tony.\n\n01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:59.840\nHoly shit, it's fucking hot up in here.\n\n01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.840\nBut as

your brother and your father again.\n\n01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:26.840\nOh, it's fucking over, I'm gonna stop tearing out my little baby hair, I guess.\n\n01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:31.840\nNo, no, no, no,

--> 01:42:55.840\nA mother and a child are trapped in a Hot Monorail between Disney and downtown Disney.\n\n01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:01.840\nThe baby seems to be from New York for some reason.\n\n01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.840\nPretty salty.\n\n01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:12.840\nMeanwhile, in the basement of the Pentagon, we close in on a hissing cryogenic chamber\n\n01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:17.840\nuntil, as the camera reaches the latches, they pop open.\n\n01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:22.840\nA familiar man leans forward, gasping for air.\n\n01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.840\nSomeone needs help.\n\n01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.840\nIt's Walt Disney.\n\n01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.840\nMr. Disney, we told you that you wouldn't wake up until the year 2038.\n\n01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:36.840\nWell, that's where I second guessed you, see.\n\n01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:44.840\nI designed my cryogenic chamber to also react to scenarios of peril at my own Disney world.\n\n01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:49.840\nSo are you aware that we have a Hot Monorail crisis going on?\n\n01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:55.840\nCorporal, I can't hear you over the sound of me strapping on this jet pack.\n\n01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:02.840\nDisney, away!\n\n01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:07.840\nCan you read my mind?\n\n01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:13.840\nI'm one person flying higher than I ever have.\n\n01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:17.840\nEvery star is a cup of water, every moon.\n\n01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:18.840\nThere's only one.\n\n01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:21.840\nI will eat it like a cupcake.\n\n01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.840\nI will also touch the sun.\n\n01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.840\nHello.\n\n01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.840\nHello.\n\n01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:28.840\nWalt Disney?\n\n01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:29.840\nYes.\n\n01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.840\nBecause why did you create Anti-Semitic Terror in Disneyland?\n\n01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.840\nOh, is that still going?\n\n01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:35.840\nYeah.\n\n01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.840\nOh, for crimony, jeez.\n\n01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.840\nI'll take care of it.\n\n01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.840\nJarvis.\n\n01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.840\nYes, sir.\n\n01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:51.840\nTake Target, The Monorail.\n\n01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:58.840\nRight away.\n\n01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:01.840\nLet's pop a hole in this can.\n\n01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.840\nI'm snarky.\n\n01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:15.840\nWalt Disney, it's me, your enemy, Notch Berry Farm.\n\n01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.840\nI don't even know who you are.\n\n01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:22.840\nDon't be a dick.\n\n01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.840\nWe got Monoism as revenge.\n\n01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.840\nIt's a pretty good perk.\n\n01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:33.840\nI've heated up your Monorails to almost unbearable temperatures.\n\n01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.840\nA mother and her son are about to die.\n\n01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:46.840\nWell, I guess we just need a little help from our friends, like the frozen girl.\n\n01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.840\nMake it real.\n\n01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.840\nMake it real.\n\n01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.840\nMake it alive.\n\n01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.840\nI can't remember the song.\n\n01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:57.840\nLet it go.\n\n01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.840\nMake it go.\n\n01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:00.840\nMake it real.\n\n01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:03.840\nIt's the copyright version.\n\n01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:05.840\nMake it real.\n\n01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:09.840\nMake it so.\n\n01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.840\nAh, now the whole Monorail is cold as a Jiminy Cricket.\n\n01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.840\nWait, we need someone to lasso that speeding Monorail.\n\n01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.840\nLook, it's Woody from Toy Story.\n\n01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.840\nYou are a guy I know.\n\n01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.840\nYou are a guy I know.\n\n01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.840\nI got it.\n\n01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:34.840\nThat'll slow it down to a crawl and eventually a stop.\n\n01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.840\nWe can get that baby and that mommy out of there.\n\n01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:43.840\nAnd to help, if only there were just a couple of fish from Pixar's fish movie.\n\n01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.840\nFish.\n\n01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.840\nWe're here.\n\n01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.840\nYou are a, we got a special situation.\n\n01:46:52.840 --> 01:47:03.840\nI was so racing to the point of Randy Newman's songs are the same.\n\n01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.840\nI couldn't fucking, I couldn't obey the rules of improv.\n\n01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:08.840\nI was like, no, I get it.\n\n01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.840\nA mine.\n\n01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:10.840\nI will eat.\n\n01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.840\nWhen we get there, Randy's mine.\n\n01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:15.840\nWalter, are you okay?\n\n01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:19.840\nNo, sorry, sorry guys.\n\n01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:25.840\nNow could y'all just give me a moment while I go down into the Monorail car and see to these two.\n\n01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:32.840\nI've always had a special place for dissatisfied customers.\n\n01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:39.840\nHoly shit, fucking Walt himself.\n\n01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.840\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:44.840\nWell, aren't you an articulate little man?\n\n01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:46.840\nI pulled all my hair out.\n\n01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:47.840\nI look like Tony Soprano.\n\n01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:48.840\nIt's a good thing.\n\n01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.840\nIt's good.\n\n01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:57.840\nI'm happy about it.\n\n01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.840\nYoung lady, is this your son?\n\n01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:00.840\nYes.\n\n01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.840\nI'm awful sorry you had a bad time at Disneyland.\n\n01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:10.840\nCan I just say that you should make it so you can just stop the Monorails.\n\n01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:16.840\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.840\nHe also said you should make it so anti-Semitic town doesn't happen.\n\n01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.840\nI can't control everything.\n\n01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:22.840\nOh, fucks.\n\n01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:24.840\nYou need some of that stuff.\n\n01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:25.840\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:33.840\nYou can't problemize everything.\n\n01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.840\nSometimes the tail wags the dog.\n\n01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:43.840\nSpeaking of which, what if I were to say to you, young man, that I had a special island\n\n01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:52.840\nwhere aggressive boys like you who maybe don't fit in as much when held to the standard of humanity\n\n01:48:52.840 --> 01:49:00.840\ncan be more adorable when surgically augmented to be half-animal?\n\n01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.840\nThere ain't Jewish guys over there or no?\n\n01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:03.840\nSure.\n\n01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:10.840\nDr. Moreau has changed his name to work in Chopin's surgery.\n\n01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:15.840\nYou know what I mean, no matter what, take me to that fucking island, Walt.\n\n01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:24.840\nMa'am, what if I were to tell you that the best thing you could do for this child was to let him go to a special island\n\n01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.840\nwhere he'd be mutilated surgically?\n\n01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:31.840\nRejoin your husband with the good child.\n\n01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.840\nLive out your days.\n\n01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.840\nBut I love him.\n\n01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840\nWhat is love, really?\n\n01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:41.840\nIf it's unconditional, then can't you just love a fire hydrant?\n\n01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.840\nTrue.\n\n01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.840\nIsn't all love somehow conditional?\n\n01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.840\nAren't we, therefore, somehow accountable to whether or not we are loved?\n\n01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:57.840\nAren't the people that get that the ones that become truly creative in an endless quest to make things,\n\n01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:08.840\nwhether they be bad movies or giant theme parks and just always just trying to get people to love us that didn't love us very much?\n\n01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:17.840\nI think if this child were to have floppy ears like grafted to the side of his head,\n\n01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:30.840\nfed spam from a stainless steel bowl and regularly whipped with a crazy Jedi electric whip so it didn't feel as violent\n\n01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.840\nbecause it's like sci-fi violence.\n\n01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:37.840\nI told you I'm fucking in already.\n\n01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:45.840\nYou're waiting for my fucking balls to drop over here, let's go.\n\n01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.840\nI just want to make sure the young lady's okay with it.\n\n01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.840\nI don't know if that's what he wants.\n\n01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.840\nI'm Italian, I'm part of Animal Anyways, let me go.\n\n01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.840\nThat is true.\n\n01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.840\nSo racist.\n\n01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.840\nBut so are animals.\n\n01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:01.840\nAnd we love them.\n\n01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:06.840\nDisney, yay, yay, yay!\n\n01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:16.840\nWalt Disney turned into a rocket and took the baby Tony to a special island where he was never seen again.\n\n01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:26.840\nLauren returned to giraffe parking where Dan and baby Angel were still unable to figure out how to get out.\n\n01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:29.840\nOh shit, it's your mother.\n\n01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:31.840\nPlay it cool.\n\n01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.840\nHey baby.\n\n01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:33.840\nHey.\n\n01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:34.840\nHi mama.\n\n01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:35.840\nHi.\n\n01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.840\nYou're gonna pull the car around.\n\n01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:40.840\nSure, you are.\n\n01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:48.840\nYou know I left you for dead in a hot monorail.\n\n01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:59.840\nI guess for all our effort, we're just all a big pile of whatever happened to us.\n\n01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:03.840\nSure.\n\n01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:04.840\nTony's gone.\n\n01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:07.840\nI noticed, I noticed.\n\n01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.840\nAre you stoked?\n\n01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:11.840\nI let him be what he wanted to be.\n\n01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:12.840\nNice.\n\n01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.840\nDead or just missing?\n\n01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:17.840\nApparently he's going to an island.\n\n01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.840\nHe's gonna be a half animal.\n\n01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:21.840\nI love it.\n\n01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:31.840\nBut what of his thriving deli business?\n\n01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:32.840\nWho's gonna answer that?\n\n01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:35.840\nThat's his phone.\n\n01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:36.840\nHello?\n\n01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:41.840\nI ordered a pastrami like a fucking four days ago.\n\n01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:44.840\nWhere's my goddamn sandwich?\n\n01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:49.840\nWell, well, you reached a baby click.\n\n01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:53.840\nNow that's a mother's day.\n\n01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:55.840\nYay.\n\n01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:58.840\nYou're the best there is.\n\n01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:02.840\nMother was the best.\n\n01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.840\nMother was the best.\n\n01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:10.840\nTop on the top for the mother's day.\n\n01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.840\nPanavision.\n\n01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:14.840\nThat was good.\n\n01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:15.840\nThat was good.\n\n01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:17.840\nI think we got to the...\n\n01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.840\nLet's thank Lauren, everybody.\n\n01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:19.840\nLauren.\n\n01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:23.840\nThank you, Lauren, for sharing your pain.\n\n01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:25.840\nWe fucking did it.\n\n01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.840\nWe solved mother's day.\n\n01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.840\nWe fixed mother's day.\n\n01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:31.840\nRight?\n\n01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:32.840\nDidn't we?\n\n01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:33.840\nYeah.\n\n01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:34.840\nNo.\n\n01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:36.840\nI mean, were you traveling?\n\n01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:39.840\nI think we made it worse, didn't we?\n\n01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:42.840\nYou're lonelier now than you were when you came up.\n\n01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:43.840\nNo.\n\n01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:44.840\nI love this place.\n\n01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:46.840\nHere's what the dough boys are.\n\n01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:48.840\nHere's some shitty advice from us.\n\n01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:50.840\nTomorrow can be your mother's day.\n\n01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:52.840\nBring her over some dinner or something\n\n01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.840\nand you can patch it all up tomorrow, if you'd like.\n\n01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:55.840\nWhat are you planning?\n\n01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:58.840\nThe holiday doesn't matter and bring her something to eat\n\n01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:00.840\nand you guys will work it out, right?\n\n01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.840\nShe seems like the type of mom that'll be like,\n\n01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.840\nis this a secret mother's day?\n\n01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:05.840\nYeah, she is.\n\n01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:06.840\nSo cut you off of the pass.\n\n01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:07.840\nThat's true.\n\n01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.840\nYeah, not everything can be solved by food, I guess.\n\n01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:12.840\nBut your podcast can.\n\n01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:15.840\nThe dough boys is on every Wednesday at 3 p.m.\n\n01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.840\nYou don't have a time slot.\n\n01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.840\nThank you so much, Lauren.\n\n01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:23.840\nIs there anything else we don't want you to be voicelessly\n\n01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:26.840\nrailroaded by our mirth?\n\n01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:31.840\nAnything else to...\n\n01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:33.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:34.840\nI'm bad at it.\n\n01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:35.840\nMy mom?\n\n01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:36.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.840\nMy mom doesn't listen to this.\n\n01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:39.840\nDo you love your mom?\n\n01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:40.840\nI love my mom.\n\n01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:41.840\nYou must.\n\n01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:42.840\nI love my mom.\n\n01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:43.840\nI love my stepmom.\n\n01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.840\nI love my other moms that I consider mothers to me.\n\n01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:47.840\nMy best friend's mother.\n\n01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:48.840\nI love her.\n\n01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:49.840\nLive with her now.\n\n01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.840\nWho are all those mothers?\n\n01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.840\nWoo!\n\n01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:53.840\nAll right.\n\n01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.840\nProps to all those mothers.\n\n01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:55.840\nAll right.\n\n01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:56.840\nThank you, Lauren.\n\n01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:57.840\nThank you.\n\n01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:58.840\nYou can...\n\n01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:04.840\nThank you, Lauren.\n\n01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.840\nSo she does have a lot of moms.\n\n01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:11.840\nSo her mom is, like, getting boxed out.\n\n01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.840\nThat's what we learned right at the end.\n\n01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:14.840\nI was like...\n\n01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:15.840\nNot really, though.\n\n01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:16.840\nI was like...\n\n01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:17.840\nWhat's the...\n\n01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:20.840\nThat's not the most healthy way of thinking, right?\n\n01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.840\nOh, okay.\n\n01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:23.840\nWell, it's...\n\n01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:24.840\nThat's true, though.\n\n01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:25.840\nIt's true.\n\n01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:26.840\nCaptain Elf.\n\n01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.840\nFoster Brooks' name.\n\n01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.840\nThat is not the most healthy way to think about it.\n\n01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:38.840\nOr the most healthy way to say what you said.\n\n01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:41.840\nBecause it sounds like you've...\n\n01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.840\nOkay, never mind.\n\n01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:44.840\nAll right.\n\n01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:45.840\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:46.840\nI wasn't going to...\n\n01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:47.840\nNow, Dan, will you call mom or no?\n\n01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:48.840\nOnly a text.\n\n01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:49.840\nI texted her.\n\n01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:51.840\nFor God's sake, we like it that way.\n\n01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.840\nThat's it?\n\n01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:53.840\nWe got it.\n\n01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:54.840\nWe got it.\n\n01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:56.840\nShe wouldn't like a call better than a text?\n\n01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:58.840\nOh, fart on you.\n\n01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:00.840\nI texted her.\n\n01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:01.840\nWhat did she say?\n\n01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:02.840\nDid she text you back?\n\n01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.840\nYeah.\n\n01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.840\nWhat did she say?\n\n01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:06.840\nShe said, uh...\n\n01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:07.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:08.840\nShe...\n\n01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:09.840\nGreat.\n\n01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.840\nIf I read her text, then it'll be...\n\n01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.840\nWouldn't that just make the problem worse?\n\n01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:16.840\nI kind of feel like...\n\n01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:18.840\nI don't know why my parents didn't come to my wedding.\n\n01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:24.840\nLike, I kind of feel like maybe it was because maybe they didn't want to...\n\n01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:30.840\nMaybe part of the whole thing of me talking about my life and stuff maybe is off-putting to them.\n\n01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:37.840\nSo, I don't want to read my mom's text for fodder.\n\n01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:41.840\nBecause on the off chance that that is the thing, I don't want to...\n\n01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.840\nWas she happy to hear from you?\n\n01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.840\nIt's a text, man.\n\n01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.840\nShe was like...\n\n01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.840\nI think you should bring her a meal tomorrow.\n\n01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.840\nIs that something from Olive Garden or...\n\n01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:56.840\nChuck E. Chains?\n\n01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:58.840\nFrom Tony's Deli.\n\n01:56:58.840 --> 01:56:59.840\nAll right.\n\n01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.840\nWell, what have you learned this whole time, Spencer?\n\n01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.840\nCome on, man.\n\n01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:06.840\nWhy do you give me all the hard questions?\n\n01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.840\nEnd of my show!\n\n01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:09.840\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.840\nNo, I'm not going to.\n\n01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:14.840\nI'll sit here.\n\n01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:19.840\nAll right, well, then I'll go back to the dregs of the fucking shitty note app.\n\n01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.840\nBecause we don't have an ending.\n\n01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.840\nMy chiropractor is a piece of shit, but he's really nice.\n\n01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.840\nNobody came tonight because of Mother's Day.\n\n01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.840\nHow's your back?\n\n01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:29.840\nMy back's great.\n\n01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:30.840\nLook at me.\n\n01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:31.840\nI'm doing high kicks.\n\n01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.840\nIs it better?\n\n01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:33.840\nIt's

01:57:43.840\nYeah, he's doing better.\n\n01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.840\nAwesome.\n\n01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.840\nBut let's problematize that.\n\n01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:50.840\nWho says Seek's doing better?\n\n01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:51.840\nHe does.\n\n01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.840\nYeah.\n\n01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:53.840\nWho's he talking to?\n\n01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:54.840\nUs.\n\n01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.840\nYeah.\n\n01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:56.840\nAnd why is he doing that?\n\n01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:59.840\nBecause he cares about himself and us.\n\n01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:00.840\nExactly.\n\n01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:01.840\nRacist.\n\n01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.840\nAnd us.\n\n01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.840\nAll right.\n\n01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:09.840\nTap Titans,

song?\n\n01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.840\nYeah, but not a rap.\n\n01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:24.840\nIs there anything that's not a rap, like just a song?\n\n01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:25.840\nLike family?\n\n01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:28.840\nI think, yeah.\n\n01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:30.840\nYou want to do a little song?\n\n01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.840\nWhat do you want it to be about?\n\n01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:33.840\nWhat we've learned.\n\n01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:34.840\nOkay.\n\n01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:36.840\nWe'll do it.\n\n01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:45.840\nNow, let's take a

about potatoes.\n\n01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:59.840\nThat seems like a rap.\n\n01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:01.840\nOkay, but that doesn't have to be.\n\n01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.840\nAll right, I won't.\n\n01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:04.840\nYeah.\n\n01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.840\nThat's it.\n\n01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:07.840\nYeah.\n\n01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:08.840\nThere we go.\n\n01:59:08.840 -->
