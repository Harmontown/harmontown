00:00.000 --> 00:27.000
From Hollywood, California at Meltdown Comics, the Nerdist leader Harmontown is now in session.

00:31.000 --> 00:41.000
Spencer Crittenden, everybody. Spencer!

00:41.000 --> 00:50.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
What's up, Dan? I thought I had a new note-taking method, but I don't know if it's working very well.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Thanks for coming.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
Those of you that did, is it a Mother's Day? We got some late ticket sales, Mother's Day Game of Thrones, maybe?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
It's not funny, you guys.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Did you call your mom today?

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I threw her a text.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
What was your text?

01:21.000 --> 01:30.000
I just texted her a bunch of Game of Thrones spoilers. She's the season behind, so...

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
And she's like, what are you doing? You're ruining everything.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
And I said, I didn't ask to be born!

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
And then I hung up, even though it was text.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
What do you think?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Are you Ironborn?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
I am Ironborn. Thank you for asking.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
Man, that Game of Thrones, huh? That's a tough game.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I can't tell who's winning, who's losing. It's hard to keep track.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
I think you either win or you die. I don't even think you can lose.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I like...

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
The guy, now that...

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
What's her name? Circe, who has...

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Who's the big fucker that just now heard like her champion?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
The mountain.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
And he's like a crazy zombie mountain guy, and he's just smashing dudes.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
It's the best...

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
As promised, yeah. I mean, I kept thinking, are they really going there with that?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
And yeah, I guess that's what he's going to do.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
I told you backstage last week that you asked about Jon Snow.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I said he's going to get smoke-pussied.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
And smoke-pussied is fucking... Yeah, she did it.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
It was a little more artisanal than that, but...

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
I don't think that's a spoiler, because even people who...

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
She got smoke-pussied. He got smoke-pussied.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
But he's been... Kit Harrington's been on the key art and all that stuff, so...

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
How was your week, Dan? What did you do? I haven't talked to you in a while.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
You know, I've been just... I've been working, man. It's unremarkable.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
This gives me a terrible show, by the way. Terrible show.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
All you do is work now. You work, work, work, work.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
That's why it's going to be terrible. And when I'm not working, I've acquired this horrible habit.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
I'm headlong into a horrible, debilitating addiction to incremental tap games.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Now I know what they're called. That was the first step.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Somebody said, oh, incremental tappers. And I was like, incremental tappers?

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
That's these games that I've just descended.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Now I just have five games. I switch back and forth between them on my iPad.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
It was just like, you just tap a cookie, and then you make nine cookies,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
and then you can get a super cookie, and then you just keep tapping the super cookie

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
or whatever, you just build a bakery, and then it's just like...

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
And then if you hit a plateau, it's like, oh, it looks like it's going to take an hour to build

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
to like super, super chocolate chip level, and then you switch over to a thing

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
where you're like on a moon, and you just like keep hitting the crater,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
and it's like fucking things, and then you make a bulldozer to like...

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
It's insane. It's insane. There's three games. Tapped Titans.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
I keep switching between that, and I think the same people make Tapped Tycoon.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
These are quality tap games, but they're bad for your life,

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
and then Tapped Galaxy, which is more of an eight-bit affair, where you just...

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Talk me through Tapped Tycoon. What goes on there?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Tapped Tycoon, you're a little guy.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Remember I told you guys about the adventure capitalist where you just hit the buttons

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
that represent the businesses? Well, this one's a little more stylized graphically.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
There's a little guy, and then if you tap the air above him, dollars form,

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
and he grabs him and stuffs him in his little pockets,

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
and then over time you can buy businesses, and it's really just the same game,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
but it's just like there's a little dude jumping around.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
So you really are just tapping things?

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah, you really do just tap, and obviously if my therapist were here,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
as you would say, so in other words, you've found a way to keep your wheels spinning

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
with reduced accountability. There's no chance of choosing right or wrong.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
There's no humans to interact with or disappoint.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
It's amazing that even a regular video game would be too much.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Now I've been reduced to just... I'm just free-basing dopamine.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
I got up in New York through the weekend,

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
and I was hungover. I had a wonderful time with my lover,

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
and we have a great time, but I sat up, and I looked in the mirror that was next to the bed,

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
and I said, oh my god, I'm a gorilla, and someone should just teach me sign language.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
I bet it would be easier for me to learn sign language.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
So my chiropractor, every time I miss a session, he texts me...

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
What does he say?

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
He texts me too. He texts both of us.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
For real?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Does he group text you?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
No, no. He texts us both separately.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Let's see. I'm trying to find his...

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
This is what I got. You can't see this, but it's all the same.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
They all say, hi, Dan, you missed your appointment today at 9.30.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Will you be able to make it up on Thursday at 9.30?

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
Doctor, and I wish I could tell you his name, because you'd be like, what?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Is it a funny name?

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
Well, it's his first name, so it's like Dr. Gary, but it's worse.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
It's like...

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Minus Dr. Doug.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
He looks like a sexy George Clooney.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
When did these guys get to...

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
A sexy George Clooney?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
He looks sexier than George Clooney.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
How do you... I can't even picture that.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I know. And then he cracks your back.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
You're like, fucking sexy George Clooney, just fucked me up. This is the best.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
How come these guys get to call themselves doctors as long as they don't use a last name?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
That seems problematic.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh, by the way, problematic.

07:02.000 --> 07:11.000
I had a delightful conversation with a millennial that brought me another step further into my relationship with atoning with them.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
This person, everything about them on paper, it should have been just a bad evening of talking to them,

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
because they're getting their degree, and it's just something that suggests that the world is fucked.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.000
Actually, it was very interesting. It was transatlantic colonial literature, but I wanted to be funny, and I wasn't.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
But she was talking about...

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
We were just talking about...

07:35.000 --> 07:44.000
Because she's studying literature, particularly with a view on, because it's the slavery period, it's imperialism, colonialism,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
and that's what she's mostly interested in.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
And so we were talking about slavery within literature, mythology, and all this stuff.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
And she used this verb that I'd never heard before.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
She was like, what I'm trying to do with my latest paper is I'm problematizing this, and this, and that, and problematizing.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
And I was like, wait, wait, you're problematizing?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
And she's like, yeah. And I'm like, wait, oh, shit.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
I got really excited, because she... And I said, I don't ever hear the word problematic.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And she's like, yeah, problematic.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Problematizing is the act of making something problematic, is figuring out that it is.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
And I was like, yeah, but that's so much better.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
And she goes, I know, because it's something I do, and not something that you're pointing at and saying that is something.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
I was like, yes, yes. God damn it.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
You can just smile and say, I love problematizing.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
And you wouldn't come off like such a fucking jagoff.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
You know? I enjoy problematizing.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
That's why I'm so goddamn happy.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
It's a thing I like to do.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
It's like the equivalent of vandalism, only instead of a brick wall, it's your buzz, you know?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Like, it's fun. I'm going to put my mark on it.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I like to problematize.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And it's actually, you know, and I looked it up, you know, it's a real thing.

09:01.000 --> 09:09.000
And I was like, wait, okay, yeah, problematization, you can't say it if you've had a single drink.

09:09.000 --> 09:18.000
But it's to consider the concrete or existential elements of a term, writing, opinion, ideology, identity, or person as challenges,

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
problems, that invite people involved to transform those situations.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
It's a method of defamiliarization of common sense.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
See, that sounds punk rock and lateral and inventive and interesting.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I think it's what we keep...

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
So how do I problematize something? What does that mean?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Well, let's problematize Mother's Day.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Like, okay, well, like...

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Finally.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
Well, they list, I mean, it would be problematic to tell you how to problematize, but they...

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Because who are you?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
You know?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Oh, Wikipedia is telling me how to problematize.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
But the sort of what process is sort of to ask the questions.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Who is making this statement?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
For whom is he or she making it?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Why is the statement being made here and now?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Whom does this statement benefit?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Whom does it harm?

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Sorry, that's a good way of picking something apart.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
Especially though, what I really like is the invitation of people involved to transform something.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And I think that's what gets left out a lot.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
I think that if you're... Like, so to problematize Mother's Day, it'd say, like,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
you'd have to ask, like, well, who came up with Mother's Day?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
You know?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
That would require some research or a bunch of assumptions.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I think a hallmark, right?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
I don't know, man.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
You'd have to look it up.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
That's the other problem, is that a lot of problematization seems to be a kind of hobby.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
When it's based on zero research, then you're all the way into just kind of saying, like,

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
hey, this sketch offended me.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Who is making this sketch?

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, you're either going to say the writers, and then you've got to get into all kinds

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
of problematic conversations about, was it a black writer?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Was it a white writer?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
If it was, like, for instance, like a sketch that was like the black news,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
and it was pointing out that black people have a different point of view.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
And now you're bringing a bag in there into that airport and, like, unloading it.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Or you have to be so vague that it doesn't sound as provocative.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Like, you'd have to go, just people.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Or just the media.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
The media's at it again.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
The media's talking to whom?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
The underclass?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
The impressionable?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Black people?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
White people?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
The audience?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Just people?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
I don't know.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
You'd have to be subjective and speculate and assume, or you'd have to, like, just be

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
really vague and say, there's a box in my living room that I don't know how it works.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
And I read some stuff online about kind of how it works.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
So I'm making some assumptions about maybe the intention of this thing,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
and I'm kind of problematizing it.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
I think the danger there is the, obviously, problematizing while fun.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
And I think it's great to say I love doing it.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
I think that kind of, like, it obviously doesn't invite discourse.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
So this is the problem that you see online all the time.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
It's just, like, it's the white redditor going, like, actually, actually, and, like,

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
trying to problematize the problematization that's being brought up

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
problematically.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Because you can't, if somebody tells you that you're, because remember,

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
to problematize something is not to ask a question.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
It's not to provide any information.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
It's actually, just to put it in the most simple terms, it's to take something that

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
everyone is assuming in the room, and then to start to ask, why are we assuming

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
this?

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Which is very healthy if you're dealing with, for instance, the Catholic Church

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
saying, like, no, this isn't a pedophile.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And ask the question, is it?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And then you go, oh, look at that.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
It is.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
But there's some research involved there, and there's some, and there's that

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
invitation to transform.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
It's like, what are we going to do about this?

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
But if you, so if you invite somebody to transform circumstances that they're

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
assuming in a negative way, that could be somebody sitting in a room and they're

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
wearing a hat, and you just go, you should take that hat off, because I'm

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
looking at your hat in a different way, and I've found it problematic.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
And not only am I just complaining about it, I'm actually also inviting you,

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
the person involved with your hat, to transform, to partake part in its

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
transformation.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
And the problem there, and maybe your hat has a swastika on it.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
So this is a good thing, maybe, if maybe you're in a synagogue.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Like, there is context, and context, and context.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Maybe your hat is genuinely problematic.

13:33.000 --> 13:39.000
The problematic nature of problematization inherently is that if that person

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
isn't wearing a swastika on their hat, and you aren't in a synagogue,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
they're just a dude with a hat on.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
So if they say anything at all, you're already in a conflict, you set the

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
table for conflict.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
That's why it's probably called problematization.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Not because you're just finding them.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
You're causing problems.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
You're saying, take your hat off.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
And if the person ignores you, they're a fucking asshole.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
And if they say, I have a problem with your problematization of my hat,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
then they're, you know, hat-splaining to you.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
And if somebody starts problematizing your problematization, what are you

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
going to do?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Stop and go, you're right.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Problematization is very problematic.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Stop it immediately.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
No, you're going to say, stop hat-splaining my problematization.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I'm trying to do something.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
So it's not really an activity.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I'm still confused.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I still don't know.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, it's not a group activity problematization.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
But when you problematize, is it an active thing?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
It's a method of criticism.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Right.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
It's an algorithm for criticism, maybe put it that way.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Is it good or is it bad?

14:48.000 --> 14:56.000
I think it's good one time per conversation at the top of it and needs to be heavily

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
mitigated with the expectation that somebody might tell you to go fuck yourself because

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
you haven't done any research and don't know what you're talking about.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
Because it takes a really, really, really long time to see a sketch on a television

15:10.000 --> 15:17.000
show, to go from there to writing an essay about it, requires more than typing.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
I think unless you're going to just make people laugh, if you're really going to try to make

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
people think and provide new information, you're going to have to call somebody at the production

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
office of that show and ask who wrote this?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
What were the circumstances?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Where did the sketch originate from?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
How was your show structured?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
What does your writer's room look like?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Was there rewrites on this thing?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
How did it end up being this particular sketch?

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Then you have to go around and find out how people received it and what happened.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
Then you have to still bring in all kinds of speculation about who benefited and who's

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
suffering.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
All those things are going to be really subjective.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Now here's the thing.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
There are situations in which it's not subjective at all and it's really easy.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Those things seem to be our Teflon for problematization.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Like, god damn it, I hate this fucking word.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Donald Trump comes pre-problematized.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
You can't fucking touch the guy.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
He's a Rubik's Cube and all the colors are the same on every side.

16:14.000 --> 16:25.000
If a senator says, arts education is a waste of money in urban schools because urban kids

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
tend to get urban shots, you can problematize the shit out of that and start talking about

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
how urban probably means black and blah, blah, blah.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
If someone says all Mexicans are rapists, do you have nothing to do but go fly a kite?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
He's like, who's making this statement?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Donald Trump.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Why is he making it?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Trump supporters.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Why is he making it?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
To get votes.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Who's suffering?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Mexicans.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Who's gaining?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Angry white people.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
You're done.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
There's nothing to do.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
The danger of that is that if we're addicted as a culture to problematizing as an activity,

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
it might just be that we think that when we're done doing that, we're done doing everything

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
and that we don't then do what Woodward and Bernstein did, which is take down a fucking

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
dude.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Take him down.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Open books, go meet with people in parking garages.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
But how do you take somebody down who takes himself down constantly?

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Well, there's got to be shit that this guy, I mean, it's got to be all the worse.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
The guy is a pathological liar.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
I don't know.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
I mean, I saw that vanity fair piece from the 90s.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
I don't know.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
It's all out there.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
It's like he had Hitler's speeches next to his bed.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I guess you're right.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
No, I don't know what to do.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
There's got to be a way.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
There's got to be a way to find out or to figure out that we don't have to.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I was at Dino's today.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Dino had a barbecue and there was these...

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And Donald Trump was there.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
These directors were there.

17:47.000 --> 17:55.000
And one of the directors was saying the guy that's doing the Albert Brooks and Louis C.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
K. thing.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
And these guys were there.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
And one of the guys says, apparently, Hitler was really into poop.

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
He and Eva Braun, their housekeeper had to keep changing their sheets because every time

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
they got together, there was shit everywhere.

18:11.000 --> 18:18.000
And so he was saying, apparently, Hitler was really into scat play and the pooping.

18:18.000 --> 18:26.000
And Dino goes, don't ruin Hitler for me.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Meaning don't dimensionalize him.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Keep him Dracula for me.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
He's just like a character.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
It's like the girl with the skunk hair on the arches.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Hitler's here.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
He wants the band to fail.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
That's it.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Don't tell me when he goes home he has interesting things going on.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
We keep finding out that Hitler had a micro penis.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
He had one testicle.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
He likes to poop on people.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
He was just a bad guy.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
He peed on his nephew.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
He peed on his nephew, says somebody in the crowd.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
Is that verifiable evidence?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
He peed on his nephew.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Under what circumstances?

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
All right, now.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
Who is making this statement?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Dan, are you going to problematize that statement?

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Some kind of Hitler hater.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
For whom is he or she making it?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Do you know why Hitler killed himself?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I know.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
He saw his gas bill.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
It's true.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
It's true.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
He said he offers up.

19:53.000 --> 20:02.000
That's verifiable, unproblematizable fact.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, whatever.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
That was a bad Hitler joke.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It's a great Hitler joke.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Here's why.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
No, it takes the actual gas part and it trivializes it.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
That is problematic.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
So there.

20:18.000 --> 20:26.000
The funny Hitler jokes are like, oh, do you know why he never drank?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Why?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
He was an angry drunk.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Not as funny as the gas one.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Well, I don't tell jokes very well, but it's just like,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
when you use Hitler as an Abe Lincoln or a Dracula,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
where it's just like, oh, you have to invite him in

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
before he can come in, Hitler has those little rules.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
But then the actual minutiae of the extermination

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
and then in addition to that, taking that and going like,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
oh, what a Monday.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
All right.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
But with any joke, when you walk through this process,

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
I don't know if this is a flow trick.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Who is making this statement?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Someone telling a joke.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
For who are they making it?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
An audience.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Why is the statement being made?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
The person is trying to be funny.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Who does it hurt?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Who does it benefit?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Anyone that laughs?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Who does it hurt?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Anyone that doesn't?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I mean, that's kind of been known for a while.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
It's not going to get you anywhere either, is it?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
That's your current favorite joke.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
Or all problematization is like, who's problematizing?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Academics.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
For whom are they doing it?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Academics.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Why are they doing it here and now?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
For academia.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Possibly to justify the existence of academia.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Who does that benefit?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Academics.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Who does it hurt?

21:37.000 --> 21:45.000
People who would otherwise maybe do shit.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
Okay, but that's just me dumb-splaining.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Spencer, you talked to your mom today?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Oh, yeah.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I mean, I texted her.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Sure.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
What did you say?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
I said, happy Mother's Day.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
No, I don't know.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
She texted me a couple days ago was like, am I going to see you on Mother's Day?

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
It was just like one of these things where it's like, oh, I guess I'm not going to text

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
you for two or three days.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
So it's just like, I don't want that, man.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I don't need that.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
You're texting me.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Am I going to see you texting me?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
And you know, that's what I want to know.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
I don't want to know that.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
I don't know.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
It just sucks, man.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
It sucks.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I hate my parents.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
I hate my family.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I hate everything.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
It's no good.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
My grandpa's dead.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
He's fine.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
No.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I mean, he's dead, but he's fine.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Like, no, it's fine.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Was he fine before he was dead or he's fine now that he is dead?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
He's fine now that he's dead.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Yeah.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
So, I don't know.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
You're not pals with your parents at all?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
No, no.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
They were, they were, no, no.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
They were, no, no.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Yeah, no.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
Do you think there's a day that you might be like, come back around to be friends with

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
them?

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
These are the times that it would be happening and I'm really going in the opposite direction.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
So, I mean, I got to figure that out if I want that to happen.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
What would have to happen for you to become friends with them?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
I don't know, man.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.560
It's just, it's so much, so much, it's all like nickel and dime shit, you know?

23:20.560 --> 23:22.800
It's not like some big falling out happened.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.720
It's just like, this happens all the time and this happens all the time.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.560
And at the end of the day, it's like, I don't want most of that.

23:28.560 --> 23:32.160
So I'm, I'm, I'm here, you know, that's why I'm here.

23:32.160 --> 23:36.920
I think like back in the old days when we first met you that you felt like kind of responsible

23:36.920 --> 23:41.320
for their relationship and kind of like you're kind of a caretaker, right?

23:41.320 --> 23:42.320
Sure.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.320
Yeah.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.320
I think I said that.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.320
Is that, is that still the case or no?

23:45.320 --> 23:46.320
No.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.320
I mean, well, my dad lives in Columbia.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.080
I mean, he probably has a girlfriend or something right now.

23:50.080 --> 23:55.440
He's, he's taking care of himself and my mom, she's like a hobo or something.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.520
She's a, she's like couchsurfing and traveling and stuff.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.600
She doesn't have a stable residence as far as I'm aware.

24:01.600 --> 24:05.960
So I mean, who knows, who knows, right?

24:05.960 --> 24:10.360
You know what my big thing with family is, you don't like them.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.800
At some point this, there was this syndrome that started happening where it was like,

24:13.800 --> 24:16.840
well, I haven't talked to these people in a while.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.120
And then it's like, now I'm 43.

24:19.120 --> 24:22.440
So they're getting long on the tooth.

24:22.440 --> 24:30.080
Like we're getting to the point where after a long life of like fruitfulness and tradition

24:30.080 --> 24:35.280
and stuff, you're supposed to like partake of this tragic like third act where it's like

24:35.280 --> 24:37.360
bittersweet, you know?

24:37.360 --> 24:38.360
Yeah.

24:38.360 --> 24:43.040
I don't want to, you know, I don't want, part of me, like just because of our kind of stigma

24:43.040 --> 24:48.040
against like, you know, sickness and stuff like a, I don't want to say certain words

24:48.040 --> 24:52.840
out loud because I'll sound like just the epitome of evil, but, but like, I just have

24:52.840 --> 24:57.640
this like weird feeling about like, like, well, I don't even know these people at this

24:57.640 --> 24:58.640
point.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.640
Yeah.

24:59.640 --> 25:00.640
So it's like start now.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.640
Yeah.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.160
Because now is a bad time to start.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.560
And it's like, and for what?

25:04.560 --> 25:09.120
For the benefits of family, because I feel like I've been cruising without that just

25:09.120 --> 25:12.520
fine all this time and, you know, it's all, it's all been good.

25:12.520 --> 25:17.280
So now I want to go into that more ass just because that's what happens on television

25:17.280 --> 25:18.800
like it seems dumb.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.560
And a little bit of a slight, right?

25:20.560 --> 25:26.600
If you didn't get like the whole like other side of it where it's like, your family means

25:26.600 --> 25:36.320
a lot to you, throwing the ball in the yard, Thanksgiving times, AT&T wants you to be there.

25:36.320 --> 25:41.920
This holiday season when the gravy's up and the stockings are out, bring your nuzzles

25:41.920 --> 25:43.440
around the Christmas tree.

25:43.440 --> 25:47.000
It's like, like when it's really just more dysfunctional than that, you just kind of

25:47.000 --> 25:52.440
like, then the, then you're supposed to get that like the cable knit sweaters and the golden

25:52.440 --> 25:58.120
retrievers and the like, God, dad, dad's going to do his chaplain impression again.

25:58.120 --> 26:05.600
Like, I love it when we come up to this cabin in the Hamptons of every, every winter and

26:05.600 --> 26:07.280
sure we have our problems.

26:07.280 --> 26:15.800
And remember when Gloria smoked weed and sent her to rehab, but now she's okay to the McClannahan

26:15.800 --> 26:19.720
clan who keeps getting bigger and happier.

26:19.720 --> 26:24.880
And then if you've got, if you've had all that, then, then bring on the fucking diagnoses

26:24.880 --> 26:32.240
and the, uh-oh, I got to go away for the weekend, beep, beep, like, I always wanted to do more.

26:32.240 --> 26:38.080
I know, but you did, Uncle Herman.

26:38.080 --> 26:43.560
But if Uncle Herman was like, you know, why get on board right before the meet, meet?

26:43.560 --> 26:44.560
Yeah.

26:44.560 --> 26:50.320
Exactly, because it's just been, it's like just a flat line up until that point.

26:50.320 --> 26:55.100
It's like, how, how, what, what is the peak that we're hoping to achieve before the inevitable

26:55.100 --> 26:56.100
pitfall?

26:56.100 --> 26:57.100
Yeah.

26:57.100 --> 26:58.100
What is this day new mod that I'm getting?

26:58.100 --> 27:02.640
It's, it's, it's like, it's like, yeah, it's like, if you went to see a matrix movie

27:02.640 --> 27:07.720
and it was just about Keanu Reeves, like fighting a million agent Smiths and you'd be like,

27:07.720 --> 27:09.680
what's this weird educational video?

27:09.680 --> 27:14.000
Like, someone would have to explain to you, there was a first movie and it was kind of

27:14.000 --> 27:19.160
fun.

27:19.160 --> 27:24.320
If you met Dan, like if you met your mother or your father at a bar, like there were strangers,

27:24.320 --> 27:26.000
do you think that you would have anything to talk about?

27:26.000 --> 27:29.920
Like if, if you just met them, face value as strangers.

27:29.920 --> 27:35.280
Yeah, I think I'd, I think I'd like my dad, you know, you could have a chat.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.520
You could enjoy each other's company.

27:37.520 --> 27:38.520
Yeah.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.640
It's a bad way to spend Mother's Day talking about it.

27:41.640 --> 27:45.400
I think my dad's a cool guy.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.400
Not your mom though?

27:46.400 --> 27:49.560
Well, with my mom, but my mom, it's more important to be like, I mean, it's like, this is, and

27:49.560 --> 27:50.880
I think moms get a bum rap.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.400
I think it's the, I think it's an opposite gender kid kind of thing too.

27:54.400 --> 27:59.280
It's also, but like, you know, I think moms get a bum rap from the male kids because they

27:59.280 --> 28:04.680
nurture and they, they, they, they, they are there.

28:04.680 --> 28:09.880
And then ironically, you kind of, you know, you cut the strings and you kind of, you don't

28:09.880 --> 28:11.880
look back and go like, what a pal.

28:11.880 --> 28:18.080
You look back and go like, you know, goddess, monster, you know, in any case, not a human,

28:18.080 --> 28:22.840
you know, like you really need to, you really need to have like a human relationship with

28:22.840 --> 28:26.560
your family or, or it's, or you're not going to have one.

28:26.560 --> 28:30.280
And that's a statement that's really powerful.

28:30.280 --> 28:33.240
But then again, you know, and that's everybody I talked to always goes like, we always end

28:33.240 --> 28:34.240
this conversation.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.960
We go like, yeah, but have you met those people with the, like the loving Norman Rockwell

28:36.960 --> 28:37.960
family?

28:37.960 --> 28:38.960
Yeah.

28:38.960 --> 28:42.440
Like, like just, just really annoying.

28:42.440 --> 28:47.400
When your mom passes away, uh, what, what, do you feel like there'll be a loss?

28:47.400 --> 28:50.280
Like what, like something will be subtracted from you?

28:50.280 --> 28:53.560
I think this is a bad day to say anything, but yes.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.560
Well, what?

28:54.560 --> 28:58.280
Like, well, cause just on the off chance that she's like, well, it's mother's day, he'll

28:58.280 --> 28:59.880
probably say something about me.

28:59.880 --> 29:03.320
And then you're like, when she dies, will you feel anything?

29:03.320 --> 29:05.320
Hmm.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.320
So yes.

29:06.320 --> 29:10.520
It'll, it'll, it'll be different than when you, than when your father passes away.

29:10.520 --> 29:14.080
Like there'll be a complicated feelings either way.

29:14.080 --> 29:17.240
But I do acknowledge that they're going to be more narcissistically centered.

29:17.240 --> 29:20.840
You know, they're not, they're going to be like unresolved shit that I haven't worked

29:20.840 --> 29:21.840
on.

29:21.840 --> 29:27.960
My mom, my mom died when I was 13 and it's like that was like kind of the perfect time

29:27.960 --> 29:30.760
for that to happen because I wasn't so young.

29:30.760 --> 29:35.060
I didn't know her, but I wasn't so old that it meant a lot more.

29:35.060 --> 29:41.800
But when I look at, when I remember my mother, she's so much of who I am.

29:41.800 --> 29:47.520
Like as much as I'm genetically my father, I look just like my dad, I am intellectually

29:47.520 --> 29:48.520
my mother.

29:48.520 --> 29:53.000
Like, like I have all of her emotions, like her brain.

29:53.000 --> 30:00.440
And it's like, it's like, when I think of my mom today, it's like, she was so fucking

30:00.440 --> 30:01.440
funny.

30:01.440 --> 30:02.640
She was so cool.

30:02.640 --> 30:06.640
And I didn't know her long enough, like, you know, I was 13.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.440
So she was kind of hardgoing.

30:09.440 --> 30:14.520
Like it was a little bit heavy to be around my mom because she was that intense.

30:14.520 --> 30:19.880
But I wish she was still around because she was like the funniest person I ever knew.

30:19.880 --> 30:26.240
My mom got me my first typewriter, my first Commodore 64.

30:26.240 --> 30:30.980
She always made sure she told me whenever I said, what, what should I do?

30:30.980 --> 30:33.080
She always said, do whatever you want.

30:33.080 --> 30:38.960
She never said, you have to be this or that, you know, she never had a career plan for

30:38.960 --> 30:39.960
me.

30:39.960 --> 30:45.000
She always said, just make sure you, you, you do it because you want to do it and make

30:45.000 --> 30:46.360
sure you're really good at it.

30:46.360 --> 30:49.920
If you're going to be a garbage man, no offense to the garbage men listening, that's the example

30:49.920 --> 30:50.920
she would use.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.120
If you're going to be a garbage man, just be the best garbage man, you know, that there

30:54.120 --> 30:56.360
is and, and, and make sure you're happy doing it.

30:56.360 --> 31:02.240
So she was super on your side, like what, also she threw things at you.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.560
She usually throwing them at my dad and I would get in the way, you know, like my birthday

31:06.560 --> 31:10.480
cake.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.480
But it was carrot cake.

31:11.480 --> 31:14.960
I didn't even want it.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.720
Carrot cake is the, is the, is Alexis of cakes.

31:17.720 --> 31:22.000
I would, I would, I would give, I would give up a thousand birthday cakes for the story

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
I got, which is my mom threw my 11th birthday cake at my dad.

31:27.000 --> 31:32.960
Like I would, I would, I would give up cake forever to have that story be true, which

31:32.960 --> 31:33.960
it is.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.320
And then she's like, here's your D&D books.

31:36.320 --> 31:40.280
I didn't have time to wrap them and I was like, that's fine, man.

31:40.280 --> 31:41.280
This is awesome.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.280
All right.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.960
Well, let's, let's, let's bring out, let's bring out our guests.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.800
We can continue to talk about this.

31:47.800 --> 31:51.680
Let's bring some, some, some, some more, some more dudes out here.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.040
But this show is lacking anything.

31:53.040 --> 31:57.440
It's, it's due to energy.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.600
These guys have a very popular feral audio podcast.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.840
It's like, I don't know if you care about such things, but it's number five.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.840
I happen to know that.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.560
It's like the, it's like the fifth most popular feral audio podcast.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.560
Where are we?

32:08.560 --> 32:09.560
I don't know.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.560
I don't care about these things.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.560
Are we the top?

32:11.560 --> 32:12.560
We're number one.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.560
One or two.

32:13.560 --> 32:14.560
I don't know.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.560
Who's number one?

32:15.560 --> 32:16.560
I think it might be Duncan Trussell.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.560
Oh, I'll fucking kill that guy.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.560
Fucking hippie piece of shit.

32:21.560 --> 32:26.200
And probably, yeah, he's probably probably, uh, they're probably counting, uh, uh, astral

32:26.200 --> 32:32.880
people in the, in the, in the, in the, in the listeners numbers.

32:32.880 --> 32:40.560
It's like Greg and Greg's spirit are both listening to Dan in this lighting right now.

32:40.560 --> 32:41.560
Right.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.000
What were you standing right in this lighting?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.920
You have become more good looking than Russell Crowe.

32:46.920 --> 32:53.360
He, he looks like shit.

32:53.360 --> 32:59.200
You have, you've crossed over into being better at Russell Crowe.

32:59.200 --> 33:06.000
Our guests tonight have a podcast called the dough boys on feral audio.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.960
They, uh, they review, excuse me, what's the worst intro in the world?

33:11.960 --> 33:14.240
You can't burp during an intro.

33:14.240 --> 33:19.240
They review, uh, franchise restaurants.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.240
It's, it's salt of the earth.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.520
It was my burp with salt of the earth.

33:22.520 --> 33:27.120
They, they, they, they review franchise restaurant chain restaurants, you know, like, uh, Jesus

33:27.120 --> 33:28.120
Christ.

33:28.120 --> 33:32.720
Uh, we'll, we'll, we'll get to know every little detail about them.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.640
Uh, it's, uh, they're, they're, they're UCB alum.

33:35.640 --> 33:39.120
They're, they're, they're very much, uh, they're, they're related to our family by a

33:39.120 --> 33:41.120
lot of mutual cousins and things.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.520
We can talk about that too.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.720
Oh, can we Dan?

33:43.720 --> 33:44.720
Shut up.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.720
You fucking millennial puke.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.720
Um, what did you come here for?

33:48.720 --> 33:52.160
Norman Lear was coming back.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.160
Norman Lear.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.720
That was the most intense shit in the world.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.720
I know.

33:55.720 --> 33:59.720
And then, and then remember when Dustin uploaded the podcast and it said normal Lear?

33:59.720 --> 34:00.720
Yeah.

34:00.720 --> 34:07.720
This guy, this guy, 93 years old, he's, he's worked in the business for a hundred of those

34:07.720 --> 34:08.720
years.

34:08.720 --> 34:14.720
His, his, his name is Norman, he's silver leg hippie.

34:14.720 --> 34:20.720
Get the, get the, get the, get the incense out of your mouth.

34:20.720 --> 34:27.720
Uh, the dough boys are here and we're going to get to know them now.

34:27.720 --> 34:45.920
They are Nick Weigar and Mitch Mitchell, the dough boys.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.400
That's a Mike Mitchell, right?

34:47.400 --> 34:48.720
Well, you go, you go by Mitch.

34:48.720 --> 34:49.720
I go by Mitch.

34:49.720 --> 34:50.720
Yeah.

34:50.720 --> 34:51.720
So that's fine.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.160
We haven't established canonically what Mitch's name is.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.160
He goes by Mike.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.160
He goes by Michael.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.160
And he goes by Mitch.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.160
I'm fine with all of them.

34:57.160 --> 35:01.680
I'm trying to save work cause it said, the information I got was it's Mike Mitchell.

35:01.680 --> 35:02.680
He goes by Mitch.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.680
And I was like, why am I going to share the genealogy?

35:04.680 --> 35:08.360
I was just like, I introduce myself as Mitch.

35:08.360 --> 35:13.320
Uh, I don't care about myself enough to even care what anyone calls me when they, when

35:13.320 --> 35:15.800
people ask me, I'm just like, yeah, Mitch or Mike, I don't care.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.400
I don't care what they say.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.400
It's fine with me.

35:18.400 --> 35:23.120
So long as I don't like make anyone angry, which I think I'm doing right now, possibly.

35:23.120 --> 35:28.440
Yeah, no, you have to work harder than that to get on their head side.

35:28.440 --> 35:29.640
They're like, I hate myself too.

35:29.640 --> 35:30.640
Grow up.

35:30.640 --> 35:31.640
All right.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.640
Good, good, good.

35:32.640 --> 35:33.640
We're on the, we're on the same side.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.520
Uh, so your, your podcast is, people love it.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.280
Spencer counts himself among the fans.

35:38.280 --> 35:39.280
I believe.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.280
Yeah.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.280
Yeah.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.280
Thank you, Spencer.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.280
It's not a big deal.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.280
Yeah.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.280
Thanks, Spencer.

35:45.280 --> 35:46.280
It's not, it's not a good look to tell people you love their podcast.

35:46.280 --> 35:48.280
It's not a good look.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.280
It's not.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.280
We appreciate it.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.280
Yeah.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.280
We like it.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.280
Yeah.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.280
So number five, that's pretty, that's not bad.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.280
Right?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.280
I got that.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.280
You know, that's Dustin.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.280
He's a producer.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.280
He thinks about these things.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.280
He's just going to give a thumbs up or something.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.280
Yeah.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.280
All right.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.280
There we go.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.280
Why is it called?

36:04.280 --> 36:05.280
Doughboys.

36:05.280 --> 36:08.280
Uh, good question.

36:08.280 --> 36:13.640
Um, I mean, I would say that we are doughy men eating unhealthy food.

36:13.640 --> 36:19.280
So he was, he was fat at one point and I remained fat.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.400
Oh, and I've never not got fat.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.640
He was a fat guy at one point.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.640
He's thin.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.640
You're a thin man now.

36:25.640 --> 36:29.400
I'd say I'm towards the slender side, but there's still a layer of pudding over everything.

36:29.400 --> 36:32.720
Like I'm not like, I'm not like cut, you know, I'm in pretty good shape though.

36:32.720 --> 36:33.720
Yeah.

36:33.720 --> 36:34.720
I used to be a lot fatter.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.720
Yeah.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.480
Um, but no, it's, it's an, we live an unhealthy lifestyle.

36:38.480 --> 36:42.720
We both kind of have the diets of guys who are bulking up for an Academy Award winning

36:42.720 --> 36:43.720
role.

36:43.720 --> 36:48.920
And so, and, and so it's just like we're, as far as a comment on that, Doughboys felt

36:48.920 --> 36:49.920
appropriate.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.280
Like a runner up with sight of guys.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.280
We almost went with that.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.680
And I think we made the right call.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.680
Yeah.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.040
I went dead silent.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.160
Are you, are you both under 30?

37:00.160 --> 37:01.160
I'm 35.

37:01.160 --> 37:02.160
I'm 33.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.160
Okay.

37:03.160 --> 37:07.240
Under 30, like I couldn't gain a pound.

37:07.240 --> 37:12.680
Then one day I was sitting at Rob Schrab's with Dan, we would get Benito's tacos every

37:12.680 --> 37:16.320
night and I was like, oh fuck, I'm, I'm fat.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.320
I gained a pound.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.320
Yeah.

37:18.320 --> 37:24.200
He put it under his pillow, his first pound.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.200
He framed it.

37:25.200 --> 37:31.560
He framed it like a car washes dollar.

37:31.560 --> 37:35.320
Just curiously though, Nick, Nick is the skinny one, right?

37:35.320 --> 37:39.720
Nick, not the one that's named Mike and Mitch.

37:39.720 --> 37:44.880
Nick is a skinny one and there's a part of me that thinks that this is all like a seven

37:44.880 --> 37:50.240
style plot by you to make me fucking fatter and fatter as time goes on.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.480
Do you think every time you get, wait, well, so, not to, I don't want to derail this too

37:53.480 --> 37:58.640
much, but, but, but I'm just, I am curious if you were fat and you got thin, Nick, was

37:58.640 --> 37:59.920
there a method you used?

37:59.920 --> 38:03.840
Because a lot of my listeners are always, always looking for a new technique.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.520
It's, he told me his technique.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.520
Yeah.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.640
I mean, like I've been through my weight is yo-yoed a lot through my life.

38:09.640 --> 38:13.960
I was like a fat kid and then I got skinny late in the, like in early adulthood when

38:13.960 --> 38:17.160
I was like 18, 19, I was like very thin and the best shape of my life.

38:17.160 --> 38:21.800
Then I plumped up again throughout my 20s and around 29, I lost some weight again.

38:21.800 --> 38:26.840
And the factor late in life was a diet, like earlier in life when I had that initial weight

38:26.840 --> 38:29.400
loss, I just started swimming and I just burned off a shitload of calories.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.560
I think like what, which I'm saying just, just, just that much of activity and having

38:32.560 --> 38:34.160
that young metabolism.

38:34.160 --> 38:38.920
But as I was older, I found that I had to restrict sugar and restrict carbohydrate intake and

38:38.920 --> 38:42.840
just have a very strict sort of low carb ish diet.

38:42.840 --> 38:43.920
But you're not doing that anymore.

38:43.920 --> 38:49.040
Do you guys actively, when you, as I listened to a little bit of one of your most recent

38:49.040 --> 38:51.640
podcasts, I picked the one that had my friend, David Phillips on it.

38:51.640 --> 38:52.640
Oh yeah.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.640
You left Philips.

38:53.640 --> 38:54.640
Philips is a great guy.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.720
And, but I never got to the part where you actually started talking about the specific

38:57.720 --> 38:58.720
restaurant.

38:58.720 --> 39:05.200
Although at the top of the podcast episode, there's this very charming post-karina long

39:05.200 --> 39:12.480
worth, is that a reference that sticks now, the, the, the very, very academic, just like,

39:12.480 --> 39:15.880
like dump of information about the restaurant you're going to be talking about.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.480
Is that, is that every episode?

39:17.480 --> 39:19.720
I have a little monologue I start each episode with.

39:19.720 --> 39:24.000
It's kind of just loosely plagiarized from Wikipedia, but makes me sound and feel smart.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.400
So I like to stay it and sort of gives a little background in the restaurant.

39:26.400 --> 39:29.160
And then we fuck around for like 45 minutes.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.280
And then we finally get to the restaurant.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.640
We talk about that for pretty much the balance of the episode.

39:32.640 --> 39:37.480
Yeah, you give a nice little autistic twist on it and you seem to enjoy it.

39:37.480 --> 39:41.400
Are you just drawing on memories of eating at these places or do you, do you ever have

39:41.400 --> 39:42.400
to study up?

39:42.400 --> 39:48.000
Mitch and I go before each episode, the two of us go either together independently, sometimes

39:48.000 --> 39:51.560
with our guests, to the restaurant in question.

39:51.560 --> 39:54.000
So we always have a fresh perspective on whatever we're visiting.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.480
And sometimes that involves a draw, a drive to Gardena to visit Long John Silver's.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.120
That sucks.

40:00.120 --> 40:10.200
And then some in March we, I ate 18 cheeseburgers in March, please, I'll take it.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.640
I have nothing else to, I love it.

40:12.640 --> 40:16.400
You ate 18 burgers throughout the month of March or you ate them in one day?

40:16.400 --> 40:19.560
Hey, no, God, no, 18 cheeseburgers throughout the month of March.

40:19.560 --> 40:26.880
That was not for the podcast though, that was for the podcast.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.080
So it's, it was your favorite burger in town, Mitch.

40:30.080 --> 40:35.400
So, so this is, we were ranking them and, and it's a point of contention.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.800
Because I like Wendy's, he likes in and out burger.

40:38.800 --> 40:43.400
And then I voted in the final, I voted for Shake Shack, was what I voted for.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.280
Shake Shack, I don't think I've ever been there.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.280
It's good.

40:46.280 --> 40:47.280
It's really good.

40:47.280 --> 40:51.360
What is the, because I mean, it's important to note, you guys aren't snarky about the

40:51.360 --> 40:52.360
whole thing.

40:52.360 --> 40:56.240
Like you're not, you're not foodies that are bashing on these restaurants for being less

40:56.240 --> 40:57.320
than gourmet.

40:57.320 --> 41:01.640
You're actually partaking in the, you know, you're opening the hood of, of a staple of

41:01.640 --> 41:05.960
our lives, which is like these giant corporate chains and you're, you're approaching them

41:05.960 --> 41:12.160
as if, as if you were talking about real food.

41:12.160 --> 41:15.160
Where does that, where does that, where did that passion come from?

41:15.160 --> 41:16.680
Where did that passion come from?

41:16.680 --> 41:21.000
Harmon, just go hang yourself.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.040
Where did that passion come from?

41:23.040 --> 41:27.840
You put it, no, you put a good twist on it because I feel like we just, I mean, we like

41:27.840 --> 41:30.760
all these restaurants and we want an excuse to eat there every week.

41:30.760 --> 41:33.520
I feel like, and that was a big part of it.

41:33.520 --> 41:34.520
And then, yeah.

41:34.520 --> 41:39.640
Well, did you get, so when you guys go to, right here, I mean, turning this into something

41:39.640 --> 41:46.000
about me, the, the, the, what I, the big LA thing is there's, there's a new restaurant

41:46.000 --> 41:47.920
every day and there's another one closing.

41:47.920 --> 41:51.680
And if you wanted to, every day you could just like, and there are people who want to

41:51.680 --> 41:54.880
do this in particular, I feel like it's an age thing.

41:54.880 --> 42:00.400
Like my younger friends are, have no problem going, let's go eat at this one place.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.200
I heard great things about it.

42:02.200 --> 42:06.920
And I always know that if you heard great things about it, that means I'm going to be

42:06.920 --> 42:14.640
sitting in doll furniture, elbow to elbow with strangers and, and, and, and eating, you know,

42:14.640 --> 42:18.680
not to get all Tim Allen about it, but also the portions are going to be small and, and

42:18.680 --> 42:25.000
weird, like in some deliberate way, some off-handedly fucking deliberate way.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.120
And whereas then there's just like, holy shit, can I go to Taylor Steakhouse?

42:29.120 --> 42:34.680
I, I, every time I go to a night in market song, you know, night plus market song, I'm

42:34.680 --> 42:38.040
always afraid I'm going to fall through the chair every time I go there.

42:38.040 --> 42:41.200
Like I'm just truly in back, like nervous and embarrassed, I'm going to fall through

42:41.200 --> 42:42.200
the chair.

42:42.200 --> 42:46.600
But yeah, I mean, it, it, we talked about that because we do like, I like all types

42:46.600 --> 42:47.600
of food.

42:47.600 --> 42:48.600
Yeah.

42:48.600 --> 42:49.600
We like, we like fine dining too.

42:49.600 --> 42:55.200
And we like like cool hip, you know, individual location places, but there's something inclusive

42:55.200 --> 42:59.360
and comforting about chains by design, you know, like it's a different experience going

42:59.360 --> 43:04.560
to a Mimi's cafe or a Chili's and their whole, it's calculated at a corporate level to make

43:04.560 --> 43:06.400
you feel included.

43:06.400 --> 43:07.400
And I don't know.

43:07.400 --> 43:10.280
I mean, we wanted to celebrate that atmosphere and not like make fun of it because it's something

43:10.280 --> 43:14.000
that for a lot of people, that's the only, depending on where you live in the country,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.320
that's the only, those are the only restaurants you have access to.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.320
Right.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.320
That's interesting.

43:18.320 --> 43:23.280
So in being kind of sewers of chains, so what are the things that you have concluded?

43:23.280 --> 43:24.280
What connects all of them?

43:24.280 --> 43:25.600
You've done like 50 episodes of this.

43:25.600 --> 43:30.240
So there must be, is there like overriding psychological principles at work in a successful

43:30.240 --> 43:31.240
chain restaurant?

43:31.240 --> 43:36.360
I'd say a hundred percent, like a, well, you, you, you're the smarter one of the two.

43:36.360 --> 43:38.240
So you go for it.

43:38.240 --> 43:42.680
When you say make you feel included, I think is the phrase you use, make you feel included

43:42.680 --> 43:43.680
or invited.

43:43.680 --> 43:44.680
What did you say exactly?

43:44.680 --> 43:45.680
I said included.

43:45.680 --> 43:46.680
I'm not sure if that was the perfect word choice.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.360
What would you elaborate on that?

43:48.360 --> 43:53.400
It's just like, you know, there's, there's, when anytime you're at a restaurant, you're

43:53.400 --> 43:56.720
paying for the service, you're paying for the food, but you're also paying for the service.

43:56.720 --> 44:00.520
You're paying for people to pretend like they're your servants for a little bit.

44:00.520 --> 44:04.480
And like, I feel like the better chain restaurants, fundamentally that's what you're dealing with.

44:04.480 --> 44:07.480
You know, you're paying for people to sort of do it on you and take care of your every

44:07.480 --> 44:12.320
need and act like, to pretend in this, in this situation, you're a higher status of

44:12.320 --> 44:14.600
them, but in the real world, you might not be, you know?

44:14.600 --> 44:20.920
So I think the, the effective, the effective chain restaurants kind of just have that experience.

44:20.920 --> 44:25.160
They just presented in a way that you would in, in, in, in a good individual location restaurant.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.360
They franchise wide.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.480
They kind of have, they, they make you feel that way.

44:28.480 --> 44:32.320
And one restaurant we reviewed very highly, I'm just saying Hillstone, it goes by many

44:32.320 --> 44:33.320
names.

44:33.320 --> 44:34.720
Houston's you may know is most popularly.

44:34.720 --> 44:35.720
Yeah.

44:35.720 --> 44:36.720
Houston's is great.

44:36.720 --> 44:44.120
But I mean, that's a place where just the, the level of service, the level of services

44:44.120 --> 44:47.080
is universally very high in addition to the food quality.

44:47.080 --> 44:55.920
So yeah, I guess I, I find Chili's like a reliable in an airport, airports is kind of

44:55.920 --> 44:56.920
a, that's their slogan.

44:56.920 --> 44:57.920
It's its own thing.

44:57.920 --> 45:02.560
Like it's, it's, it's a no man's land in an airport.

45:02.560 --> 45:06.240
I've never, that's, that's an interesting from a class perspective.

45:06.240 --> 45:13.640
It's like, it's, you're talking about a middle class thing, like, and going out to dinner

45:13.640 --> 45:18.600
being not something you do every night, possibly doing it with your family and loved ones.

45:18.600 --> 45:21.880
And there is like, I guess that there is something interesting about that.

45:21.880 --> 45:26.400
Like they create little worlds as if it's part dinner, part vacation.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.960
Like you've, you've come to islands.

45:28.960 --> 45:37.000
You've got to have a tropical doppelganger doopie doopie, you know, and they have like,

45:37.000 --> 45:40.480
they have like little sayings and they have little, and they have outfits and they have

45:40.480 --> 45:41.480
a, the whole theme thing.

45:41.480 --> 45:44.880
And I just realized that that's not, I don't know what I ever thought that was.

45:44.880 --> 45:46.800
I hadn't problematized it yet.

45:46.800 --> 45:51.040
I hadn't, I hadn't looked at it like, like, like, like, and I asked myself, I just felt

45:51.040 --> 45:55.360
like that was just, but that's what they're trying to do is they're trying to, they're

45:55.360 --> 46:00.360
competing over dollars that are harder earned than to, than to say like, like, they're like

46:00.360 --> 46:07.240
dollars that are like, holy shit, I, I almost died, like, like, like, like typing for this

46:07.240 --> 46:08.240
dollar.

46:08.240 --> 46:13.200
Like my bones are sticking out of my fingertips and I, and I, and I want to make sure I get

46:13.200 --> 46:14.200
treated right.

46:14.200 --> 46:17.840
And so that, you know, that's like the, the, the big giant parking lots of the big blinking

46:17.840 --> 46:22.360
signs that say like, look, there's plenty of room here, there's a runway.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.360
Yeah.

46:23.360 --> 46:27.840
I, I feel like, and especially now there's, there's that thing of there's, there's two,

46:27.840 --> 46:32.880
there's two things I play to that I feel like that kind of a, will separate the good from

46:32.880 --> 46:33.880
the bad.

46:33.880 --> 46:37.080
And it's, it's the quality being good across like all the restaurants, if you can like

46:37.080 --> 46:42.760
keep a standard of quality in, in Los Angeles and then somewhere in Wyoming, like everywhere

46:42.760 --> 46:48.080
you go, it feels like kind of the same level of food and then that's like, and then the

46:48.080 --> 46:51.080
change that have failed have been ones that are, that kind of like, you go to a different

46:51.080 --> 46:53.000
place and it'll be good and then it will be bad.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Or they're just bad in general.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Or they're just bad in general.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
I mean, those are the worst.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.520
So it was just places that taste like shit.

46:57.520 --> 47:01.840
We went to this place that I had fond memories of from my childhood, um, Keros, which is

47:01.840 --> 47:04.040
a, a West coast chain.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.560
Keros, Keros.

47:05.560 --> 47:10.680
Yeah, um, and at one point they were pretty, it was pretty big and it was well reviewed

47:10.680 --> 47:11.680
and it was well revered.

47:11.680 --> 47:13.840
That was a place that would be like a treat.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.480
And now it's kind of, it's dying.

47:15.480 --> 47:18.840
It got bought off by a larger company and it went from, you know, I think at its peak,

47:18.840 --> 47:20.200
it had 60 locations.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.840
Now it's like 12 locations.

47:21.840 --> 47:24.880
We went to one in South Pasadena, which was like one of the only ones in the greater

47:24.880 --> 47:25.880
LA area.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.040
And it was just, it was a real sad, sad scene.

47:28.040 --> 47:30.640
We asked the wait, we were like, what do you like to eat at this place?

47:30.640 --> 47:31.920
And she was like, nothing.

47:31.920 --> 47:32.920
She said that.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.920
She just said nothing at all.

47:34.920 --> 47:41.360
And we were like, oh, um, Keros has rice pudding, by the way, uh, nobody has rice

47:41.360 --> 47:42.360
pudding.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.360
Yeah.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.360
You can get a rice pudding at Keros.

47:44.360 --> 47:47.320
Well, I think that's, I think that's the thing of like the entire clientele, except

47:47.320 --> 47:53.480
for us was, uh, was older adults, was seniors who I think it was like, oh, this is my comforting

47:53.480 --> 47:55.000
place that I've gotten used to.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.960
But I think, you know, do you guys ever go to Sambo's or are you two young Sambo's?

47:59.960 --> 48:00.960
Yeah.

48:00.960 --> 48:01.960
No, not me.

48:01.960 --> 48:07.880
I was about to say, there's a place called Sambo's.

48:07.880 --> 48:10.880
I think there might be still one that exists.

48:10.880 --> 48:11.880
Santa Barbara.

48:11.880 --> 48:12.880
Oh my God.

48:12.880 --> 48:13.880
It's still there.

48:13.880 --> 48:19.320
And they maintain that's why it's called Sambo's short for Santa Barbara.

48:19.320 --> 48:23.080
We know better from the logo.

48:23.080 --> 48:25.680
The logo isn't a sunset behind a ship.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.760
Uh, the, the, uh, did you, what about Barnaby's?

48:28.760 --> 48:30.320
You guys ever hear Barnaby's?

48:30.320 --> 48:32.680
No, we, have you heard of Barnaby's?

48:32.680 --> 48:33.680
Where's Barnaby's?

48:33.680 --> 48:37.080
Barnaby's was, I mean, it was a place, so when I was a kid, I thought there was only

48:37.080 --> 48:38.080
one Barnaby's.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.080
That's the other thing.

48:39.080 --> 48:42.200
When you're a kid, you grow up, whatever, but, but, but that's the thing.

48:42.200 --> 48:45.480
When you're a kid, you just want to kill myself.

48:45.480 --> 48:50.640
Um, I just want to, I want to, I want to kill myself just so I can go to hell and, and have

48:50.640 --> 48:53.440
everyone there tell me to kill myself.

48:53.440 --> 48:58.720
Man, we would love to have you on the podcast because we talk like, we talk about fast food,

48:58.720 --> 49:02.880
but like 70% of it is talking about killing ourselves.

49:02.880 --> 49:03.880
Yeah.

49:03.880 --> 49:10.200
If there isn't a death wish behind a podcast dedicated to reviewing chain restaurant food,

49:10.200 --> 49:12.720
then I guess you'd have to go to the Philip Morris happy hour.

49:12.720 --> 49:13.720
I don't know.

49:13.720 --> 49:17.080
Um, we, we, we talk about them podcasts and then we get done with the podcast and we text

49:17.080 --> 49:19.040
each other about how we want to kill ourselves.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.480
Like never stops happening.

49:21.480 --> 49:25.960
By the way, for you 16 year olds listening, that is a sport among us, those of us over

49:25.960 --> 49:28.320
30, we're professionals.

49:28.320 --> 49:29.320
Do it.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.480
If you, if you, if you have conflicted feelings, talk to somebody that's not the same thing.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.880
It's not the same thing that you're feeling.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.880
Hang in there and talk to somebody.

49:36.880 --> 49:37.880
All right.

49:37.880 --> 49:40.840
Uh, I want, I want, I want nothing on my hands, man.

49:40.840 --> 49:45.240
Uh, I want to leave only footprints on this world and I already fucked up with that Chevy

49:45.240 --> 49:57.440
voicemail and I was like, last thing I need is like, you know, just tumbler note and the

49:57.440 --> 50:03.040
bar, Barnaby's was a, but also I care if you're listening, the Barnaby's was like this.

50:03.040 --> 50:08.200
I had this like stained glass, it was an Italian restaurant, kind of Italian restaurant.

50:08.200 --> 50:13.560
It was, it was a pizza place and, and, and it was, everything was, everything was like

50:13.560 --> 50:19.400
varnished wood and darkness and, and like stained glass chandeliers and stained glass

50:19.400 --> 50:21.600
windows that didn't let any light in.

50:21.600 --> 50:25.040
If you were eating there during the day and then, and then there was like a little window

50:25.040 --> 50:28.440
to the kitchen, like some of those places have where you could watch the guys make the

50:28.440 --> 50:29.440
pizza.

50:29.440 --> 50:33.240
Um, and, uh, I don't know, I don't know why I'm bringing it up because, well, because

50:33.240 --> 50:34.560
I never knew it was a chain.

50:34.560 --> 50:39.040
I just thought it was this place that it was in Milwaukee and my family would go there.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.680
It was our big, that was our place.

50:40.680 --> 50:47.280
That was that meant that like, like beyond let's go to McDonald's because it's a fuck

50:47.280 --> 50:49.040
it kind of night.

50:49.040 --> 50:51.840
This was like, it's, it's special.

50:51.840 --> 50:55.560
It's like a fuck it kind of night and, and we're in a good mood.

50:55.560 --> 51:01.000
Um, we're not, we're, and, and, and, and, and, and like, uh, it closed.

51:01.000 --> 51:06.600
I got taken over by this place called Tom Fulhery's, um, which was, it was on the heels

51:06.600 --> 51:08.280
of Chuck E. Cheese.

51:08.280 --> 51:13.600
It was Chuck E. Cheese for adults, Tom Fulhery, uh, the logo was in, is it was in Miami Vice

51:13.600 --> 51:19.200
Style blue neon and you would go into the idea was that the parents could hang out in

51:19.200 --> 51:25.440
this swank 80s swingery kind of dining environment and, and there was a stack of free tokens

51:25.440 --> 51:28.480
for the arcade in the corner, which was like this grotto.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.560
You would just stuff your kids for the evening.

51:30.560 --> 51:34.520
And then it was like, so it was like pursuing the strange dichotomy.

51:34.520 --> 51:36.560
It was like, like, like, hey, it's the 80s.

51:36.560 --> 51:43.280
Maybe your family's a liability, like, like, like, and Pac-Man's here to solve that problem.

51:43.280 --> 51:46.080
Like, like, like we've got the shit figured out, right?

51:46.080 --> 51:52.240
Economics, man, uh, we, and then, and that, but then my friend Dino took me to a Barnaby's

51:52.240 --> 51:54.920
in Chicago and it was identical.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.960
I had so many fucking flashbacks.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.280
I was like, wait, can I go to the bathroom?

51:59.280 --> 52:00.280
The answer is yes.

52:00.280 --> 52:07.280
Uh, but like the entire floor plan of the entire place was identical, which is another crazy

52:07.280 --> 52:10.720
thing about a chain restaurant is like, you could have, you could have a memory of your

52:10.720 --> 52:16.480
favorite eighth birthday and then you could, if they're, if that, if that virus of that

52:16.480 --> 52:20.000
restaurant survives in some pocket, even if you have to, you have to go find one somewhere,

52:20.000 --> 52:21.880
you could like have all those flashbacks.

52:21.880 --> 52:24.720
We just, we just recently, well, he's got something going on.

52:24.720 --> 52:28.960
Uh, we recently went to Chuck E. Cheese's speaking of Tom Fullerys.

52:28.960 --> 52:31.240
My lovely ex-wife, Erin McGathy's episode, right?

52:31.240 --> 52:32.240
That's correct.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.240
Yeah.

52:33.240 --> 52:38.520
And, uh, and, uh, I've never felt like a, like a bigger pervert in my entire life.

52:38.520 --> 52:41.600
Did you actually go to a Chuck E. Cheese with Aaron?

52:41.600 --> 52:44.240
Uh, I went, uh, were you fucking her?

52:44.240 --> 52:45.240
No, no.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.240
Oh, shit.

52:46.240 --> 52:54.680
Cause like I'm dating, but the best time in town ever.

52:54.680 --> 52:56.320
No, sir.

52:56.320 --> 52:57.560
No, sir.

52:57.560 --> 53:06.400
We find out one of the deal boys is fucking your ex-wife and that that's how you do it.

53:06.400 --> 53:13.200
I mean, if you're going to fuck someone ex-wife, take him to Chuck E. Cheese.

53:13.200 --> 53:14.200
I'm sorry.

53:14.200 --> 53:16.960
I'm, I'm derailing you to a certain extent.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.920
Are there still Chuck E. Cheese's?

53:18.920 --> 53:21.080
There, there is, there's a lot of them actually.

53:21.080 --> 53:23.080
There was way more than I thought there was going to be.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.080
Yeah.

53:24.080 --> 53:25.080
It's like 250.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.080
There's like a good number nationwide.

53:26.080 --> 53:28.280
They merged with show biz, was it show biz or show time pizza?

53:28.280 --> 53:29.280
Show biz.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.280
I think show biz pizza.

53:30.280 --> 53:31.280
Yeah.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.280
They merged with show biz pizza and then converted all their locations.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.280
There's, there's still a lot.

53:33.280 --> 53:38.680
I'm the ski ball there when, when the tickets come out, if you slightly pull, they just

53:38.680 --> 53:39.680
keep fucking coming.

53:39.680 --> 53:40.680
Oh yeah.

53:40.680 --> 53:41.680
Nice hack.

53:41.680 --> 53:46.720
Here's, here's another life hack.

53:46.720 --> 53:52.440
If you're 11 years old in the eighties and you don't get invited to a Chuck E. Cheese

53:52.440 --> 53:59.200
birthday party, you fucking like, you're, you're just, you're off the grid, unpopular.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.760
You become a show creator later on in life.

54:01.760 --> 54:05.640
I never, it was like, oh, Steve's having a Chuck E. Cheese birthday, but I was like,

54:05.640 --> 54:09.880
there were no, there was no discretion because those parties were just like, just tell basically

54:09.880 --> 54:10.880
everybody to come.

54:10.880 --> 54:13.680
It's not like people were buying their pizza.

54:13.680 --> 54:16.320
It was like, it was like a Midwestern thing was just show up.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.040
Just, they just didn't want me there.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.040
Who did?

54:19.040 --> 54:21.040
They didn't want me in a public place.

54:21.040 --> 54:24.400
Dan, who did not invite you to a Chuck E. Cheese?

54:24.400 --> 54:25.400
I said Steve.

54:25.400 --> 54:26.400
Steve.

54:26.400 --> 54:27.400
Steve who?

54:27.400 --> 54:29.840
I'm not going to name his last name.

54:29.840 --> 54:30.840
Steve?

54:30.840 --> 54:31.840
Hamstack?

54:31.840 --> 54:32.840
No.

54:32.840 --> 54:33.840
No.

54:33.840 --> 54:36.440
I mean, the people who wronged me have suffered.

54:36.440 --> 54:37.440
Believe me.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.440
Wait.

54:38.440 --> 54:42.440
What did you do?

54:42.440 --> 54:43.640
I didn't do shit.

54:43.640 --> 54:45.840
I'm God's hammer and word.

54:45.840 --> 54:54.080
I'm finding karma just happens.

54:54.080 --> 54:59.400
Sometimes you have the pleasure of, of, of feeling God hammering people using you as

54:59.400 --> 55:00.400
the hammer.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.760
You know, that's what Facebook's about, right?

55:02.760 --> 55:08.640
You feel that nature actually is like tortured them or they actually got their comeuppance?

55:08.640 --> 55:09.640
I don't know.

55:09.640 --> 55:15.000
Do you think their goal was to like, just keep loving football and was that supposed to

55:15.000 --> 55:16.960
make them like really happy or?

55:16.960 --> 55:19.800
I mean, did something terrible happen to that person?

55:19.800 --> 55:24.680
I'd say there's no burnt houses or anything on their Facebook profiles, but I check in

55:24.680 --> 55:38.400
and I go like, yeah, yeah, told you, told you baseball was dumb.

55:38.400 --> 55:47.880
I don't post that on their page, but I say it to myself and I masturbate crying fall asleep.

55:47.880 --> 55:49.800
And I don't come a lot.

55:49.800 --> 55:53.080
I come desperate, sad little droplets.

55:53.080 --> 55:59.520
Well, after hearing this, just to be clear, Nick and I don't fuck at all.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.360
We don't fuck anything.

56:01.360 --> 56:09.840
But we went, we went to, I went to Chuck E. Cheese by myself and then a friend for those

56:09.840 --> 56:18.040
of you who aren't video subscribers, the crowd gasped Mitch, Mitch isn't, Mitch isn't a guy

56:18.040 --> 56:23.040
you hope as a parent to see at a Chuck E. Cheese by himself.

56:23.040 --> 56:30.480
You'd rather see him there with a kid and a baby Bjorn, a friend, a friend, a grown

56:30.480 --> 56:36.840
adult friend, joined me, a man, and we, it's getting worse.

56:36.840 --> 56:39.640
If he looked like Stanley Tucci, it just makes it worse.

56:39.640 --> 56:43.960
It's just like, like you have like an accomplice.

56:43.960 --> 56:45.120
It was, it was not good.

56:45.120 --> 56:51.440
We sat by the stage and he want, he was like intent on playing Ski Ball afterwards and

56:51.440 --> 56:53.080
I was like, please, we, I was sweating.

56:53.080 --> 56:56.560
I was like, we need to get out of here as fast as possible.

56:56.560 --> 56:59.760
But we played a little Ski Ball.

56:59.760 --> 57:03.840
It's one of those virus restaurants that you were talking of like a virus chain where it's,

57:03.840 --> 57:07.400
it's, you're like, oh, I remember some of this, but it's not, nothing is right here.

57:07.400 --> 57:08.960
Like nothing feels right about it.

57:08.960 --> 57:10.720
I have the strangest, most specific memory.

57:10.720 --> 57:15.640
I went to, I went to show biz before it was Chuck E. Cheese one time and I think it was

57:15.640 --> 57:19.800
because my parents get so used to me coming home kind of like sad and then dragging it

57:19.800 --> 57:25.320
out of me that Steve didn't invite me and it was fucking gala again.

57:25.320 --> 57:31.600
So at one point they actually took me to show biz, just my parents and me and we sat in

57:31.600 --> 57:36.680
the back room and there was a, there was a Billy Bob the bear and he sang songs and stuff.

57:36.680 --> 57:40.520
I think I've talked about this in the podcast before because I remember it straight.

57:40.520 --> 57:43.640
I was probably 12 years old, 11.

57:43.640 --> 57:46.280
And they, they did this like letters section.

57:46.280 --> 57:51.000
They would sing songs, the animatronic band, and then they did a letter like, oh, here's,

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
here's letters.

57:52.000 --> 57:56.160
And then one of the letters they read was from a kid who said, Billy Bob, how come when

57:56.160 --> 58:03.120
you're on stage, you have bear feet with no shoes on and when you're wandering around

58:03.120 --> 58:06.320
the arcade, you have sneakers on?

58:06.320 --> 58:07.880
Why would they include that?

58:07.880 --> 58:13.440
Talk about like a weird shame, like fraud complex, like, just like, like, like a telltale heart.

58:13.440 --> 58:19.280
Like, they're like, we have to address this.

58:19.280 --> 58:25.480
And Billy Bob said, animatronic robot bear answered the question that the kid posed and

58:25.480 --> 58:31.320
said, well, the thing is, when I'm up here on stage, I don't want to fall off the stage.

58:31.320 --> 58:36.120
So my bear toe claws help me keep balance up here.

58:36.120 --> 58:40.560
But when I'm walking around there, while you're eating your food, no one wants to see my toenails

58:40.560 --> 58:46.160
out there, meanwhile, you're eating pizza and listening to him talking about his toenails

58:46.160 --> 58:47.160
and it's gross.

58:47.160 --> 58:50.760
So mission not accomplished.

58:50.760 --> 58:52.600
And then they moved on.

58:52.600 --> 58:59.360
That's my memory of Chopin's Pizza Place was just weird, like, over piping, like, sometimes

58:59.360 --> 59:01.360
if it's broke, don't fix it.

59:01.360 --> 59:05.720
I feel like you can't hear any of that stuff anymore, because it's just like the whirring

59:05.720 --> 59:11.440
of like a 20 year old robot is all you can hear now, it's just like the stirring of the

59:11.440 --> 59:15.240
robots and the flapping of their eyelids and stuff.

59:15.240 --> 59:16.960
It's very off-putting.

59:16.960 --> 59:17.960
There must be a thing.

59:17.960 --> 59:25.480
So it must be at this point, there must be a heavy, like the pie chart of their customer

59:25.480 --> 59:32.280
base, a lot, a big slice of it must be nostalgic adults coming in to relive a childhood memory

59:32.280 --> 59:34.200
who don't have kids with them.

59:34.200 --> 59:40.720
Just on my, me and Mitch's anecdotal experience, I would say that's a very small slice.

59:40.720 --> 59:46.280
It feels like they're mostly families and if you're adults alone without kids, you're

59:46.280 --> 59:50.640
drawing eyeballs for being very, very, I don't know, I don't know how much of the nostalgia

59:50.640 --> 59:54.640
crowd that it's attracting among people who don't have kids, maybe people who take their

59:54.640 --> 59:57.920
kids and like, oh, there's a place I used to go to with a kid.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:04.160
So if you are over 30 and you do want to take a nostalgic trip back to an animatronic-themed

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:10.560
pizza place, take a kid.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.720
Maybe one you know, whatever, just find a kid and have him with you so the other parents

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.720
can be comfortable.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.080
We were afraid we were going to get stopped.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.360
But leave with a different kid.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.800
They have controls in place for that.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800
They have controls, yeah.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.800
They have their checks and balances.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.320
Well, yeah, the ball pit, man, tells no tales.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.840
The ball pit tells no tales.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.080
That's like the pig pen in Deadwood.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.080
Cock sucker.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.080
Swagin'.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:45.240
Take him to the ball pit.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:49.160
When you get in there, there's like an airlock system and you have to like, wait in a cattle

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.440
crate and they come over and give you wristbands that are color coordinated so that they know

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.960
that you're leaving with the correct children.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.960
Oh, God.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.960
What?

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:58.960
Yeah, it's really, really crazy.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.960
Wow.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.520
I mean, that represents some actual crimes.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520
Yeah.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.040
They used to have a hand stamp.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.560
They used to have this hand stamp, it was like ultraviolet, you know, and so there'd

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.720
be a letter on it.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:17.600
But then I think they realized you could just like buy those stamps and that's why they

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600
do wristbands.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.600
I don't know.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.600
This is a rabbit hole.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:26.200
It's making it so hard for me to go and just steal children from Chuck E. Cheese.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.800
I just, I showed that, I have to book on this guy, Steve Levy's not here so this will

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:37.240
fall on deaf ears, but I want to book on the podcast because I don't want to do any research.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:47.160
I want to know like is the actual, like what the hell is it, what is, is there more terrible

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:54.080
things happening to children per capita or is this like a weird group?

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.440
What guest is going to solve that problem for you?

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.000
A child molester?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.280
Janet Jackson.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280
A census taker?

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280
I don't fucking know.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.560
Yeah, I can't really go back to the same house and they're gone.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.000
No, I don't know actually.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.240
Somebody who could actually just say like, no, well here's the thing because I know there's

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.800
a variety of variables.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.040
For instance, the population keeps exploding so even if you were to, so sometimes flat

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.280
numbers can be misleading.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.880
I'm just, I'm just, like Duncan was on this podcast and I'm like really, he really, like

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.720
what he was like saying, oh never mind.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.160
I'm not going to quote him again because it was so funny but it makes him sound like

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.160
a villain too.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.080
I just like, like, like it's, we're, we've become obsessed.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.000
Obviously our national psyche is like doting on this like idea, we can't have a conversation

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.400
that involves children without immediately, like it's, it's, it's like a syndrome of like

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:53.960
both comedians have learned it and like actual concern and it's all feeding into itself.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:59.120
It's like this zeitgeist pocket of like, oh my God, children are just like this, like,

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.520
like, like candy apple just like rolling around and like, they're just, they have targets

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:10.600
on every side of their body and like the world is made of arrows and I, I'm not interested

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600
in them.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600
I think they're gross.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.600
I think they're annoying.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.000
I think they don't know overkill.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.200
Have you ever tried to explain to a kid the comedy comes in fucking threes, not nineties?

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.120
Yeah, I get it.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.240
It's an airplane.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240
Fucking moron.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240
The stuff they're into.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240
Yeah.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.240
You know what?

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.240
Some of them are going to get taken.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.240
No one will be agree with this side.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:38.160
Some of them are going to get taken sometimes, but a room has showed us that they get back

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160
unharmed.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.160
I did.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.160
Yeah.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.160
They find their way back.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.680
I just, I'm just curious like, I was like, yeah, if there's something at work in the

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.880
national psyche, like there's some shift that happened, like we, we changed our perception

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.440
of drugs several times.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.200
Like we've made, we made decisions.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.240
You can trace them, you know, depending on your ideology, maybe it's that you can't

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.760
fuck kids anymore.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.760
You know?

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760
Maybe it's impossible.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.400
I feel like through most of human history, people have just been fucking kids left and

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.400
right.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.400
Right?

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.880
Like the child, you know, like, you know, you'd get married at like 11 or 12 and then

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.320
Greeks would fuck little boys is like, oh, it's actually, it's actual.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.920
It's an actual absence of the legal recourse to do.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920
Yeah.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920
I will say this.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.840
At my confirmation, Cardinal Law was at my confirmation.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.840
He gave mass.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840
Cardinal Law?

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.880
Cardinal Law, like his name was Cardinal Law.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.880
Cardinal Law.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.880
He's, he's.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.640
Was he with corporal punishment?

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.280
You don't know about Cardinal Law.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.120
Have you, have you seen spotlight?

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.120
Yeah.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.600
Cardinal Law is the Hulk Hogan of, of spotlight.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:49.840
Cardinal Law, for real, that's amazing.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.840
Go on.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:56.040
He's, he, you know, the villain of spotlight was a, gave the mass at my confirmation.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.000
And he, he, he asked a question, which I guess my godfather said it was a very easy

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
question.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.040
And he pointed to me and I didn't know the answer to the whole church laughed.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:09.280
So, so I feel like I got him in some sort of way, you know?

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:15.520
Uh, yeah, no, Cardinal, Cardinal Law was, uh, was, uh, he, he, I mean, he covered it

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.520
all up.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.480
I feel like that's where it all went wrong with the children thing, because when I, when

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:23.840
I was in elementary school, I'd walk home from school in elementary school.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.600
Like I feel like third grade, I'd be walking home from school.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.400
It seems like the shit, that's what, the, the, the, the things that I would do when

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:38.400
I was a kid, the territory I occupied, the amount of fencing around it, both figuratively

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:45.520
and literally like the amount of hours I was allowed to log unsupervised in the expansive

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.840
territory, et cetera.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:53.520
Like compared to what I, and I'm, does it like not like, if I had a kid right now, eight

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.180
years old, just based on nothing more than just cultural zeitgeist, the, the, the disparity

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:04.600
between where, what I would let that kid do versus what I did when I was a kid is so vast.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:10.560
It makes me ask the question, is also the environment actually, is the disparity actually

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560
there?

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560
Yeah.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:17.000
I would guess it's actually, I, I, I'm, I'm guessing this is based on nothing, no, but

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.040
I'm guessing that it's both gotten less dangerous for kids, but we've gotten more awareness

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040
of it.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040
The internet.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.040
Yeah.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.040
The internet is everything.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040
All local news is national news now.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:32.280
So every horrific, you know, horrific crime that occurs or horrific accident that, that

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.320
happens with a, with a kid in a car seat you hear about, and it, it just feeds that national

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320
heart.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320
Yeah.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.280
We're in fascination with, with, you know, not because we're bad people, but because

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.840
we're good people, probably at heart, like we want to, you know, it's like the things

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.160
that are going to pop and sizzle off of a big frying pan full of grease called the internet

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.480
are stories about innocence, you know, we get it, getting, getting hurt, you know.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480
Oh yeah.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.800
I read a, I read a fucking long ass piece.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.080
I don't know why I do this to myself, but I read really long, like true crime pieces

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.000
and I read a long piece of just about kids who were trapped in hot cars.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.680
And there was like, there's this, this one part that stick, that stuck with me.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.040
It may, it'll probably stick with you now, so I apologize, but there was a, they'd asked

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.600
a detective what was the worst thing they'd ever seen involving one of these cases.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600
I've heard this before.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600
Should I not share this?

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.600
Should I not?

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600
I won't share it.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.600
No, I do.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.280
We're all, we're all, no, it's, it's part of our media watchdog segment.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280
We're all good people.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.280
Everybody.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.200
You know, buckle your holy shit belts.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.000
They're, what was the worst thing you ever saw investigating one of these, these cases?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.840
And I remember it said the detective took a pause to gather themself.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:45.640
You don't have to include that part.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.040
There was a little girl who was two, who was trapped in a car.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.440
It was a hundred degrees.

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:56.080
And when they found her, she was dead and she had torn all her hair out of her head.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:02.640
Well, that's been our show guys, thanks for, thanks for coming.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.640
Holy shit.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.640
Just a nightmare.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.640
Just a nightmare.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:16.240
There was a, in the, in the, I think New Yorker magazine, a LAPD homicide detective was asked.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:21.480
They found like a couple of dead bodies up in Angeles national forest.

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:26.160
And like, they had been there for, you know, many years.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:30.840
And a reporter asked the detective, how many people do you think are buried out here?

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:36.240
And he said, if I asked everybody buried in national, like Angeles national forest to

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.040
stand up, it would look like Venice beach.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.560
It's like, like, that's where you, that's where you go to bury people.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.960
So like, when you, when you're driving by on the two freeway, they don't, they don't

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:59.920
want to be silver robots, they all have roller skates, they all have boom boxes in the shoulders.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:07.800
The amount of caricature art.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.720
We are surrounded by a forest full of murdered people.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.160
Well, according to that cop, I mean, I, and I have no reason to doubt him, but also Mark

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.640
Furman as an example, I don't know, he had information to like, like, like, like cops

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:27.240
are, you know, they're not, they don't graduate from cop college to become cops.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.200
They, they, some of them are, some of them know exactly what they're talking about.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.760
And some of them are like, I wish I was Mickey Spillane.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.280
He was a hard boiled, like kind of writer.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.840
Also, another, there's also one of Miller lights, all stars.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.040
Another LAPD cop said that there's probably more dead bodies between us and Catalina right

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.040
now, because if you want to really kill somebody, have a boat.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.040
Yeah, man.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.040
Dave, don't youp that.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.040
That's it.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.040
That was a wrong time to youp.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.040
That's how you do it.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.040
All right.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:09.280
I, uh, but you guys, we should, we should all, let's all kill someone tonight and find out

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280
who wins.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.560
By the way, I thought, where's my clock?

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.560
I'm flying blind here.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.680
Oh my God.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680
The cops in Quincy.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680
It's 9-12.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680
You see?

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680
God damn it.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.680
I'll explain later.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.680
We finally forgot.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.680
Oh, no.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680
Oh, I get it.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:37.680
It turns out all you had to do is turn a clock off and we can forget.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:48.240
Uh, 9-13, what a bummer.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.920
Of the thoughts swirling in my head are, I'm going to, I'm going to, you know, there's

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:59.080
a good chance what I'm about to do will ruin an episode as, you know, zip.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.840
But let's just, I'm going to wing it.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.960
Because of the, uh, we're overrepresented on one side, I'll ask for a female volunteer

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:17.920
or someone, someone who, uh, compartmentalizes as such, uh, the, uh, uh, and, uh, anybody

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:26.360
who has, uh, a relationship, positive, negative, anything noteworthy that they're willing

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.840
to share their relationship about their mother.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.840
Uh, all right, we're going to hand go up pretty quickly here.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.840
Come join us.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.840
Come up.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.840
Hello.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.840
What's your name?

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.840
Lauren.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.840
Lauren?

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.840
Yes.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.840
I've met you before.

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.840
Wow.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840
Yeah.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.840
Nice to meet you again.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:48.840
Yes.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:49.840
Uh, Lauren, uh, yeah.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.840
So, uh, did you, did you have a good mother's day?

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:58.840
No, no, I did not.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.840
Uh, not, not, is it, okay.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.840
Well, uh, I'll walk down this path of, uh, okay.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.840
So is it because you don't get along with your mom?

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.840
Yes.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.840
Never really have actually.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.840
So it's never been a good mother's day.

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.840
She's always found a way out of it by either getting mad at us.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.840
My brother and I, uh, or canceling mother's day.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.840
Like today I was going to plan to take her to Monterey because

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.840
that's where her mother is scattered.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.840
And she's always, she was never there when her mother got

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840
scattered.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.840
So I wanted to take her there to be with her mom.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.840
And maybe a couple of weeks ago, she got mad at my brother and I

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.840
and canceled mother's day.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.840
Basically by sending us a text message saying, I want nothing.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.840
Don't do anything for me.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.840
This is like a refreshingly, not to call your problems refreshing,

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840
but so effervescent.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.840
Delicious.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.840
Uh, but like typically somebody, I mean, like, like, I'm, like,

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.840
you're, you're, so you're somebody that's like, like, you're,

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.840
you're, your mom, your mom ruins mother's day by saying,

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.840
I don't want anything.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.840
Like, it's like, like this is a generational thing, maybe, or no,

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.840
not to dismiss it.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.840
It's very personal.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:18.840
Okay.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.840
Uh, I just think it's, it's neat.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.840
It's neat because with my mom and the problem is like, oh shit,

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.840
what am I supposed to, I don't know.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.840
Um, and with your mom, you're saying like, why am I commenting

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840
at it?

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.840
How am I helping?

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.840
Um, uh, let's, let's get, let's get to the, to the, to the root of

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.840
this.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:38.840
Uh, so your, your mom is how old she's 51.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.840
So you're a youngster.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.840
I am a youngster.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.840
Did she have you very young?

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.840
Uh, I don't remember or I don't know.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840
I mean, I'm 25.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.840
So 25 years ago.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840
Okay.

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.840
Um, yeah.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.840
So well, so you're at the age where your mom had you is what

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.840
it sounds like.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.840
Did she live in town or is she out of state?

01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.840
She just moved.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.840
I just moved out.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.840
Yeah.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.840
So you're trying to reach out to her and say, let's hang out.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840
Let's go.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.840
Let's go be in Monterey.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:14.840
That's, that's Monterey Mike.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.840
You reached out to your mom and she's like, she, she didn't want

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.840
any part of that.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.840
I didn't even get to tell her that that's what I was going to do

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.840
for her.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.840
Do you think if, if you told her that she'd be open to that or

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.840
no?

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.840
No.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.840
Well, because she said a couple of weeks ago, could you tell her,

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.840
you're comfortable talking about that event?

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.840
What, what was the conflict that resulted in your mom canceling

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:36.840
Mother's Day weeks in advance?

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.840
To be honest, I always forget why.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.840
It's kind of weird.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.840
It's like an ongoing thing I could do.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.840
I could breathe wrong.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.840
I could come home at a wrong time.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:51.840
I could do one little thing wrong and it's just a constant cycle.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.840
It's always been like that.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.840
You said come home.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.840
Do you live with her?

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.840
I used to live with her.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.840
Yeah.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.840
What about other holidays?

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.840
Is there also Christmas is canceled.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.840
Mother's Day is canceled.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.840
Wait from today, just from today.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.840
Yeah.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.840
No, it's, it's a constant thing.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.840
It's never happy.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.840
It's always, I have been finding ways to spend holidays with other

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840
families.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.840
Was that always the case throughout your childhood?

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:19.840
Yes.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.840
What do you think that's about for her?

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.840
I know she says, she likes to say that she's not appreciated.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.840
And I, my brother and I have done our best, but we come from

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.840
divorced parents where it wasn't pretty.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.840
And it was a weird custody agreement.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.840
And we got tossed back and forth between our parents.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.840
And it was never kind of, it was a very unstable environment.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.840
So that plus I also know things were triggered by like her

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:48.840
upbringing.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.840
She wasn't very friendly with her mother.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.840
And it's a constant.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.840
It looks like it's been a cycle for years.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.840
So it sounds like, yeah, I mean, like, like trauma gets handed

01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.840
down.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:04.840
She, she's not to speculate in either direction, like judging

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.840
her or, or, or forgiving her, but just like from what I'm

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.840
learning in therapy, like one might speculate that these

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:18.840
holidays represent like the opportunity for crisis.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:23.840
And that she's ironically trying to shut them down thinking

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.840
that that's going to solve the problem.

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.840
But of course she's creating new, she's just doing it again.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.840
Yeah, that's exactly what I hear in therapy as well.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.840
That she's like, she's like shutting off.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.840
She's like, Oh, yeah, I don't want to have a heart attack.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:39.840
So I'll shut off all blood to my heart, you know, that way

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.840
I'll be perfectly immortal forever.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.840
And, and so like you're, you're able to know that, but like,

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.840
like, it's like, like, how do you so, and yet you're not

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.840
going to do that when you have kids.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.840
Are you going to have kids?

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.840
I'm going to have kids one day, maybe.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.840
I don't know.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.840
You're going to have them tonight.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.840
Let's spin the wheel.

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.840
That's the Harmontown guaranteed.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:05.840
Problematic.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.840
Everybody gets impregnated tonight.

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.840
I feel like, I feel like that is like a common mom threat

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.840
though, right?

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.840
Like that, like, like my mom gets frustrated around the

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.840
holidays and then she's like, like, you guys aren't treating

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.840
me well.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.840
We're not going to do Christmas.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.840
Like I feel like that threat is there.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:25.840
Definitely postponement and cause I learned the word

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:30.840
postpone by studying notes left by my mother on Easter

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.840
morning, like, like, and Halloween morning and Christmas

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.840
morning.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.840
We would, there would be like a big fight the previous

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.840
night and then we'd, we'd wake up and it would be like,

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.840
my brother would go like, there's a note and then we'd

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.840
look and it would say Easter has been postponed.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.840
And I remember that we're learning that word because

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.840
by going over it with my brother going, does that mean

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.840
Easter never will happen or does it mean it will happen

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.840
later? And he's like, I don't, I don't, I think it means it'll

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.840
happen later.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.840
We'd like look it up.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.840
It happens three days later.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.840
Yeah, exactly.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:07.840
Like, like, like, so, so yeah, holiday, holiday control.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:08.840
Yeah.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.840
In the parental, I don't want to, I don't want to draw

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.840
analogies that are going to offend anybody, but like,

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.840
like, like, like young women who have eating disorders,

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.840
it's like, like, like you're out of control.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.840
Everything in your life.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.840
There's no, there's no threshold to fucking like, like

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.840
accomplish anything like, like, like, that feels like,

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.840
like change and, and like the default place of like, oh,

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.840
well, I can, I can eat or not eat for lunch, you know, I can

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840
eat less or all these things.

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.840
Like, and it kind of spirals into the syndrome of like, oh,

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.840
that makes me feel comfortable that I'm out of control.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.840
I would have like, like her emotional intake.

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.840
What am I doing?

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.840
What is it?

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.840
Like, I'm not a therapist.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.840
What am I doing?

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.840
Like, like, look, my point, what is my point?

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.840
How do we turn this into show?

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.840
I was, I was, I was thinking, looking down the line that we

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.840
had a couple of improv trained guys.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:02.840
No, I loved what you were saying.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:03.840
I mean, I agree with you.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.840
It does feel like that kind of like a common thread and it

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.840
comes from a place of my mom not wanting to deal with it.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.840
Maybe it comes from a good place or something like that.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.840
Well, I'm sure like, she's, she implies like, I'm, she's

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.840
heard that from a therapist already.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.840
Like it's, it's been dimensionalized and personified.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.840
She gets it.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.840
Yeah.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.840
Lauren, like, let's say you had a kid, you know, a boy or girl.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.840
Let's say, let's say you had two.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.840
You say you had one of each.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.840
Do you think that you would pass any of that on of your,

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.840
your mother's like hangups?

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.840
Do you think that you'd be able to not do that?

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.840
Or do you think you inherit that too?

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.840
I, that's why I'm in therapy for my parent and my parents passed

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.840
down these traits to me and my therapist and I are trying to

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.840
break those before I get into a relationship or have kids.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.840
So I know like that I'm not going to pass those traits on and

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.840
hopefully I have more of a healthier relationship with my

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.840
future whoever or my future kids.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.840
Can you tell us like what the language your therapist is using

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.840
like in circling this area?

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.840
Like what are some of the tools or things that you've learned

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.840
or anything that's causing like an epiphany about it that

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:11.840
you, that sticks out as like, like just like in talking about

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.840
your mom and therapy and her relationship with these holidays

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.840
and canceling them and stuff.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.840
Has your therapist said anything where you're like,

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.840
Oh, I remember this.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:22.840
It's like she likes to tell me like when your mom gets into

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.840
her screaming fits and things just kind of stay calm and

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.840
cause normally I would fight back.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.840
I would argue back with her and say like that's not fair or

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.840
whatever.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.840
You don't understand.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.840
I just would stay calm and like just say like, okay, mom,

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:39.840
okay, mom, okay.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.840
And you should do that.

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.840
Why?

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.840
Because there's just therapists have a theory about what your

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.840
mom's doing and then how it's going to play itself out.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.840
It's her attention grabbing.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.840
She's trying to get grab attention because she didn't have

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.840
attention when she was younger.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.840
Oh, but that's a weird.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.840
I mean, it's like, like, not that something being weird means

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.840
it doesn't exist.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:08.840
I mean, look at flamingos knees, but the episode title.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.840
I lifted that from Oh God, the movie Oh God.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.840
I'm not a perfect guy.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.840
Look at flamingos kneecap.

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840
That's George Burns.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.840
Okay.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.840
So the, but the, but it is just, I mean, it's just weird

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:26.840
thinking like here are these days that are demarcated for

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.840
specialness and attention and all these things.

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:34.840
And but like they're being superseded and your therapist is

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.840
certain like the stories.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.840
Are you sure your mom didn't actually endure trauma like,

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.840
like, like from family?

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.840
It's not, it's not about her needing attention.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.840
It's about her actually avoiding trauma.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.840
Like, like, like, I think it's more attention.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.840
Like she was, she had like her history and she was the

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840
middle child.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.840
She wasn't cared about her brother and her sister were,

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.840
you know, the, oh, they're the best children in the world.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.840
She had to do all the chores.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.840
I mean, mother's day with your kids.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.840
It's, there's, there's not a lot of competition for that corner.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.840
It's like you only have so many kids and it's like,

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.840
they don't have other moms that are like going to box her out.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.840
I could sit like, like, like, but, but in her mind,

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.840
it's like maybe festivity and tradition and stuff.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:23.840
It's all like a ritualistic way of like maybe somehow

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.840
minimizing her.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.840
Lauren, how much do you, do you think that you like inherit

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.840
your mother's traits?

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.840
Like how much of you is she?

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:39.840
Um, I would say, like, I share 50-50 of my father and my mom.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.840
Like, I mean, physicality, like, looks and stuff and personality.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.840
Are you close with your dad?

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.840
I kind of, I feel like I'm closer with my dad.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:51.840
Then mom?

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.840
Then mom, because mom tends to push away a little bit more

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.840
because she says she's, she's tried enough.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:04.840
And my dad, he, he will still reach out.

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.840
Even if he's angry at me, though, like time will pass

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.840
and then he'll try to reach out.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.840
My mom says that she's done enough.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.840
She's tried enough.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.840
There's like these hints at backstory with your mom.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.840
Like she's somehow been victimized to the past,

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.840
not only by her parents, but actually by you guys.

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:22.840
Yeah, we, I mean, it was really hard because my dad was,

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.840
when they got divorced, it was a very ugly divorce.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:30.840
She felt, oh, she felt, she felt, she felt like she was in a pageant

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.840
to like compete as a parent.

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.840
Yeah, parents do that.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:34.840
They feel like they need to compete.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.840
My mom felt like she needed to give us anything and everything we wanted.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:43.840
And then we kind of, my dad on the other end was telling us like,

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.840
oh, your mom, you know, she's a liar.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.840
She's, you know, she left you guys, she left you with us

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.840
or left, left me with you guys.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.840
And then like things like child support, like your mom didn't give enough money

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.840
for child support.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.840
And so, I mean, it's this really vicious cycle.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:03.840
Are you and your brother close?

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.840
Kind of, not really.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.840
Our family's kind of broken.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.840
It's all, it's all fractious.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840
Yeah.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840
Okay.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.840
So, well, so I was going to, I was going to have somebody come up

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.840
and then I was going to like maybe fix their problem

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.840
in the form of like an improv scene, not doing that.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.840
Oh my God.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.840
That would be, I'm pre-problematizing that.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.840
Thank you.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:28.840
I was entertained by the podcast where Laura was just sitting there crying

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.840
and while you guys made jokes about the mythologizing her situation.

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.840
But it's amazing that you can come up and talk about that

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.840
and be like that open about it.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.840
Yeah, thank you so much for bearing that stuff.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840
I was not aware of that.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:41.840
Thank you.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.840
I'm sorry.

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.840
But stay here for a second.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.840
Life all comes at a price.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.840
We all pay a price for being ourselves and like, like,

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.840
you didn't, you didn't earn or deserve any of that,

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.840
but you're trying your best to like not pass that along.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.840
And we, like clearly if you had a kid,

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.840
I think we can all agree that you would be a good mom.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.840
Maybe the, maybe the exercise is to,

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.840
is to prove that with a,

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.840
Uh-oh.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.840
A scene will do a radio play,

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.840
improvised radio play.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.840
Oh, no.

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.840
And your role, don't worry.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.840
You don't have to be like, like Johnny on the spot or anything.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.840
We'll just, you can just say,

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.840
like you'll be the matriarch of a family and we'll,

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.840
and we'll just, uh,

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.840
We're the kids?

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.840
Well, we'll start with like,

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.840
yeah, well, we'll start with her.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.840
Yes.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.840
We'll, uh,

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.840
I'll be, I'll be your, I'll be your husband.

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.840
Uh, I'm assuming you,

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.840
when you, when you first see yourself having kids,

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.840
you first see yourself,

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.840
I don't want to heteronormatize you or anything.

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:55.840
Like, do you see yourself as like married to a dude that has a,

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.840
that you have a kid with them as like a nuclear situation

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.840
or is there some other fantasy in your head of like,

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.840
of family?

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:05.840
Just having kids.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.840
Okay.

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:07.840
It doesn't need to be anything special.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.840
Not with a big, okay.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:10.840
But, okay.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.840
So I'm being over cautious.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.840
I just don't want to, like,

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840
by the way, I'm a lesbian.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840
You totally offended me the whole time.

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.840
Uh, the, the, okay.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.840
So I'll be your husband and then we'll,

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.840
we're, we're, we're at the hospital and we just,

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.840
um, we just had our first kid together and then we'll,

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.840
we'll do like an Avalon type thing where we,

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:34.840
we move through the ages and you and I will grow old together and die as our,

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.840
as our family, as our family kind of continues as they have a family of their own

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.840
and things and you and I will die of old age,

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.840
happy, assuming that that's part of the fantasy.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840
Cool.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:45.840
Okay.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.840
All right.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840
But right now we're 25.

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.840
Lauren's world.

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.840
Okay.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.840
Hey baby, did it hurt?

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.840
No.

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:05.840
Oh good.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.840
God, everyone says it hurts.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.840
I, I, uh, they said they're going to bring the baby in.

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:14.840
Uh, I, I, thank you so much for doing this.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.840
You're welcome.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.840
Lauren, Dan, I'm, I'm Dr. Schwarzman.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.840
I, uh, I have good news and bad news.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.840
Uh, you have two babies.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.840
One baby is a super special baby.

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.840
One baby kind of an asshole.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.840
Well, they're both going to be special to us.

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:40.840
Isn't that right baby?

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.840
Yes, definitely.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:42.840
Okay.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:43.840
Well, let's bring them in.

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.840
Well, they look to me, they look the same.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.840
I think it's great that we had two babies.

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.840
Mommy, daddy.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.840
They're already speaking.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.840
Whoa, that's crazy.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.840
Also, sorry, sorry, Dr. Schwarzman again.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.840
One of your, one of your babies can already speak English.

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.840
Well, you, you're stepping on the second baby's line.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:15.840
Aw.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.840
What's up you dipshiots?

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.840
Oh, oh, oh my God.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.840
What a mislead.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.840
It's the, the, the baby that could, okay.

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.840
Well, they,

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.840
Well, Dr. Schwarzman, I'm leaving you, you're on your own now.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.840
Oh.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:33.840
Okay.

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:34.840
All right.

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:35.840
Well, let's, let's get them home.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.840
I'm assuming there's equipment and things you probably have to,

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:38.840
they probably take a credit card.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.840
All right.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:42.840
We'll take, we'll take the two special seats and,

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.840
and like the bungee cord and the two bottles, I guess,

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:50.840
and what diapers, throw some diapers in.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.840
Who cares?

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:58.840
Anything's more comfortable than that pussy I just got out of.

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:03.840
You know what I just realized?

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.840
We haven't named them yet.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.840
Cause I'm like, well, this one, oh my God, the mouth on him.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.840
Call me, call me Tony.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:16.840
Well, he took his own name.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.840
He's so exceptional.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.840
Oh my God.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.840
And, name, name myself.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.840
Fucking dumbass.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.840
Hey, whoa, Tony.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.840
Hey, sorry, sorry.

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.840
My name is baby angel.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.840
Oh, baby angel.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.840
I love both of you.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.840
You're amazing.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:50.840
One month later, baby, the, the babies are making noise.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.840
It's my turn, right?

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:55.840
I'll go, I'll go, I guess I'll go see what's going on in the

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.840
baby's room.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:01.840
I got a fucking log in my pants.

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:12.840
So me out.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.840
I mean, it's, it's, it's so hard to stay mad at you, but like,

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.840
cause you're so, you're so above board about everything, but

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.840
how do you do an angel?

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:29.840
Tony tried to garret me with the mobile cord.

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.840
Tony, stay away from my past by a little bitch.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.840
Stay on your side of the room.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.840
You guys are sharing a crib.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:38.840
You're just a month old.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.840
Like, like, you're not supposed to be first of all talking,

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:46.840
second of all, garretting, third of all, understanding

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:47.840
possession.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.840
We had, we had hoped to avoid that.

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.840
Like, it's like a runaway train.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:54.840
Well, here, let me change your diaper.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.840
Come here.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.840
Come here, Tony.

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.840
Sorry, you know, it's, I'm excited too, by the way.

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.840
Jesus Christ.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.840
Rock soft.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:19.840
Daddy, why did you only circumcise one of us?

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:26.840
Well, daddy's Jewish and mom's Lutheran and you're our

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.840
little angel.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.840
So we felt you were chosen.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.840
And so we circumcised you.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.840
Is that the answer you were looking for?

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:40.840
It's an answer.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.840
Why are you asking the questions, buddy?

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:51.840
I'm the one who's going to do all this shmegma and so on.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.840
Oh, shit.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:57.840
It's three in the morning.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:58.840
Hello.

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.840
Is Lauren there?

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:01.840
Uh, yeah.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:02.840
This is, this is her mother.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.840
Oh, okay.

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.840
Jesus Christ, okay.

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.840
Put me on speaker.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:15.840
Well, I'm, I'm walking the phone to the master bedroom.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.840
Put me on speaker.

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.840
I never liked you.

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.840
I never liked you, Dan.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:22.840
I've never cared.

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.840
But, uh, put my, put my daughter on the phone.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.840
Lauren.

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:27.840
Lauren.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.840
Yes.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:29.840
It's your mom.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:30.840
Oh, yeah.

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.840
I'm going to put, I'm going to put her on speaker.

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:33.840
Okay.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.840
That's by her request.

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:41.840
Sorry, my phone's so wet.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:42.840
Lauren, are you there?

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:43.840
Yes.

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.840
Mother's Day's cancel.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:45.840
Click.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.840
Why does she do that every year?

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.840
Cause she just does.

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.840
I mean,

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.840
All right.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.840
Well, that didn't land.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.840
Cancel for, for, for her.

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.840
Yeah.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.840
Well, yeah.

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:03.840
All right.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.840
Hello.

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:05.840
Oh shit.

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:06.840
Sorry.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.840
I was calling somebody else.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:09.840
Click.

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.840
I feel like she just wants attention.

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:14.840
I was like, I know it seems crazy, but I feel like she wants attention.

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:17.840
Like, like, like she's fucking like, this is what she does.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:19.840
All right. I got the kids.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:20.840
I left Tony's.

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.840
Tony took a huge shit.

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:28.840
Dick is gigantic and angels already asking questions about the circumcision.

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.840
Okay.

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:30.840
But, but get sleep.

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:31.840
Get sleep, baby.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:32.840
Get some sleep.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.840
Thank you.

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:34.840
All right.

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:35.840
What the hell?

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.840
This is Tony.

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:37.840
Go ahead.

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:38.840
What?

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.840
Yeah.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:40.840
What do you need?

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:41.840
Okay.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:47.840
Two pounds of Kilbasa.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:48.840
Tony.

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:53.840
Are you running a small business?

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:58.840
I got myself a little deli.

01:33:58.840 --> 01:33:59.840
Yeah.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.840
Open it up.

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.840
Give me that.

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.840
Hey.

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:05.840
Hey.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.840
There's an internet now.

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.840
You know, who's fault?

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.840
You even get your own phone.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.840
Hello.

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.840
Yeah.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.840
Can I get an egg salad on right?

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.840
Two latkes and an egg cream.

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.840
You're calling him one month old.

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:21.840
Yeah.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:25.840
But he has the best egg salad in town.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:28.840
Also got a big dick.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.840
You hate that.

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.840
You know what the secret is for the egg salad?

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.840
I use mom's eggs.

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.840
I use mom's eggs.

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.840
You're laughing so much while you're saying it.

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.840
It's hard to quite make it out.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.840
You're saying you use mom's eggs.

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.840
That's what you said.

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.840
You use mom's eggs.

01:34:51.840 --> 01:35:02.840
In 2020, you have eschewed internet culture and created a telephone-based deli and have

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.840
learned to harvest eggs in a month.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.840
And you're laughing about it.

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:16.840
What's it do you, buddy?

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.840
Angel, you all right?

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.840
Have you shit your pants?

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:26.840
The doctor said one of us was special and one of us would be kind of an asshole.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:32.840
And I'm starting to wonder, maybe Tony's the one who's special.

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.840
And maybe I'm the one who's kind of an asshole.

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.840
That's what special people always think.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.840
You're going to be like me.

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.840
You're going to be a writer.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.840
Hello?

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.840
Dr. Schwarzman here.

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:52.840
Angel Baby is the asshole.

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:57.840
We just got the test results.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.840
Sorry, I got to go.

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:04.840
Oh shit, my sandwich is here.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:11.840
Did you order a paola?

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.840
All right.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.840
One year later at Disneyland.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.840
All right, guys.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:23.840
It looks like there's a Dumbo ride.

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.840
Hold onto them hands and glasses.

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:30.840
This here's the wildest ride in the wilderness.

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:31.840
Dumbo.

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.840
He's kind of westernized the Dumbo ride.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:39.840
Ever since the Will Smith movie.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.840
They changed the rides to fit the movie.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.840
Main seated, please.

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:48.840
Feminist isn't others.

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.840
This is fucking boring.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.840
Hey, Tony, what did I say in the parking lot?

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.840
I want to go see the baby from Roger Rabbit that's a lot like me.

01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:03.840
You know the one I'm talking about.

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.840
Just be quiet.

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:10.840
And watch the show that we're in or the ride that we're on.

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.840
What are you going to say, Angel, you dumb asshole?

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:20.840
Tony told me that the real Splash Mountain is...

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:27.840
What happens to girls' pussies when he's around?

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.840
Tony, what are you?

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.840
A Comedy Central writer?

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:36.840
You're one year old.

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:41.840
Hey, he's going to learn it sooner or later, you know what I mean?

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.840
Lauren, can I see you for a moment?

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:45.840
Kids, stay here.

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.840
Eat your cotton candy.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:53.840
Lauren, what if we left them?

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:58.840
What if we just left Tony?

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.840
You know, just imagine you and me and baby Angel.

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.840
Just Venice Beach.

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.840
You could get a trailer.

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.840
They'd be like, oscillating fans.

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.840
Tempting.

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.840
You're so dedicated.

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.840
Because you want to be a good mom.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.840
You want to be a good father.

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.840
Yeah, I do.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:28.840
But we couldn't have predicted this.

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.840
Life happens.

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.840
Thank you, you brought me strength.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.840
Thank you.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.840
Mommy, daddy.

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.840
Hey, Angel, I snuck away from Tony.

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:41.840
I have an idea.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:52.840
Let's leave them in a hot monorail car.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:55.840
Hey, what's going on over here?

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.840
Nothing, nothing.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:04.840
Well, let's put a pin in that and let's all take the monorail to a different area of the park.

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:06.840
Yeah, let's go to the vault.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.840
I want to see some of that anti-juice stuff that Disney loves.

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:11.840
You bet.

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:14.840
As long as the monorail takes us there.

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.840
Two tickets, please.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.840
And two juniors.

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:22.840
Welcome to Anti-Semitic Town.

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:26.840
That's what I'm talking about.

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:30.840
I can't believe this exists.

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.840
All right.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:34.840
Well, here we are.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:36.840
Hey, oh, Tony.

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:44.840
Daddy left his iPad mini under a seat up there toward the front of the car.

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:46.840
About 90 yards from the door.

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.840
Oh, I got you.

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:48.840
Hold on a second.

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:49.840
Let me see here.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.840
Come on.

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:51.840
Come on.

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:52.840
Lauren, no.

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:55.840
There's no fucking iPad under here.

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.840
Monorail now leaving.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:58.840
Doors locked.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:39:59.840
Lauren!

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.840
Lauren!

01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:01.840
Lauren!

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:06.840
Lauren!

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:07.840
All right.

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:08.840
Angel, run.

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.840
Run for the parking lot.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.840
Your mom can raise Tony.

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:11.840
Run!

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:12.840
What?

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.840
Keys, keys, keys, keys!

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.840
God damn it, keys!

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.840
I only have baby keys.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.840
Hold on.

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.840
Daddy's got to make a phone call.

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:27.840
Angel, get in the back.

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:28.840
Strap yourself in.

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:29.840
Okay.

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:30.840
Hello, 911?

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.840
What happened at Disneyland?

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:37.840
And my wife and my cat are on a monorail.

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.840
This sounds like a bad performance, sir.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.840
Did you kill your wife and child?

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:43.840
No, they're alive.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:44.840
Go find them.

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.840
God damn it.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:46.840
The fuck.

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:47.840
I don't even know what else.

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.840
Angel, you and I...

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:50.840
Boo!

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:51.840
Shit.

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.840
Boo!

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:53.840
Shit.

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:54.840
Fuck.

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:55.840
Hey, let me out.

01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:58.840
Do you know how fast you were going, sir?

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:01.840
Zero, I was parked in the...

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.840
We're in the Buzz Lightyear lot.

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:05.840
All right.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.840
On you go.

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.840
Shit, I thought they were...

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.840
Okay, let's get out of here.

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.840
Let's get out of here.

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:15.840
Giraffe section.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:16.840
What the hell?

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:17.840
We're gonna...

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.840
Boo!

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:19.840
Oh, god damn it.

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:20.840
Oh, fuck.

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:21.840
Do you know how fast you were going?

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:22.840
Like 12?

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:23.840
Correct.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.840
On you go.

01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:33.840
Listen, Angel, there are people and there are people, and people can't control to whom

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.840
they're born and who they're raised by, but you and I, like, we are simpatico, okay?

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:44.840
And I love your mother so fucking much, and I wish that she wasn't so dedicated to being

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:48.840
a good mother, because now she has to be with that turd for the rest of her life.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.840
Cut to the Hot Monorail with Lauren and Tony.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:59.840
Holy shit, it's fucking hot up in here.

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.840
But as well, climb back up, you have a voosh, you know what I'm saying?

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:07.840
Yeah.

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.840
That's a thing Italians say, right, mama?

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.840
Yeah, sure.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:17.840
Oh, ma, we're gonna die, aren't we?

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:18.840
Hopefully not.

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.840
Hopefully we'll see your brother and your father again.

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:26.840
Oh, it's fucking over, I'm gonna stop tearing out my little baby hair, I guess.

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:31.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's gonna be fine.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.840
No.

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.840
Oh.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:45.840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, CBS News.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:55.840
A mother and a child are trapped in a Hot Monorail between Disney and downtown Disney.

01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:01.840
The baby seems to be from New York for some reason.

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.840
Pretty salty.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:12.840
Meanwhile, in the basement of the Pentagon, we close in on a hissing cryogenic chamber

01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:17.840
until, as the camera reaches the latches, they pop open.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:22.840
A familiar man leans forward, gasping for air.

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.840
Someone needs help.

01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.840
It's Walt Disney.

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.840
Mr. Disney, we told you that you wouldn't wake up until the year 2038.

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:36.840
Well, that's where I second guessed you, see.

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:44.840
I designed my cryogenic chamber to also react to scenarios of peril at my own Disney world.

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:49.840
So are you aware that we have a Hot Monorail crisis going on?

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:55.840
Corporal, I can't hear you over the sound of me strapping on this jet pack.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:02.840
Disney, away!

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:07.840
Can you read my mind?

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:13.840
I'm one person flying higher than I ever have.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:17.840
Every star is a cup of water, every moon.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:18.840
There's only one.

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:21.840
I will eat it like a cupcake.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.840
I will also touch the sun.

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.840
Hello.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.840
Hello.

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:28.840
Walt Disney?

01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:29.840
Yes.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.840
Because why did you create Anti-Semitic Terror in Disneyland?

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.840
Oh, is that still going?

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:35.840
Yeah.

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.840
Oh, for crimony, jeez.

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.840
I'll take care of it.

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.840
Jarvis.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.840
Yes, sir.

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:51.840
Take Target, The Monorail.

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:58.840
Right away.

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:01.840
Let's pop a hole in this can.

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.840
I'm snarky.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:15.840
Walt Disney, it's me, your enemy, Notch Berry Farm.

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.840
I don't even know who you are.

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:22.840
Don't be a dick.

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.840
We got Monoism as revenge.

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.840
It's a pretty good perk.

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:33.840
I've heated up your Monorails to almost unbearable temperatures.

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.840
A mother and her son are about to die.

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:46.840
Well, I guess we just need a little help from our friends, like the frozen girl.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.840
Make it real.

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.840
Make it real.

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.840
Make it alive.

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.840
I can't remember the song.

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:57.840
Let it go.

01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.840
Make it go.

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:00.840
Make it real.

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:03.840
It's the copyright version.

01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:05.840
Make it real.

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:09.840
Make it so.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.840
Ah, now the whole Monorail is cold as a Jiminy Cricket.

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.840
Wait, we need someone to lasso that speeding Monorail.

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.840
Look, it's Woody from Toy Story.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.840
You are a guy I know.

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.840
You are a guy I know.

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.840
I got it.

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:34.840
That'll slow it down to a crawl and eventually a stop.

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.840
We can get that baby and that mommy out of there.

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:43.840
And to help, if only there were just a couple of fish from Pixar's fish movie.

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.840
Fish.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.840
We're here.

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.840
You are a, we got a special situation.

01:46:52.840 --> 01:47:03.840
I was so racing to the point of Randy Newman's songs are the same.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.840
I couldn't fucking, I couldn't obey the rules of improv.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:08.840
I was like, no, I get it.

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.840
A mine.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:10.840
I will eat.

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.840
When we get there, Randy's mine.

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:15.840
Walter, are you okay?

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:19.840
No, sorry, sorry guys.

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:25.840
Now could y'all just give me a moment while I go down into the Monorail car and see to these two.

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:32.840
I've always had a special place for dissatisfied customers.

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:39.840
Holy shit, fucking Walt himself.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.840
What's going on?

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:44.840
Well, aren't you an articulate little man?

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:46.840
I pulled all my hair out.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:47.840
I look like Tony Soprano.

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:48.840
It's a good thing.

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.840
It's good.

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:57.840
I'm happy about it.

01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.840
Young lady, is this your son?

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:00.840
Yes.

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.840
I'm awful sorry you had a bad time at Disneyland.

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:10.840
Can I just say that you should make it so you can just stop the Monorails.

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:16.840
You know what I mean?

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.840
He also said you should make it so anti-Semitic town doesn't happen.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.840
I can't control everything.

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:22.840
Oh, fucks.

01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:24.840
You need some of that stuff.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:25.840
You know what I mean?

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:33.840
You can't problemize everything.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.840
Sometimes the tail wags the dog.

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:43.840
Speaking of which, what if I were to say to you, young man, that I had a special island

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:52.840
where aggressive boys like you who maybe don't fit in as much when held to the standard of humanity

01:48:52.840 --> 01:49:00.840
can be more adorable when surgically augmented to be half-animal?

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.840
There ain't Jewish guys over there or no?

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:03.840
Sure.

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:10.840
Dr. Moreau has changed his name to work in Chopin's surgery.

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:15.840
You know what I mean, no matter what, take me to that fucking island, Walt.

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:24.840
Ma'am, what if I were to tell you that the best thing you could do for this child was to let him go to a special island

01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.840
where he'd be mutilated surgically?

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:31.840
Rejoin your husband with the good child.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.840
Live out your days.

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.840
But I love him.

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840
What is love, really?

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:41.840
If it's unconditional, then can't you just love a fire hydrant?

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.840
True.

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.840
Isn't all love somehow conditional?

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.840
Aren't we, therefore, somehow accountable to whether or not we are loved?

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:57.840
Aren't the people that get that the ones that become truly creative in an endless quest to make things,

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:08.840
whether they be bad movies or giant theme parks and just always just trying to get people to love us that didn't love us very much?

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:17.840
I think if this child were to have floppy ears like grafted to the side of his head,

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:30.840
fed spam from a stainless steel bowl and regularly whipped with a crazy Jedi electric whip so it didn't feel as violent

01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.840
because it's like sci-fi violence.

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:37.840
I told you I'm fucking in already.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:45.840
You're waiting for my fucking balls to drop over here, let's go.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.840
I just want to make sure the young lady's okay with it.

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.840
I don't know if that's what he wants.

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.840
I'm Italian, I'm part of Animal Anyways, let me go.

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.840
That is true.

01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.840
So racist.

01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.840
But so are animals.

01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:01.840
And we love them.

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:06.840
Disney, yay, yay, yay!

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:16.840
Walt Disney turned into a rocket and took the baby Tony to a special island where he was never seen again.

01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:26.840
Lauren returned to giraffe parking where Dan and baby Angel were still unable to figure out how to get out.

01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:29.840
Oh shit, it's your mother.

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:31.840
Play it cool.

01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.840
Hey baby.

01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:33.840
Hey.

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:34.840
Hi mama.

01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:35.840
Hi.

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.840
You're gonna pull the car around.

01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:40.840
Sure, you are.

01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:48.840
You know I left you for dead in a hot monorail.

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:59.840
I guess for all our effort, we're just all a big pile of whatever happened to us.

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:03.840
Sure.

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:04.840
Tony's gone.

01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:07.840
I noticed, I noticed.

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.840
Are you stoked?

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:11.840
I let him be what he wanted to be.

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:12.840
Nice.

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.840
Dead or just missing?

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:17.840
Apparently he's going to an island.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.840
He's gonna be a half animal.

01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:21.840
I love it.

01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:31.840
But what of his thriving deli business?

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:32.840
Who's gonna answer that?

01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.840
I don't know.

01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:35.840
That's his phone.

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:36.840
Hello?

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:41.840
I ordered a pastrami like a fucking four days ago.

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:44.840
Where's my goddamn sandwich?

01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:49.840
Well, well, you reached a baby click.

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:53.840
Now that's a mother's day.

01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:55.840
Yay.

01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:58.840
You're the best there is.

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:02.840
Mother was the best.

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.840
Mother was the best.

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:10.840
Top on the top for the mother's day.

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.840
Panavision.

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:14.840
That was good.

01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:15.840
That was good.

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:17.840
I think we got to the...

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.840
Let's thank Lauren, everybody.

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:19.840
Lauren.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:23.840
Thank you, Lauren, for sharing your pain.

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:25.840
We fucking did it.

01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.840
We solved mother's day.

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.840
We fixed mother's day.

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:31.840
Right?

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:32.840
Didn't we?

01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:33.840
Yeah.

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:34.840
No.

01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:36.840
I mean, were you traveling?

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:39.840
I think we made it worse, didn't we?

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:42.840
You're lonelier now than you were when you came up.

01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:43.840
No.

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:44.840
I love this place.

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:46.840
Here's what the dough boys are.

01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:48.840
Here's some shitty advice from us.

01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:50.840
Tomorrow can be your mother's day.

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:52.840
Bring her over some dinner or something

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.840
and you can patch it all up tomorrow, if you'd like.

01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:55.840
What are you planning?

01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:58.840
The holiday doesn't matter and bring her something to eat

01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:00.840
and you guys will work it out, right?

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.840
She seems like the type of mom that'll be like,

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.840
is this a secret mother's day?

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:05.840
Yeah, she is.

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:06.840
So cut you off of the pass.

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:07.840
That's true.

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.840
Yeah, not everything can be solved by food, I guess.

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:12.840
But your podcast can.

01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:15.840
The dough boys is on every Wednesday at 3 p.m.

01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.840
You don't have a time slot.

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.840
Thank you so much, Lauren.

01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:23.840
Is there anything else we don't want you to be voicelessly

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:26.840
railroaded by our mirth?

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:31.840
Anything else to...

01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:33.840
I don't know.

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:34.840
I'm bad at it.

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:35.840
My mom?

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:36.840
I don't know.

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.840
My mom doesn't listen to this.

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:39.840
Do you love your mom?

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:40.840
I love my mom.

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:41.840
You must.

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:42.840
I love my mom.

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:43.840
I love my stepmom.

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.840
I love my other moms that I consider mothers to me.

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:47.840
My best friend's mother.

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:48.840
I love her.

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:49.840
Live with her now.

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.840
Who are all those mothers?

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.840
Woo!

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:53.840
All right.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.840
Props to all those mothers.

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:55.840
All right.

01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:56.840
Thank you, Lauren.

01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:57.840
Thank you.

01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:58.840
You can...

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:04.840
Thank you, Lauren.

01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.840
So she does have a lot of moms.

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:11.840
So her mom is, like, getting boxed out.

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.840
That's what we learned right at the end.

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:14.840
I was like...

01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:15.840
Not really, though.

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:16.840
I was like...

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:17.840
What's the...

01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:20.840
That's not the most healthy way of thinking, right?

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.840
Oh, okay.

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:23.840
Well, it's...

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:24.840
That's true, though.

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:25.840
It's true.

01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:26.840
Captain Elf.

01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.840
Foster Brooks' name.

01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.840
That is not the most healthy way to think about it.

01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:38.840
Or the most healthy way to say what you said.

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:41.840
Because it sounds like you've...

01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.840
Okay, never mind.

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:44.840
All right.

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:45.840
No, no, no.

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:46.840
I wasn't going to...

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:47.840
Now, Dan, will you call mom or no?

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:48.840
Only a text.

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:49.840
I texted her.

01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:51.840
For God's sake, we like it that way.

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.840
That's it?

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:53.840
We got it.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:54.840
We got it.

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:56.840
She wouldn't like a call better than a text?

01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:58.840
Oh, fart on you.

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:00.840
I texted her.

01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:01.840
What did she say?

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:02.840
Did she text you back?

01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.840
Yeah.

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.840
What did she say?

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:06.840
She said, uh...

01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:07.840
I don't know.

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:08.840
She...

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:09.840
Great.

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.840
If I read her text, then it'll be...

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.840
Wouldn't that just make the problem worse?

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:16.840
I kind of feel like...

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:18.840
I don't know why my parents didn't come to my wedding.

01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:24.840
Like, I kind of feel like maybe it was because maybe they didn't want to...

01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:30.840
Maybe part of the whole thing of me talking about my life and stuff maybe is off-putting to them.

01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:37.840
So, I don't want to read my mom's text for fodder.

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:41.840
Because on the off chance that that is the thing, I don't want to...

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.840
Was she happy to hear from you?

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.840
It's a text, man.

01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.840
She was like...

01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.840
I think you should bring her a meal tomorrow.

01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.840
Is that something from Olive Garden or...

01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:56.840
Chuck E. Chains?

01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:58.840
From Tony's Deli.

01:56:58.840 --> 01:56:59.840
All right.

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.840
Well, what have you learned this whole time, Spencer?

01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.840
Come on, man.

01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:06.840
Why do you give me all the hard questions?

01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.840
End of my show!

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:09.840
Yeah, exactly.

01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.840
No, I'm not going to.

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:14.840
I'll sit here.

01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:19.840
All right, well, then I'll go back to the dregs of the fucking shitty note app.

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.840
Because we don't have an ending.

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.840
My chiropractor is a piece of shit, but he's really nice.

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.840
Nobody came tonight because of Mother's Day.

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.840
How's your back?

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:29.840
My back's great.

01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:30.840
Look at me.

01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:31.840
I'm doing high kicks.

01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.840
Is it better?

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:33.840
It's great.

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:34.840
It's great.

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:41.840
Oh, Seek is here, but, you know, I can't bring him up now because Seek's doing well.

01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.840
Yeah, he's doing better.

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.840
Awesome.

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.840
But let's problematize that.

01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:50.840
Who says Seek's doing better?

01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:51.840
He does.

01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.840
Yeah.

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:53.840
Who's he talking to?

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:54.840
Us.

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.840
Yeah.

01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:56.840
And why is he doing that?

01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:59.840
Because he cares about himself and us.

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:00.840
Exactly.

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:01.840
Racist.

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.840
And us.

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.840
All right.

01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:09.840
Tap Titans, tap Galaxy, and tap Tycoon.

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:12.840
Check them out.

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:16.840
All right, that's it.

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.840
Do you want to do a little song?

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.840
Yeah, but not a rap.

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:24.840
Is there anything that's not a rap, like just a song?

01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:25.840
Like family?

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:28.840
I think, yeah.

01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:30.840
You want to do a little song?

01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.840
What do you want it to be about?

01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:33.840
What we've learned.

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:34.840
Okay.

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:36.840
We'll do it.

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:45.840
Now, let's take a moment.

01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:47.840
And what if I had said potatoes?

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:49.840
Would you have played something else?

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:57.840
I want it to be about potatoes.

01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:59.840
That seems like a rap.

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:01.840
Okay, but that doesn't have to be.

01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.840
All right, I won't.

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:04.840
Yeah.

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.840
That's it.

01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:07.840
Yeah.

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:08.840
There we go.

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:09.840
Yeah.

01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:12.840
This is called What Have We Learn by Dan Harmon and the Joe Boys.

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.840
What have we learned?

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:15.840
All right.

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:16.840
Yeah.

01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:19.840
I feel like it's so...

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:20.840
You got it?

01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:22.840
What have we learned?

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:24.840
What have we learned?

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:29.840
What have we learned?

01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:33.840
We learned.

01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:37.840
That you got to forgive your mama.

01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:40.840
Forgive that mama.

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.840
What have we learned?

01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:47.840
All right, this isn't working.

01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:48.840
All right.

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.840
All right.

01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:52.840
Okay.

01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:53.840
Okay.

01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.840
All right.

01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:55.840
Yeah.

01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:56.840
Here we go.

01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:57.840
Yeah.

01:59:57.840 --> 01:59:58.840
Slow it down.

01:59:58.840 --> 01:59:59.840
Yeah.

01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:00.840
Yeah.

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:01.840
It's better be good.

02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:02.840
Keep it tight.

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:03.840
All right.

02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:04.840
Oh, yeah.

02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:13.840
Gonna rip up your body.

02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:19.840
Gonna rip up your body.

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:25.840
Sorry about that.

02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:28.840
From the break of dawn to the avenue,

02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:31.840
till the street comes through and keeps going through,

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:34.840
through the Lincoln Tunnel to the top of the tower.

02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:37.840
Gonna lay your body down hour after hour.

02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:40.840
Gonna go to Second Street in Lincoln Park.

02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:43.840
Gonna fuck your body till the day gets dark.

02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:46.840
Gonna put my penis inside of you.

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:48.840
And when I'm done with it, you'll think I'm through,

02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:50.840
because I'll declare it.

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.840
I'll say I'm all done and you'll say,

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:56.840
oh, I think we won because you've got that spirit.

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.840
You're a team player.

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:05.840
I fucked your mama like I was a dragon slayer.

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.840
Doe boys.

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.840
This song goes out to all the mums out there.

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:16.840
And all the dads too.

02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:17.840
Doe boys.

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:18.840
Doe boys.

02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:21.840
We like what you do to create us.

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:25.840
Whether it's your pussy or your cum.

02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:30.840
Mix them all up, daddy shooting to mommy's little sleet.

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:33.840
And the baby comes out nine months later.

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:42.840
And then we praise you on one day in May.

02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:45.840
But don't forget about that day in June.

02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:48.840
We gotta celebrate dad is two.

02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:49.840
Forget grads.

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.840
They get too much shit.

02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:52.840
Oh yeah, dad is.

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:54.840
That, that is it.

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.840
So mama, get down on your knees.

02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:57.840
Sit down.

02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:58.840
Daddy fly.

02:01:58.840 --> 02:01:59.840
Do what you please.

02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:00.840
Yeah.

02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:01.840
I'm talking.

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.840
My father's day blow job.

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:04.840
Give it daddy.

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:06.840
My father's day blow job.

02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:07.840
Mother's day.

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:08.840
Mother's day.

02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:10.840
If you love your kids, you're gonna suck your dad.

02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.840
Our dad's dick.

02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:13.840
Family.

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.840
Family is what's important.

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:17.840
That's a takeaway.

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:19.840
Family.

02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:21.840
Family till the end of the day.

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:23.840
Got a family.

02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.840
That's how much everybody.

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:27.840
Thank you for coming.

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.840
So for the Joe boys.

02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.840
Nick and Mitch.

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:34.840
Spencer Crittenden and Lauren.

02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.840
Thank you for coming up and joining us.

02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.840
I'm Jeff Davis.

02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:40.840
I'm here for your mayor.

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:48.840
Dan Harmon everybody.

02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:49.840
Drive fast.

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:54.840
Did you get any of that?

02:02:54.840 --> 02:03:20.840
It's a good show.
