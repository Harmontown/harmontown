00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, NerdMelt meter, Harmontown, now in session.

00:22.000 --> 00:39.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello. Hello everybody. Hi. Hi, how are you? Let's get down to business.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
How you doing, Dan?

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm good. Sorry I brought the energy down with my hello. I don't know why I did that.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I just created it as a pregnant pause, pregnant with possibility.

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
Oh, impregnated by possibility, pregnant with potential.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Now you brought the mood down.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
All right, Jeff, let's run through my notes.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Hey, okay, so are there any British people in the audience?

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
All right, wow.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
So what is with the word aluminum?

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Because we, it's spelled, did we discover it?

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And then they heard about it but didn't see how it was spelled?

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
I think they think they discovered it because Kate, my Scottish ex-girlfriend,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
she was emphatic about aluminium and wouldn't hear otherwise.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
There's an eye that's not there.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
It's not like nuclear where we say it wrong.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
You know, I would definitely just assume that, you know, we're Americans

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
and whoa, we do everything wrong but they're wrong about this.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Aluminium, knock it off.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
All right.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Hey, do you think dogs know how to share with each other?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
No.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Okay, all right.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I think dogs are a packed mentality.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
There's alpha, beta and so on.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
And so the beta will always defer to the alpha of any group.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Right.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
And so when there's owners there, because we have these sticks, these like pepperoni sticks

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
that the dogs really like.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
They love them.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
But Harvey, the big one, he eats, he tries to eat them slow

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
and you can see him watching Nigel, the little tiny one.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
And like Nigel just puts it between his paws and does that little thing

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
or he's just like nibbling at the end and he just loves licking and nibbling it

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
with his little needle teeth.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
And Harvey just sits across the room and watches him while he like chomps it

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
like a candy bar.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
It's like gone in three bites but he wishes it wasn't and he just stares at Nigel

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
and then he starts doing laps.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
But he's like, he's got one eye on Nigel and one eye on me all the time.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Like, because I think that means that he know, I think if I walked out of the room

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
he'd steal the other dogs thing.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Let me look at Rents of the Litter.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
The puppies won't share the teats.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
One puppy is going to be the, you know, get no milk and be a little runt.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Right, but dogs have to get socialized into the rule.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I mean, yeah, puppies certainly don't share.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Of course, they're like little blind larvae that are just looking for...

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
They probably don't even know they're not sharing.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
They probably think they are.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
The mother is just...

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I guess I disagree with you about the guys we found out.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
But the mothers don't even like try to distribute evenly.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
They just lay there and say, first come, first serve, baby.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah, what do you do?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Do the mother dogs, do they go like, alright, come on, this guy doesn't do as much.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
No, they lay there and just go, Jesus Christ, I got 17 people sucking on my tits right now.

03:55.000 --> 04:06.000
How would you feel, Dan?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Do you think that feels good?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Because I just thought that would feel good.

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
When you said that, I was like, well, that would feel 17 times as good as when you get a little nipple play.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
My nipples are extremely sensitive. I don't like a whole lot of nipple play.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, we've been over this.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
You said you're not a nipple guy.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I just don't need a whole lot of it.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Well, that's the beauty of nipples. That's the point.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I mean, I don't really need any of it.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Alright.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Or back to alienation.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I thought maybe there was a misunderstanding.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
No, you know they're supposed to be sensitive.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
That's the selling point.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I think mine are more sensitive than people that enjoy it.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Because it's like, hey, it's really like it's a lot. It's an overload.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Alright.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
So, a pop culture corner.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Alright.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I don't know what that other stuff was.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
Sometimes a society's made out of things that aren't art or education.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Or war. We call them pop culture.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Where'd you get that?

05:19.000 --> 05:28.000
That is our friend Kevin McLeod who gave us a family slide.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
From the clan McLeod.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Holy ground.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm choosing for some ass.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I got something to say.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
It's better to burn out than fade away.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
It's Highlander.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Okay, so there's a hot hamburger.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
That's it. It's been in the news for ages.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
If you don't know, you're not hip.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
There's a hot hamburger.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
They got Jake Gyllenhaal playing the hamburger now.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah, Jake Gyllenhaal.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Hey, have you seen that movie Nightcrawler?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Is that Jake Gyllenhaal?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Okay, good. I always get them confused with the other guy.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Who's the other guy?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Martin Luther King.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
Yes, I'm sure they're sick of seeing each other in casting sessions.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
I have a nightmare that Jake's out for this part too.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
That was my Martin Luther King impression.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I'd like some toast.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
It's a very sensitive, very cautious Martin Luther King impression.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Hello.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
Do you know the way to the library so I can continue to be a very smart person?

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
My name's Martin Luther King.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I was murdered.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Oh my God, a ghost! A ghost!

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah, I'm here. It's me.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
I'm a ghost.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Ooh!

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't know what... I'm on a weird...

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Are you a viewer?

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Dr. King, what's your favorite thing to go hunting now that you're a ghost?

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
Well, you know, as you know...

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
I don't want to do the whole dream thing.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Like Freddy Krueger, you know?

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
You know, every time you have a dream and then I'm there and it's like, this is my dream.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
Because I feel like fun's fun, but it undercuts my larger message.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
I don't want to turn the importance of my life into a bit in death,

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
even though I will be dead far longer than I was alive.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
And that is something you should be warned about.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
It's going to get boring.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
Enjoy it and stop being racist. I don't know how many times I have to say it.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
It's a waste of your life.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Is there racism in the afterlife?

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
There are racist ghosts. There are people who died racist.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
And so they can't get not racist.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
They're just walking around going, look at all these black people.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
And they're upset. And that's what they deserve.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Because they can't do anything about it.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
They can't integrate with non-corporeal hands.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
You can't separate people when your body is a vapor.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
They deserve it.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And I was not famous for being a judgemental person in my life.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
But I think they deserve it.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
When I died, I had two immediate thoughts.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
One was like, why the fuck am I not in heaven? This is insane.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Why am I a ghost? Me.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And then my second thought was like...

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
If you're a ghost, it's neither heaven nor hell.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
That's purgatory kind of style or what? Is that the deal?

09:06.000 --> 09:15.000
Well, I ain't seen no harps.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
I ain't seen no harps. Someone just repeated it in the audience.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Anyways, look, I was never going to make an exciting ghost.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
That's the fact.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Who's your role model ghost? Who's your favorite most entertaining ghost?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I'm glad you asked. Come on out. Come on out, Napoleon.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Suck my boo! Suck my boo!

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Suck my boo! Suck my boo!

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I didn't think of it the first time.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
I said boo and then I was like, oh fuck boo boo!

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Napoleon, wait, hang on. You just came up with Suck my boo just now in front of us?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Yeah, yeah, we will!

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm constantly inventing and experimenting.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
You've been dead for like almost 200 years.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Wee!

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
There's a thousand things to do when you die. You float around.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
You look at the people. Suck my boo!

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I just now got to LA. I never knew about it.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
Oh, I'm a Napoleon ghost.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Napoleon, are you okay?

10:19.000 --> 10:26.000
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I got ghost pneumonia.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
But you can't die from ghost pneumonia, can you?

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
No, that's why it's so bad. You just keep coughing.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
You can't get rid of it. There's no ghost medicine.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Why do I sound like Cheech Marin?

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
You sound like Cheech Marin who might have lived in Frankfurt for a while.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Dave's not here, man!

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
Alright, so anyways. Yeah, that was Pop Culture Corner.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah, you guys like segments, right?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I'm just staring at my phone. There's not a lot on here.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Look, I just wanted to, you know, I think we have some entertaining guests.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
But we do have to, as I tweeted, we don't have Spencer tonight.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
But we're going to make the best of it, you know?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
A general malaise is falling out of the crack.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Maybe the ghost of Spencer will come by.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, I don't mean that he died.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
I mean, the ghost of his presence. The ghost of his enthusiasm.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Which I do think died around episode three.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
I would believe that his enthusiasm is a ghost walking around somewhere.

11:39.000 --> 11:48.000
Alright, so, okay, so, well, I don't know how to bring things down, but, like, so, like, alright, dog sharing.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Alright, so, well, they got that, they got that new Uber program.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
They keep adding the things. It keeps getting, there's like more and more things in the bottom of Uber.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
And now the thing on the left most is Uber Pool, where you can, like, pool with Uber people.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
And then Aaron was like, I don't think I'd ever do that.

12:09.000 --> 12:18.000
She's like, well, wait, I'd do that before I'd take a regular Uber because of all the, you know, harassment and creepy creepiness that goes on in your average Uber.

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
And I was wondering if that was their point. Like, maybe Uber Pool is them, like, because they can't say Uber chaperone.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
Like, maybe they really are like, hey, for the ladies, well, there'll be another person there.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Alright, so...

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
Aren't you just doubling or tripling down on more guys getting in the car with your wife and saying like, hey, who are you guys doing later on?

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Well, I guess that's what, that was my thought, was like, how likely is it, how does this pool thing work?

12:44.000 --> 12:52.000
I was wondering if maybe that's like a, maybe it's a fake thing, where the third person is always just a licensed social worker or something.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
A federal marshal, yeah.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
And they're just like, they just clear their throat a lot whenever the driver's like, should I take a left up here?

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
No, no, take a right. Oh, sweetie, you don't know anything.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Yes, okay, left end.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
Yeah, anyways, so, okay, so do you think Curtis Armstrong is mad at us?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
No, why? What happened?

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
I don't know. He said he was going, because I'm always drunk during the show and I don't know if like...

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Did anything happen at the end of the last show he was on?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
No, not at all.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Okay, just making sure.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
We professed our love to him, he accepted that love.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
I was at the top of the show and then I was like, okay, now the other shoe is going to drop.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
And then usually the show ends in a blackout for me.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Like, I don't really, I kind of have to listen to the end of the show.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
That's why our role-playing games are so bad. Like, by the end of the show, I'm a little gone.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
So, like, I can't, it's a little bit of a fog, you know?

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
And I was, I remember talking about boxers and, you know, we touched on, I don't know.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
I couldn't remember, like, because, well, he just, he hasn't responded to my direct tweets,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
which is how we usually communicate.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
And I just, I've just been really paranoid about Curtis being upset.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
What are you raising?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
He says he's going to England.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
He says he's going to England, yeah.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
But, I mean, yeah, Twitter there.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah, he's with his daughter.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
They don't have, they don't have the word aluminum there, but they have Twitter.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
All right, fine, he's like spending time with his daughter.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
He doesn't check his tweets.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
Fine. Good.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm not, I'm not going to be worried about it.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I think you're fine. I think you're fine.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
All right.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
I think he's very happy here.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
And I think there was a, if there was anything, there was maybe a moment of sincerity where

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
we all agreed that we all like each other.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
And then we talked about how long it took for us to hang out and then it took for ages

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
for us to actually hang out as friends and not like meet at a party or whatever.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Yeah, that was at the beginning.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
By the end of the show, though, it was like, we were talking about boxing and I was like,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
well, it'd be great if McDonald's black people, blah, blah, blah.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
And I just don't know if I like, if that bulldozer had any casualties, you know, if anybody.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I don't think so.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
I mean, ask them.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Justin just brought your mail.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Do you get paid to do the show?

15:12.000 --> 15:21.000
Is that, is that your check?

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Cis boom bah.

15:25.000 --> 15:35.000
Cis boom bah.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
What is the sound of a sheep exploding?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I'm stealing from Johnny Carson, everybody.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Johnny Carson.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
No, no, I have a note about our guest tonight and what his, if we play Shadowrun, what his

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
character will be.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Oh, I see.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Okay.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Well, I actually, we should bring up our first guest.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm kind of excited because we haven't, I don't think we've ever, we haven't really

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
had a lot of, is he, is he back there?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
What's that?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yes.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
He's back there, right?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Okay.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
Because we, we never, we've never done the political thing, like in the sense of like,

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
like we've never had anybody come on the show to actually help, help them politically.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
Like this is kind of an exciting thing, like to have a show, you know, like the Daily Show

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
or something like that, where people announced their candidacy.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Well, I mean, now it's, it's, it's, it's presidential election season.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Right.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
And we've become a very important show.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah, but what, but I, I, I truly hope, Dan, that we're not gonna, like no one's gonna come

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
on the show and use that to stump for their, for their own political game.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
I think that any candidate that was gonna come on the show would be doing so because

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
they had decided that this, this demographic is savvy and young and critical thinkers and,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
you know, it's skeptical and that their votes matter the most.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
And what is sure to be a very important election.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I mean, you guys know how I feel about politics.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
I didn't, I didn't, when I heard this guy was coming on the show, I didn't at all have

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
to say, wait, who's that and have DeMorge explain it to me.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
It's, you, you, you, you, well, there's a, it's a, he's a, he's a Republican candidate

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
and he's, he's, he's been in the news a lot lately.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
He's a little controversial, but, but he's, he's, I have no, I don't know anything about

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
him and, but I know you guys have heard all about him and you're always tweeting about

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
him.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Let's welcome Bernie Sanders.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Senator Bernie Sanders.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Wow.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
Wow, wait.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
Senator, pleasure to meet you, Senator.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
You can just grab any mic you want to sit anywhere you feel comfortable.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I assume the mics were rigged with union workers.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
That's good to know.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I should clarify the introduction.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
I'm not a Republican.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Oh.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I'm an avowed socialist.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I'm the only independent senator from the state of Vermont in the United States Senate,

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
but I'm running for president as a Democrat because, well, I like to change things up.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
I got, I got my information wrong from DeMorge.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I thought you were like the new Herman Cain.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Look, you get your information wrong like the American people get inaccurate information

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
from the mainstream media, which is controlled by five corporations.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
It's the same situation.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
What we're fighting against is the top 1% that controls more than the bottom 60% combined.

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
And if you look at the numbers closer, it's the top 10% of the top 12% of the top 1.1%

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
year on year labor adjusted statistics.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah.

18:33.000 --> 18:42.000
That has more growth than a lot of, a lot of, a lot of further statistics further down the line.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I can't argue with that.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
So, well, I mean, I mean, we've all seen those charts and stuff about wealth distribution.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
What do you say to the people that say like,

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
Did you know that over two thirds of charts that are used to illustrate economic data contains

18:59.000 --> 19:08.000
more blue and red graph sections than the 99% of the working class 40% that operates somewhere

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
with between the chocolate and vanilla layers of the middle class cake?

19:14.000 --> 19:22.000
Senator Sanders, do you feel that a lot of people think that you might be drawing votes away from Hillary?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Sure.

19:23.000 --> 19:30.000
No, I don't think there's any danger of that and everybody working on my campaign is well aware.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Is there any truth?

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
I never want to be a gotcha question kind of interviewer.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
That's fine.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
My life is an open book specifically.

19:40.000 --> 19:49.000
It's a 20,000 page printout of the Bureau of Labor Statistics report for the fiscal year 2014 to 2015.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
And it's all dot matrix too.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
It's all dot matrix printer.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Well, yes, because I believe in fiscal accountability.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
So I print on very cheap paper, which is still a dot matrix printer.

19:58.000 --> 20:06.000
If I need further copies, I use a mimeograph machine because I'm from the 1970s.

20:06.000 --> 20:19.000
Senator Sanders, is there any truth to the allegations that your hair is actually a sideways wig?

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
Look, I hope we delve into some hard numbers after this because I think this is a distraction from the issues.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
But since it's brought up, I will address it for the people.

20:28.000 --> 20:44.000
My hair is harvested on a monthly to bi-monthly basis to provide cotton candy for younger Americans who come from a socio-economic background where they could not afford cotton candy.

20:44.000 --> 20:54.000
And as you know, the summer months are approaching, so I've donated recently my real hair as cotton candy to some lower income children in Vermont.

20:54.000 --> 21:10.000
And yes, I do replace it with two wigs that I'll lower it onto my head by union labor, like Darth Vader, in the rotunda of the Capitol building.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.000
I think both DeMorge and I, in the green room when we heard your name, thought you were that black guy, that crazy doctor guy?

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Look, I don't agree with them on the issues, but I respect them.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Bernie, the other one.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Look, I think I compare very well.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Ben Carson?

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
I'm so relieved that DeMorge also had no clue.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I'm way out of the loop here.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Look, wishful thinking.

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
Look, I'm a presidential candidate that everyone agrees with on everything, but no one will vote for me.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I think you sound like you're singing my tune, for sure.

21:43.000 --> 21:55.000
If one-third of the two-thirds who support my positions were to vote for me, that would be one-sixth of the population that would vote for me, and we wouldn't win the election either.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Oh, okay.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
So you think it would be difficult?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
You don't think you're going to win?

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Look, I don't think I'm here to talk about winning and losing.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
I think that's the problem with American capitalism, that we've been obsessed too much with the losers.

22:08.000 --> 22:21.000
And that's how the middle $40 billion in the federal budget goes to the top 1% of the top 2% of the top, let's say, 17% of the country.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
Is this just kind of a thinly veiled ploy, this bid for the presidency?

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Are you aiming to maybe settle in at Vice President?

22:29.000 --> 22:37.000
Look, I don't have any aspirations further than maybe a nice walk, maybe a nice cup of warm chocolate from time to time.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Mr. Sanders, is there any truth?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Hold on a second.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Let me finish the question, Mr. Sanders.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
If provoked, I will, filibuster.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Let me finish the question.

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
Is there or is there not any truth to the allegation that you are wearing my mom's glasses?

22:57.000 --> 23:07.000
That's a reasonable question because what I am doing is wearing glasses that are of the model that is widely available to librarians and mothers across this country

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
who have to work in humiliating conditions as public workers in the education and library systems.

23:13.000 --> 23:22.000
And so in solidarity, I wear the glasses that are the minimally covered glasses that you have to wear if you have public health care in these professions.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
Look, see, we're resonating with people who will not vote for me, but we're resonating with them.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
They don't even correct my vision to the right degree.

23:33.000 --> 23:40.000
I wear them merely to be in solidarity with the hardest working people of this country.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
I've been very impressed by you, what little I know about you.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
You've been very strongly in support of women's rights and equal pay.

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
I feel like that would be the most appealing thing for me as a voter is that you actually stand up for the women.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Look, women are 50% of the population.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
How many percent is 50%?

24:04.000 --> 24:17.000
Look, the bottom 40% of all 50% is equal to the top 12% of the middle, I don't know, Avogadro's number.

24:17.000 --> 24:26.000
I feel like I really have this urge to bring Barack Obama out here and have you guys have like a little debate.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
Look, I would be happy to go toe-to-toe with the President of the United States.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Let's bring him up. Let's bring him up, Barack Obama.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Is he here? Is he here?

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
I think he might be taking a shit.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
Oh, okay, he's here.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Mr. President, Mr. President.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Mr. Obama, sorry about that.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Mr. President, how was your shit?

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
It was a bit brief.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Now in the green room, Mr.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Certainly it was instantaneous.

25:04.000 --> 25:21.000
If elected president, my shits will all be short in duration with minimal about spent out of the federal budget on cleaning up the smell of the room afterwards.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
These are your salad days.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
You can say things like that.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
And you can mean.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I'm sorry, did you say salad days?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yes.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
Do you need anything as exotic as salad?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
My diet consists of oatmeal mostly.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Okay, an occasional porridge.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
And if it's a celebration, I get some raisins.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Isn't that a bit extravagant, Mr. Sanders?

25:48.000 --> 25:56.000
Look, a box of raisins in 1970 contained over 40 grapes that had been shrunk down to an edible raisin size.

25:56.000 --> 26:11.000
Today, over 40 years later, that same box of raisins contains over 20% less grapes from farm to plate because of Monsanto and genetically modified organisms,

26:11.000 --> 26:22.000
which I will fight to stop in the impossible scenario where I occupy the White House for even two or three weeks before the Pentagon calls a coup d'état.

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
Because I am simply unacceptable to anyone with power to be in the office.

26:29.000 --> 26:36.000
But you are also implying that also likewise, you don't think people will vote for you, although all the powerless people, you know what I'm saying?

26:36.000 --> 26:43.000
Of course, the grandpas of the world don't want you anywhere near the throne, but you think the voters of the world are also a little jaded.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Well, that's what I'm running for.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
I'm running for the young people, the people out there who are burdened.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Now, I'm entering a pandering section.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
You see, here's the thing.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Sure.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
Wait, hold on. Let me know my bloody tunes of stopping sound.

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
Go ahead.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
You can talk a fair game right now.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Sure.

27:11.000 --> 27:18.000
When you get into the room, the oval room, there's a red phone.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
The red phone might ring. It might be the middle of the night.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
That's no concern to me. I'm color-blind.

27:25.000 --> 27:40.000
I'll treat every phone of every color with the same respect that I would treat an average gray phone operating year on year on original AT&T payphone-wise.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Okay.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
Mr. Obama, if I might, Mr. President, I might say, I think, look, I respect you as a person.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
And as an antagonist over a nice game of mahjong.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
And don't forget, Mr. Sanders, Senator, I guess you're a Senator.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
I thought you were a doctor because I thought you were a completely different human being.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
You could use his support. I mean, you're not even running against him.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Like, this might be a good time to...

28:06.000 --> 28:13.000
Look, I would, but I'm not accepting support from any corporations or any human being that's made up specifically of corporations.

28:13.000 --> 28:23.000
Which includes Mr. Obama, and as much as I respect you as a person, I think that you, as a labor organizer, did more good for this country than you have occupied the White House.

28:23.000 --> 28:39.000
Look, the cadence and the volume was there for the crowd to agree, but still to this day, not even in the waiting days of a presidency that could only be argued as a failure, people are still on his side, comedically, room by room.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
I think this country...

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I would argue that these days are not waiting.

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
I think this country is ready for a socialist Jewish president. I think that would be an awesome change of pace.

28:48.000 --> 28:55.000
Look, I don't think there's a problem with that, but look, I think, look, if people worry that that's unpopular socialist Jewish, don't worry.

28:55.000 --> 29:02.000
I'm also an atheist, and I used to...

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
Look, I have a very popular time everywhere I go.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
I get thanked. I don't think we need to dwell on that any further.

29:12.000 --> 29:27.000
I think, look, the bottom 40% of the top 60% of the 11% who've even heard of me have 50-50 opinions on whether I look good on C-SPAN.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
Senator Sanders, what flavor is your cotton candy here?

29:32.000 --> 29:40.000
Look, it's traditional sugar flavored, and this was the result of a freak accident when I was a young man.

29:40.000 --> 29:53.000
I saw The Grateful Dead at Brandeis University, and there was some very strong lysergic acid that I sampled at the time,

29:53.000 --> 30:04.000
and it all took me, not unlike Peter Parker, sort of superhero, except that my hair turned into cotton candy because it was an outdoor event,

30:04.000 --> 30:13.000
and that's what we were eating, and there was sweetness along with LSD, and so it's a debilitating, it's a gift and a curse, you might say.

30:13.000 --> 30:20.000
When your hair tastes so good, when you're doing a speech, a 17-hour speech, like I do on a Tuesday, just when I feel like it,

30:20.000 --> 30:29.000
it's a humiliating when another senator like John McCain gets up after you and just sort of licks your hair and grabs it and licks it like a goat.

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
That's humiliating, and as president, I would only allow that on Sundays and certain holidays.

30:35.000 --> 30:46.000
Thank you. I'm a little intimidated. This is the largest crowd I've performed for. We've been doing fundraisers throughout Southern California.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
I think you've found your people. We've got about 40 bucks out of it.

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
I'm sad about how jaded and cynical and kind of disheartened you've already become, and I just met you.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Do you know there are guys like you out there?

30:58.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm the picture of optimism, but I don't believe in irrational optimism. People say you either think the glass is half full or half empty.

31:06.000 --> 31:17.000
I believe that the glass can increase year on year with targeted investments in certain sectors, that the share of the glass for the bottom 40%

31:17.000 --> 31:27.000
can be equal to what the share of the glass for the top 10% is using real dollars inflation adjusted back to the original statistics used to the Great Depression.

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
And if that's not a ringing endorsement of the potential of the American people, I don't know what is.

31:34.000 --> 31:42.000
I guess some people just want to hear, you know, we're going to kick butt overseas and we don't have to be afraid.

31:42.000 --> 31:53.000
Look, I'm not a jingoist in favor of laws that are necessary. If there's any butts that's going to be kicked, they're going to be voluntary butts.

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
You mean people that want us to go to war with them?

31:58.000 --> 32:08.000
Look, if I think that kicking butt should be like abortion, I think it should be safe, legal and rare.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
And I think it should involve consenting adults, whatever possible.

32:13.000 --> 32:23.000
As far as foreign policy, I don't believe we should have one. I think that we should pull all our military forces back and replace it with some brownies that we maybe

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
have a big sale of some kind in an international scale, which has never been tried anywhere except Norway and look at them.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
All right, well, I mean, I've never...

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
And I am a fan, by the way. I'm a fan of the show, the community show.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Oh, you like it, the old community?

32:41.000 --> 32:51.000
Yes, I think it's a fantastic look at what we need to be doing for American young people who are in the education system and the burden of student loans that they have to face.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Yeah, you don't mean moving to...

32:54.000 --> 33:06.000
The top 12% of the middle 6% of the 17, 5% of the, let's say, APR of 11.7% is equal to all graded there.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
Now, this is an algebra problem. I don't even know the answer to this. I'm just posing it to the people.

33:11.000 --> 33:25.000
Given X, what is Y? Carry the one, but the problem is the middle class no longer can't carry the one because the two burden carrying the two and the five.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
All right, Senator Bernie Sanders, everybody.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Thank you, Senator Bernie Sanders.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Thank you for coming out.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Thank you.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Thank you, Mr. President.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Sorry, Mr. Obama.

33:36.000 --> 33:43.000
If you want any more, you can go to my website, BernieSanders.org forward slash, why not, Bernie?

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
Bernie Sanders. Thank you, Senator.

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
I didn't, like, Jim Orange, will you stay please?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
What?

33:53.000 --> 33:59.000
Can someone call me an Uber, please?

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
What happened?

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
He and I were talking last week about Herman Cain and Ben Carson.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
And so when I heard Bernie, I immediately switched to Ben Carson instead of giving you a whole Ben Carson.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
Because it just, it is in Adomian's wheelhouse to come in as Ben Carson.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
That was James Adomian, everybody. James Adomian.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
It is well in his wheelhouse.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
We've never had someone come out and just do a dedicated one-off character like that.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
No, yeah. I don't know if that's, I don't know if that's what he wanted to do.

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
You think you could get Bernie Sanders to come out and play Shadowrun with us?

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
Or would there be too much percentage points in APRs?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
You could get him to do a lot of that.

34:40.000 --> 34:53.000
For example, when I was going on my Ben Carson, Herman Cain run, he, for about an hour straight, was just doing Pat Buchanan to a room of kids who had no idea what the fuck I was doing.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
So much so that afterward I was doing amazing Pat Buchanan impressions to people because I was just copying him.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
We've had him on before.

35:01.000 --> 35:14.000
Aaron and I have talked about how we like his impressions come from a different school of thought spiritually kind of than the rich littles where you just figure out how someone talks and then you kind of repeat.

35:14.000 --> 35:25.000
I don't know. He always sympathize with the people that he's mocking.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.000
Like he makes you like them. Like they're underdogs and they're the heroes of their own stories.

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
Yeah, we're fighting position. A thief never knows he's a thief. He always thinks he's doing good work.

35:36.000 --> 35:44.000
Yeah. And I love that I can just be at a party and like I just say, hey, Marc Maron, is it okay if I have these chips and then he does Marc Maron?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Or Eddie Pepitone.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
I've got it. My wife is in a vat of blue water.

35:50.000 --> 36:01.000
He does the most amazing Eddie Pepitone. Two Pepitone. There are Pepitone shows where he'll heckle him as Pepitone.

36:01.000 --> 36:15.000
One of these days maybe not to be presumptuous, but the most flattering thing in the world would be to have him heckle you as you.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I'm sure the wheels have already started.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
That's a human impression. The man does nuts though.

36:20.000 --> 36:27.000
You know who did a good one at one point was Abed Gheith, a real Abed. He did a pretty good, good Dan Harmon.

36:27.000 --> 36:35.000
He physically becomes everybody, but he can't do the impressions necessarily, but he can physically become and do the mannerisms of everybody. It's very shocking.

36:35.000 --> 36:41.000
Abed, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's kind of how I got to know him. He was at a party and everyone was gathered around in a circle.

36:41.000 --> 36:49.000
Everyone was shouting names that this guy was contorting with each name and was on overload.

36:49.000 --> 36:55.000
Looking back on it, that may be how we broke him.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
He was already there.

36:57.000 --> 37:03.000
He was an accountant when he walked into that party.

37:03.000 --> 37:09.000
I'll never forgive you for that because I introduced him as a Republican. I didn't even know where the hell was going.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
I tried to correct him. Once he came in, I was like, what are you doing? He told me, I went, oh, fuck, I complete.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
So we tried to rewrite it and get the message.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
Oh.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
Well, that wouldn't have helped. That's exactly the information I had.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I just don't know who these people are.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I'll bite the bullet on all of that. That's my thing.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
Who is it? Can we talk about the other guy though? He's a doctor.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
This is a new tradition in the post-Obama Republican world.

37:35.000 --> 37:44.000
There is this effort on the Republican side always and it will not get, and I shouldn't even say this because I don't want to give them the key to the portal,

37:44.000 --> 37:57.000
but they refuse to access, people like us, our age, who are Republicans and have a sense of how to run the Internet,

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
how to promote through the web, how to do other things.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
They really do run off this hierarchy that the elders know better and they're consistently out of touch.

38:06.000 --> 38:12.000
Every run of these campaigns, they focus on, right now, it's because of Obama, it's a black thing.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
They try to find some sort of minority savior.

38:15.000 --> 38:22.000
Trying to find, and then that's where it goes into fear mongering because then they go, okay, what part of the black culture are we going to do appeal to?

38:22.000 --> 38:30.000
Do you look at the way that they gravitated to Herman Cain last time, which is hilarious because this guy, there was no part of that guy that was serious at any point.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
And yet, there was a six week period where he was the leader.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
He was the guy.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
They had all eliminated.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
Bachman turned out to be a head spinning freak.

38:39.000 --> 38:46.000
You know, there was a Rick Perry did everything he could to blow it, including that moment where he went to Vermont.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
They gave him a bottle of maple syrup and he was tripping balls on pills and booze.

38:51.000 --> 39:00.000
Manow wrote nothing for two days. She just played that full tape for two days of him kissing a bottle and then gesturing to women in the audience.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
He was fucking insane.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And so here comes Herman Cain.

39:04.000 --> 39:15.000
Keep in mind at this time when he finally had to go, when he finally had to go, his dismount was somebody, he was giving a speech, not about saying goodbye because he actually never said, I quit.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
He said, I'm suspending my campaign for the rest of my life.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
But a person, he's on satellite feed and somebody's walking right now.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
How you doing, man?

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
He's like sitting there staring in the space because it's just everything that he's done and everything.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
So you've got to deal with now and where do you go when you've got six weeks in the spotlight.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
And now you leap.

39:35.000 --> 39:48.000
And he said, a man once asked me if I could be any ice cream, which one would I be?

39:48.000 --> 39:54.000
And I said rocky road because it has been a rocky road to the president.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
This is what he said.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
And this guy was the leading candidate.

39:58.000 --> 40:05.000
If he opened with that, if that's how we started off, then we would like that guy.

40:05.000 --> 40:16.000
You said something that distracted me back there, a ways, a stretch, as the Republicans say, back there as the crow flies, a yonder.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Do you really think that there is?

40:18.000 --> 40:32.000
I mean, I know that there is such a thing as the concept of a fiscal Republican that doesn't give a shit about any of this like other voodoo that we've come to associate with this tent.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
But still, don't you think that they've crunched those numbers?

40:36.000 --> 40:44.000
Because that would be less work for them if they thought that there were so many young people out there that would just answer the call of pragmatism financially.

40:44.000 --> 40:58.000
You implied that maybe you think that, that there's like a tragedy for the Republican Party, that they're hung up on this non-economic crap, as if they could somehow get the popular majority in an honest way.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
All I can talk to you about is this.

41:00.000 --> 41:13.000
My contemporaries who don't agree with me politically, the ones that I get in serious discussions with, where the argument is not about shutting somebody up, about talking louder than somebody.

41:13.000 --> 41:22.000
Where it's about the actual mathematics of argument and rhetoric, where if you know something that I don't know, we're going to hash this out until I know what you know.

41:22.000 --> 41:30.000
But if you don't, shut the fuck up and take my information and move on, these kinds of arguments, which are based on logic, which we don't teach.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
We don't teach in public schools, we don't teach logic, we don't teach civics.

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
So you have kids going to public venues and pissing on walls because they don't realize they own a part of that.

41:39.000 --> 41:47.000
You have people, you know, saying, I don't hear you, I don't hear you, I don't hear you, because they don't understand that that's not an argument.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
They think that I had an argument with my friend. No, you didn't. You have a discussion about anything.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
They've been infantilized. I mean, they've taken that we had, you know.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
Well, they've been limited in what they've been, in terms of how they can see the world.

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
But the ones that I have serious arguments with, those people, continue right.

42:05.000 --> 42:12.000
They write for Bush. I mean, I have friends who are Democrats who actually wrote for Bush, because that was the job that they could take.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It was the best job that they could take.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
And also, there's barely any difference between those jobs.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Okay.

42:18.000 --> 42:25.000
Because you're writing. I used to write ads for Coke, but fuck, I can only work for Pepsi. What am I going to do?

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
No, but that's it, but that's literally it.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.000
Oh, wait, it's refreshing again. Fuck it.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
That's always my job.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Vote red.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I was sitting, sorry.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Brought to you by Frito-Lay.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
But wait, wait, wait. I want to merge it.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Jeff, Jeff, I want to merge and finish this thought.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Jeff, I want to merge it.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
They're saying, but they're saying, they're...

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Dan, let's merge, finish this thought.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
I wouldn't have done the fifth one. I wouldn't have done it.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
How many comes with fives, man? How many comes with fives?

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
No, they're... Yeah, these people are my friends.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
They're all over the place. They're my colleagues and everywhere.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
But, you know, they're tapping in now.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
They got sidetracked by this Tea Party thing.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
There's this whole neocon thing of creating enemies and creating arguments where there are no arguments.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
It's because you think that your populace is going to vote for you no matter what.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
And you've got to search out certain areas and own those areas,

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
and it expands and expands and expands.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
There's a hierarchy to set up that they bought into.

43:37.000 --> 43:42.000
It's been going on since the early, mid-70s or whatever.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
Right, I was just saying, you and I were born into this, so I don't even know...

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
Yeah, and it stepped up when Clinton went into office immediately,

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
where they sort of threw out all of the understanding of how...

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
The things, the graces that you allow the president to do for better or for worse.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Because of cable TV and like...

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I don't think it's panic. It's just hunger.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
They want their power back. They had power for X amount of years.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
They did everything that they could.

44:06.000 --> 44:12.000
So they just became the other political party because it became like a world where you could get elected by...

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
from their perspective.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
By lumping everyone in that wants hope and change or whatever the rhetoric is for it.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.000
So then they became ironically this horrible shadow monster

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
that makes the really easy villain because they're constantly lying

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
and then engaged in all kinds of open-faced hypocrisy.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
They sort of have no choice now but to buy into...

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
not the younger minds that have a symbolic resonance for it.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Because they've gotten burned on that now.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
This woman in South Carolina who was insane that they put in office.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
They were like these pockets where they pick young people and say, this is our mass head.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
And then they turn out to be ill-qualified.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
These Joe DePlummer guys you mean?

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
Any of them. These are actual people running.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
They shore up and they end up winning.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
Because they look good on the surface and then they don't know what they're doing.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
They don't know how to legislate. They don't know how to govern.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
You can tell that that's what they thought Barack Obama was.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
I was paying a little bit of attention this last time because it was a long time ago

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
and I still had something in me that was a little bored.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
I was getting drawn in because Barack Obama was so charismatic

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
and the other side was so uncharismatic that it actually made politics.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
Although constantly nauseating as always.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I refuse to believe in any of it.

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
But the drama of it I really did enjoy because he really was.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
I really enjoyed watching him in this sort of Nazarene capacity.

45:37.000 --> 45:44.000
Just like, you know, just like them throwing all this shit at him.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
Well, no, I'm not going to be careful because it's not going to be fun.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I'm not going to fucking care at all. What do you mean?

45:49.000 --> 45:58.000
He was an awesome ninja Christ figure because he did not resort to...

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
He was diplomatic and gentlemanly and classy and humorous

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
and it was fun to watch him win because of his personality.

46:10.000 --> 46:17.000
And it was fun to watch the bad guys get so angry.

46:17.000 --> 46:25.000
What was not fun, at least for me, is that in the run-up to that

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
he had to run within his own party and at each point that somebody fell challenged by him

46:31.000 --> 46:40.000
there were people... I mean, Hillary had that critical Ohio weekend

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
where she released that red phone ad on Friday.

46:44.000 --> 46:51.000
This sort of borderline race-baiting ad with the stock footage

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
of a young white girl in a bed and a phone ringing

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
a mushroom cloud and then a picture of bin Laden.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
This is crazy.

47:02.000 --> 47:08.000
The implication was that because she's technically literally been in the White House

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
and then that phone rings, she won't go like,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Well, I fuck! What the fuck?

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
But that's the kind of thing with their talk.

47:15.000 --> 47:22.000
Who do you want to pick up that phone that little white girl sleeping in the room, a black dude?

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
Then you find out two weeks later that the girl,

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
the stock footage from a Lionel train ad or some sort of train ad,

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
like Amtrak or something, and that the girl as a grown-up doesn't endorse the ad.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
She actually was working for Obama out of Seattle or some place in the Northwest.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
But by that time, Tuesday had to run, so that primary had been run

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
and he'd already lost that state.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
And there were these little upturns all the way through.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
Yeah, it's horrible. What the fuck?

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
We all agree we're not going to vote in this one.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
I mean, I'm not going to say that out loud because there's too many kids listening to me

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
and I don't want to be part of the problem.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
I just think that the Republican resources are gone.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
They now realize, and it's going to be interesting when it happens,

48:09.000 --> 48:18.000
when they start empowering their informed, their educated youth

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
to really take control of that campaign.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
And the other stop is sort of shit that we can all see,

48:24.000 --> 48:30.000
because even their own constituency now can see this sort of baiting and weirdness that's going on.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
I checked out, it was so long ago, it was that big election,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
and I voted since then. I voted for Obama.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I was just like, I never want to be that guy.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
There's such a terrifying fucking terrorism on this non-vote.

48:44.000 --> 48:52.000
You didn't vote, like your fucking new AIDS cancer asshole fuckface.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
So I do turn out because I just want to say, I want to be able to go,

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
yeah, I did, and I also don't give a shit.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
But when I really checked out spiritually and mentally...

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Wait, is that this time, Bernie Sanders?

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
Well, I wish people would vote.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I voted and I don't give a shit.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
I don't even know if that guy really exists.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
But I like his style.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
You are the top 1% of the bottom 45%.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
He's certainly singing my tune, and there's always one guy early on that's like,

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
hey, I'm Mr. Elfman from the trees.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
And it's like a big joke, and it's like,

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
but we always know at the bottom of it all, it's like, for instance,

49:33.000 --> 49:38.000
like, oh yeah, God forbid an atheist Jewish socialist become the president,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
because they'd care more about their country than their church.

49:41.000 --> 49:47.000
They'd believe in equality financially, and they'd take their job very seriously.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
Like, oh no, the stereotypes associated with these groups.

49:51.000 --> 49:56.000
A Jewish atheist, oh God.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
But I don't know if that guy is, I don't know what James was making up,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
but I don't know if that guy exists or not.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
He's real.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
Well, both my mind, my father is a conservative, and we don't really talk politics,

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
but he's not a dummy, he's not a Rush Limbaugh lunatic,

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
as far as I'm concerned when people are party-lined right-wingers.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Also, I think I don't like liberals much either.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I don't really like any of that.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
There's no good politics for me.

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
The idea that anybody thinks that they know how everybody else ought to operate

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
is fucking insanity or dim-witted.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
So I think it's foolish to say like, all conservatives are out of their mind,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
or all liberals are just a bunch of fucking dickheads.

50:34.000 --> 50:40.000
But that's how people think, and the idea that there's these two polar opposites

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
duking it out in a ring is nuts.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
They're so close to each other, ideologically,

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
and then we create stupid things to argue about

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
that really have nothing to do with anything.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
We make a big argument, and the right-wing right now seems to have made

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
a constituency out of crazy.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
And there's a huge amount of crazy people that will vote for crazy shit.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Do you think it'll be different?

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
I was just to finish my point, I was at Seattle Tacoma Airport today

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
at the Anthony's Fish Place having a Bloody Mary before I got on my plane.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
And I was reading my book, and there was a guy next to me,

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
and I put it on my Instagram, a little video of him.

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
He was burping and farting and grunting and just making every goddamn thing.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
He's farting all over me.

51:21.000 --> 51:26.000
And then he's like...

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
I said, and also Bartappen, which is my least favorite thing,

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
and this guy was like 55, maybe 58-ish-ish.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Bartappers drive me up the fucking tree,

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
and he was a one-man band of just bumming me out.

51:40.000 --> 51:46.000
And I finally moved a stool over when he finally farted a fog around me

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
and my Bloody Mary, and I moved a seat away.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
And I don't think he liked that much.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Then he kind of was engaging everybody, like,

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
and he had a Boston shirt on, he had a Southern accent,

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
and he really did sound like it.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
He said, you got a Boston shirt.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
So what do you think about that Tom Brady verdict?

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
And the guy's like, I'm a Boston fan.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
I thought it was fair, but the guy's like...

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
Bartender, I got to get out of here.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And the bartender closed him out,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
and he announced to the bartender,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I'll do it as loud as he did it,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
and the bartender was two and a half feet from him,

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
and he announced this for you.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
And I said, Harmontowne, you would all have heard this at the bar,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
and there's music playing and there's an airport,

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
and there's a band playing over there.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
And he goes, well, I don't like y'all's politics,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
but that moisture was delicious.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Ah!

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
And I'm sitting right next to him like...

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
A political mastermind.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
And so the bartender without a beat,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
and I don't know that he was gay,

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
but he had that kind of like polish to him that maybe he was.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
And certainly he wasn't like a gruff, jockey,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
never-gonna-be-gay guy.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
He goes, um...

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
He goes, uh...

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
You know, you know, you can't be gay, right?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
You know, you can't be gay if you're in sports?

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Do you guys know that?

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
But he goes, what politics are those?

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
And this guy's like, you know, maybe early 40s.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
And he goes, I just mean, you know,

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
around here it's like, around where?

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
And the guy's like, do you mean like in Seattle?

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Oh, you guys...

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
And he's like, what's your point?

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
And he goes, oh, just give me some signs of bill,

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
and leaves the guy $100 bill.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Because he really just meant the oysters were good.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
They weren't that good.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
He wasn't gonna stand around Seattle

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
and not leave a parting shot and say like,

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
you guys are all a bunch of, like,

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
women loving fag kissing a bunch of weirdos.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Rootin' tootin', yeah.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Or the opposite of Rootin' tootin'.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
No, you guys never Rootin' tootin'.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I'm Rootin' tootin'.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
You guys are Vladimir Putin.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Right, right, buddy?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
You know what I'm talkin' about.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Anatoly?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Anatoly knows what he's talkin' about.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It's a little inside joke for our Russian friend.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
But the thing is, like,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
we can't just go around hating 50%

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
or whatever the populace of people

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
or the voters are.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
We can't all be right and we can't all be wrong.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
The idea that we've been polarizing is too...

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Yeah, it's silly.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
We've been barking that at them

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
for three years of this podcast

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
and you and I have been barking at it

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
since we were their age.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
What I wonder is,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
now that the country is arguably

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
in jeopardy,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
or maybe as,

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
you know, because it's been arguably,

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
it's been supposedly in jeopardy

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
since way before I was born.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I mean, it was in jeopardy because we were fighting

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Anatoly's grandparents.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
And it turns out

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
that was a fuckin' Wizard of Oz

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
if there ever was one.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
The...

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
There's always by the side, like,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
oh, God, the Chinese are buyin' everything.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
The Japanese, oh, we owe the France

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
so much money.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
So I can't tell.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I feel like because I'm 42,

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I kind of get the sense that actually

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
we are crumbling now.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
But maybe that's...

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
But if we are,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
maybe will we now see

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
maybe three

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
political parties?

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Maybe four?

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Like, major ones? Like, big ones?

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Because there's, like, maybe four ways

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
to think about the future?

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
How about 50 and 70, like, other countries

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
that have, like, high IQs?

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
The history of our country, when we were forming it

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
and there were, like, a thousand ways

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
to, like, you know, commit treason

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
to the British crown, you know?

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
And there were, like, a lot of fuckin' ways

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
to think about it.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Yeah, now it's just like, isn't it just a sign

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
of absolute luxury that we've gone into, like,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
are you a lefty or a righty?

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Are we just sort of suckin' our thumb

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
and kind of, like...

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
The main thing for me, on a style standpoint,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
if you just look at America in terms of, like,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
if it was a person, would you want to hang out

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
with that person? The answer is fuckin' no way

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
you would never hang out with America at a party.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
You would fuckin' absolutely be hanging out

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
and fuckin' like, like, Norway.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
You know, like, your friends would be other people.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I'm kind of fascinated with this concert

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
because it all depends on whether you're inside

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
or outside this black box.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
So, like, if you're inside of it,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
my new thing is I just call it King's Landing.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Like, it's kind of...

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
It's kind of cool in here unless you're, like,

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
super poor.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
So you see they go on a little tour

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
through King's Landing and there's a lot of people

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
that say the song hurts.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Um...

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Horror, horror, horror!

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Bastard!

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Uh, like, they're on the edge

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
and they're on the verge, but, but,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
like, there's, you know, like, we're hanging out

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
and we're, like, trying, I don't know,

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
there's a concept inside the box

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
called America that everything

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
could be super cool.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
But, like, yeah, if you zoom out

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
and look at its relationship with the planet,

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
then definitely you know, you don't want to hang out

57:04.000 --> 57:08.640
guy with a baseball hat on back wasn't a tribal tattoo. Yeah and but he won't

57:08.640 --> 57:12.160
even be nailed down about that if you if you if it and if you go up to him and

57:12.160 --> 57:17.080
say hey I noticed your baseball cap and your tribal tattoo I take that to mean

57:17.080 --> 57:23.360
you'd like a Coors he might go fuck you you jerk you broke-ass piss of shit

57:23.360 --> 57:32.320
piss of shit like you'd be like what and it's like I'm fancy I'm backwards

57:32.320 --> 57:38.680
cap tribal tattoo fancy pants wait but I thought the yeah well you you don't get

57:38.680 --> 57:48.800
paid to think Germany keep making my Volkswagen's bra yeah you wouldn't you

57:48.800 --> 57:51.160
wouldn't hang out with that guy no you would not

57:51.160 --> 57:58.720
there's it because America if America like went to like out for the evening

57:58.720 --> 58:03.520
America would not go to the opera or to the theater or to it I like this game it

58:03.520 --> 58:07.720
would give a go to it would absolutely be in the second row of a UFC fight

58:07.720 --> 58:11.880
that's where I say I think that's too simple that's too that's that's that

58:11.880 --> 58:14.960
kind of thinking is what gets people like George Bush elected if he can

58:14.960 --> 58:19.400
convince you he's from Texas you know it's like oh we're just simple folk we

58:19.400 --> 58:23.440
just we just like populism and like like popular stuff and if it makes sense like

58:23.440 --> 58:29.560
crushing a bro with a brew or sometimes the other way around it but we're

58:29.560 --> 58:34.480
pissing shit there's a ski there's a scheming like like there's a there's an

58:34.480 --> 58:39.900
underhand in this to it too there's all this snootery and charcuterie

58:41.080 --> 58:48.160
gladden putery we're we're we're new vorice and we're we're we're we're we're

58:48.160 --> 58:54.000
a trailer park beach we're we're we're the end of the Roman Republic it's

58:54.000 --> 58:58.880
exactly where ancient Rome and it's I mean let's not root for it I live in a

58:58.880 --> 59:04.760
big house on a big hill I'm just I'm just keep hoping it's steep enough every

59:04.760 --> 59:08.800
time I climb it and I can't I'm out of breath I hope the same thing is

59:08.800 --> 59:11.920
happening to poor people right now

59:11.920 --> 59:18.360
because if I keep getting fatter and they keep getting thinner this is gonna

59:18.360 --> 59:24.360
make a fun climb for them and I'm gonna be halfway up like eating a cheeseburger

59:24.360 --> 59:29.760
now the poor people in America are pretty fat too right so that's a good

59:29.760 --> 59:34.880
sign and and the two parties the fact that everyone's a big fat baby that's

59:34.880 --> 59:38.240
going like are you this or are you that means that things haven't even begun to

59:38.240 --> 59:43.960
go down yet that's my question is like shit's gonna go down and I'm not one

59:43.960 --> 59:46.720
of these people that's like like like loves like panicking everybody I'm just

59:46.720 --> 59:50.600
like like I would people talk about like super volcanoes and avian flu and

59:50.600 --> 59:55.240
Ebola and and like or even have like political like panic buttons and stuff

59:55.240 --> 59:58.760
like that it's like are you fucking kidding me do you really think that that

59:58.760 --> 01:00:04.720
is the thing that's gonna happen like like like if tomorrow the dollar was

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:10.720
worth a penny instead of a dollar which isn't that big a difference if tomorrow

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.720
you woke up and the dollar was worth a penny you'd have about six hours before

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:21.840
your week would be like different like it wouldn't it would you would be like

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.160
like shit would be immediately all over the new everybody would like the

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.960
everything would be fucked up six hours and like like you'd be like you wouldn't

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.080
be able to call people like like if things would be it would be Armageddon

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.120
just because we'd think it was Armageddon because what the fuck is the

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.800
dollar except our gift certificate to ourselves for an ice cream we're never

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:48.160
gonna get and as soon as it says we lick it and there's no ice cream flavor on

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:55.600
it we're going to flip a shit bird if that's an expression over the last four

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.440
minutes you've coined some doozies well you you better start making up new

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:04.440
languages now because each sector is gonna have their own I'll tell you you're

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.800
not gonna go into free fire zone they're all gonna be speaking in amalgam of

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:15.320
Chinese and Mexican I broke up or bar that means I'm holding a thermonuclear

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:21.360
hand grenade you've got me terrified and I'm a pretty easy-going guy you've got

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.840
me terrified the moment a dollar is worth a penny that that people will start

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:32.680
crushing bros with bruise right now we crush bruise with bros right that can

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.680
flip like the magnetic polarity of the earth like we imagine a world where you

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.800
crush bros we can start pissing a shit yeah I don't know you know what is it

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:47.800
with me tonight I think I drank I drank myself in New York into oblivion like

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:53.920
like oh really Dan tell us about it the why how how did that happen how did that

01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:01.720
what was someone getting married I well I think I pinched a nerve I scheduled a

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.680
doctor's appointment but I got like every once in a while I'm like yeah my

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.480
pinky's a little numb like I like I think I drank myself to death and we're

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:16.840
just living out the final hours it's possible and I'm and I'm I'm okay with

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:25.120
it like I I wanted to have kids but like like like after New York that ship is

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.480
sales well no no I'm just saying like it's just becoming increasingly like

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.080
I'm getting that feeling of like like well either your kids gonna be John

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:42.880
Connor or he's gonna be one of those skulls to put it in strictly terminator

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:53.200
two terms like just to use that movie as an example like like so what are the

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.760
odds that my kids gonna end pretty hot that my kid would be John Connor I

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.520
agree you don't have to say if anyone was gonna raise the hope of the of society

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.280
in Los Angeles like yeah I do think it would be me I do but I don't know if

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.400
he'd get the message in time like I don't know he'd be looking at me and go

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:17.840
and like so why are robots bad this guy seems to jerk off to laptops a lot

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:23.680
he's really loves playing Minecraft like why would my son I need to get my shit

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.680
together and have a baby so then I can teach him jujitsu and I just I have so

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:37.360
much Minecraft to play I guess my point is if I if I if I were to get so drunk

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:46.720
that I died before I had a baby you might have doomed us to a to a terrible

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.000
apocalypse no notice someone else I'll have John Connor it's 9-11 by the way

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.440
it took us a few years but we're cheering for 9-11

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:03.880
we just think that was gonna happen in the weeks following the tragedy plus

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.200
time yeah think about it with the six months of those buildings falling and

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.880
all those people dying thanks for bringing it back to that if somebody

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.440
said to you then Dan you and Jeff Davis are gonna be on stage doing a

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.720
podcast and when you point to a clock and say it's 9-11 the whole crowd will

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.880
cheer what year do you think that will be I don't know you're making me feel

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.560
like I'm I don't know it's like the joke is about the number having

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.280
significance it's like you're making you're bringing you're tying it to the

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:40.480
corpses in the rubble and I'm I'm out I'm not like it is it is terrible when

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:47.120
people die all the time it always will be but the number being important is

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.520
funny it's funny you know it's weird though and again I talked to Professor

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.120
Brian Cox and he says it's all just coincidence I've been looking at my

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:02.680
clock and all the time now it's 9 10 really yeah so maybe I'm going back in

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:09.160
time we did have a controversy wait what a controversy now I'm Helen Slater

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:14.100
what are you how drunk are you right now 1 to 10 I this is my well I have

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:20.080
filled it up a couple times when when the lines between political satire and my

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.680
ignorance were so blurred that life was a teardrop I I did I did fill this a

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.880
couple times but when you drink you can drink a lot of vodka and still be very

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:37.920
articulate thank you that that that's the problem like I I'm saying like in

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:44.440
Portland in New York those those towns are my those are my towns baby I I drank

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.080
a lot do you know and get it on with him yep I did it I did it all I did it all

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.440
like my definition of it all like I hung out a lot of bars and had a lot of fun

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.760
conversations with a lot of wonderful people New York is very friendly I don't

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.360
know that now it seems like that's the gimmick I think that's just Dinos New

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.120
York Dino knows how to take you through New York and it becomes like this

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.680
magical wonderful place where you're just walking into these creepy places and

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:16.920
everyone is so happy it's just New York I well I but I think I mean so maybe

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.880
you're like Dino and maybe I'm the odd man out but I like I was always so

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.880
intimidated by that city I always felt like it was so like hustle and bustle

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:30.200
and like like like like you're in the way and like you know it's all about

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:35.480
practicality so and more insectoid and like I just like now when I go there like

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:40.320
it's like it's like this honeycomb of dive bars and like everyone's just like

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.440
kind of like they don't they they know you're from out of town but they don't

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:51.200
care and they're like happy where did you go radio city musical they have they

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.400
have this like lounge in the they'll talk to you and there was a lady there

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:08.080
that kicks for a living and only at Christmas what a city why would they

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:18.840
attack that town I got to see you guys feel how I feel when you bring it to the

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:27.240
actual yeah so boo him you were you were booing him good

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:36.400
they were pulling you I just I was like I just like one little tiny little like

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:42.600
like little cinnamon hot apple from the apple pie of New York that is largely a

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:51.160
blurb it was so fun like sitting at a bar with Dino and and this guy like like

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.240
came out of the back room and he was wearing this like he was like eight

01:07:55.240 --> 01:08:02.320
feet tall and I guess if you if certainly I wouldn't describe him this way if he

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.960
were present but it seemed like it seemed like his head was too small for

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:12.760
his giant body like like like he kind of and he had like this like like sports

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:18.640
jersey on like a like a muscle shirt and like kind of like I don't know he just

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:23.960
had this big giant arms and this little tiny head and and he was just coming out

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.440
of the back room and he and he had this furrowed brow and was like looking for

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:33.160
his wallet as he's heading out of the bar and and Dino's in the middle of

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.600
talking to people and he goes like oh sorry everybody hold on the guy I paid

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:42.480
to beat the shit out of me is here and and we just all looked at the guy we

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.040
started laughing because it really looked like this guy was like job is to

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.920
beat you up and we're like yeah it's funny that doesn't look like you're

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.880
and he's like what what it looks like you looks like you beat people up for a

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:59.560
living he's like I do a professional boxer why does everybody react to me

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:04.480
that way and I'm like oh and he's like he sat down like let us buy you a drink

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:11.000
he's like I don't drink look at me but he had this like really thick accent and

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.560
was like he was it was just like he was he spent the five minutes because I was

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.240
like can I get you a power bar or what like it's like reverse bullying this guy

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.800
but like loving him and he's like but he's like no seriously it's like fucking

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:29.480
we are like I don't choose this you know like every year it's like my arms keep

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:36.320
getting bigger and we're just dying laughing because we're like because we're

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.400
dying and we're laughing this is like a young big strong guy who's like someone

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.520
get me out of this body

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:49.240
it's such a I don't I don't I don't see that happening in other cities you know

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:54.120
it's just like like I gotta go to the gym now people beat up more people it's

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:59.440
all I could do I feel like New York is really good like people make eye

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.480
constant like they flirt and bars and people talk to each other like people

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.360
like there's a lot more stranger interaction I've found and from people

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.520
I know that have lived though they say yeah that's that's very appealing and

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.960
that's great but like the relationships don't really they're very good at

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:18.600
short kind of superficial like like like short quick fix like relationships and

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.720
and hang out so you like there's a lot of that going on but like like dating is

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.480
very hard I hear out there and stuff like that it's very transient out there

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.480
because it's there's so much going on I don't know if that's true or not you but

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.600
maybe we have some New Yorkers here that agree or disagree yeah this is very

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.320
busy everybody's just very busy all the time and everything's just kind of moving

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.120
so it's hard to keep track of people or over a long period of time yeah people

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.480
also like exit they just exit the city at different points so you might be dating

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.000
somebody like you know what it's time for me to get out you've been part of a

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:56.080
sort of cutting I've been doing and now now it's time to heal up and go to

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:02.800
Oregon there was once I went back years years ago I went back for it was like

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.320
the last before Christmas the last showing of SNL there's a whole week where

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.200
we were all back and Josh Vadim was there and James Adamian might have been

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:15.480
there I think Derek Waters was there Jonah Ray was there all these people from

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.800
LA just happened to be in town at the same time and it was a Friday night where

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:22.640
we all agreed that we were gonna meet at one bar and then from there go to

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:28.080
another friend of mine the bar that was near a friend of mine in Brooklyn so we

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.120
set up this bar and a bunch of great stuff happened leading up to this so it

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.440
was already a good night and we get to this bar and it's sort of a yuppie bar

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:40.200
on Delancey Street and we're just hanging out and I'd been there before so I

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:49.640
thought it was a good hangout and right around 11 30 quarter to 12 people started

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.320
coming in and going downstairs in the same bar but these people were wrapped

01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:01.240
in vinyl one person was leading another person in on all fours and I remember

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.120
like at some point Fatem goes where they going gonna go oh there's another great

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.920
bar downstairs because I remembered in that moment oh yeah Friday night there's

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:12.440
a dungeon downstairs was it lit was it lit no I think it's it might even be

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:22.800
Delancey Street bar yeah the Delancey that's it so I said so I go Josh it's a

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.360
great bar downstairs you should go check it out and Josh went downstairs and then

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:34.320
didn't come back for like an hour and he came back he's like what was going on

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.120
just a museum of I had friends that told me years years ago a long time ago like

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.560
12 years ago 15 years ago to meet us at a bar in Hollywood that I don't think is

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.240
there anymore it's near where Bordner's is and it was like it's changed I think

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.360
it's next door to Bordner's it used to be like kind of like a leather club or I

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.120
don't know what now but it wasn't that was near that near that place and we go

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.320
meet us at this bar and we'll all meet up there and then we'll all go to sort of

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.840
thing and it's kind of like a like a like a sexy like SNME kind of themed bar

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:07.720
like fine so we go in there and it wasn't just SNM themed it was fucking on and

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:13.040
there was a there was a guy that I would say you know 30 year old 28 year old

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:18.000
guy on a saw horse like strapped down to like all the legs like like arms and

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.600
legs strapped down laying across totally naked and no eye protection and

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.760
there was a couple women like working on them with whips and like car batteries

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:36.440
and whatnot and then out of his out of his asshole was half of a very large

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:42.000
hammer well you can tell by the end of it is a claw hammer and but the size of

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.480
the head of the hammer and you and only about maybe five inches of it like out

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.200
like just there's eight or nine or ten inches of a hammer up that guy's butt wait

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.080
what do you okay hold on so you the important thing to me is that the head

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.640
of the hammer was that you were looking at okay because you were like it's a claw

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.160
hammer and you could tell from the club it was like what was in the I don't know

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.040
and you brought me around a place like okay so the handle of the hammers up his

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.360
ass okay fine so we sat there drinking and like this guy was getting to the

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.600
fucking full

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:29.040
people have a table five needs bread

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:34.280
clean clean up an aisle three how do you know when you're finished how do you

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:37.200
know when you're finished how do you know when you're finished yeah when you

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.960
have a hammer up your ass how do you know when you're finished like when does

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:48.960
that guy go got it that's it thank you ladies Tabitha Samantha at the same time

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:54.000
next week he walks out and they're like oh shit our hammer I mean either I'm

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.080
more hammers that way the fascinating thing about that stuff is a leg when

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:04.320
Dino when Dino has experiences there is a I think it's okay for me to say this

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.640
without drawing like either jeers or cocked eyebrows or anything because I

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.520
think that I've assumed that's what that 50 shades of great businesses are

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.720
increasing awareness that we are a little jealous of of people who are able

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.560
to have heightened like and and I think if you're a human being like like

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.280
heightened sexuality if that does involve like crazy shit that we would

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:32.280
look at as being way distant from prom night like that that that it's like

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.760
almost like well yeah cuz like wolves can do prom night like it's like I'm a

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.480
wolf and I haven't had sex yet the female wolves like me neither so here we go

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:46.840
okay we're done oh you got pregnant let's have more normal wolves like like

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:51.040
whereas there are some people out there that are like you know and the internet

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:55.040
has made them more able to do it through with control and safety and like like

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.960
well still like I don't know they just have this whole fucking like network and

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:05.680
crazy like there and I swear like like I it's not it's not gonna work for me I'm

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.800
going to migrate very happily like like like kissing Aaron and like sometimes

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.880
coming and like making a baby then like I'm gonna tell him do the same thing but

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:21.320
if he doesn't find like like like like but but like I do see the nobility like

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:26.760
or the I definitely don't look down on it what people are like like like the

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:32.520
Dino like he has adventures like he has like like he like he tells one person

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.680
this thing and then he tells that they make agreements like you're gonna meet

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.080
her in the hotel bar he lied to a dominatrix did he tell the story on the

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:44.720
show yeah he did I don't you know that's like the dishonesty thing but but I'm

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.960
talking about like the I'm talking about like the role-playing thing where it's

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:52.200
like you could agree in advance and you can go like like he did this thing in

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:58.000
New York where he had one person that he knew from from one part of the world and

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.680
another print and they were one was a Dom and one was a sub and he told them like

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.240
like he was explaining to me over drinks he's like here's what I did I told them I

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.480
gave him my hotel room keys and I told them you're gonna I'm gonna go to this

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.080
adult swim thing you guys are gonna meet in my hotel room they've never met

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.880
before you guys pow wow about whatever you want to do to me when I get back to

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:21.120
the room I don't know I don't know how you're gonna interact with each other or

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.880
what you're gonna do Dino is just like gonna go have dinner hang out and then

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.840
while I went to the up front and learned about marketing and demographics and

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.400
watched a Miley Cyrus performance Dino went back to his hotel room where two

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:42.880
women you know had agreed to do secret things to his body that were like he

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.640
didn't know if he was good when he was gonna walk in there if he was gonna be

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:51.080
attacked and told that he was a pig and tied up and blah blah blah or if he was

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.280
gonna walk in and one woman was gonna have the other woman's woven in a web

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:59.640
and hanging from like a lord of the rings cocoon you know like I'm going

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.440
like like she's in there but like he didn't know and so and then I and I

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.640
never I never asked him because they didn't really that that stuff I was

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.920
fascinated with like the preparatory period and then the next day I saw him

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.720
and it was like how'd it go he's like it was great like but he knew going into it

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.680
that it could have been a disaster that's the other weird thing is like the

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:24.760
acceptance of like part of our mythology of sex is like oh it's supposed to

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:32.240
always be good like like it's like dessert when like like actually it's

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:37.720
like an intermingling of the human like the animal you know and like it's like

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:43.560
that that that idea that search commercial idea that romance equals sex

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:50.040
equals always infatuated equals all that stuff that that could be responsible

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.920
for a very high divorce rate because you look across the table at breakfast at

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.800
this person that you haven't felt animalistic about in 10 years and why

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.880
should you out of respect to her feel that way and now all of a sudden because

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.840
you saw a stupid rom-com the other night you think that means you're not in love

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.280
with her which isn't true you know there just might need to be communication

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:17.400
about what makes your little wee wee dance around and what and maybe like what

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:21.840
what makes you little wee wee dance around and maybe what scares you what

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.800
you think might be a trick what make your little wee wee dance around what

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.800
kind of music make sure and what sort of dances as a foxtrot or a merengue my

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:36.040
final thesis is those guys are I'm sure there's a lot of douchebags among those

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:39.440
people but there I perceive them as existing on a slightly higher more

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.200
evolved level because I think that if we're all gonna survive in a world where

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.720
our kids are able to like look at the internet and like how do people raise

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:53.400
children like we're becoming like that this myth that like well when a man

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:57.360
likes a lady they go in the bedroom and then they she takes off her clothes he

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:04.600
loves what he sees when he drops his pants and she's like wow and then she

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:10.200
lays back and then he goes in there and he's just like root and they both love

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.960
it and like well you know we we used to think she didn't have to love it but now

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:20.440
we know as of the 70s if she loves it it increases the chance of conception because

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:25.720
her caramel glide his right into the egg and that's how sex it doesn't like

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:30.480
worst the people who are talking about like you know you should you should you

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:36.800
should dress like a leprechaun man I want you to dress like a leprechaun and I

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:43.280
don't I don't want to know when you're coming for my gold I'm just gonna keep

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.240
gold in my kitchen and I'm a and wear pants with it with the dick cut out and

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:53.920
like but take three days surprise shock me scare the shit out of me and be like

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:59.560
where's me gold and like and then fucking get on me and make my limp dick

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.800
hard like cuz I'll be like that's a leprechaun like make it hard make it

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:09.160
hard unless I say tequila let's be honest how many how many little

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:15.480
weebies are dancing around right now a couple polite shows of hands there like

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:20.200
I do a girl that her job she gets paid quite a quite a good deal of money

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.400
there's this billionaire that she works for apparently is quite good looking and

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:27.640
very successful and a nice guy and seems well adjusted but her job is to

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.720
humiliate him on like kind of grand grand scale and like she's also supposed

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.200
to like fuck him in the butt with a big strap on his stuff at the end of the

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:40.640
whole she's bang but before that happens she's supposed to do high concept

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.960
humiliation and so one of the ones that she did and he's like and like here's a

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:59.720
blank check like like like like like remake Star Wars and put my name on it

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:06.680
$85 million this is a this is terrible he's like I don't know I thought if the

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:19.760
robots were rounder I don't know all right well that was a goodie thanks so

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:27.240
much what a what an orgasm back to work tomorrow morning one of the what she did

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:31.840
he got off a plane and she had like a team of people as his cast of people and

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.240
he doesn't know what it is and he gets off the plane and it was a car waiting

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:39.800
for him and it's a his publicist is there it's all fake he's greeted by his

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.040
publicist his agent and he's going to he's going to a high-fashion photo shoot

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:50.240
and he goes to this office building and he's told that he has to go do it he's

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.000
a supermodel and this guy's not a supermodel and waiting in the waiting

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.080
room are the best-looking men in the world like like a super good-looking

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:02.800
guys and they're all going in there and he has to watch them do what he's about

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.240
to do and that's he has to get naked but then they dress him up like a little

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.720
like I forget what the costumes were but everybody there like everyone he met

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.280
that day all had to watch him do something and the whole thing was just

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:18.440
completely to like diminish him and to make him feel horrified and like take

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.280
his clothes off and dance around like I'm like dressed up as little boopeep I

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.880
don't know what the fuck it was but like she's like the hard part is like you

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:34.200
got to keep coming up with these fucking these easy parts fucking them in the

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:43.760
yeah I nice work if you can get it get it if you try I would never want that

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.000
job yeah but I admire I that's great like I because obviously the people who

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.480
do it successfully and get paid to do it they're there it's like we live in a

01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:01.000
world where you can't make a lawn toy without you know consumer advocacy

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:07.920
oversight like like and like we don't have a lot of fatalities and emotional

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.960
casualties of like the sex service industry and we know that it's a big

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.000
industry and so what we know is that even though it's mostly unregulated like

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.800
there's a lot of very responsible independent agents out there that threw

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:29.360
nothing but their primal understanding of this is part of a fantasy I paid Jeff

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.800
to help

01:24:31.800 --> 01:25:00.280
it's supposed to be my show stop dancing if I'm going like this and you go

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:10.680
like that yeah no I know what happens I'm explaining to them first syllable in

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:17.680
dancing is Dan to mark you've been quiet one thing you can touch on is like

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:25.440
the people here because in my experience with it I have a lot of friends who go

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.920
in to cross that line into that but they they don't they don't know that until

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.400
it happens it sort of happens accidentally to them and they have these

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.320
stories and they tell you yeah that they didn't know that they had that part I

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:40.520
had a friend who's a writer very accomplished writer who went to a party

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:46.320
once in Boston I think in a like a weird sort of loft party in Boston and was

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:49.800
milling about talking to people and wandered around to look at the place

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:57.200
and walked into a room all four walls of the room had murals of Lucille ball

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:02.440
painted on them and then the door shut behind him and there was was a woman in

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:10.200
there who was I think it was her place and she was a dominatrix and she said

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:13.880
who asked you to come into this room and then she said who told you to come in

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:20.840
this room and he said no nobody and then she put him in a rack pulled a rack

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.440
down from the ceiling and put him in he's telling me this story and I'm

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.200
listening he gets into this rack she straps him up in this thing and there's

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.080
no suspension in the middle so he's sort of his body is his hell but the middle

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:38.280
of his body is drawn down and it's discomforted and she raises him up to

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.000
the ceiling so that he can see all four murals basically at the same time and

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.560
there's all this pressure and she walks out of the room shuts the door locks it

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:53.560
and leaves she doesn't let him out until the morning and he comes down and he's

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.680
so this happened on like a Friday or Saturday this is Thursday when he's

01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.080
telling me this and I was like you realize that every point of that you had

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.600
to you could have outgunned her and walked around they got out of the room

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:13.360
you got into the rack and he just goes yes and there are other examples of

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.320
just friends of mine who've just said you're not gonna believe what happened

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.560
to me Thursday and then they told the story and it's just you know it's you

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:24.320
know these things sometimes people don't know and then they and they just have

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.160
it in them I think it it just is in them and they don't maybe go to it

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:33.160
regularly I think that's true because I I will lay myself bare as much as I can

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:39.040
here and say like I've never I've never done anything like that however at 42

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.040
what I have done is gone through a bunch of relationships where I was very much

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.760
in charge and then a couple where things got a little sketchy and a little hurt

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:54.680
a little hurtful where I got abraded a little bit and I like I don't I don't know

01:27:54.680 --> 01:28:00.440
if this makes me scarred or healthy or it's like is this what I was always into

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.960
because you always hear people talking about like like like Dino says like it's

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.120
not about the it's not about like a heart out of the moment it's not like it's

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.280
not it's like a whole this is whole experience and then you jerk off to it

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:17.960
later to quote Dino about this stuff like Dino so things like you do you do

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.480
you get off and he's like no never it's like it's all for for jerk enough for

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.080
the rest of your life thinking about that right and so and so then I think okay

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:28.480
you jerk off for the rest of your life thinking about that and then I think well

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.920
what have I jerked off to the rest of my life thinking about and some of those

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.760
things have been very emotionally painful like I think and I don't know if

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:42.040
it's like distancing you know pornography can be very can be very misogynistic

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:50.200
maybe once in a while male pornographers don't take the ladies feelings into

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:55.360
account there are there are there are lots of self self self-employed female

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.520
pornographers out there who are the heroes of the new information age

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.280
because of the first people to monetize the internet and their millionaires and

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:04.600
their they don't have pimps and they're not they don't exist in a world where

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:08.320
they're ruled and they're they're doing what they they like but pornography's

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:14.320
history does have a trace of misogyny to it and and I and I wonder how much of

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.960
that has to do with the fact that men are like these brutes who like we exert

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:26.480
all this control based on like this instinctive fear and need and then it's

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:32.560
like getting hurt getting getting like getting victimized getting taken advantage

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.400
of you know it's not like I don't I'm sorry are you saying that I'm saying

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.120
there are memories that you have that were sexual memories but that were still

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.840
hurtful I don't I'm sick no no no I'm saying that I have I have in the past

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:49.760
like throughout my life I've seen a pattern and I like where I like I will

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:56.480
masturbate thinking about ex-girlfriends that I do not like that like like you're

01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:02.960
cheating on me that's what I'm saying like like like like a cuckold like like like thing

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:08.640
like but I know from my life experience that I don't like that I don't want that

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:17.240
to happen to me but then so I don't know if when I'm like am I exhibiting a need

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:22.120
during masturbation to distance myself from what I'm thinking about so that it

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:27.320
can be animalistic appropriately that's how I've always parsed it it's like when

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.280
you're masturbating you don't want it to be you don't want to think about the

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:37.160
royal wedding I hope I hope in spite of her low-born upbringing that Princess

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:41.320
Dye is happy in this marriage and I hope he really makes love to her tonight I

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:45.800
you you you think about people being animals you know you think about the

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:50.360
taboo and so I don't know if that's just like a personal expression of that or

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:54.560
you just like like well look I want to this is this is about self-indulgence and

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:58.760
this is about like like part of that trigger is like things I'm not supposed

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.040
to be thinking about what if your ex-girlfriend was cheating on you with

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:09.920
Prince Charles she is and you're not supposed to say it we're all gonna die

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:17.200
tonight but courtesy of Her Majesty's somewhat untrained but still very

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:23.640
effectual Secret Service sorry what we're gonna say to Orange I just I mean

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:28.520
that kind of sexuality is targeted I think when you're when you're thinking

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:35.000
that way and it's psychologically it based if you subscribe to that but also

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.520
neurologically it's Olympic and that's and that system kind of acts on its own

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:44.200
it sort of bridges that gap between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:48.640
systems and so you can do targeted thinking you can find and it actually

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:53.400
does I think isolate the things that you're concerned the narrative aspects

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.680
of it but kind of pushes them out it edits them out and it just sort of is

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.760
the node is those things that trigger those dendrites and make those things

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:07.120
make all those things move I just like them big old titties what if you had

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.840
17 of them brought to you by Frito a brings it all around that's not no

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:16.960
that's not how the show ends you can't force it to add no you don't get to pick

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:22.800
the ending of the show I know you have school tomorrow we don't end before 10

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:36.200
ever I hate it I don't want to end the show I don't I want to bring out as a

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.840
Spencer replacement but not he's not gonna guide us through GND unless he

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:47.640
wants to but he probably won't my other assistant Steve Levy

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.720
what up Steve

01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:00.480
you can choose if you sit there or sit in the Spencer seat

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:10.560
hello my favorite thing about Steve is he's the opposite of Spencer is that

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:16.720
right yeah you're very clean shaven and very nervous not the Spencer's not

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:24.760
nervous I mean you and you care about me yeah I do yeah Spencer does as well

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:31.400
Spencer does not care about me if if I if Spencer and I were somehow locked

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:38.440
alone in a home and I died like like the dog would eat my face first the cat

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:46.000
third Spencer suck it I don't know about that he's a I'm just he doesn't he

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.560
doesn't he but I'm saying you're a compassionate what is the division of

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:53.520
labor between these two assistants like I will tell you so just one hunt and one

01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:00.680
gather so I used to I used to have Daniella who then she got pregnant she

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:05.480
raised her kid in the in the office and like I mean she I did my best to be a

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:10.880
part of this modern workplace where like we don't provide women with any kind of

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.360
like acknowledgement that that maternity is part as part of health care blah

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.960
blah blah points points ladies thank you

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:24.840
the but but I mean so I was you know there's a crib next to my desk and like

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:31.120
I didn't change the diapers but I took a lot of Instagrams of the baby everything

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:36.960
a modern boss should do but even still making making your employee bring the

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.120
baby to work not not maternity leave no she had maternity leave oh there you

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:46.800
okay that's that's that's that's not enough lately baby was of a certain age

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:50.400
it's child care I mean once you have a baby the child needs care we tell we

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:53.280
tell parents that they both have to work and then we but we also

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:58.320
simultaneously tell them like oh yeah you should definitely have kids like it's

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.720
and then when a mother has a baby it's like we act like they got the flu we're

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:06.120
like oh okay so go home for a while come back when you're better which means you

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:12.640
can hire a nanny it's and if you can't afford that I your 99% of everybody then

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:17.280
you're like what are you doing and so in our case the baby was like in a drawer

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:24.440
and I their faces are so smooth at that point like they make really great mouse

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:30.800
pads for the for the laser tracking ones not the old ball ones because they get

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:35.560
they're like pugs they have accumulated right this is wasn't why I wanted to

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:41.320
bring this up Daniela eventually had to leave by virtue of the call you know

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.200
it's like she was like you know I feel like I'm being a bad assistant and a bad

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:50.840
mother and obviously I'm gonna choose to be a good mother so she's Spencer filled

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:55.360
that first hole right well sometime along when when Spencer filled the first

01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:03.400
hole and you never forget that while she was a claw hammer while she was when

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.760
she got pregnant I started to feel guilty about making her go to Toys R Us to

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:13.440
buy video games like you answer the phones like like like do appointments and

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.440
all this stuff you're the clerical assistant like you know that's what you

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.160
do appointments because this is a big this is a big job like like full-time

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:26.840
job for old popular man right right lots of people I want to interview me and

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:34.440
it's true yeah vanity fair I'm sure or something so at that point brought

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:40.040
Spencer on because Spencer was the back room of the Apple Store and so okay so

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:44.480
Spencer's gonna slap he's gonna be like a bee assistant if I need to go if I

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:48.480
need video games he'll go get him if I need like a headphone you know he'll

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:53.280
slap if you need an eye-harmon fashion till he'll do that for you

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:58.160
hill like hell yeah he'll like he'll tell till fill the bar at home or like you

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.680
know like like the the schleppy personal assistant stuff and then the

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:07.160
business assistant that's the division I yeah I guess that's that's sort of how

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:12.180
it is but Spencer does a lot more he's been helping me a lot of in a lot of

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:19.560
ways fuck that guy well he does is go to Toys R Us no I wasn't I didn't mean it

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.000
sounds like I thought it sounded like both of you do a lot I wouldn't want to

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.040
schlep or fucking handle it I was just playing and Jeff boy I'm getting drunk

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:36.000
so when Daniela left and she helped me find like she her last act is one of

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.120
the greatest assistants in the world she took her baby out of the drawer

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:49.320
we find yes I said your baby and your gun and she put them on the table I took

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:55.040
them I don't know why I guess it's just part of like she's on suspension I guess

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.120
but Daniela if I catch her pursuing this case you're getting you're getting too

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.440
close to this baby I want you have this baby but and then and then we I

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.880
interviewed a bunch of candidates and one of them was Steve and that's that

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:14.720
Steve's role he's the new Daniela whereas Spencer is like just like kind of

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:20.920
like he's like he's a he's like a shoe he's a chauffeur he has to drive me

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:28.280
everywhere because I still don't have a car that's Spencer and then yes good does

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.320
he provide any bodyguard service he's big he's a big fella he's got that wolf

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:37.960
that wolf kick defense thing yeah I feel like Spencer adds I think I think if

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:42.000
you got attacked by any group of anything be they thugs or or wolves or

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.080
anything I think Spencer might just like tap into some weird reservoir of rage

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:52.960
really fucking hurt people I'm sure yeah I think between me and Spencer you know

01:38:52.960 --> 01:39:02.000
like if a very very small unarmed preteen girl

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:07.120
you're kind of like running Dangerfield and I forget the actress name Lou Bert

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:13.480
Young back to school all right anyway so Steve so so I just Spencer's not here

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.800
so I thought I'd bring you up and we'd get to know you and that's all good I'm

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.620
getting text Steve what's the names names some of the what's the most

01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:29.320
satisfying element of being a Harmon assistance oh so Aaron's actually also

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:35.920
maybe my I thought it was obvious that I don't I value Spencer a lot as Aaron's

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:40.320
like warning me that sounds like I don't think Spencer does anything I would say

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.720
I would say I would say to balance things out a little bit say something nice

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.400
about Spencer because you I mean the guy who couldn't bother to be here he's

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:59.480
amazing that's not fair and the next time he's here I'm gonna crush him

01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:05.960
Spencer if you're out there and I hope you are the show is called Harmon's

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:09.040

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.000
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna pressure you because you were having a difficult time

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.440

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:42.440
compliment he's I what he's he's he's my I see myself in him and I respect him

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.160
and even that's not a good enough compliment cuz you know that's a good

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.360
comment he's not like a mini me or anything like that like he's like I

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.120
just like you know I like him and I feel I feel very comfortable with him

01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.360
that's the thing when he comes and picks me up like I've talked about that

01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:01.000
before like I don't have like he and I are in the same wavelength or lack of it

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
like like like other other people like there's always that inevitable point

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:11.880
where it's like I'm fine with the fact that I haven't said that you're doing a

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:16.560
good job for the last four weeks but are you you know I warned you about that

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:23.520
when I interviewed you yeah but is Spencer's one of the most charming

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:27.880
genuine moral people I think I've ever met and that's just part of the allure

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:35.920
yeah like for example so here here so this might really embarrass Marissa I

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.400
hope it doesn't but but she when she was she was visiting she was she was here

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.440
for all this while she was getting her she was doing her post-productive thing

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:49.440
Marissa was a she she's the first person to ever do a blog about us she was

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.120
like she was the she's the number one absolute of course yeah yeah beyond

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.920
community fan she's like a she's like a she was like a Dan Harmon fan before

01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:03.520
that was a thing and like and as a delightful young lady and like like

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:09.560
really like like like smart and cool and balanced and and she came to our

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:13.760
wedding and like I mean she's she's like a friend she's not like she's more than

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:18.720
a fan she's like a friend and she she she was in LA like getting her degree in

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:24.040
post-production and I brought her over to community and we were hanging out we're

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.640
doing the stuff and like we're all like let's go let's go out and get a drink and

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.480
all this stuff and Marissa's like I gotta pack up my shit I got my truck full of

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:34.760
shit and all this stuff blah blah blah she like Marissa's coming to meet us at

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:40.120
this restaurant to have a drink and she was moving that day all their stuff was

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:43.920
packed in her car she gets in this terror well not terrible but like like like I

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:51.320
mean all it was a scary in a car accident like it was and she's freaking out

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.760
because she's young and like like like every anyone freaks out when they get a

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:58.760
car accident but your first one and you're out of town and your shit's in the

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:04.000
back seat and like you don't you're just you she was like she was really

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000
freaking out and Spencer and Steve ran over there and like Steve I didn't fucking

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.240
go I was like she was like a block from the restaurant and I was like Steve

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:22.120
Spencer they're like your angels to your Charlie tell her tell her I'll cover

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:26.400
cover the insurance bill whatever you know like I'll like throw money at shit

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:31.240
but I'm not like I don't have a heart I'm a horrible heartless villain and it's

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:35.480
not true and these guys ran over I thank you I'll you get a bonus for this

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:42.520
saying that the the but but anyways but that just talking about like Spencer's

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.360
like Spencer puts his money where his mouth is in terms of a personality

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:49.600
because like he Steve's account of it was like not only did Spencer go over

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:55.680
there and help out but actually like at every every accident scene there's like

01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.160
the very little flaw in our justice system where it's like two people collide

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.360
no one knows who fault it is like two civil servants show up that's traumatic

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.600
yeah two people are traumatized like two guys with badges and guns show up and

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.880
they basically are a judge jury like that's basically ends with them like

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.120
they have to get out of the car like make their decision Spencer was so like

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:23.160
they were so taken with Spencer that he's so he was so warm and like yeah it's

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:27.640
I'm pretty sure like we all have our qualities like like they're kind of our

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:32.520
lead qualities and also I think that we're all good people but I don't I don't

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:37.360
I don't know very many people thank you I don't know very many people that the

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:41.360
lead quality that would say about them I know some but Spencer is one of the

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:44.640
few people I know that I would the first quality I say he's good Spencer is a

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:49.320
good person and like not that we're not good people but he leads with good and

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:53.280
he's and you said it Steve that he's a moral person I think that he has an

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.280
intense moral compass which I think is very yeah he wants to do the right thing

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.560
and he thinks about that a lot he doesn't want to do the popular thing he

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:02.320
doesn't want to even do the thing I think I fall short of that where I'm like

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.560
what do most people think is the right thing I want to do that if they're

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.800
looking Spencer doesn't hesitate Spencer knows what's the right thing Spencer is

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:16.280
like he doesn't give the panhandlers but does jump out of his car to give to the

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:21.680
people that are going through recycling bins getting shit even though they might

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.160
tell him to go fuck himself because they didn't ask for anything but he's giving

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:28.680
them money because he's you know he's like puzzling through in his head like

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:33.080
how do you actually use your pocket change to like help society actually

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:38.040
that sounds kind of draconian and like and randish but but but but but I mean

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:42.160
he thinks about morality he thinks about being a good person and he and he

01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:47.200
also like yeah he like I could picture him like I would I would fucking like

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.120
that's why I didn't go over there I'm like there's gonna be hysterical people

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.600
getting out of cars pointing at each other and shrieking this is your fault

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:56.800
no it's your fault and there's gonna be two douchebag cops who like don't don't

01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:59.320
know what to do but they're gonna file their little report and all this shit's

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.720
gonna be handled by insurance companies and I don't want anything to do with

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:04.480
this shit just tell me who to write to check out to and I don't fucking care

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.400
Spencer went over there with his little cargo shorts and his flannel shirt

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.680
it's probably the reason why the cops were basically like you know it's probably

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.040
the other ladies fault because because she was screaming bloody murder and

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:19.480
Marissa was like traumatized and freaking out have this lady like

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:24.880
shrieking at her well not at her but like about her to the cops and and like

01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:29.840
but Spencer was just like I don't well you were there yeah yeah first thing I

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:35.920
saw was you know Marissa was noticeably upset and her car was totaled like it

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:40.720
was destroyed and Spencer like the first thing he did he walked over and he gave

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:44.680
her this big hug and he's like it's gonna be okay you know like we're gonna

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:49.840
whatever whatever happens like you know you're you're healthy and you know it's

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:58.240
a vehicle it's aluminum I don't know what is it aluminum steel aluminium yeah

01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:02.400
he's like you know you're everything's gonna be okay and she you know she's

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.200
just had all these things going through her head like you know how am I pay for

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:09.720
all this I gotta get a new car like it's always me that's the answer I'm gonna

01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:17.560
pay for it that's my morality and Spencer is centers like well one thing at

01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:20.440
a time you know like let's let's get through this whole process with the

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:24.640
police and I know this woman's like an insane person right now and she won't

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:29.440
even talk to you she wasn't she wouldn't even look at Marissa's face like Marissa

01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:35.360
would say like I'm you know I'm sorry trying to like talk to this woman so

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:39.160
they can like come to some kind of an agreement but she wouldn't even talk to

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:43.440
her it was really terrible but Spencer is there through the whole thing and the

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:47.700
cops showed up and if I ever got a car accident I would want somebody who's

01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:51.080
good at logic and maps to go well there's no way the car could have gone

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:55.880
there because the car cars only moves at this rate per second like but Spencer

01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.520
was like that so he examined before the cops even got there he examined the

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:03.720
damage of Marissa's car and the woman's car of course he did and and he and he

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:08.400
was like okay Marissa like well like like take me through it like what what

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.680
happened you know and so she was like you know this guy I was in the left most

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:16.760
lane and the guy it was we're at a red light and the guy waved me on because I

01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:21.400
had my blinker on to turn to get into the next lane and she so this guy was

01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.040
stopped and Marissa went into the next lane he you know he held up traffic for

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.960
her to move on and her car I guess like she you know she looked and she said

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:37.760
another blinker to move into the to the right most lane and this car just whizzed

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:43.880
up and just nailed her and so this Spencer looked at the damage and he goes

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:51.680
she was definitely speeding or texting like you know like you know he so you

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:56.840
know Spencer CSI yeah it's the kind of thing she was like you know I shouldn't

01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:02.200
have cut across two lanes but Spencer's like but for the amount of damage that

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:06.920
happened here she was doing something illicit like there's something wrong and

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:10.560
then the cops came and they Marissa was totally honest with them you know I cut

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:13.560
across three like two lanes or whatever it was and they're like yeah you should

01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:19.160
you shouldn't do that but at the same time they were like ma'am were you looking

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:25.000
at your phone were you texting no I was texting you know like just from Miami it

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.080
was legal there until last year you could like look at your phone or like text on

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.320
your phone just a crazy place don't go to Miami

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:37.880
well leavey but right so aside from noticing how awesome Spencer is yeah

01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:44.240
your your your talents include helping me edit like the last half of season 6 of

01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:47.880
community because I was fucking checked out this guy's awesome he doesn't have

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:52.080
anybody here to say what about Steve Levy that's why I wanted to bring him

01:50:52.080 --> 01:51:01.000
up yeah fuck Spencer that's what you're saying oh wait so it's not Dan I think

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.160
you told me that there are times when you were like like I'm I'm tired and you

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:09.480
let Steve take the wheel like you he took the helm sometimes absolutely why

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:14.280
don't want him to get blamed this season 6 season 6 sucks I don't get in trouble

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:18.160
with a guild or a union or something no no but I'm saying like I'm saying there

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:22.320
were times when I would have phoned it in and then like like like Steve had that

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:26.320
enthusiasm which is also like Chris McKenna before him and Ruthie Aslan the

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:31.280
editor like I am I am at the mercy of people who at the moment of my

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:35.840
exhaustion and the point where I'm reading the 700th tweet that's like you

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:40.160
know pushing me like out the door where I'm just like I don't know who cares it's

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:43.880
funny enough it's good enough for the there's always there's someone else that

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:52.240
goes like yeah but what if you did this and like like Ruthie and Steve and and

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:57.200
and and I mean it's just in the edit bay like like there at the end and our other

01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:05.920
editors in case they're listening JP and Billy and also the hairdresser but you

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:10.080
know it was awesome to have somebody because you I'm never gonna say to

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:14.720
somebody come to the edit bay with me you said hey I'm interested in that okay

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:20.680
good come in here and then you were like what if you did that instead and there's

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:24.840
like by the way I have never said this to you now that we're done there's a lot

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:28.600
of hazing that happens when that when you do that like the editors out of

01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:33.480
protection for the whole thing like they weren't they weren't too coy about like

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:40.040
oh no if you if you had been capable of being shamed into silence they would

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:43.680
have found that well at first I was I was terrified of saying anything but

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:48.160
they were like a couple bits in grifter where you're like I really wanted to

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:53.960
work this way but I don't know I like I can't I can't think I don't like right
