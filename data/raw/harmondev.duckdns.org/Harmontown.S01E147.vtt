{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:22.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, NerdMelt meter, Harmontown, now in session.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:39.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:45.000\nHello. Hello everybody. Hi. Hi, how are you? Let's get down to business.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:46.000\nHow you doing, Dan?\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:51.000\nI'm good. Sorry I brought the energy down with my hello. I don't know why I did that.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:54.000\nI just created it as a pregnant pause, pregnant with possibility.\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:03.000\nOh, impregnated by possibility, pregnant with potential.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:06.000\nNow you brought the mood down.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:11.000\nAll right, Jeff, let's run through my notes.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:15.000\nHey, okay, so are there any British people in the audience?\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:21.000\nAll right, wow.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:26.000\nSo what is with the word aluminum?\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:31.000\nBecause we, it's spelled, did we discover it?\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:35.000\nAnd then they heard about it but didn't see how it was spelled?\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:39.000\nI think they think they discovered it because Kate, my Scottish ex-girlfriend,\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:44.000\nshe was emphatic about aluminium and wouldn't hear otherwise.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.000\nThere's an eye that's not there.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:50.000\nIt's not like nuclear where we say it wrong.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:54.000\nYou know, I would definitely just assume that, you know, we're Americans\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:59.000\nand whoa, we do everything wrong but they're wrong about this.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:03.000\nAluminium, knock it off.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nAll right.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nHey, do you think dogs know how to share with each other?\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:10.000\nNo.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:13.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nI think dogs are a packed mentality.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:17.000\nThere's alpha, beta and so on.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:21.000\nAnd so the beta will always defer to the alpha of any group.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:22.000\nRight.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\nAnd so when there's owners there, because we have these sticks, these like pepperoni sticks\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nthat the dogs really like.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:29.000\nThey love them.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:33.000\nBut Harvey, the big one, he eats, he tries to eat them slow\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:36.000\nand you can see him watching Nigel, the little tiny one.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nAnd like Nigel just puts it between his paws and does that little thing\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nor he's just like nibbling at the end and he just loves licking and nibbling it\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nwith his little needle teeth.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:50.000\nAnd Harvey just sits across the room and watches him while he like chomps it\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nlike a candy bar.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:55.000\nIt's like gone in three bites but he wishes it wasn't and he just stares at Nigel\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nand then he starts doing laps.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:01.000\nBut he's like, he's got one eye on Nigel and one eye on me all the time.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:05.000\nLike, because I think that means that he know, I think if I walked out of the room\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.000\nhe'd steal the other dogs thing.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:10.000\nLet me look at Rents of the Litter.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:13.000\nThe puppies won't share the teats.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:17.000\nOne puppy is going to be the, you know, get no milk and be a little runt.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nRight, but dogs have to get socialized into the rule.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nI mean, yeah, puppies certainly don't share.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:25.000\nOf course, they're like little blind larvae that are just looking for...\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nThey probably don't even know they're not sharing.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nThey probably think they are.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:33.000\nThe mother is just...\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.000\nI guess I disagree with you about the guys we found out.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nBut the mothers don't even like try to distribute evenly.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:45.000\nThey just lay there and say, first come, first serve, baby.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nYeah, what do you do?\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\nDo the mother dogs, do they go like, alright, come on, this guy doesn't do as much.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\nNo, they lay there and just go, Jesus Christ, I got 17 people sucking on my tits right now.\n\n03:55.000 --> 04:06.000\nHow would you feel, Dan?\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:09.000\nDo you think that feels good?\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nBecause I just thought that would feel good.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:20.000\nWhen you said that, I was like, well, that would feel 17 times as good as when you get a little nipple play.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:23.000\nMy nipples are extremely sensitive. I don't like a whole lot of nipple play.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nYeah, we've been over this.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nYou said you're not a nipple guy.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nI just don't need a whole lot of it.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nWell, that's the beauty of nipples. That's the point.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nI mean, I don't really need any of it.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nAlright.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nOr back to alienation.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nI thought maybe there was a misunderstanding.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nNo, you know they're supposed to be sensitive.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nThat's the selling point.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nI think mine are more sensitive than people that enjoy it.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nBecause it's like, hey, it's really like it's a lot. It's an overload.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nAlright.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:00.000\nSo, a pop culture corner.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.000\nAlright.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nI don't know what that other stuff was.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:11.000\nSometimes a society's made out of things that aren't art or education.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:16.000\nOr war. We call them pop culture.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:19.000\nWhere'd you get that?\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:28.000\nThat is our friend Kevin McLeod who gave us a family slide.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nFrom the clan McLeod.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nHoly ground.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nI'm choosing for some ass.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nI got something to say.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nIt's better to burn out than fade away.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nIt's Highlander.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nOkay, so there's a hot hamburger.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nThat's it. It's been in the news for ages.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nIf you don't know, you're not hip.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nThere's a hot hamburger.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nThey got Jake Gyllenhaal playing the hamburger now.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nYeah, Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:02.000\nHey, have you seen that movie Nightcrawler?\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nIs that Jake Gyllenhaal?\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:07.000\nOkay, good. I always get them confused with the other guy.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nWho's the other guy?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:12.000\nMartin Luther King.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:17.000\nYes, I'm sure they're sick of seeing each other in casting sessions.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:26.000\nI have a nightmare that Jake's out for this part too.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:31.000\nThat was my Martin Luther King impression.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nI'd like some toast.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:39.000\nIt's a very sensitive, very cautious Martin Luther King impression.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.000\nHello.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:50.000\nDo you know the way to the library so I can continue to be a very smart person?\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:55.000\nMy name's Martin Luther King.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nI was murdered.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nOh my God, a ghost! A ghost!\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nYeah, I'm here. It's me.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:07.000\nI'm a ghost.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nOoh!\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nI don't know what... I'm on a weird...\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nAre you a viewer?\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:19.000\nDr. King, what's your favorite thing to go hunting now that you're a ghost?\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:26.000\nWell, you know, as you know...\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nI don't want to do the whole dream thing.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nLike Freddy Krueger, you know?\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:38.000\nYou know, every time you have a dream and then I'm there and it's like, this is my dream.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:44.000\nBecause I feel like fun's fun, but it undercuts my larger message.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:49.000\nI don't want to turn the importance of my life into a bit in death,\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\neven though I will be dead far longer than I was alive.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nAnd that is something you should be warned about.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nIt's going to get boring.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:04.000\nEnjoy it and stop being racist. I don't know how many times I have to say it.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nIt's a waste of your life.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nIs there racism in the afterlife?\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:14.000\nThere are racist ghosts. There are people who died racist.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nAnd so they can't get not racist.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nThey're just walking around going, look at all these black people.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:24.000\nAnd they're upset. And that's what they deserve.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nBecause they can't do anything about it.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:33.000\nThey can't integrate with non-corporeal hands.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:38.000\nYou can't separate people when your body is a vapor.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nThey deserve it.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:43.000\nAnd I was not famous for being a judgemental person in my life.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nBut I think they deserve it.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:51.000\nWhen I died, I had two immediate thoughts.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:56.000\nOne was like, why the fuck am I not in heaven? This is insane.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:59.000\nWhy am I a ghost? Me.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nAnd then my second thought was like...\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nIf you're a ghost, it's neither heaven nor hell.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nThat's purgatory kind of style or what? Is that the deal?\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:15.000\nWell, I ain't seen no harps.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:20.000\nI ain't seen no harps. Someone just repeated it in the audience.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnyways, look, I was never going to make an exciting ghost.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nThat's the fact.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:30.000\nWho's your role model ghost? Who's your favorite most entertaining ghost?\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nI'm glad you asked. Come on out. Come on out, Napoleon.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nSuck my boo! Suck my boo!\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.000\nSuck my boo! Suck my boo!\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nI didn't think of it the first time.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:45.000\nI said boo and then I was like, oh fuck boo boo!\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:50.000\nNapoleon, wait, hang on. You just came up with Suck my boo just now in front of us?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:53.000\nYeah, yeah, we will!\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nI'm constantly inventing and experimenting.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nYou've been dead for like almost 200 years.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nWee!\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nThere's a thousand things to do when you die. You float around.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:07.000\nYou look at the people. Suck my boo!\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nI just now got to LA. I never knew about it.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:17.000\nOh, I'm a Napoleon ghost.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nNapoleon, are you okay?\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:26.000\nYeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I got ghost pneumonia.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nBut you can't die from ghost pneumonia, can you?\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:32.000\nNo, that's why it's so bad. You just keep coughing.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nYou can't get rid of it. There's no ghost medicine.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:39.000\nWhy do I sound like Cheech Marin?\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:43.000\nYou sound like Cheech Marin who might have lived in Frankfurt for a while.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:47.000\nDave's not here, man!\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:52.000\nAlright, so anyways. Yeah, that was Pop Culture Corner.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:55.000\nYeah, you guys like segments, right?\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nI'm just staring at my phone. There's not a lot on here.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:02.000\nLook, I just wanted to, you know, I think we have some entertaining guests.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:06.000\nBut we do have to, as I tweeted, we don't have Spencer tonight.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.000\nBut we're going to make the best of it, you know?\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nYeah.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:16.000\nA general malaise is falling out of the crack.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:19.000\nMaybe the ghost of Spencer will come by.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nWell, I don't mean that he died.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:28.000\nI mean, the ghost of his presence. The ghost of his enthusiasm.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:33.000\nWhich I do think died around episode three.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:39.000\nI would believe that his enthusiasm is a ghost walking around somewhere.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:48.000\nAlright, so, okay, so, well, I don't know how to bring things down, but, like, so, like, alright, dog sharing.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nAlright, so, well, they got that, they got that new Uber program.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:57.000\nThey keep adding the things. It keeps getting, there's like more and more things in the bottom of Uber.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:04.000\nAnd now the thing on the left most is Uber Pool, where you can, like, pool with Uber people.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:09.000\nAnd then Aaron was like, I don't think I'd ever do that.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:18.000\nShe's like, well, wait, I'd do that before I'd take a regular Uber because of all the, you know, harassment and creepy creepiness that goes on in your average Uber.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:26.000\nAnd I was wondering if that was their point. Like, maybe Uber Pool is them, like, because they can't say Uber chaperone.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:32.000\nLike, maybe they really are like, hey, for the ladies, well, there'll be another person there.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nAlright, so...\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:40.000\nAren't you just doubling or tripling down on more guys getting in the car with your wife and saying like, hey, who are you guys doing later on?\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:44.000\nWell, I guess that's what, that was my thought, was like, how likely is it, how does this pool thing work?\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:52.000\nI was wondering if maybe that's like a, maybe it's a fake thing, where the third person is always just a licensed social worker or something.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nA federal marshal, yeah.\n\n12:53.000 --> 13:01.000\nAnd they're just like, they just clear their throat a lot whenever the driver's like, should I take a left up here?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nNo, no, take a right. Oh, sweetie, you don't know anything.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:08.000\nYes, okay, left end.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:15.000\nYeah, anyways, so, okay, so do you think Curtis Armstrong is mad at us?\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nNo, why? What happened?\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:25.000\nI don't know. He said he was going, because I'm always drunk during the show and I don't know if like...\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:29.000\nDid anything happen at the end of the last show he was on?\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nNo, not at all.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:31.000\nOkay, just making sure.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nWe professed our love to him, he accepted that love.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nI was at the top of the show and then I was like, okay, now the other shoe is going to drop.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nAnd then usually the show ends in a blackout for me.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nLike, I don't really, I kind of have to listen to the end of the show.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:49.000\nThat's why our role-playing games are so bad. Like, by the end of the show, I'm a little gone.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:52.000\nSo, like, I can't, it's a little bit of a fog, you know?\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:58.000\nAnd I was, I remember talking about boxers and, you know, we touched on, I don't know.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:05.000\nI couldn't remember, like, because, well, he just, he hasn't responded to my direct tweets,\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nwhich is how we usually communicate.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:12.000\nAnd I just, I've just been really paranoid about Curtis being upset.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nWhat are you raising?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nHe says he's going to England.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nHe says he's going to England, yeah.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nBut, I mean, yeah, Twitter there.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nYeah, he's with his daughter.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:24.000\nThey don't have, they don't have the word aluminum there, but they have Twitter.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nAll right, fine, he's like spending time with his daughter.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nHe doesn't check his tweets.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:31.000\nFine. Good.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:35.000\nI'm not, I'm not going to be worried about it.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nI think you're fine. I think you're fine.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nAll right.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nI think he's very happy here.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:43.000\nAnd I think there was a, if there was anything, there was maybe a moment of sincerity where\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nwe all agreed that we all like each other.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd then we talked about how long it took for us to hang out and then it took for ages\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:53.000\nfor us to actually hang out as friends and not like meet at a party or whatever.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nYeah, that was at the beginning.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nBy the end of the show, though, it was like, we were talking about boxing and I was like,\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nwell, it'd be great if McDonald's black people, blah, blah, blah.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:04.000\nAnd I just don't know if I like, if that bulldozer had any casualties, you know, if anybody.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:05.000\nI don't think so.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:06.000\nI mean, ask them.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:10.000\nJustin just brought your mail.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nDo you get paid to do the show?\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:21.000\nIs that, is that your check?\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:25.000\nCis boom bah.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:35.000\nCis boom bah.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nWhat is the sound of a sheep exploding?\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nI'm stealing from Johnny Carson, everybody.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nJohnny Carson.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:46.000\nNo, no, I have a note about our guest tonight and what his, if we play Shadowrun, what his\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\ncharacter will be.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nOh, I see.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nOkay.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nWell, I actually, we should bring up our first guest.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\nI'm kind of excited because we haven't, I don't think we've ever, we haven't really\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nhad a lot of, is he, is he back there?\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nWhat's that?\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nYes.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nHe's back there, right?\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:01.000\nOkay.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:06.000\nBecause we, we never, we've never done the political thing, like in the sense of like,\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:10.000\nlike we've never had anybody come on the show to actually help, help them politically.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:15.000\nLike this is kind of an exciting thing, like to have a show, you know, like the Daily Show\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nor something like that, where people announced their candidacy.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:20.000\nWell, I mean, now it's, it's, it's, it's presidential election season.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nRight.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nAnd we've become a very important show.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:27.000\nYeah, but what, but I, I, I truly hope, Dan, that we're not gonna, like no one's gonna come\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\non the show and use that to stump for their, for their own political game.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:34.000\nI think that any candidate that was gonna come on the show would be doing so because\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:40.000\nthey had decided that this, this demographic is savvy and young and critical thinkers and,\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nyou know, it's skeptical and that their votes matter the most.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nAnd what is sure to be a very important election.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nI mean, you guys know how I feel about politics.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:54.000\nI didn't, I didn't, when I heard this guy was coming on the show, I didn't at all have\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:59.000\nto say, wait, who's that and have DeMorge explain it to me.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:04.000\nIt's, you, you, you, you, well, there's a, it's a, he's a, he's a Republican candidate\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:09.000\nand he's, he's, he's been in the news a lot lately.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:14.000\nHe's a little controversial, but, but he's, he's, I have no, I don't know anything about\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:19.000\nhim and, but I know you guys have heard all about him and you're always tweeting about\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nhim.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nLet's welcome Bernie Sanders.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nSenator Bernie Sanders.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nWow.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:30.000\nWow, wait.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:35.000\nSenator, pleasure to meet you, Senator.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:40.000\nYou can just grab any mic you want to sit anywhere you feel comfortable.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nI assume the mics were rigged with union workers.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:46.000\nThat's good to know.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nI should clarify the introduction.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nI'm not a Republican.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nOh.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:53.000\nI'm an avowed socialist.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nI'm the only independent senator from the state of Vermont in the United States Senate,\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:01.000\nbut I'm running for president as a Democrat because, well, I like to change things up.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nI got, I got my information wrong from DeMorge.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nI thought you were like the new Herman Cain.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nLook, you get your information wrong like the American people get inaccurate information\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:14.000\nfrom the mainstream media, which is controlled by five corporations.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nIt's the same situation.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:22.000\nWhat we're fighting against is the top 1% that controls more than the bottom 60% combined.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:29.000\nAnd if you look at the numbers closer, it's the top 10% of the top 12% of the top 1.1%\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:32.000\nyear on year labor adjusted statistics.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nYeah.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:42.000\nThat has more growth than a lot of, a lot of, a lot of further statistics further down the line.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nI can't argue with that.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:50.000\nSo, well, I mean, I mean, we've all seen those charts and stuff about wealth distribution.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:53.000\nWhat do you say to the people that say like,\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:59.000\nDid you know that over two thirds of charts that are used to illustrate economic data contains\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:08.000\nmore blue and red graph sections than the 99% of the working class 40% that operates somewhere\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:14.000\nwith between the chocolate and vanilla layers of the middle class cake?\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:22.000\nSenator Sanders, do you feel that a lot of people think that you might be drawing votes away from Hillary?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nSure.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:30.000\nNo, I don't think there's any danger of that and everybody working on my campaign is well aware.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nIs there any truth?\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:36.000\nI never want to be a gotcha question kind of interviewer.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nThat's fine.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nMy life is an open book specifically.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:49.000\nIt's a 20,000 page printout of the Bureau of Labor Statistics report for the fiscal year 2014 to 2015.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\nAnd it's all dot matrix too.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:51.000\nIt's all dot matrix printer.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:54.000\nWell, yes, because I believe in fiscal accountability.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:58.000\nSo I print on very cheap paper, which is still a dot matrix printer.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:06.000\nIf I need further copies, I use a mimeograph machine because I'm from the 1970s.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:19.000\nSenator Sanders, is there any truth to the allegations that your hair is actually a sideways wig?\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:25.000\nLook, I hope we delve into some hard numbers after this because I think this is a distraction from the issues.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.000\nBut since it's brought up, I will address it for the people.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:44.000\nMy hair is harvested on a monthly to bi-monthly basis to provide cotton candy for younger Americans who come from a socio-economic background where they could not afford cotton candy.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:54.000\nAnd as you know, the summer months are approaching, so I've donated recently my real hair as cotton candy to some lower income children in Vermont.\n\n20:54.000 --> 21:10.000\nAnd yes, I do replace it with two wigs that I'll lower it onto my head by union labor, like Darth Vader, in the rotunda of the Capitol building.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:18.000\nI think both DeMorge and I, in the green room when we heard your name, thought you were that black guy, that crazy doctor guy?\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:21.000\nLook, I don't agree with them on the issues, but I respect them.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nBernie, the other one.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nLook, I think I compare very well.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nBen Carson?\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:33.000\nI'm so relieved that DeMorge also had no clue.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nI'm way out of the loop here.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nLook, wishful thinking.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:41.000\nLook, I'm a presidential candidate that everyone agrees with on everything, but no one will vote for me.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nI think you sound like you're singing my tune, for sure.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:55.000\nIf one-third of the two-thirds who support my positions were to vote for me, that would be one-sixth of the population that would vote for me, and we wouldn't win the election either.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nOh, okay.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nSo you think it would be difficult?\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nYou don't think you're going to win?\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:03.000\nLook, I don't think I'm here to talk about winning and losing.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:08.000\nI think that's the problem with American capitalism, that we've been obsessed too much with the losers.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:21.000\nAnd that's how the middle $40 billion in the federal budget goes to the top 1% of the top 2% of the top, let's say, 17% of the country.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:26.000\nIs this just kind of a thinly veiled ploy, this bid for the presidency?\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:29.000\nAre you aiming to maybe settle in at Vice President?\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:37.000\nLook, I don't have any aspirations further than maybe a nice walk, maybe a nice cup of warm chocolate from time to time.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:40.000\nMr. Sanders, is there any truth?\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nHold on a second.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nLet me finish the question, Mr. Sanders.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:48.000\nIf provoked, I will, filibuster.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nLet me finish the question.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:57.000\nIs there or is there not any truth to the allegation that you are wearing my mom's glasses?\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:07.000\nThat's a reasonable question because what I am doing is wearing glasses that are of the model that is widely available to librarians and mothers across this country\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:13.000\nwho have to work in humiliating conditions as public workers in the education and library systems.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:22.000\nAnd so in solidarity, I wear the glasses that are the minimally covered glasses that you have to wear if you have public health care in these professions.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:28.000\nLook, see, we're resonating with people who will not vote for me, but we're resonating with them.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:33.000\nThey don't even correct my vision to the right degree.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:40.000\nI wear them merely to be in solidarity with the hardest working people of this country.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:46.000\nI've been very impressed by you, what little I know about you.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:50.000\nYou've been very strongly in support of women's rights and equal pay.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:57.000\nI feel like that would be the most appealing thing for me as a voter is that you actually stand up for the women.\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nLook, women are 50% of the population.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:04.000\nHow many percent is 50%?\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:17.000\nLook, the bottom 40% of all 50% is equal to the top 12% of the middle, I don't know, Avogadro's number.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:26.000\nI feel like I really have this urge to bring Barack Obama out here and have you guys have like a little debate.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:30.000\nLook, I would be happy to go toe-to-toe with the President of the United States.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nLet's bring him up. Let's bring him up, Barack Obama.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nIs he here? Is he here?\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:40.000\nI think he might be taking a shit.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:45.000\nOh, okay, he's here.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:49.000\nMr. President, Mr. President.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:52.000\nMr. Obama, sorry about that.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:56.000\nMr. President, how was your shit?\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:59.000\nIt was a bit brief.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nNow in the green room, Mr.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:04.000\nCertainly it was instantaneous.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:21.000\nIf elected president, my shits will all be short in duration with minimal about spent out of the federal budget on cleaning up the smell of the room afterwards.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:26.000\nThese are your salad days.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:29.000\nYou can say things like that.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nAnd you can mean.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nI'm sorry, did you say salad days?\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nYes.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:36.000\nDo you need anything as exotic as salad?\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:39.000\nMy diet consists of oatmeal mostly.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nOkay, an occasional porridge.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:46.000\nAnd if it's a celebration, I get some raisins.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nIsn't that a bit extravagant, Mr. Sanders?\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:56.000\nLook, a box of raisins in 1970 contained over 40 grapes that had been shrunk down to an edible raisin size.\n\n25:56.000 --> 26:11.000\nToday, over 40 years later, that same box of raisins contains over 20% less grapes from farm to plate because of Monsanto and genetically modified organisms,\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:22.000\nwhich I will fight to stop in the impossible scenario where I occupy the White House for even two or three weeks before the Pentagon calls a coup d'état.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:29.000\nBecause I am simply unacceptable to anyone with power to be in the office.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:36.000\nBut you are also implying that also likewise, you don't think people will vote for you, although all the powerless people, you know what I'm saying?\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:43.000\nOf course, the grandpas of the world don't want you anywhere near the throne, but you think the voters of the world are also a little jaded.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nWell, that's what I'm running for.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nI'm running for the young people, the people out there who are burdened.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:51.000\nNow, I'm entering a pandering section.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nYou see, here's the thing.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nSure.\n\n26:55.000 --> 27:00.000\nWait, hold on. Let me know my bloody tunes of stopping sound.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:06.000\nGo ahead.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nYou can talk a fair game right now.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nSure.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:18.000\nWhen you get into the room, the oval room, there's a red phone.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:21.000\nThe red phone might ring. It might be the middle of the night.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:25.000\nThat's no concern to me. I'm color-blind.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:40.000\nI'll treat every phone of every color with the same respect that I would treat an average gray phone operating year on year on original AT&T payphone-wise.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nOkay.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:47.000\nMr. Obama, if I might, Mr. President, I might say, I think, look, I respect you as a person.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:53.000\nAnd as an antagonist over a nice game of mahjong.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:58.000\nAnd don't forget, Mr. Sanders, Senator, I guess you're a Senator.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.000\nI thought you were a doctor because I thought you were a completely different human being.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\nYou could use his support. I mean, you're not even running against him.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nLike, this might be a good time to...\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:13.000\nLook, I would, but I'm not accepting support from any corporations or any human being that's made up specifically of corporations.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:23.000\nWhich includes Mr. Obama, and as much as I respect you as a person, I think that you, as a labor organizer, did more good for this country than you have occupied the White House.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:39.000\nLook, the cadence and the volume was there for the crowd to agree, but still to this day, not even in the waiting days of a presidency that could only be argued as a failure, people are still on his side, comedically, room by room.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nI think this country...\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nI would argue that these days are not waiting.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:48.000\nI think this country is ready for a socialist Jewish president. I think that would be an awesome change of pace.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:55.000\nLook, I don't think there's a problem with that, but look, I think, look, if people worry that that's unpopular socialist Jewish, don't worry.\n\n28:55.000 --> 29:02.000\nI'm also an atheist, and I used to...\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:07.000\nLook, I have a very popular time everywhere I go.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:12.000\nI get thanked. I don't think we need to dwell on that any further.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:27.000\nI think, look, the bottom 40% of the top 60% of the 11% who've even heard of me have 50-50 opinions on whether I look good on C-SPAN.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:32.000\nSenator Sanders, what flavor is your cotton candy here?\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:40.000\nLook, it's traditional sugar flavored, and this was the result of a freak accident when I was a young man.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:53.000\nI saw The Grateful Dead at Brandeis University, and there was some very strong lysergic acid that I sampled at the time,\n\n29:53.000 --> 30:04.000\nand it all took me, not unlike Peter Parker, sort of superhero, except that my hair turned into cotton candy because it was an outdoor event,\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:13.000\nand that's what we were eating, and there was sweetness along with LSD, and so it's a debilitating, it's a gift and a curse, you might say.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:20.000\nWhen your hair tastes so good, when you're doing a speech, a 17-hour speech, like I do on a Tuesday, just when I feel like it,\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:29.000\nit's a humiliating when another senator like John McCain gets up after you and just sort of licks your hair and grabs it and licks it like a goat.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:35.000\nThat's humiliating, and as president, I would only allow that on Sundays and certain holidays.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:46.000\nThank you. I'm a little intimidated. This is the largest crowd I've performed for. We've been doing fundraisers throughout Southern California.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:50.000\nI think you've found your people. We've got about 40 bucks out of it.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:56.000\nI'm sad about how jaded and cynical and kind of disheartened you've already become, and I just met you.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nDo you know there are guys like you out there?\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:06.000\nI'm the picture of optimism, but I don't believe in irrational optimism. People say you either think the glass is half full or half empty.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:17.000\nI believe that the glass can increase year on year with targeted investments in certain sectors, that the share of the glass for the bottom 40%\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:27.000\ncan be equal to what the share of the glass for the top 10% is using real dollars inflation adjusted back to the original statistics used to the Great Depression.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:34.000\nAnd if that's not a ringing endorsement of the potential of the American people, I don't know what is.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:42.000\nI guess some people just want to hear, you know, we're going to kick butt overseas and we don't have to be afraid.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:53.000\nLook, I'm not a jingoist in favor of laws that are necessary. If there's any butts that's going to be kicked, they're going to be voluntary butts.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:58.000\nYou mean people that want us to go to war with them?\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:08.000\nLook, if I think that kicking butt should be like abortion, I think it should be safe, legal and rare.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:13.000\nAnd I think it should involve consenting adults, whatever possible.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:23.000\nAs far as foreign policy, I don't believe we should have one. I think that we should pull all our military forces back and replace it with some brownies that we maybe\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:31.000\nhave a big sale of some kind in an international scale, which has never been tried anywhere except Norway and look at them.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:35.000\nAll right, well, I mean, I've never...\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:39.000\nAnd I am a fan, by the way. I'm a fan of the show, the community show.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nOh, you like it, the old community?\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:51.000\nYes, I think it's a fantastic look at what we need to be doing for American young people who are in the education system and the burden of student loans that they have to face.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:54.000\nYeah, you don't mean moving to...\n\n32:54.000 --> 33:06.000\nThe top 12% of the middle 6% of the 17, 5% of the, let's say, APR of 11.7% is equal to all graded there.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:11.000\nNow, this is an algebra problem. I don't even know the answer to this. I'm just posing it to the people.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:25.000\nGiven X, what is Y? Carry the one, but the problem is the middle class no longer can't carry the one because the two burden carrying the two and the five.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:28.000\nAll right, Senator Bernie Sanders, everybody.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nThank you, Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:31.000\nThank you for coming out.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:32.000\nThank you.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nSorry, Mr. Obama.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:43.000\nIf you want any more, you can go to my website, BernieSanders.org forward slash, why not, Bernie?\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:46.000\nBernie Sanders. Thank you, Senator.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:52.000\nI didn't, like, Jim Orange, will you stay please?\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:53.000\nWhat?\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:59.000\nCan someone call me an Uber, please?\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nWhat happened?\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:06.000\nHe and I were talking last week about Herman Cain and Ben Carson.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:10.000\nAnd so when I heard Bernie, I immediately switched to Ben Carson instead of giving you a whole Ben Carson.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:15.000\nBecause it just, it is in Adomian's wheelhouse to come in as Ben Carson.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:19.000\nThat was James Adomian, everybody. James Adomian.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:23.000\nIt is well in his wheelhouse.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:27.000\nWe've never had someone come out and just do a dedicated one-off character like that.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:30.000\nNo, yeah. I don't know if that's, I don't know if that's what he wanted to do.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:35.000\nYou think you could get Bernie Sanders to come out and play Shadowrun with us?\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:38.000\nOr would there be too much percentage points in APRs?\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nYou could get him to do a lot of that.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:53.000\nFor example, when I was going on my Ben Carson, Herman Cain run, he, for about an hour straight, was just doing Pat Buchanan to a room of kids who had no idea what the fuck I was doing.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:59.000\nSo much so that afterward I was doing amazing Pat Buchanan impressions to people because I was just copying him.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nWe've had him on before.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:14.000\nAaron and I have talked about how we like his impressions come from a different school of thought spiritually kind of than the rich littles where you just figure out how someone talks and then you kind of repeat.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:25.000\nI don't know. He always sympathize with the people that he's mocking.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:31.000\nLike he makes you like them. Like they're underdogs and they're the heroes of their own stories.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:36.000\nYeah, we're fighting position. A thief never knows he's a thief. He always thinks he's doing good work.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:44.000\nYeah. And I love that I can just be at a party and like I just say, hey, Marc Maron, is it okay if I have these chips and then he does Marc Maron?\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nOr Eddie Pepitone.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:50.000\nI've got it. My wife is in a vat of blue water.\n\n35:50.000 --> 36:01.000\nHe does the most amazing Eddie Pepitone. Two Pepitone. There are Pepitone shows where he'll heckle him as Pepitone.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:15.000\nOne of these days maybe not to be presumptuous, but the most flattering thing in the world would be to have him heckle you as you.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nI'm sure the wheels have already started.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:20.000\nThat's a human impression. The man does nuts though.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:27.000\nYou know who did a good one at one point was Abed Gheith, a real Abed. He did a pretty good, good Dan Harmon.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:35.000\nHe physically becomes everybody, but he can't do the impressions necessarily, but he can physically become and do the mannerisms of everybody. It's very shocking.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:41.000\nAbed, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's kind of how I got to know him. He was at a party and everyone was gathered around in a circle.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:49.000\nEveryone was shouting names that this guy was contorting with each name and was on overload.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:55.000\nLooking back on it, that may be how we broke him.\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nHe was already there.\n\n36:57.000 --> 37:03.000\nHe was an accountant when he walked into that party.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:09.000\nI'll never forgive you for that because I introduced him as a Republican. I didn't even know where the hell was going.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:14.000\nI tried to correct him. Once he came in, I was like, what are you doing? He told me, I went, oh, fuck, I complete.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.000\nSo we tried to rewrite it and get the message.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:20.000\nOh.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:24.000\nWell, that wouldn't have helped. That's exactly the information I had.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nI just don't know who these people are.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nI'll bite the bullet on all of that. That's my thing.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:32.000\nWho is it? Can we talk about the other guy though? He's a doctor.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:35.000\nThis is a new tradition in the post-Obama Republican world.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:44.000\nThere is this effort on the Republican side always and it will not get, and I shouldn't even say this because I don't want to give them the key to the portal,\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:57.000\nbut they refuse to access, people like us, our age, who are Republicans and have a sense of how to run the Internet,\n\n37:57.000 --> 38:01.000\nhow to promote through the web, how to do other things.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:06.000\nThey really do run off this hierarchy that the elders know better and they're consistently out of touch.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:12.000\nEvery run of these campaigns, they focus on, right now, it's because of Obama, it's a black thing.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:15.000\nThey try to find some sort of minority savior.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:22.000\nTrying to find, and then that's where it goes into fear mongering because then they go, okay, what part of the black culture are we going to do appeal to?\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:30.000\nDo you look at the way that they gravitated to Herman Cain last time, which is hilarious because this guy, there was no part of that guy that was serious at any point.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:34.000\nAnd yet, there was a six week period where he was the leader.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:35.000\nHe was the guy.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:36.000\nThey had all eliminated.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:39.000\nBachman turned out to be a head spinning freak.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:46.000\nYou know, there was a Rick Perry did everything he could to blow it, including that moment where he went to Vermont.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:51.000\nThey gave him a bottle of maple syrup and he was tripping balls on pills and booze.\n\n38:51.000 --> 39:00.000\nManow wrote nothing for two days. She just played that full tape for two days of him kissing a bottle and then gesturing to women in the audience.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nHe was fucking insane.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nAnd so here comes Herman Cain.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:15.000\nKeep in mind at this time when he finally had to go, when he finally had to go, his dismount was somebody, he was giving a speech, not about saying goodbye because he actually never said, I quit.\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:20.000\nHe said, I'm suspending my campaign for the rest of my life.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:25.000\nBut a person, he's on satellite feed and somebody's walking right now.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:26.000\nHow you doing, man?\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:30.000\nHe's like sitting there staring in the space because it's just everything that he's done and everything.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:34.000\nSo you've got to deal with now and where do you go when you've got six weeks in the spotlight.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:35.000\nAnd now you leap.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:48.000\nAnd he said, a man once asked me if I could be any ice cream, which one would I be?\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:54.000\nAnd I said rocky road because it has been a rocky road to the president.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nThis is what he said.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nAnd this guy was the leading candidate.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:05.000\nIf he opened with that, if that's how we started off, then we would like that guy.\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:16.000\nYou said something that distracted me back there, a ways, a stretch, as the Republicans say, back there as the crow flies, a yonder.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nDo you really think that there is?\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:32.000\nI mean, I know that there is such a thing as the concept of a fiscal Republican that doesn't give a shit about any of this like other voodoo that we've come to associate with this tent.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:36.000\nBut still, don't you think that they've crunched those numbers?\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:44.000\nBecause that would be less work for them if they thought that there were so many young people out there that would just answer the call of pragmatism financially.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:58.000\nYou implied that maybe you think that, that there's like a tragedy for the Republican Party, that they're hung up on this non-economic crap, as if they could somehow get the popular majority in an honest way.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nAll I can talk to you about is this.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:13.000\nMy contemporaries who don't agree with me politically, the ones that I get in serious discussions with, where the argument is not about shutting somebody up, about talking louder than somebody.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:22.000\nWhere it's about the actual mathematics of argument and rhetoric, where if you know something that I don't know, we're going to hash this out until I know what you know.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:30.000\nBut if you don't, shut the fuck up and take my information and move on, these kinds of arguments, which are based on logic, which we don't teach.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:34.000\nWe don't teach in public schools, we don't teach logic, we don't teach civics.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:39.000\nSo you have kids going to public venues and pissing on walls because they don't realize they own a part of that.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:47.000\nYou have people, you know, saying, I don't hear you, I don't hear you, I don't hear you, because they don't understand that that's not an argument.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:50.000\nThey think that I had an argument with my friend. No, you didn't. You have a discussion about anything.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:54.000\nThey've been infantilized. I mean, they've taken that we had, you know.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:59.000\nWell, they've been limited in what they've been, in terms of how they can see the world.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:05.000\nBut the ones that I have serious arguments with, those people, continue right.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:12.000\nThey write for Bush. I mean, I have friends who are Democrats who actually wrote for Bush, because that was the job that they could take.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\nIt was the best job that they could take.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:17.000\nAnd also, there's barely any difference between those jobs.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:18.000\nOkay.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:25.000\nBecause you're writing. I used to write ads for Coke, but fuck, I can only work for Pepsi. What am I going to do?\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:28.000\nNo, but that's it, but that's literally it.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:33.000\nOh, wait, it's refreshing again. Fuck it.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nThat's always my job.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:36.000\nVote red.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nI was sitting, sorry.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nBrought to you by Frito-Lay.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:43.000\nBut wait, wait, wait. I want to merge it.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:46.000\nJeff, Jeff, I want to merge and finish this thought.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nJeff, I want to merge it.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nThey're saying, but they're saying, they're...\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nDan, let's merge, finish this thought.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:02.000\nI wouldn't have done the fifth one. I wouldn't have done it.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:05.000\nHow many comes with fives, man? How many comes with fives?\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:09.000\nNo, they're... Yeah, these people are my friends.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:12.000\nThey're all over the place. They're my colleagues and everywhere.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:16.000\nBut, you know, they're tapping in now.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nThey got sidetracked by this Tea Party thing.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:24.000\nThere's this whole neocon thing of creating enemies and creating arguments where there are no arguments.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:29.000\nIt's because you think that your populace is going to vote for you no matter what.\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:32.000\nAnd you've got to search out certain areas and own those areas,\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:35.000\nand it expands and expands and expands.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nThere's a hierarchy to set up that they bought into.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:42.000\nIt's been going on since the early, mid-70s or whatever.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:45.000\nRight, I was just saying, you and I were born into this, so I don't even know...\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:49.000\nYeah, and it stepped up when Clinton went into office immediately,\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:54.000\nwhere they sort of threw out all of the understanding of how...\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:57.000\nThe things, the graces that you allow the president to do for better or for worse.\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nBecause of cable TV and like...\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nI don't think it's panic. It's just hunger.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:04.000\nThey want their power back. They had power for X amount of years.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nThey did everything that they could.\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:12.000\nSo they just became the other political party because it became like a world where you could get elected by...\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nfrom their perspective.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:18.000\nBy lumping everyone in that wants hope and change or whatever the rhetoric is for it.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:23.000\nSo then they became ironically this horrible shadow monster\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:27.000\nthat makes the really easy villain because they're constantly lying\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:32.000\nand then engaged in all kinds of open-faced hypocrisy.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:35.000\nThey sort of have no choice now but to buy into...\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:39.000\nnot the younger minds that have a symbolic resonance for it.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nBecause they've gotten burned on that now.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:45.000\nThis woman in South Carolina who was insane that they put in office.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:50.000\nThey were like these pockets where they pick young people and say, this is our mass head.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:53.000\nAnd then they turn out to be ill-qualified.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nThese Joe DePlummer guys you mean?\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:58.000\nAny of them. These are actual people running.\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nThey shore up and they end up winning.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:03.000\nBecause they look good on the surface and then they don't know what they're doing.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:06.000\nThey don't know how to legislate. They don't know how to govern.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:09.000\nYou can tell that that's what they thought Barack Obama was.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:13.000\nI was paying a little bit of attention this last time because it was a long time ago\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:16.000\nand I still had something in me that was a little bored.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:20.000\nI was getting drawn in because Barack Obama was so charismatic\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:23.000\nand the other side was so uncharismatic that it actually made politics.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:26.000\nAlthough constantly nauseating as always.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nI refuse to believe in any of it.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:33.000\nBut the drama of it I really did enjoy because he really was.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:37.000\nI really enjoyed watching him in this sort of Nazarene capacity.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:44.000\nJust like, you know, just like them throwing all this shit at him.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:47.000\nWell, no, I'm not going to be careful because it's not going to be fun.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nI'm not going to fucking care at all. What do you mean?\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:58.000\nHe was an awesome ninja Christ figure because he did not resort to...\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:05.000\nHe was diplomatic and gentlemanly and classy and humorous\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:10.000\nand it was fun to watch him win because of his personality.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:17.000\nAnd it was fun to watch the bad guys get so angry.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:25.000\nWhat was not fun, at least for me, is that in the run-up to that\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:31.000\nhe had to run within his own party and at each point that somebody fell challenged by him\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:40.000\nthere were people... I mean, Hillary had that critical Ohio weekend\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:44.000\nwhere she released that red phone ad on Friday.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:51.000\nThis sort of borderline race-baiting ad with the stock footage\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:55.000\nof a young white girl in a bed and a phone ringing\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:59.000\na mushroom cloud and then a picture of bin Laden.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:02.000\nThis is crazy.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:08.000\nThe implication was that because she's technically literally been in the White House\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:11.000\nand then that phone rings, she won't go like,\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nWell, I fuck! What the fuck?\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nBut that's the kind of thing with their talk.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:22.000\nWho do you want to pick up that phone that little white girl sleeping in the room, a black dude?\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:26.000\nThen you find out two weeks later that the girl,\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:30.000\nthe stock footage from a Lionel train ad or some sort of train ad,\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:35.000\nlike Amtrak or something, and that the girl as a grown-up doesn't endorse the ad.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:40.000\nShe actually was working for Obama out of Seattle or some place in the Northwest.\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:44.000\nBut by that time, Tuesday had to run, so that primary had been run\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\nand he'd already lost that state.\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:50.000\nAnd there were these little upturns all the way through.\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:54.000\nYeah, it's horrible. What the fuck?\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:57.000\nWe all agree we're not going to vote in this one.\n\n47:57.000 --> 48:01.000\nI mean, I'm not going to say that out loud because there's too many kids listening to me\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nand I don't want to be part of the problem.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:06.000\nI just think that the Republican resources are gone.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:09.000\nThey now realize, and it's going to be interesting when it happens,\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:18.000\nwhen they start empowering their informed, their educated youth\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:21.000\nto really take control of that campaign.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:24.000\nAnd the other stop is sort of shit that we can all see,\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:30.000\nbecause even their own constituency now can see this sort of baiting and weirdness that's going on.\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:35.000\nI checked out, it was so long ago, it was that big election,\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nand I voted since then. I voted for Obama.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nI was just like, I never want to be that guy.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:44.000\nThere's such a terrifying fucking terrorism on this non-vote.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:52.000\nYou didn't vote, like your fucking new AIDS cancer asshole fuckface.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:57.000\nSo I do turn out because I just want to say, I want to be able to go,\n\n48:57.000 --> 49:00.000\nyeah, I did, and I also don't give a shit.\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:04.000\nBut when I really checked out spiritually and mentally...\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nWait, is that this time, Bernie Sanders?\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:09.000\nWell, I wish people would vote.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nI voted and I don't give a shit.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:15.000\nI don't even know if that guy really exists.\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:18.000\nBut I like his style.\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:21.000\nYou are the top 1% of the bottom 45%.\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:25.000\nHe's certainly singing my tune, and there's always one guy early on that's like,\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:28.000\nhey, I'm Mr. Elfman from the trees.\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nAnd it's like a big joke, and it's like,\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:33.000\nbut we always know at the bottom of it all, it's like, for instance,\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:38.000\nlike, oh yeah, God forbid an atheist Jewish socialist become the president,\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:41.000\nbecause they'd care more about their country than their church.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:47.000\nThey'd believe in equality financially, and they'd take their job very seriously.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:51.000\nLike, oh no, the stereotypes associated with these groups.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:56.000\nA Jewish atheist, oh God.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:59.000\nBut I don't know if that guy is, I don't know what James was making up,\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nbut I don't know if that guy exists or not.\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:02.000\nHe's real.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:06.000\nWell, both my mind, my father is a conservative, and we don't really talk politics,\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:11.000\nbut he's not a dummy, he's not a Rush Limbaugh lunatic,\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:15.000\nas far as I'm concerned when people are party-lined right-wingers.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nAlso, I think I don't like liberals much either.\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nI don't really like any of that.\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nThere's no good politics for me.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:26.000\nThe idea that anybody thinks that they know how everybody else ought to operate\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:28.000\nis fucking insanity or dim-witted.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:32.000\nSo I think it's foolish to say like, all conservatives are out of their mind,\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nor all liberals are just a bunch of fucking dickheads.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:40.000\nBut that's how people think, and the idea that there's these two polar opposites\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nduking it out in a ring is nuts.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nThey're so close to each other, ideologically,\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:47.000\nand then we create stupid things to argue about\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nthat really have nothing to do with anything.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:52.000\nWe make a big argument, and the right-wing right now seems to have made\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\na constituency out of crazy.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:58.000\nAnd there's a huge amount of crazy people that will vote for crazy shit.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nDo you think it'll be different?\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:05.000\nI was just to finish my point, I was at Seattle Tacoma Airport today\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:09.000\nat the Anthony's Fish Place having a Bloody Mary before I got on my plane.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:12.000\nAnd I was reading my book, and there was a guy next to me,\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:15.000\nand I put it on my Instagram, a little video of him.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:20.000\nHe was burping and farting and grunting and just making every goddamn thing.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:21.000\nHe's farting all over me.\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:26.000\nAnd then he's like...\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:30.000\nI said, and also Bartappen, which is my least favorite thing,\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:34.000\nand this guy was like 55, maybe 58-ish-ish.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:37.000\nBartappers drive me up the fucking tree,\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:40.000\nand he was a one-man band of just bumming me out.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:46.000\nAnd I finally moved a stool over when he finally farted a fog around me\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:49.000\nand my Bloody Mary, and I moved a seat away.\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nAnd I don't think he liked that much.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nThen he kind of was engaging everybody, like,\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:56.000\nand he had a Boston shirt on, he had a Southern accent,\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:57.000\nand he really did sound like it.\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:58.000\nHe said, you got a Boston shirt.\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:01.000\nSo what do you think about that Tom Brady verdict?\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:05.000\nAnd the guy's like, I'm a Boston fan.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:08.000\nI thought it was fair, but the guy's like...\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:11.000\nBartender, I got to get out of here.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nAnd the bartender closed him out,\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nand he announced to the bartender,\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nI'll do it as loud as he did it,\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nand the bartender was two and a half feet from him,\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nand he announced this for you.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:24.000\nAnd I said, Harmontowne, you would all have heard this at the bar,\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nand there's music playing and there's an airport,\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:27.000\nand there's a band playing over there.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:30.000\nAnd he goes, well, I don't like y'all's politics,\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nbut that moisture was delicious.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nAh!\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:41.000\nAnd I'm sitting right next to him like...\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nA political mastermind.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nAnd so the bartender without a beat,\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nand I don't know that he was gay,\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:50.000\nbut he had that kind of like polish to him that maybe he was.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nAnd certainly he wasn't like a gruff, jockey,\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nnever-gonna-be-gay guy.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nHe goes, um...\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nHe goes, uh...\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nYou know, you know, you can't be gay, right?\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nYou know, you can't be gay if you're in sports?\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nDo you guys know that?\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:07.000\nBut he goes, what politics are those?\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:10.000\nAnd this guy's like, you know, maybe early 40s.\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nAnd he goes, I just mean, you know,\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:15.000\naround here it's like, around where?\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:18.000\nAnd the guy's like, do you mean like in Seattle?\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nOh, you guys...\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:23.000\nAnd he's like, what's your point?\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nAnd he goes, oh, just give me some signs of bill,\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:28.000\nand leaves the guy $100 bill.\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nBecause he really just meant the oysters were good.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nThey weren't that good.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nHe wasn't gonna stand around Seattle\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nand not leave a parting shot and say like,\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nyou guys are all a bunch of, like,\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:44.000\nwomen loving fag kissing a bunch of weirdos.\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nRootin' tootin', yeah.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nOr the opposite of Rootin' tootin'.\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nNo, you guys never Rootin' tootin'.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nI'm Rootin' tootin'.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:55.000\nYou guys are Vladimir Putin.\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nRight, right, buddy?\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nYou know what I'm talkin' about.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:00.000\nAnatoly?\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nAnatoly knows what he's talkin' about.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nIt's a little inside joke for our Russian friend.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nBut the thing is, like,\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nwe can't just go around hating 50%\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nor whatever the populace of people\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nor the voters are.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:15.000\nWe can't all be right and we can't all be wrong.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nThe idea that we've been polarizing is too...\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:18.000\nYeah, it's silly.\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nWe've been barking that at them\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nfor three years of this podcast\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nand you and I have been barking at it\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nsince we were their age.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nWhat I wonder is,\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:31.000\nnow that the country is arguably\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nin jeopardy,\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nor maybe as,\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nyou know, because it's been arguably,\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:40.000\nit's been supposedly in jeopardy\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nsince way before I was born.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nI mean, it was in jeopardy because we were fighting\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nAnatoly's grandparents.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nAnd it turns out\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\nthat was a fuckin' Wizard of Oz\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nif there ever was one.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nThe...\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nThere's always by the side, like,\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\noh, God, the Chinese are buyin' everything.\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nThe Japanese, oh, we owe the France\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nso much money.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nSo I can't tell.\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nI feel like because I'm 42,\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nI kind of get the sense that actually\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\nwe are crumbling now.\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\nBut maybe that's...\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nBut if we are,\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\nmaybe will we now see\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nmaybe three\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\npolitical parties?\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nMaybe four?\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nLike, major ones? Like, big ones?\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nBecause there's, like, maybe four ways\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nto think about the future?\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nHow about 50 and 70, like, other countries\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.000\nthat have, like, high IQs?\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nThe history of our country, when we were forming it\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nand there were, like, a thousand ways\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nto, like, you know, commit treason\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nto the British crown, you know?\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nAnd there were, like, a lot of fuckin' ways\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nto think about it.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:48.000\nYeah, now it's just like, isn't it just a sign\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:50.000\nof absolute luxury that we've gone into, like,\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:52.000\nare you a lefty or a righty?\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nAre we just sort of suckin' our thumb\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nand kind of, like...\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\nThe main thing for me, on a style standpoint,\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nif you just look at America in terms of, like,\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nif it was a person, would you want to hang out\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nwith that person? The answer is fuckin' no way\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nyou would never hang out with America at a party.\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:12.000\nYou would fuckin' absolutely be hanging out\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nand fuckin' like, like, Norway.\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nYou know, like, your friends would be other people.\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:18.000\nI'm kind of fascinated with this concert\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nbecause it all depends on whether you're inside\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nor outside this black box.\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nSo, like, if you're inside of it,\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nmy new thing is I just call it King's Landing.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nLike, it's kind of...\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nIt's kind of cool in here unless you're, like,\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nsuper poor.\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:34.000\nSo you see they go on a little tour\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nthrough King's Landing and there's a lot of people\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nthat say the song hurts.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nUm...\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nHorror, horror, horror!\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nBastard!\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nUh, like, they're on the edge\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nand they're on the verge, but, but,\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:50.000\nlike, there's, you know, like, we're hanging out\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nand we're, like, trying, I don't know,\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nthere's a concept inside the box\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\ncalled America that everything\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\ncould be super cool.\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nBut, like, yeah, if you zoom out\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:02.000\nand look at its relationship with the planet,\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nthen definitely you know, you don't want to hang out\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:08.640\nguy with a baseball hat on back wasn't a tribal tattoo.

Roman Republic it's\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:58.880\nexactly where ancient Rome and it's I mean let's not root for it I live in a\n\n58:58.880 --> 59:04.760\nbig house on a big hill I'm just I'm just keep hoping it's steep enough every\n\n59:04.760 --> 59:08.800\ntime I climb it and I can't I'm out of breath I hope the same thing is\n\n59:08.800 --> 59:11.920\nhappening to poor people right now\n\n59:11.920 --> 59:18.360\nbecause if I keep getting fatter and they keep getting thinner this is gonna\n\n59:18.360 --> 59:24.360\nmake a fun climb for them and I'm gonna be halfway up like eating a cheeseburger\n\n59:24.360 --> 59:29.760\nnow the poor people in America are pretty fat too right so that's a good\n\n59:29.760 --> 59:34.880\nsign and and the two parties the fact that everyone's a big fat baby that's\n\n59:34.880 --> 59:38.240\ngoing like are you this or are you that means that things haven't even begun to\n\n59:38.240 --> 59:43.960\ngo down yet that's my question

it's like are you fucking kidding me do you really think that that\n\n59:58.760 --> 01:00:04.720\nis the thing that's gonna happen like like like if tomorrow the dollar was\n\n01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:10.720\nworth a penny instead of a dollar which isn't that big a difference if tomorrow\n\n01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.720\nyou woke up and the dollar was worth a penny you'd have about six hours before\n\n01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:21.840\nyour week would be like different like it wouldn't it would you would be like\n\n01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.160\nlike shit would be immediately all over the new everybody would like the\n\n01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.960\neverything would be fucked up six hours and like like you'd be like you wouldn't\n\n01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.080\nbe able to call people like like if things would be it would be Armageddon\n\n01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.120\njust because we'd think it was Armageddon because what the fuck is the\n\n01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.800\ndollar

01:02:09.480\npinky's a little numb like I like I think I drank myself to death and we're\n\n01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:16.840\njust living out the final hours it's possible and I'm and I'm I'm okay with\n\n01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:25.120\nit like I I wanted to have kids but like like like after New York that ship is\n\n01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.480\nsales well no no I'm just saying like it's just becoming increasingly like\n\n01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.080\nI'm getting that feeling of like like well either your kids gonna be John\n\n01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:42.880\nConnor or he's gonna be one of those skulls to put it in strictly terminator\n\n01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:53.200\ntwo terms like just to use that movie as an example like like so what are the\n\n01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.760\nodds that my kids gonna end pretty hot that my kid would be John Connor I\n\n01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.520\nagree you don't have to say if anyone was gonna raise the hope of the of society\n\n01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.280\nin Los Angeles like yeah I do think it would be me I do but I don't know if\n\n01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.400\nhe'd get the message in time like I don't know he'd be looking at me and go\n\n01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:17.840\nand like so why are robots bad this guy seems to jerk off to laptops a lot\n\n01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:23.680\nhe's really loves playing Minecraft like why would my son I need to get my shit\n\n01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.680\ntogether and have a baby so then I can teach him jujitsu and I just I have so\n\n01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:37.360\nmuch Minecraft to play I guess my point is if I if I if I were to get so drunk\n\n01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:46.720\nthat I died before I had a baby you might have doomed us to a to a terrible\n\n01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.000\napocalypse no notice someone else I'll have John Connor it's 9-11 by the way\n\n01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.440\nit took us a few years but we're cheering for 9-11\n\n01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:03.880\nwe just think that was gonna happen in the weeks following the tragedy plus\n\n01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.200\ntime yeah think about it with the six months of those buildings falling and\n\n01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.880\nall those people dying thanks for bringing it back to that if somebody\n\n01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.440\nsaid to you then Dan you and Jeff Davis are gonna be on stage doing a\n\n01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.720\npodcast and when you point to a clock and say it's 9-11 the whole crowd will\n\n01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.880\ncheer what year do you think that will be I don't know you're making me feel\n\n01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.560\nlike I'm I don't know it's like the joke is about the number having\n\n01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.280\nsignificance it's like you're making you're bringing you're tying it to the\n\n01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:40.480\ncorpses in the rubble and I'm I'm out I'm not like it is it is terrible when\n\n01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:47.120\npeople die all the time it always will be but the number being important is\n\n01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.520\nfunny it's funny you know it's weird though and again I talked to Professor\n\n01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.120\nBrian Cox and he says it's all just coincidence I've been looking at my\n\n01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:02.680\nclock and all the time now it's 9 10 really yeah so maybe I'm going back in\n\n01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:09.160\ntime we did have a controversy wait what a controversy now I'm Helen Slater\n\n01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:14.100\nwhat are you how drunk are you right now 1 to 10 I this is my well I have\n\n01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:20.080\nfilled it up a couple times when when the lines between political satire and my\n\n01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.680\nignorance were so blurred that life was a teardrop I I did I did fill this a\n\n01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.880\ncouple times but when you drink you can drink a lot of vodka and still be very\n\n01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:37.920\narticulate thank you that that that's the problem like I I'm saying like in\n\n01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:44.440\nPortland in New York those those towns are my those are my towns baby I I drank\n\n01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.080\na lot do you know and get it on with him yep I did it I did it all I did it all\n\n01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.440\nlike my definition of it all like I hung out a lot of bars and had a lot of fun\n\n01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.760\nconversations with a lot of wonderful people New York is very friendly I don't\n\n01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.360\nknow that now it seems like that's the gimmick I think that's just Dinos New\n\n01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.120\nYork Dino knows how to take you through New York and it becomes like this\n\n01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.680\nmagical wonderful place where you're just walking into these creepy places and\n\n01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:16.920\neveryone is so happy it's just New York I well I but I think I mean so maybe\n\n01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.880\nyou're like Dino and maybe I'm the odd man out but I like I was always so\n\n01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.880\nintimidated by that city I always felt like it was so like hustle and bustle\n\n01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:30.200\nand like like like like you're in the way and like you know it's all about\n\n01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:35.480\npracticality so and more insectoid and like I just like now when I go there like\n\n01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:40.320\nit's like it's like this honeycomb of dive bars and like everyone's just like\n\n01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.440\nkind of like they don't they they know you're from out of town but they don't\n\n01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:51.200\ncare and they're like happy where did you go radio city musical they have they\n\n01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.400\nhave this like lounge in the they'll talk to you and there was a lady there\n\n01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:08.080\nthat kicks for a living and only at Christmas what

he\n\n01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.960\nwere present but it seemed like it seemed like his head was too small for\n\n01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:12.760\nhis giant body like like like he kind of and he had like this like like sports\n\n01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:18.640\njersey on like a like a muscle shirt and like kind of like I don't know he just\n\n01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:23.960\nhad this big giant arms

happening in other cities you know\n\n01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:54.120\nit's just like like I gotta go to the gym now people beat up more people it's\n\n01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:59.440\nall I could do I feel like New York is really good like people make eye\n\n01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.480\nconstant like they flirt and bars and people talk to each other like people\n\n01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.360\nlike there's a lot more stranger interaction I've found and from people\n\n01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.520\nI know that have lived though they say yeah that's that's very appealing and\n\n01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.960\nthat's great but like the relationships don't really they're very good at\n\n01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:18.600\nshort kind of superficial like like like short quick fix like relationships and\n\n01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.720\nand hang out so you like there's a lot of that going on but like like dating is\n\n01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.480\nvery hard I hear out there and stuff like that it's very transient out there\n\n01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.480\nbecause it's there's so much going on I don't know if that's true or not you but\n\n01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.600\nmaybe we have some New Yorkers here that agree or disagree yeah this is very\n\n01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.320\nbusy everybody's just very busy all the time and everything's just kind of moving\n\n01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.120\nso it's hard to keep track of people or over a long period of time yeah people\n\n01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.480\nalso like exit they just exit the city at different points so you might be dating\n\n01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.000\nsomebody like you know what it's time for me to get out you've been part of a\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:56.080\nsort of cutting I've been doing and now now it's time to heal up and go to\n\n01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:02.800\nOregon there was once I went back years years ago I went back for it was like\n\n01:11:02.800 -->

jeers or cocked eyebrows or anything because I\n\n01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.520\nthink that I've assumed that's what that 50 shades of great businesses are\n\n01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.720\nincreasing awareness that we are a little jealous of of people who are able\n\n01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.560\nto have heightened like and and I think if you're a human being like like\n\n01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.280\nheightened sexuality if that does involve like crazy shit that we would\n\n01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:32.280\nlook at as being way distant from prom night like that that that it's like\n\n01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.760\nalmost like well yeah cuz like wolves can do prom night like it's like I'm a\n\n01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.480\nwolf and I haven't had sex yet the female wolves like me neither so here we go\n\n01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:46.840\nokay we're done oh you got pregnant let's have more normal wolves like like\n\n01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:51.040\nwhereas there are some people out there that are like you know and the internet\n\n01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:55.040\nhas made them more able to do it through with control and safety and like like\n\n01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.960\nwell still like I don't know they just have this whole fucking like network and\n\n01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:05.680\ncrazy like there and I swear like like I it's not it's not gonna work for me I'm\n\n01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.800\ngoing to migrate very happily like like like kissing Aaron and like sometimes\n\n01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.880\ncoming and like making a baby then like I'm gonna tell him do the same thing but\n\n01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:21.320\nif he doesn't find like like like like but but like I do see the nobility like\n\n01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:26.760\nor the I definitely don't look down on it what people are like like like the\n\n01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:32.520\nDino like he has adventures like he has like like he like he tells one person\n\n01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.680\nthis thing and then he tells that they make agreements like you're gonna meet\n\n01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.080\nher in the hotel bar he lied to a dominatrix did he tell the story on the\n\n01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:44.720\nshow yeah he did I don't you know that's like the dishonesty thing but but I'm\n\n01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.960\ntalking about like the I'm talking about like the role-playing thing where it's\n\n01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:52.200\nlike you could agree in advance and you can go like like he did this thing in\n\n01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:58.000\nNew York where he had one person that he knew from from one part of the world and\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.680\nanother print and they were one was a Dom and one was a sub and he told them like\n\n01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.240\nlike he was explaining to me over drinks he's like here's what I did I told them I\n\n01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.480\ngave him my hotel room keys and I told them you're gonna I'm gonna go to this\n\n01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.080\nadult swim thing you guys are gonna meet in my hotel room they've never met\n\n01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.880\nbefore you guys pow wow about whatever you want to do to me when I get back to\n\n01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:21.120\nthe room I don't know I don't know how you're gonna interact with each other or\n\n01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.880\nwhat you're gonna do Dino is just like gonna go have dinner hang out and then\n\n01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.840\nwhile I went to the up front and learned about marketing and demographics and\n\n01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.400\nwatched a Miley Cyrus performance Dino went back to his hotel room where two\n\n01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:42.880\nwomen you know had agreed to do secret things to his body that were like he\n\n01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.640\ndidn't know if he was good when he was gonna walk in there if he was gonna be\n\n01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:51.080\nattacked and told that he was a pig and tied up and blah blah blah or if he was\n\n01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.280\ngonna walk in and one woman was gonna have the other woman's woven in a web\n\n01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:59.640\nand hanging from like a lord of the rings cocoon you know like I'm going\n\n01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.440\nlike like she's in there but like he didn't know and so and then I and I\n\n01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.640\nnever I never asked him because they didn't really that that stuff I was\n\n01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.920\nfascinated with like the preparatory period and then the next day I saw him\n\n01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.720\nand it was like how'd it go he's like it was great like but he knew going into it\n\n01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.680\nthat it could have been a disaster that's the other weird thing is like the\n\n01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:24.760\nacceptance of like part of our mythology of sex is like oh it's supposed to\n\n01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:32.240\nalways be good like like it's like dessert when like like actually it's\n\n01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:37.720\nlike an intermingling of the human like the animal you know and like it's like\n\n01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:43.560\nthat that that idea that search commercial idea that romance equals sex\n\n01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:50.040\nequals always infatuated equals all that stuff that that could be responsible\n\n01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.920\nfor a very high divorce rate because you look across the table at breakfast at\n\n01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.800\nthis person that you haven't felt animalistic about in 10 years and why\n\n01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.880\nshould you out of respect to her feel that way and now all of a sudden because\n\n01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.840\nyou saw a stupid rom-com the other night you think that means you're not in love\n\n01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.280\nwith her which isn't true you know there just might need to be communication\n\n01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:17.400\nabout what makes your little wee wee dance around and what and maybe like what\n\n01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:21.840\nwhat makes you little wee wee dance around and maybe what scares you what\n\n01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.800\nyou think might be a trick what make your little wee wee dance around what\n\n01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.800\nkind of music make sure and what sort of dances as a foxtrot or a merengue my\n\n01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:36.040\nfinal thesis is those guys are I'm sure there's a lot of douchebags among those\n\n01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:39.440\npeople but there I perceive them as existing on a slightly higher more\n\n01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.200\nevolved level because I think that if we're all gonna survive in a world where\n\n01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.720\nour kids are able to like look at the internet and like how do people raise\n\n01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:53.400\nchildren like we're becoming like that this myth that like well when a man\n\n01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:57.360\nlikes a lady they go in the bedroom and then they she takes off her clothes he\n\n01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:04.600\nloves what he sees when he drops his pants and she's like wow and then she\n\n01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:10.200\nlays back and then he goes in there and he's just like root and they both love\n\n01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.960\nit and like well you know we we used to think she didn't have to love it but now\n\n01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:20.440\nwe know as of the 70s if she loves it it increases the chance of conception because\n\n01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:25.720\nher caramel glide his right into the egg and that's how sex it doesn't like\n\n01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:30.480\nworst the people who are talking about like you know you should you should you\n\n01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:36.800\nshould dress like a leprechaun man I want you to dress like a leprechaun and I\n\n01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:43.280\ndon't I don't want to know when you're coming for my gold I'm just gonna keep\n\n01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.240\ngold in my kitchen and I'm a and wear pants with it with the dick cut out and\n\n01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:53.920\nlike but take three days surprise shock me scare the shit out of me and be like\n\n01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:59.560\nwhere's me gold and like and then fucking get on me and make my limp dick\n\n01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.800\nhard like cuz I'll be like that's a leprechaun like make it hard make it\n\n01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:09.160\nhard unless I say tequila let's be honest how many how many little\n\n01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:15.480\nweebies are dancing around right now a couple polite shows of hands there like\n\n01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:20.200\nI do a girl that her job she gets paid quite a quite a good deal of money\n\n01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.400\nthere's this billionaire that she works for apparently is quite good looking and\n\n01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:27.640\nvery successful and a nice guy and seems well adjusted but her job is to\n\n01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.720\nhumiliate him on like kind of grand grand scale and like she's also supposed\n\n01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.200\nto like fuck him in the butt with a big strap on his stuff at the end of the\n\n01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:40.640\nwhole she's bang but before that happens she's supposed to do high concept\n\n01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.960\nhumiliation and so one of the ones that she did and he's like and like here's a\n\n01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:59.720\nblank check like like like like like remake Star Wars and put my name on it\n\n01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:06.680\n$85 million this is a this

what a what an orgasm back to work tomorrow morning one of the what she did\n\n01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:31.840\nhe got off a plane and she had like a team of people as his cast of people and\n\n01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.240\nhe doesn't know what it is and he gets off the plane and it was a car waiting\n\n01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:39.800\nfor him and it's a his publicist is there it's all fake he's greeted by his\n\n01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.040\npublicist his agent and he's going to he's going to a high-fashion photo shoot\n\n01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:50.240\nand he goes to this office building and he's told that he has to go do it he's\n\n01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.000\na supermodel and this guy's not a supermodel and waiting in the waiting\n\n01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.080\nroom are the best-looking men in the world like like a super good-looking\n\n01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:02.800\nguys and they're all going in there and he has to watch them do what he's about\n\n01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.240\nto do and that's he has to get naked but then they dress him up like a little\n\n01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.720\nlike I forget what the costumes were but everybody there like everyone he met\n\n01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.280\nthat day all had to watch him do something and the whole thing was just\n\n01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:18.440\ncompletely to like diminish him and to make him feel horrified and like take\n\n01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.280\nhis clothes off and dance around like I'm like dressed up as little boopeep I\n\n01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.880\ndon't know what the fuck it

I nice work if you can get it get it if you try I would never want that\n\n01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.000\njob yeah but I admire I that's great like I because obviously the people who\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.480\ndo it successfully and get paid to do it they're there it's like we live in a\n\n01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:01.000\nworld where you can't make a lawn toy without you know consumer advocacy\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:07.920\noversight like like and like we don't have a lot of fatalities and emotional\n\n01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.960\ncasualties of like the sex service industry and we know that it's a big\n\n01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.000\nindustry and so what we know is that even though it's mostly unregulated like\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.800\nthere's a lot of very responsible independent agents out there that threw\n\n01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:29.360\nnothing but their primal understanding of this is part of a fantasy I paid Jeff\n\n01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.800\nto help\n\n01:24:31.800 --> 01:25:00.280\nit's supposed to be my show stop dancing if I'm going like this and you go\n\n01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:10.680\nlike that yeah no I know what happens I'm explaining to them first syllable in\n\n01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:17.680\ndancing is Dan to mark you've been quiet one thing you can touch on is like\n\n01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:25.440\nthe people here because in my experience with it I have a lot of friends who go\n\n01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.920\nin to cross that line into that but they they don't they don't know that until\n\n01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.400\nit happens it sort of happens accidentally to them and they have these\n\n01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.320\nstories and they tell you yeah that they didn't know that they had that part I\n\n01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:40.520\nhad a friend who's a writer very accomplished writer who went to a party\n\n01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:46.320\nonce in Boston I think in a like a weird sort of loft party in Boston and was\n\n01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:49.800\nmilling about talking to people and wandered around to look at the place\n\n01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:57.200\nand walked into a room all four walls of the room had murals of Lucille ball\n\n01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:02.440\npainted on them and then the door shut behind him and there was was a woman in\n\n01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:10.200\nthere who was I think it was her place and she was a dominatrix and she said\n\n01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:13.880\nwho asked you to come into this room and then she said who told you to come in\n\n01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:20.840\nthis room and he said no nobody and then she put him in a rack pulled a rack\n\n01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.440\ndown from the ceiling and put him in he's telling me this story and I'm\n\n01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.200\nlistening he gets into this rack she straps him up in this thing and there's\n\n01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.080\nno suspension in the middle so he's sort of his body is his hell but the middle\n\n01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:38.280\nof his body is drawn down and it's discomforted and she raises him up to\n\n01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.000\nthe ceiling so that he can see all four murals basically at the same time and\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.560\nthere's all this pressure and she walks out of the room shuts the door locks it\n\n01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:53.560\nand leaves she doesn't let him out until the morning and he comes down and he's\n\n01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.680\nso this happened on like a Friday or Saturday this is Thursday when he's\n\n01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.080\ntelling me this and I was like you realize that every point of that you had\n\n01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.600\nto you could have outgunned her and walked around they got out of the room\n\n01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:13.360\nyou got into the rack and he just goes yes and there are other examples of\n\n01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.320\njust friends of mine who've just said you're not gonna believe what happened\n\n01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.560\nto me Thursday and then they told the story and it's just you know it's you\n\n01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:24.320\nknow these things sometimes people don't know and then they and they just have\n\n01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.160\nit in them I think it it just is in them and they don't maybe go to it\n\n01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:33.160\nregularly I think that's true because I I will lay myself bare as much as I can\n\n01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:39.040\nhere and say like I've never I've never done anything like that however at 42\n\n01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.040\nwhat I have done is gone through a bunch of relationships where I was very much\n\n01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.760\nin charge and then a couple where things got a little sketchy and a little hurt\n\n01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:54.680\na little hurtful where I got abraded a little bit and I like I don't I don't know\n\n01:27:54.680 --> 01:28:00.440\nif this makes me scarred or healthy or it's like is this what I was always into\n\n01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.960\nbecause you always hear people talking about like like like Dino says like it's\n\n01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.120\nnot about the it's not about like a heart out of the moment it's not like it's\n\n01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.280\nnot it's like a whole this is whole experience and then you jerk off to it\n\n01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:17.960\nlater to quote Dino about this stuff like Dino so things like you do you do\n\n01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.480\nyou get off and he's like no never it's like it's all for for jerk enough for\n\n01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.080\nthe rest of your life thinking about that right and so and so then I think okay\n\n01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:28.480\nyou jerk off for the rest of your life thinking about that and then I think well\n\n01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.920\nwhat have I jerked off to the rest of my life thinking about and some of those\n\n01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.760\nthings have been very emotionally painful like I think and I don't know if\n\n01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:42.040\nit's like distancing you know pornography can be very can be very misogynistic\n\n01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:50.200\nmaybe once in a while male pornographers don't take the ladies feelings into\n\n01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:55.360\naccount there are there are there are lots of self self self-employed female\n\n01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.520\npornographers out there who are the heroes of the new information age\n\n01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.280\nbecause of the first people to monetize the internet and their millionaires and\n\n01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:04.600\ntheir they don't have pimps and they're not they don't exist in a world where\n\n01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:08.320\nthey're ruled and they're they're doing what they they like but pornography's\n\n01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:14.320\nhistory does have a trace of misogyny to it and and I and I wonder how much of\n\n01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.960\nthat has to do with the fact that men are like these brutes who like we exert\n\n01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:26.480\nall this control based on like this instinctive fear and need and then it's\n\n01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:32.560\nlike getting hurt getting getting like getting victimized getting taken advantage\n\n01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.400\nof you know it's not like I don't I'm sorry are you saying that I'm saying\n\n01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.120\nthere are memories that you have that were sexual memories but that were still\n\n01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.840\nhurtful I don't I'm sick no no no I'm saying that I have I have in the past\n\n01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:49.760\nlike throughout my life I've seen a pattern and I like where I like I will\n\n01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:56.480\nmasturbate thinking about ex-girlfriends that I do not like that like like you're\n\n01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:02.960\ncheating on me that's what I'm saying like like like like a cuckold like like like thing\n\n01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:08.640\nlike but I know from my life experience that I don't like that I don't want that\n\n01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:17.240\nto happen to me but then so I don't know if when I'm like am I exhibiting a need\n\n01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:22.120\nduring masturbation to distance myself from what I'm thinking about so that it\n\n01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:27.320\ncan be animalistic appropriately that's how I've always parsed it it's like when\n\n01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.280\nyou're masturbating you don't want it to be you don't want to think about the\n\n01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:37.160\nroyal wedding I hope I hope in spite of her low-born upbringing that Princess\n\n01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:41.320\nDye is happy in this marriage and I hope he really makes love to her tonight I\n\n01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:45.800\nyou you you think about people being animals you know you think about the\n\n01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:50.360\ntaboo and so I don't know if that's just like a personal expression of that or\n\n01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:54.560\nyou just like like well look I want to this is this is about self-indulgence and\n\n01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:58.760\nthis is about like like part of that trigger is like things I'm not supposed\n\n01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.040\nto be thinking about what if your ex-girlfriend was cheating on you with\n\n01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:09.920\nPrince Charles she is and you're not supposed to say it we're all gonna die\n\n01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:17.200\ntonight but courtesy of Her Majesty's somewhat untrained but still very\n\n01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:23.640\neffectual Secret Service sorry what we're gonna say to Orange I just I mean\n\n01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:28.520\nthat kind of sexuality is targeted I think when you're when you're thinking\n\n01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:35.000\nthat way and it's psychologically it based if you subscribe to that but also\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.520\nneurologically it's Olympic and that's and that system kind of acts on its own\n\n01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:44.200\nit sort of bridges that gap between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\n\n01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:48.640\nsystems and so you can do targeted thinking you can find and it actually\n\n01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:53.400\ndoes I think isolate the things that you're concerned the narrative aspects\n\n01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.680\nof it but kind of pushes them out it edits them out and it just sort of is\n\n01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.760\nthe node is those things that trigger those dendrites and make those things\n\n01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:07.120\nmake all those things move I just like them big old titties what if you had\n\n01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.840\n17 of them brought to you by Frito a brings it all around that's not no\n\n01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:16.960\nthat's not how the show ends you can't force it to add no you don't get to pick\n\n01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:22.800\nthe ending of the show I know you have school tomorrow we don't end before 10\n\n01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:36.200\never I hate it I don't want to end the show I don't I want to bring out as a\n\n01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.840\nSpencer replacement but not he's not gonna guide us through GND unless he\n\n01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:47.640\nwants to but he probably won't my other assistant Steve Levy\n\n01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.720\nwhat up Steve\n\n01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:00.480\nyou can choose if you sit there or sit in the Spencer seat\n\n01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:10.560\nhello my favorite thing about Steve is he's the opposite of Spencer is that\n\n01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:16.720\nright yeah you're very clean shaven and very nervous not the Spencer's not\n\n01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:24.760\nnervous I mean you and you care about me yeah I do yeah Spencer does as well\n\n01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:31.400\nSpencer does not care about me if if I if Spencer and I were somehow locked\n\n01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:38.440\nalone in a home and I died like like the dog would eat my face first the cat\n\n01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:46.000\nthird Spencer suck it I don't know about that he's a I'm just he doesn't he\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.560\ndoesn't he but I'm saying you're a compassionate what is the division of\n\n01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:53.520\nlabor between these two assistants like I will tell you so just one hunt and one\n\n01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:00.680\ngather so I used to I used to have Daniella who then she got pregnant she\n\n01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:05.480\nraised her kid in the in the office and like I mean she I did my best to be a\n\n01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:10.880\npart of this modern workplace where like we don't provide women with any kind of\n\n01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.360\nlike acknowledgement that that maternity is part as part of health care blah\n\n01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.960\nblah blah points points ladies thank you\n\n01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:24.840\nthe but but I mean so I was you know there's a crib next to my desk and like\n\n01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:31.120\nI didn't change the diapers but I took a lot of Instagrams of the baby everything\n\n01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:36.960\na modern boss should do but even still making making your employee bring the\n\n01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.120\nbaby to work not not maternity leave no she had maternity leave oh there you\n\n01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:46.800\nokay that's that's that's that's not enough lately baby was of a certain age\n\n01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:50.400\nit's child care I mean once you have a baby the child needs care we tell we\n\n01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:53.280\ntell parents that they both have to work and then we but we also\n\n01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:58.320\nsimultaneously tell them like oh yeah you should definitely have kids like it's\n\n01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.720\nand then when a mother has a baby it's like we act like they got the flu we're\n\n01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:06.120\nlike oh okay so go home for a while come back when you're better which means you\n\n01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:12.640\ncan hire a nanny it's and if you can't afford that I your 99% of everybody then\n\n01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:17.280\nyou're like what are you doing and so in our case the baby was like in a drawer\n\n01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:24.440\nand I their faces are so smooth at that point like they make really great mouse\n\n01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:30.800\npads for the for the laser tracking ones not the old ball ones because they get\n\n01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:35.560\nthey're like pugs they have accumulated right this is wasn't why I wanted to\n\n01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:41.320\nbring this up Daniela eventually had to leave by virtue of the call you know\n\n01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.200\nit's like she was like you know I feel like I'm being a bad assistant and a bad\n\n01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:50.840\nmother and obviously I'm gonna choose to be a good mother so she's Spencer filled\n\n01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:55.360\nthat first hole right well sometime along when when Spencer filled the first\n\n01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:03.400\nhole and you never forget that while she was a claw hammer while she was when\n\n01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.760\nshe got pregnant I started to feel guilty about making her go to Toys R Us to\n\n01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:13.440\nbuy video games like you answer the phones like like like do appointments and\n\n01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.440\nall this stuff you're the clerical assistant like you know that's what you\n\n01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.160\ndo appointments because this is a big this is a big job like like full-time\n\n01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:26.840\njob for old popular man right right lots of people I want to interview me and\n\n01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:34.440\nit's true yeah vanity fair I'm sure or something so at that point brought\n\n01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:40.040\nSpencer on because Spencer was the back room of the Apple Store and so okay so\n\n01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:44.480\nSpencer's gonna slap he's gonna be like a bee assistant if I need to go if I\n\n01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:48.480\nneed video games he'll go get him if I need like a headphone you know he'll\n\n01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:53.280\nslap if you need an eye-harmon fashion till he'll do that for you\n\n01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:58.160\nhill like hell yeah he'll like he'll tell till fill the bar at home or like you\n\n01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.680\nknow like like the the schleppy personal assistant stuff and then the\n\n01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:07.160\nbusiness assistant that's the division I yeah I guess that's that's sort of how\n\n01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:12.180\nit is but Spencer does a lot more he's been helping me a lot of in a lot of\n\n01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:19.560\nways fuck that guy well he does is go to Toys R Us no I wasn't I didn't mean it\n\n01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.000\nsounds like I thought it sounded like both of you do a lot I wouldn't want to\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.040\nschlep or fucking handle it I was just playing and Jeff boy I'm getting drunk\n\n01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:36.000\nso when Daniela left and she helped me find like she her last act is one of\n\n01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.120\nthe greatest assistants in the world she took her baby out of the drawer\n\n01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:49.320\nwe find yes I said your baby and your gun and she put them on the table I took\n\n01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:55.040\nthem I don't know why I guess it's just part of like she's on suspension I guess\n\n01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.120\nbut Daniela if I catch her pursuing this case you're getting you're getting too\n\n01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.440\nclose to this baby I want you have this baby but and then and then we I\n\n01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.880\ninterviewed a bunch of candidates and one of them was Steve and that's that\n\n01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:14.720\nSteve's role he's the new Daniela whereas Spencer is like just like kind of\n\n01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:20.920\nlike he's like he's a he's like a shoe he's a chauffeur he has to drive me\n\n01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:28.280\neverywhere because I still don't have a car that's Spencer and then yes good does\n\n01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.320\nhe provide any bodyguard service he's big he's a big fella he's got that wolf\n\n01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:37.960\nthat wolf kick defense thing yeah I feel like Spencer adds I think I think if\n\n01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:42.000\nyou got attacked by any group of anything be they thugs or or wolves or\n\n01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.080\nanything I think Spencer might just like tap into some weird reservoir of rage\n\n01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:52.960\nreally fucking hurt people I'm sure yeah I think between me and Spencer you know\n\n01:38:52.960 --> 01:39:02.000\nlike if a very very small unarmed preteen girl\n\n01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:07.120\nyou're kind of like running Dangerfield and I forget the actress name Lou Bert\n\n01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:13.480\nYoung back to school all right anyway so Steve so so I just Spencer's not here\n\n01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.800\nso I thought I'd bring you up and we'd get to know you and that's all good I'm\n\n01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.620\ngetting text Steve what's the names names some of the what's the most\n\n01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:29.320\nsatisfying element of being a Harmon assistance oh so Aaron's actually also\n\n01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:35.920\nmaybe my I thought it was obvious that I don't I value Spencer a lot as Aaron's\n\n01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:40.320\nlike warning me that sounds like I don't think Spencer does anything I would say\n\n01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.720\nI would say I would say to balance things out a little bit say something nice\n\n01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.400\nabout Spencer because you I mean the guy who couldn't bother to be here he's\n\n01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:59.480\namazing that's not fair and the next time he's here I'm gonna crush him\n\n01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:05.960\nSpencer if you're out there and I hope you are the show is called Harmon's\n\n01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:09.040\nTown but no matter when Greg Poops came on or Ryan Styles or someone somebody\n\n01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:14.760\nmade a dig on Spencer fucking a sacred territory oh man no way yeah why do you\n\n01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:19.040\nthink I hate him no no no I'm kid it's I he's my son what do you want me to say\n\n01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:25.000\nhe's my son what do you want me to say tell him you love him tell your son you\n\n01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.520\nlove him I don't know what love is I have hired him to help me find out you're\n\n01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:35.160\nbeing a he does a very good job he's you're being the great Dantini right now\n\n01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:42.000\nyou're being I mean instinctive shot I feel if I just I what I do what why is\n\n01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.680\nit wouldn't what do you like about him name a couple things that you like about\n\n01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.640\nhim and then they're valuable to you the same thing as them is beard and he's\n\n01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:55.440\nfunny flannel shirt and it's like May you know you consider do you consider a\n\n01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:04.400\nfriend a pal definitely yeah I only have like three friends you know like yeah if\n\n01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:11.360\nyou and Dino like stop hanging out with me I'd be like Dana Gould and he'd be\n\n01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:16.560\nlike hey Dan what's going on I'd be like yeah remember 1995 when we said we'd\n\n01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:24.120\nhang out so yes Spencer's my friend but I guess I I guess I undersold that it's\n\n01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.000\nI'm not gonna I'm not gonna pressure you because you were having a difficult time\n\n01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.440\nexpressing affection no it's not the highest government is an actual high\n\n01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:42.440\ncompliment he's I what he's he's he's my I see myself in him and I respect him\n\n01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.160\nand even that's not a good enough compliment cuz you know that's a good\n\n01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.360\ncomment he's not like a mini me or anything like that like he's like I\n\n01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.120\njust like you know I like him and I feel I feel very comfortable with him\n\n01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.360\nthat's the thing when he comes and picks me up like I've talked about that\n\n01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:01.000\nbefore like I don't have like he and I are in the same wavelength or lack of it\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000\nlike like like other other people like there's always that inevitable point\n\n01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:11.880\nwhere it's like I'm fine with the fact that I haven't said that you're doing a\n\n01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:16.560\ngood job for the last four weeks but are you you know I warned you about that\n\n01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:23.520\nwhen I interviewed you yeah but is Spencer's one of the most charming\n\n01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:27.880\ngenuine moral people I think I've ever met and that's just part of the allure\n\n01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:35.920\nyeah like for example so here here so this might really embarrass Marissa I\n\n01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.400\nhope it doesn't but but she when she was she was visiting she was she was here\n\n01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.440\nfor all this while she was getting her she was doing her post-productive thing\n\n01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:49.440\nMarissa was a she she's the first person to ever do a blog about us she was\n\n01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.120\nlike she was the she's the number one absolute of course yeah yeah beyond\n\n01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.920\ncommunity fan she's like a she's like a she was like a Dan Harmon fan before\n\n01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:03.520\nthat was a thing and like and as a delightful young lady and like like\n\n01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:09.560\nreally like like like smart and cool and balanced and and she came to our\n\n01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:13.760\nwedding and like I mean she's she's like a friend she's not like she's more than\n\n01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:18.720\na fan she's like a friend and she she she was in LA like getting her degree in\n\n01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:24.040\npost-production and I brought her over to community and we were hanging out we're\n\n01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.640\ndoing the stuff and like we're all like let's go let's go out and get a drink and\n\n01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.480\nall this stuff and Marissa's like I gotta pack up my shit I got my truck full of\n\n01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:34.760\nshit and all this stuff blah blah blah she like Marissa's coming to meet us at\n\n01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:40.120\nthis restaurant to have a drink and she was moving that day all their stuff was\n\n01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:43.920\npacked in her car she gets in this terror well not terrible but like like like I\n\n01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:51.320\nmean all it was a scary in a car accident like it was and she's freaking out\n\n01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.760\nbecause she's young and like like like every anyone freaks out when they get a\n\n01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:58.760\ncar accident but your first one and you're out of town and your shit's in the\n\n01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:04.000\nback seat and like you don't you're just you she was like she was really\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000\nfreaking out and Spencer and Steve ran over there and like Steve I didn't fucking\n\n01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.240\ngo I was like she was like a block from the restaurant and I was like Steve\n\n01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:22.120\nSpencer they're like your angels to your Charlie tell her tell her I'll cover\n\n01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:26.400\ncover the insurance bill whatever you know like I'll like throw money at shit\n\n01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:31.240\nbut I'm not like I don't have a heart I'm a horrible heartless villain and it's\n\n01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:35.480\nnot true and these guys ran over I thank you I'll you get a bonus for this\n\n01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:42.520\nsaying that the the but but anyways but that just talking about like Spencer's\n\n01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.360\nlike Spencer puts his money where his mouth is in terms of a personality\n\n01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:49.600\nbecause like he Steve's account of it was like not only did Spencer go over\n\n01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:55.680\nthere and help out but actually like at every every accident scene there's like\n\n01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.160\nthe very little flaw in our justice system where it's like two people collide\n\n01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.360\nno one knows who fault it is like two civil servants show up that's traumatic\n\n01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.600\nyeah two people are traumatized like two guys with badges and guns show up and\n\n01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.880\nthey basically are a judge jury like that's basically ends with them like\n\n01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.120\nthey have to get out of the car like make their decision Spencer was so like\n\n01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:23.160\nthey were so taken with Spencer that he's so he was so warm and like yeah it's\n\n01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:27.640\nI'm pretty sure like we all have our qualities like like they're kind of our\n\n01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:32.520\nlead qualities and also I think that we're all good people but I don't I don't\n\n01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:37.360\nI don't know very many people thank you I don't know very many people that the\n\n01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:41.360\nlead quality that would say about them I know some but Spencer is one of the\n\n01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:44.640\nfew people I know that I would the first quality I say he's good Spencer is a\n\n01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:49.320\ngood person and like not that we're not good people but he leads with good and\n\n01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:53.280\nhe's and you said it Steve that he's a moral person I think that he has an\n\n01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.280\nintense moral compass which I think is very yeah he wants to do the right thing\n\n01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.560\nand he thinks about that a lot he doesn't want to do the popular thing he\n\n01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:02.320\ndoesn't want to even do the thing I think I fall short of that where I'm like\n\n01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.560\nwhat do most people think is the right thing I want to do that if they're\n\n01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.800\nlooking Spencer doesn't hesitate Spencer knows what's the right thing Spencer is\n\n01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:16.280\nlike he doesn't give the panhandlers but does jump out of his car to give to the\n\n01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:21.680\npeople that are going through recycling bins getting shit even though they might\n\n01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.160\ntell him to go fuck himself because they didn't ask for anything but he's giving\n\n01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:28.680\nthem money because he's you know he's like puzzling through in his head like\n\n01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:33.080\nhow do you actually use your pocket change to like help society actually\n\n01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:38.040\nthat sounds kind of draconian and like and randish but but but but but I mean\n\n01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:42.160\nhe thinks about morality he thinks about being a good person and he and he\n\n01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:47.200\nalso like yeah he like I could picture him like I would I would fucking like\n\n01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.120\nthat's why I didn't go over there I'm like there's gonna be hysterical people\n\n01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.600\ngetting out of cars pointing at each other and shrieking this is your fault\n\n01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:56.800\nno it's your fault and there's gonna be two douchebag cops who like don't don't\n\n01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:59.320\nknow what to do but they're gonna file their little report and all this shit's\n\n01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.720\ngonna be handled by insurance companies and I don't want anything to do with\n\n01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:04.480\nthis shit just tell me who to write to check out to and I don't fucking care\n\n01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.400\nSpencer went over there with his little cargo shorts and his flannel shirt\n\n01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.680\nit's probably the reason why the cops were basically like you know it's probably\n\n01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.040\nthe other ladies fault because because she was screaming bloody murder and\n\n01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:19.480\nMarissa was like traumatized and freaking out have this lady like\n\n01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:24.880\nshrieking at her well not at her but like about her to the cops and and like\n\n01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:29.840\nbut Spencer was just like I don't well you were there yeah yeah first thing I\n\n01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:35.920\nsaw was you know Marissa was noticeably upset and her car was totaled like it\n\n01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:40.720\nwas destroyed and Spencer like the first thing he did he walked over and he gave\n\n01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:44.680\nher this big hug and he's like it's gonna be okay you know like we're gonna\n\n01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:49.840\nwhatever whatever happens like you know you're you're healthy and you know it's\n\n01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:58.240\na vehicle it's aluminum I don't know what is it aluminum steel aluminium yeah\n\n01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:02.400\nhe's like you know you're everything's gonna be okay and she you know she's\n\n01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.200\njust had all these things going through her head like you know how am I pay for\n\n01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:09.720\nall this I gotta get a new car like it's always me that's the answer I'm gonna\n\n01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:17.560\npay for it that's my morality and Spencer is centers like well one thing at\n\n01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:20.440\na time you know like let's let's get through this whole process with the\n\n01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:24.640\npolice and I know this woman's like an insane person right now and she won't\n\n01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:29.440\neven talk to you she wasn't she wouldn't even look at Marissa's face like Marissa\n\n01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:35.360\nwould say like I'm you know I'm sorry trying to like talk to this woman so\n\n01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:39.160\nthey can like come to some kind of an agreement but she wouldn't even talk to\n\n01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:43.440\nher it was really terrible but Spencer is there through the whole thing and the\n\n01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:47.700\ncops showed up and if I ever got a car accident I would want somebody who's\n\n01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:51.080\ngood at logic and maps to go well there's no way the car could have gone\n\n01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:55.880\nthere because the car cars only moves at this rate per second like but Spencer\n\n01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.520\nwas like that so he examined before the cops even got there he examined the\n\n01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:03.720\ndamage of Marissa's car and the woman's car of course he did and and he and he\n\n01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:08.400\nwas like okay Marissa like well like like take me through it like what what\n\n01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.680\nhappened you know and so she was like you know this guy I was in the left most\n\n01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:16.760\nlane and the guy it was we're at a red light and the guy waved me on because I\n\n01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:21.400\nhad my blinker on to turn to get into the next lane and she so this guy was\n\n01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.040\nstopped and Marissa went into the next lane he you know he held up traffic for\n\n01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.960\nher to move on and her car I guess like she you know she looked and she said\n\n01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:37.760\nanother blinker to move into the to the right most lane and this car just whizzed\n\n01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:43.880\nup and just nailed her and so this Spencer looked at the damage and he goes\n\n01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:51.680\nshe was definitely speeding or texting like you know like you know he so you\n\n01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:56.840\nknow Spencer CSI yeah it's the kind of thing she was like you know I shouldn't\n\n01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:02.200\nhave cut across two lanes but Spencer's like but for the amount of damage that\n\n01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:06.920\nhappened here she was doing something illicit like there's something wrong and\n\n01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:10.560\nthen the cops came and they Marissa was totally honest with them you know I cut\n\n01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:13.560\nacross three like two lanes or whatever it was and they're like yeah you should\n\n01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:19.160\nyou shouldn't do that but at the same time they were like ma'am were you looking\n\n01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:25.000\nat your phone were you texting no I was texting you know like just from Miami it\n\n01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.080\nwas legal there until last year you could like look at your phone or like text on\n\n01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.320\nyour phone just a crazy place don't go to Miami\n\n01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:37.880\nwell leavey but right so aside from noticing how awesome Spencer is yeah\n\n01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:44.240\nyour your your talents include helping me edit like the last half of season 6

saying there\n\n01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:22.320\nwere times when I would have phoned it in and then like like like Steve had that\n\n01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:26.320\nenthusiasm which is also like Chris McKenna before him and Ruthie Aslan the\n\n01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:31.280\neditor like I am I am at the mercy of people who at the moment of my\n\n01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:35.840\nexhaustion and the
