00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
There is a ghost who lives in Harmontown

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
From Hollywood, California

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
There is a ghost who lives in Harmontown

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
The Mid-Melt Theater and Meltdown Comics

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Touchdown Boulevard

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Harmontown is now in session

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
There is a ghost who lives in Harmontown

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Happy Birthday Shawna

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Shawna Tova told all of our Jewish people listening out there

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Let's bring out our Game Master, Shawie, Mrs. Spencer, Quintengan

00:36.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh yeah

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
As he scampers nimbly across the stage, looking at mountain goats

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
Let's also welcome the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Thank you

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Thank you very much

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You're too kind

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
What does that mean?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Well, it's humility

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
You're too kind

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, I don't deserve it

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
What am I, George Carlin?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Deconstructing the...

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
What am I, Andy Kindler?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
What am I, what am I guy?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
That's an Andy Kindler joke

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
We've got to have Andy back on

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I'm very excited tonight

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
We have a best-selling author

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
He's written a landmark book

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I don't know what you'd call it

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
It kind of bridges, I mean, for those of you

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
For those few of you in the Harmontown demographic

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Who may be somewhere on the spectrum

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Those rare couple of you

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
You might be aware of a sort of

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Odd kind of tension that exists between

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
The actually autistic, which is a hashtag that is used

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
You know, actually autistic

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
And the really, really beleaguered, frantic

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Sometimes heroic, sometimes unintentionally

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Villainous parents of autistic children

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
It's one of the most ironically divided

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Realms I find

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Ever since I've been writing

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
The character of Abbott and community

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Have sort of been drawn into this world

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And fascinated by it

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
And this guy wrote this book

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
It makes holding hands

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Across that schism somehow possible

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
It's a really good book

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
If you've ever had questions about autism

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
What the hell it is

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Which we all do because in the 70s

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
We were cattle prodding children still

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Like, well, we can talk about that

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
They were called tingle sticks

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
And it was one of the most popular

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
The guy that adventured

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
That treatment method was a hero

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
To some of the most loving parents in the world

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Because he represented a light at the end of a tunnel

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
And it was so exciting

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Zapping kids for not hugging you

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And then low and behold after a while

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
They start hugging you

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
It was looked at

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
How much voltage was coming out of the tingle stick

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
It was tingley

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
It was a modified cattle prod I assume they

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't know how you calibrate it

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
With an autistic child

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Because that's a mistake, right?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
You can't calibrate it with an autistic kid

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
You're going to zap him and go

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
What do you think?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
And he's going to be like

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Lemons

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
All right

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Maybe up the voltage

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
That sounds like a joke-making light of autism

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
But obviously, I care

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Obviously

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Obviously

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Isn't that obvious, people?

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
I mean, I read the whole fucking audio book

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
It's like 12 hours long

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Wait, you finished it?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I did by listening to it at double speed

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Nice

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So when I told the guy

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I thought you sounded like Martin Scorsese

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Well, so you can read it

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
You can hear it at double speed

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
And it still scans

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Like you can still dig it

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, maybe I'm autistic

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, no

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I've tried this with other books

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I tried this with the Scientology book

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And I found myself having to slow it down

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
But I don't know if it's just the language

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Of his writing

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Is a great journalist

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I'd love to talk to him about that, too

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I spent so much time reading his book

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
That I didn't research his career

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Which is probably kind of awesome, too

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
He's just a great journalist

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
But here's what the book sounds like

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
At double speed

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
In the context of a conference

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
And the experience proved to be a revelation

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
In ways that they could do

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Down from the outside

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Not all that much happened

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
They booed up cups of tea

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
That would still be sitting there hours later

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Cold on the floor

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Because they suddenly forgot what to do with tea

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
But not distracted

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Scorsese, right?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
My influence isn't that departed

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I'm largely a Hitchcockian

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
But people don't know that

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
The thing about Hitchcock is

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
He loved revelation

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
He loved revelation

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
He loved revelation

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
But anyways

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Whatever

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm in a great mood

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
My wife is coming home tonight

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
She missed her flight yesterday

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm a little concerned

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
But I've been seeing the picture

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
She has lost a stone

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Not a kidney stone

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Damn

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
She's lost 14 pounds or more

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Which apparently the Irish

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
People use stones to weigh stuff

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Which doesn't seem scientific

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Because they come in and all

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
I mean, which which stone?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Could be a heavy one

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Ha ha ha ha ha

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Did they round up or down

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
To the nearest stone?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't even know

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
If what you're doing is a joke

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I'm not asking an honest question

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Well, I don't know what a stone is

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
He weighs seven stone

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
What is a stone?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Metrically, what is a stone?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
20 pounds

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Right

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
So yeah, so you weigh seven stones

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
What if you weigh 125 pounds?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
She lost a stone and I think

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
He may have found it

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
While she was gone

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It was inside a donut

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And I like, I took a bath tonight

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And I was like scrub a scrub scrub

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Like, like, because I really, I literally

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
All right, like, I'm accustomed to the fact

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
That this will elicit a reaction

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
But in honor of our, of the book

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
We'll be discussing tonight

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I say this, I don't care

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
I haven't taken a shower since she left

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Oh, I got whistles

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
That's five weeks

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
People are shocked when they hear

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
How little I am capable of showering

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Is that five weeks?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I don't, yeah, yeah, yeah

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Yeah, yeah

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Like, I never thought about it

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
I never did it

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
You know, maybe my chiropractor

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Was probably like, ugh, it's like

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
It's like a pin cushion

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
Full of stink pins

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I know my chiropractor has OCD

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And like, I know I must be

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I must constantly challenge his career path

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Every time I leave his office

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
He must be like, why, why, why

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Why do I have to care about the human back

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
So much that this man isn't my life

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Because I like, every time I come into the office

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I have to, because you go, you face a table

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And then it goes, brrr, and you go down

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
But I have to empty my pockets

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
And my pockets are always just like

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
There's just like, you know, random drugs

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And like, beer bottle caps

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
And like, house keys

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
And just like wads of money

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And he, he always like, he always

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Look on his face, he's like

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
I might as well be the baby rats

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And he always goes like, he goes like

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You have a little bit of lint on your shirt

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
And I'm like, if he's noticing lint on my shirt

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
He wants to hang himself

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Because here's some other stuff on my shirt

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Five weeks of residue, you know

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Blood stains from my back acne

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm not compatible with a, and he's like

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Boy, if my mom saw that, like one time

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
He said about like all my stuff

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Like he's like, you gotta get a money clip

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Like, you keep telling me that, but 42

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I think, I think, I think, I think

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I think everything's kind of baked up here

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Like I, I got my phone

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
And I got my pocket that has all of my money

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
My wads of money

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And I also feel like I probably lose

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Like $600 a week, which is fair to me

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
It feels like karmic, like, like, like, like

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Because do you give to panhandlers

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Or, and encourage panhandling

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Or as Spencer does, do you pull over

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
When you see a guy recycling cans

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And, like, throw money at him

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
That he didn't ask for it

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
To encourage industriousness

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
R.W.B.F. Skinner is our job

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
To program the homeless with our money

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
The actual solution is just ooze so much cash

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
That you randomly just, like, you just

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
It just comes out of you, like

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
It's actual trickle down

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah, yeah

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Yes, with Reagan was alive today

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
He would be like, this is what I meant

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
The Star Wars initiative

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
That was the idea of, like

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
The Star Wars space station was trickle down

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Justice, right?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
We're going to trickle everything down

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
So Erin's coming back

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
She may actually walk in during the show

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
She landed at 7.30

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I got a text, it may have been, no

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Did you do a little arts and crafts project at home?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I did, I did a...

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, I cut out Welcome Home

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Out of letters

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
And hung them from a string

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Bare minimum

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Right?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
But I really wanted to be there when the dogs are

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Because I feel like they're...

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah, that would be YouTube-able

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
That's what's important

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
I'm a little nervous about, like

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I don't know, you know

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Did you speak every day or talk or text?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
No, because I'm not good on the phone

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And FaceTime's weird, like

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
She gets punished for calling me or FaceTiming me

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Because I'm like, I wouldn't be able to be with Erin

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I wouldn't be married to Erin

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
If text messaging wasn't invented

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You know, I wouldn't be anything

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I don't think if I...

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
They didn't come up with a technology

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
That allowed me to, like, you know

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Because someone calls you on the phone

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Especially FaceTime is especially, like

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
It's just the worst

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Isn't it the worst of all possible worlds?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Because it's like, you can't...

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
In a normal face-to-face conversation

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
You have the option of minimized eye contact

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
You can't do that with FaceTime

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
You can't look at a George Jetson screen

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
And then just look away

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
You have to lock eyes with a deck of card-sized

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Version of your wife and, like, stare at her

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And then it'll be like

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, then what did you do?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Then I drank some water

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
It's just not my wife

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
This is an image of my wife

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Okay

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And then, inevitably, the other person on the other end

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Goes like, alright

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Which means

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
You don't love me

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
And I'm always like, like, like, what?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
What? And they're like, what?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And I'm like, do you mean I don't love you?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Like, what?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
It's bad

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
FaceTime is bad for me

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
So, no

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
And that's all I... I don't know

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
But then, on the other hand, like, my cat, Fiv

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Like, she's sick

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
And, like...

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
So then, like a...

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Like an, you know, like an emotionally, like, kind of

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Stunted person

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Like, the reason we like animals is because they make a convenient, like

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Because they can't, you know, you just... So, of course, I'm like

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Balling about the cat

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I, like, punched a wall, which I haven't done in 20 years

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
There's a big hole in the bedroom wall

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And I was like, like, rolling around in the bed going

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Ah!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I recorded myself crying

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Because halfway through it, I was like, this sounds fake

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Well, you...

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
You can separate those two parts of your brain that well

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
And, like, you're going through such a weird cry that...

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah, no, because it was weird, because I haven't done this in 10 years

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I don't even remember crying, like, like this

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Let's see

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
It's going to sound like Scorsese

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Is this...

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Wait, there's nothing I need to do, right?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
I'll just come out of the speaker, grandpa

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Say, I don't know if...

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
What's going on?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
The suspense is palpable

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I don't hear anything

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I must have done...

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Is this a voice memo or...?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Did I do it wrong?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Oh!

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Oh...

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh...

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Oh...

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Oh...

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Oh...

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Oh...

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Oh...

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Oh...

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Oh...

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Oh...

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Oh...

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Oh...

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Are you a basset, huh?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Oh...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Oh...

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh...

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Oh...

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Oh...

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Oh...

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Oh...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Oh...

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh...

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Oh...

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Oh...

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Oh...

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
That's the cry of somebody that doesn't cry enough

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
That's why I recorded it

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I wanted to talk to my therapist

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I'm like, okay, this is fucked up

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
My wife's been gone for a month

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
When she calls me on the phone, she walks away from it

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
feeling unloved

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
The fucking cat that I've totally neglected

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
That's why it's dying, because I don't...

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
That was incredibly ill when you found it

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
It was already...

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
It was FIV positive, but I'm saying

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Once we got the dogs, it was like

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
You need to take that feline shit to the curb

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Girl friend

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I don't know why I pause before friend

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I was trying to think of maybe girl fiv

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
That's her name

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
She's been neglected since the dogs arrived

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I have not

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
She's been chased away

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
by the dogs

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
She's repelled by the dogs

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Particularly Harvey

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
When I come over, she comes right at me

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
When the dogs are upstairs with you and I'm downstairs

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
She comes at me and she's like

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I need a friend really bad

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
She's so bony

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
She spends a lot of time outside

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
the front door where the dogs can't get at her

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Every time you...

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
It's a bummer, but I just want to be honest

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
about that

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Because the important thing about that

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
is like, okay, this is not...

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Let's not celebrate this as a man's bond

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
between him and his cat

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
This is symptomatic of

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
misappropriated emotional funds

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
You know

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And I shared that with my therapist

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And I had a really good session based on that

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And she said, you know, it's time

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
It's time for the chapter

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
called Dan Doesn't Have Feelings

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
to come to an end

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And I'm gonna...

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I know how to breathe

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
And I'll learn how to

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I'll learn how to talk to

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Aaron

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
about how much I love her

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
and

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
kind of spread that peanut butter

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
of feeling

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
across the

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
bread of life

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Speaking of which

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Happy Rosh Hashanah

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I think that's what Rosh Hashanah means

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
the bread of life, right?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
There's no greater tragedy

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
than the life unleavened

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
than the life unleavened

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I think

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Famous Jewish cooking host

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Emerald Berg

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
What said

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Alright

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Let's talk to our guest

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
about some autism

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
His book is called Neuro-Tribes

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
It's truly...

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
It's the first determined

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
thorough and enlightening

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
journalistic investigation

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
of a phenomenon that is still a mystery

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
to everybody

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
It's a New York Times bestseller

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
He has flattered us by coming up from San Francisco

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
His name is Steve Silberman

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
There's a microphone

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Hello

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Hello

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Hi, nice to be here

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Are you...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Are you gonna sit down?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
He's settling in

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Is that better?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Sorry

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Sorry I was off putting

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
No, no, no, it's fine

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
There are no rules here except the ones you make

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
And I'm strangely

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
adamant about them

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Now I feel like I have to say

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
you don't have to sit down

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Steve, what you don't know is

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Dan, when a guest comes out, he takes the opportunity

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
to sit down himself

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
He doesn't want to be robbed of that repose

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
That's great

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I was kind of scared or delighted

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
that you were going to launch into just 10 minutes

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
about airline food or something

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
because you were just standing there with the mic

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
He's going to do stand-up

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
High chairs slightly scare me

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
One wonders if I'm going to teeter off

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I wish we could

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
That's a good segue into our talk

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
about autism

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Because the big theme

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
in the book is the realization

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
which is ironically realized

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
long after Hans Asperger

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
said it originally

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
His feelings

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
on the subject lost to the ages

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
until recently

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It's less about

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
diagnosis and treatment than it is about realizing

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
that there's different kinds of brains

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
and there's a lot of ways we can

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
make the environment compatible

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
to anybody that we happen to run across

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
That's true

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Basically in 1930s Vienna

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
he started seeing these kids in his clinic

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
who were interestingly mischievous

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
They would steal a bunch of shit

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
to build up their chemistry sets

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
They would get kicked out of schools

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
because they didn't take the teacher seriously

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It was sort of a clinic of last resort

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
One kid was

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
there's a typical thing

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
especially with mildly autistic people

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
is

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
obsession with

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
particular areas

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
One kid was obsessed with poison and was there

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
because he had stolen cyanide from his school

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
There were red flags

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Exactly

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Some of the kids ended up there

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
through the court system and stuff

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
The thing about this clinic was that

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
it was amazingly progressive place

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
because it was half clinic, half school

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Kids wouldn't just bring

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
kids wouldn't just get brought there

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
for diagnosis or whatever

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
The people who worked in the clinic actually lived

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
with the kids and observed them

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
tying their shoes in the morning

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
if they could or couldn't

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
That's how they learned to recognize autism

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Asperger and his colleagues

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
believed that autism and autistic traits

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
were very common

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
In fact

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
that people with autistic traits had been

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
accelerating the evolution of science

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
technology and culture

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
millennia

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
and we're already familiar

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
to all of us through the sort of pop culture

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
archetypes of the absent minded professor

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Dr. Who

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Right, well that wasn't invented yet

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
but autistic people would soon

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
make sure that it was

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
It's not a character

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
but I mean before the word

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Asperger which by the way it should be noted

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Asperger did not

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
He didn't discover Asperger syndrome

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
He discovered what we now call the autism spectrum

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And was saying in the beginning

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
This is a spectrum

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
and it was later

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
what was it the 70's when somebody coined

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
the phrase Asperger syndrome?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, and that was a marketing term

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
actually because it was

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
an autism diagnosis that did not contain

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
the word autism

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
and one of the reasons why it proved

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
to be so popular was that

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
it did not carry the heavy burden of shame

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
and stigma that the word autism

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
carried because parents

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
had been blamed for autism not by

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Asperger, one might note

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
by Leo Connor

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
the Edison to

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Asperger's Tesla

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
in the discovery of autism

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
was a parallel I kept thinking about

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
What an appropriate parallel

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Because Edison was the more successful one

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
he was the more neurotypical one

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
and he was better at issuing press releases

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
and he was

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
He was American

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
and he had two advantages over Asperger

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
He was, even though he actually

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
was from Eastern Europe too, he lived

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
in America, he worked at Johns Hopkins Hospital

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
in Baltimore, but

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
even better from the

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
perspective of history, he didn't work for Nazis

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
like Hans Asperger did

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Because Hans Asperger's wonderful clinic

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
in the University of Vienna Hospital

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Well, it happened to be in a country

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
that the Nazis marched into

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
in 1938 to annex

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
for the German fatherland

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and so at that point Asperger's

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
position in his culture became

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
very, very tricky

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
because the Germans, inspired by the way

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
by American eugenics

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
scientists, were attempting to

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
basically flush

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
people with hereditary diseases

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
and disorders out of the gene pool

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
This is one of the craziest things about this book

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
because it's completely unexpected

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
There's probably

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
whole entire books written about this stuff

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
but they're probably

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
tend towards conspiracy

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
dramas and things like this

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
but the cold hard facts are that

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
the things that Hitler's reading

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
while he's in jail, before he writes

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Mein Kampf, are coming from our

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
side of the Atlantic

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
We were becoming obsessed with eugenics

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
and

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
unashamed of them because

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
they didn't have the current stigma because

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
there weren't no Hitler yet

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
You describe

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
a conference where

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
it's like the world's fair

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
of eugenics

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
By the way, there was a slogan

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
in use at that conference which was

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
echoed in orphan black recently

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
the self-direction of human evolution

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
that creepy leaky guy

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
That was actually a real slogan from

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
the American eugenics movement

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and they had like the ideal

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
paragon of civilization

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
was this white athlete from Harvard

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
They had statues

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
They had composites made of the perfect man

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
which were based on the

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
ten handsomest guys from Harvard

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
or something

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Really

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
and it was

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
some of the speeches

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
some of the panels being done there

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
included titles like

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
the Jewish problem

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
and the Negro problem

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
and all kinds of stuff about Negroes

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
and what are they

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
and what do they want

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Why are they hanging around all of a sudden

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
It was

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
bone-chilling

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I was completely unexpected because hearing him

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
talking into a book about

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Temple Grandin but I'm seeing like this crazy

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Alan Moore

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
It feels like an alternate history where there should

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
be zeppelins in the sky

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
That was the thing man

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
There have been a million books written about

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Asperger's syndrome or autism or whatever

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
but they've usually looked at

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
autism through a strictly medical lens

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
and there's actually been

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
very very little written about Asperger

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
in his clinic and I thought

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
why hasn't anyone ever pulled the camera back

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
to see like the burning

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Jewish storefronts

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
You know

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
euthanasia going on

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
That's the irony is that

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
what the history is written by the winners

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
and the myth that favors us

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
is that

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
it was the 1920s

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
and late ladies loved short hair

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
and sitting on flagpoles

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
and FDR had a plan

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
for the kaleidoscope

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
and meanwhile

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
in Europe a growing menace

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Adolf Hitler invents anti-Semitism

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and slowly somehow manages

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
to convince half the planet

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
that it's a great idea

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
and we sort of

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
the absolute

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
ugly truth of it is that

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
there is an uplifting

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
aspect to it

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
an uplifting irony to the fact that

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
we're flirting with it in open air

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
inviting Jewish physicians

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
to a conference

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
to hear talk about the Jewish problem

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
they weren't banned from the thing it was like

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
let's just be anti-Semitic just because

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
it's fashionable you can't do anything about it

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Dr. Rosen

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Do you want to be a doctor or not?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Sure it couldn't hurt

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
and it's like well why do you talk like that

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
that's the title of my next conference

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
why are you so Jewish

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
and he's like

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
are you there enough?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Son of a Tovah

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
and it's the shadow that we cast

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
by being allowed to talk about it

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
by publishing books about it

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
by

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
the triple irony of

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
the euphemism of the word eugenics

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
which means the good birth

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
the fact that it took

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
what happened then

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
for everyone to be shamed

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
into a proper historical perspective

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
is it's simultaneously

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
totally cynical but also

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
kind of like well

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
good that's what you get

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
this is

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
language's thought

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
and thought is deed

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
and you can't just

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
walk around seething with hatred

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
and be polite about it

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
that is going to end up

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
being the same

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
as actual

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
bad physical things happening

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
and also at some point the Nazis must have been like

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
why are the Americans objecting to this

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
we are just putting their theories into practice

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
they must have absolutely

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
like Vonnegut used to use

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
they must have thought for a while

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
they could flip a coin

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
which side's America going to come in on

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
because we were certainly making money from both sides

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
selling oil and bullets

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
before we got into the war

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
so

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I'm sure there were rooms in the Nazi headquarters

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
where they were like

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
there's still a good 40% chance when they finally

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
come in

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
guys, Pearl Harbor, ah fuck

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
they're not going to be able to spin that one

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I guess they're

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
are we still? yeah, access of evil

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
why did we do that

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
what have we gotten

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
free sushi

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
it's bad by the time it gets here

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
it's 1939

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
free sushi

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
it's a good way to die

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
anyways

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
that's a huge

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
a huge weird side note

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
but you had to do it

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
you had to reshine

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
like long lost light

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
on that fact because

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Asperger

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
that it seems to be

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
one of the big answers to the question

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
why was this also complicated

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
and arduous

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
why is something that's being discovered way back then

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
still in the 70's being treated with cattle prods

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
and part of the answer is because

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Asperger is just like bound

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
to, you know, there's pictures of him

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
and there's swastika somewhere in the picture

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
but the story is worthy

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
of a

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Robert DeNiro movie or something

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
and the guy was a hero

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
he didn't like no Nazis

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
well he was a complex hero

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
he probably had to make some concessions

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
that we don't know about

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
to not have his head chopped off

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
basically

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
you don't mention any of those in your book

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
but you paint a picture of a guy who by virtue

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
of his love of these children

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
is absolutely horrified

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
by the idea and he's sort of

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
some of the ironic concessions

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Dan, could you use the word ironic more tonight?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
one of the stranger

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
and more poetic concessions

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
that he makes

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
he tries to

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
he tries to make a case for these kids

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
continuing to get treatment because they'll make

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
good code breakers one day

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
and if you think about it with Alan Turing

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
in a sense

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
we use the Aspergerian brain

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
to break the German codes

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
but they were too busy killing

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
the children that carried those genes

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
to make use of those talents

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
the children that invented

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
as they entered adulthood

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
if they were time and time again

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
it's like

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
on one hand we have to eschew the myth

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I don't think anyone suffers from this myth anymore

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
the idea that every single person with autism

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
has some kind of hidden superpower

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
like an ex-man

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
but it is true time and time again

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
that through environmental understanding

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
doing the equivalent

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
of a ramp

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
for someone as bound to a chair

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
which in this case

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
involves sort of opening your own mind

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
changing your own time scale

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
that

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
though the people

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
that suffer from childhood autism

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
that are raised in that patient of an environment

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
which is no easy thing in a capitalist world

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
though they

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
do flourish

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
they do learn how to communicate in their own

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
time and to the extent that

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
there is disparity between the way they communicate

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
the thoughts in their heads at mainstream society

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
they have

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
always been

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
it's not an exaggeration to say that they are

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
progressing our society

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
right and one reason why we didn't

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
know how cool autistic people could be

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
for a couple of decades

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
was that they were put in institutions

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
because the guy who took credit for discovering autism

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
who was not Hans Asperger

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
but this guy Leo Connor

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
said that even the special

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
talents of his kids like

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
this kid could recognize 18 symphonies

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
before he turned 2

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
he could correctly identify 18 symphonies

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
but Connor instead of saying

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
oh this is really cool

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
this is a specialized form of intelligence

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
which is what Asperger said

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
he called it autistic intelligence

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
but Connor said oh no no

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
these kids are just unloved

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
their parents are refrigerator mothers

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
and overambitious fathers

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
so the treatment is to remove the child

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
and put them in an institution

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
and have their family pictures taken out of the family albums

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
quietly and never mentioned again

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
one of the most chilling things is like

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
before the rise

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
between World War I and World War II

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
there's a German doctor who sends out a questionnaire

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
so we're still in a time

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
when if you're born with what we now call

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
autism you're called feeble minded

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
you're shuttled

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
into an institutional world

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
and you're a ward of the state

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
and you're a burden on the parents

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
emotionally and financially

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
and this doctor sends out this questionnaire

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
to the men of the household

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
specifically

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
and says

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
how would you feel

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
about an artificial shortening

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
of your child's life

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
to the extent that they're unable to

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
live with their disability

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
asking these sort of leading questions

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
about euthanasia

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
and not only was the response overwhelmingly

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
oh absolutely

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
but with an extra order

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
of macabre fries

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
that is I wish however

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
that you just wouldn't ask

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I wish you just killed the kid

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
and tell me it was natural causes

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
that would be

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
if you're looking for what I would like to order

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
from this menu

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
and we have to

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
you know

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
it's dark shit we don't have to sympathize

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
but we have to

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
we have to remember

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
what the fuck do we have to remember Dan shut up

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
it's hard

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
the world was ignorant

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
and the poor people were held responsible

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
for their

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
kids disabilities

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
and they were never

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
a ticket to increase social standing

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
you know I have an autistic kid

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
didn't mean oh maybe I should get a promotion

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
at work

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
and also at some point they were being bombarded

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
by propaganda that such children

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
were a burden on the state

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
and they would literally have pictures of these sort of

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
drooling maniacs from assignments

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
and saying 50 million Reich marks a year

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and so

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
they started doing it fairly publicly too

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
they didn't really hide it

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and they realized it was such bad PR

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
like nobody is going to sign off on that

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
even the hardest Nazi

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
household is not going to sign off

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
on the killing of German children

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
even if they are mentally disabled or whatever

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
and so then they just put it way on the

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
secrets

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
well right and in fact

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
something that I talk about in the book

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
is that the Germans really used

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
the killing of disabled children

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
and adults as a practice run

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
for Jews

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
that's how they figured out how to do

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
oh we can put the trains here

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
and move the bodies here

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
because the first one the gas van

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
the thing that they would do

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
they would put a pipe through the exhaust pipe

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
of a van that was for euthanasia

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
they had different techniques

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
they would slowly feed them less

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
that's a good thing

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
the specialist diet

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
and word got out

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
even though it was supposed to be a secret

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
when the feeble minded are gone

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
we will be the next to go

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
and children would run away from these buses

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
even though they weren't supposed to know what they were for

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
when they liberated I don't know if it was the Russians

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
or the Americans

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
we were closing in on Berlin at the end of the war

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and they liberated one of the camps

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
and they found loads of

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
twins

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
almost all the survivors were these twin children

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
because they were doing lots of tests on

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
twins and genetics

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
about like can we all sort of

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
find a way to fine tune

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
making perfect little Aryan children

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and they used the euthanasia program

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
to do the kinds of

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
esoteric medical experiments

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
that would have been impossible

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
in cases where the patient was expected to live

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
basically

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
what did you find

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
as you're delving into that

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
darkness

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
you're reading so many books

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
letters

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
you're knee deep in that world

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
did you come away with an impression

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
about what our obsession

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
with eugenics was

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
was it a genuine, was it face

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
value, a fear that we were going

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
to mongrelize ourselves

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
into extinction, or was it

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
was it just a

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
just a completely dishonest

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
do you know what, here's the deal

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
like while I was writing that chapter

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I saw an ad

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
from some startup dude

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
who was basically

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
selling some kind of new genomic scanning

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
technology

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
and he was talking about things like autism

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
and ADHD and dyslexia

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
as like glitches in the human program

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
and we can finally fine

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
tune our own code

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
so that we can eliminate these glitches

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
it was sort of like that's exactly

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
what eugenics came out of

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
the notion that we can perfect humanity

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
by eliminating difference

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
and again

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I'll use the word irony but

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
really fittingly because

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
the neurotypicals

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
that are the villains in this story if there are any

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
these neurotypicals were

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
just to find that word for me what does that mean

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
non-autistic people and that's a word

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
invented by autistic people

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
so it was sort of a hack because

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
it was a wonderful word because

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
instead of always being medicalized by us

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
that allowed them to

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
medicalize us

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
it was invented on the internet in the late 90s

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
so they seemed to have a capacity

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
for racism which is not founded on

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
logic

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
neurotypicals

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
isn't that a little strange

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I kept waiting

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
to hear stories about

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Hans Asperger

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
he was surrounded

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
by Nazis and completely incentivized

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
to toe the line

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
to the point where you're cautiously

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
assuming that if we saw every moment of his life

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
we probably would click our tongues

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
we probably would

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
and

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
but he

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
the weird thing is that

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
we have this tribe

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
of cognitively

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
variant people

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
who because of their seclusion

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
because

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
they tend to propel us

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
societally towards things like ham radio

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
which

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
we'll talk about that

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
in a second but how fascinating it is

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
how it just absolutely is

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
that autistic people have been trying to make

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
the internet since before there was internet

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
laying around

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
and that we all

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
love that world

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
we all love emoticons

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
we all love facebook

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
but in no uncertain terms

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
it's not because you've done the research now

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
so it might have been tacky

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
before reading this book to say

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
they invented the internet

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
autistic people invented the computer languages

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
that we use

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
but it's clear from your book

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I mean it is

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
it's a general fact that you can say

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
that's the thing before I wrote this book

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I wrote for 15 years for wired magazine

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
and so people were constantly saying

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
oh he's on the spectrum

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
oh Bill Gates he's on the spectrum

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Steve Jobs on the spectrum

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
and so I actually went to look to figure out

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
what the history was

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
what were these people who would now say would be

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
super geeks on the spectrum

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
what were they doing before there was an internet

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
computer through morse code

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
over ham radio

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
because there was no facial signals to parse

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
you could

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
obsess about your favorite technology

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
and really get rewarded for it

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
you could leave your old bullied

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
geeky, nerdly identity behind

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
and become like this amazing person on the internet

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
with your, or not the internet, ham radio

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
with your call letters

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
and so it was a strict

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
meritocracy like programming is

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
so it didn't matter if you were a total dork

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
like if you could do the shit

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
you were cool

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
and the ham radio

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
community and also the

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
science fiction fandom community

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
were both organized by the same guy

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
who I write about in the book

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
named Hugo Gernsback

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
who almost certainly had Asperger syndrome

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
and by the way I do want to say

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I'm not just diagnosing people willy nilly

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
like if I say in the book that somebody

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
probably had Asperger syndrome

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
there's always a higher authority involved

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
like Oliver Sacks

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
or in this case it's Hugo Gernsback's

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
biographer Gary Westfall believed he was

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Aspergian. Anyway

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
he was a very weird guy but he had a

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
genius idea which was to

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
make home electronics

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
available to hobbyists rather than

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
just scientists in other words

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
really cool kids like they could order

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
stuff from his mail order catalog

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
put it together and become a ham radio

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
operator and in those catalogs

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
there's pictures of nerdy kids

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
and now he sort of

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
developed this culture that when you look

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
back at the 50s you're like

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
the whole comic con

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
everything kind of all of a sudden comes

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
together it all snaps together

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
the culture of fandom

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
the culture of

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
overlapping with nerdiness

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
our consumption of pop culture

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
there's always been a fascination with

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
science fiction associated with

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
people on the spectrum and

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
it's because of the

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
ability to logically consume it

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
the fact that you're talking about

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
worlds built from scratch which can make more sense

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
than the confusing worlds described

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
in Catcher and the Rye or Freight Gatsby

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
it's like I guess he was rich

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
what am I learning from this book

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
whereas it's like

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Zeep Zanflord landed in his

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
space pod and stepped out it's like I can access

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
every aspect of this and I can

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
the first

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
fanzines and in fact the word fandom

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
the concept of fanaticism

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
fan groups and things that all came out of the ham radio culture

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
which was connected to this

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
this science fiction pulp

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
pulp culture

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
comic books and catalogs where you could buy

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
chemistry kits and

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
and it was all started by

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
a guy who clearly

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
wanted to create his own world

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
and not only that

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
but his best bud was Nikola Tesla

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Nikola Tesla had

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
the chops to design

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
that future world

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
that's why I wanted you to bring your book up

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
because that's one of the passages I was hoping you could

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
there's two passages I don't know

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
if you can willy-nilly like page them up

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
but one of them is

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Tesla talking about the future

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
describing

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
what the world

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
is going to be like

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
do you put Tesla on the spectrum

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
he wasn't neurotypical I actually don't

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
retro diagnose him but he had many many

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
autistic traits he was like fascinated with

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
glittering things

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
he was very very honest

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
so like when his two aunts

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
asked him who was more attractive

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
he said something like well you're not

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
you're not quite as ugly as the other

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
so he had that aspergian utter frankness

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
yeah

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
well I have a question but maybe we'll do after you

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
read this passage

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
if I can find it that is

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
maybe I can talk

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
here it is I got it

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
okay quote

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
when wireless meaning ham radio

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
when wireless is perfectly

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
applied the whole earth

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
will be converted into a huge brain

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Tesla told an interviewer

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
in 1926

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
we shall be able to communicate with one another

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
instantly irrespective of distance

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
not only this but through television

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
and telephony we shall see

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
and hear one another as perfectly as though we

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
were face to face despite

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
intervening distances of thousands of miles

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
FaceTime

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
and the instruments through which

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
we shall be able to do this will be

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
amazingly simple compared with our present

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
telephone a man will be able

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
to carry one in his vest pocket

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
we shall be able to witness

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
and hear events the inauguration

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
of a president the playing of a world series

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
game the havoc of an earthquake

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
or the terror of a battle just

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
as though we were present

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
this is 1926 people

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I mean on one hand

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
it seems like a no-brainer but yeah

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
kind of that's because we're on a podcast

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I mean

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
like Tesla again

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
it's like Tesla and Asperger both

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
probably not neurotypical

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
and their rivals their successful

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
trademarking like dominant

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
guys who

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
popular fringe culture

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
actually we're on

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
has it that Edison

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
there's backward things about

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
our current society that are

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
hard baked into it because Tesla's

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
like more

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
populist empowering

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I don't know

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
going back to AC versus DC

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
you know just Edison's proficiency

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
for trademarking and patenting

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
and his desire for hegemony

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
like conquering Tesla's

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
reclusive fanatical

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
desire for everything

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
to make sense

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
and one of Asperger's artistic traits

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
was that he was able to

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
resist peer pressure

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
so

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
while everybody else around him was

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
thinking in terms of eliminating difference

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
he said something like that

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
which is different from the norm is not necessarily

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
inferior which was a very

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
un-nazi like thing to say

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
because there's a skepticism so that's what I was seeing before

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
my train of thought got

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
remarkably

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
tangentialized

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
this idea that

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
it's the neurotypical

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
of the world who

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
seem to have a gift for

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
politics, racism

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
war

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
seduction

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
charm I guess

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
diplomacy

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
white lies, flattery

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
yeah, fashion

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
hygiene

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
like

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I'm sitting right here

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
they

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
but the weird thing about it is

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
these are all

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
like

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
these are all things

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
if an autistic kid

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
wants to memorize a map of Los Angeles

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
my friend Chris McKenna has

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
a couple of autistic loved ones in his family

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
describing

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
one of their obsession

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
with road maps and things

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and every time he meets somebody he asks him

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
where are they coming from and where are they going

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
and then that's his conversation

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
is that instead of small talk

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
he can tell them about our route

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
to take next time they drive

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
can I just jump in and tell a little anecdote

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I went to an autistic retreat

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
so I was one of the very few

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
neurotypical people with like

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
about 70 autistic people of all ages

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
and the second day that I was there

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I went up to a guy who I thought was cool

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
the night before and I said

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
hey man, how'd you sleep? and he said

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
why?

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
it was like

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
an excellent question

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
and I realized like how much

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
fucking energy

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I put into like reputation management

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
like every time I walk into a room

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
hi, how'd you sleep? I'm charming

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
you know

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
wow

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I have to share this

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
because

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
and I have no idea what the person I'm talking about is

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I'm not certainly not qualified to diagnose

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
anything but there's such a

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I had an encounter

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
where I went up to somebody at a party and I said

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I stood next to him

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
and I was like this guy

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
he gets picked down by people

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I love him

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I'm an outcast, I'm gonna log some hours here

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I'm gonna be a wonderful guy

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
and like

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I'm gonna talk to him, not

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
cool people

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
and so I stand next to him and I look around the party

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
and I go wow, looks like everybody's here

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I just spent the next eight minutes

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
in a monologue

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
about how I'm like

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
well I didn't get the list of people

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
that should be here, I wouldn't be able to compare

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
the thing, it was

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
maddening because in my mind I was thinking

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
you little prick

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I'm stupid here

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
you know

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
and it's like that happens on a cellular level all the time

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
in interactions but like

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
what's at the core of it of course when you take a step back from it

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
is like you said

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
why am I asking how someone slapped

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
we could have spent that

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
time inventing something

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I love the

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
early science fiction fandom

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
nickname for neurotypicals was

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
the mundane

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
and so it's like

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
those are the people who think they rule the world

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
the mugwumps

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
how easy is it to go back and

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
reverse diagnose people

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
are there certain

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
can you look back at Dostoevsky or Chaucer

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
are these people like

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
are there a way

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
to kind of definitively say

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
or you can kind of guess

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
well

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
some people are much more promiscuous

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
about their retro diagnosing than I am

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
like I'm a science writer

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
so I have to be strict

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
is there an etiquette, that's another thing

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
like when I was in Wired and I did that interview

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
where I told the guy at the end of the interview

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I was like by the way and I took a quiz online

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
and it's like maybe I don't know that

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
and seeing an imprint I'm like so tacky

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and where there's tackiness there must be etiquette

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
is there a guiding principle for

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
no

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
some people seriously self-diagnosed

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
and you know

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I believe it's called self-diagnosed peer supported

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
in the autistic community

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
so it's like basically if you're

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
if you're allegedly autistic peers say

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
yes you are like us

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
then it's cool

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
if you just declare

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
yourself autistic

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
and there's no sort of

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
no one to gauge yourself against it's not as cool

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
but the thing that I'll say is

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
people often say to me

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
don't you think we're just diagnosing

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
weird kids too much you know

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I don't actually believe that

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
because virtually everyone who I've met

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
who had an official diagnosis

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
really did need like

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
special forms of support and whatever

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
and had a hard time

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
passing among the mundane

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
in the beginning of your book

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
talking about

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
the emergence of the concept

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
of neurodiversity which is simply to say

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
that ADHD

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
dyslexia all these things

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
by the way all of my friends and so they're like

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Justin Roiland definitely ADHD

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
co-creator of this cartoon I made

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
like Joel McHale dyslexic

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Rob Schrab dyslexic like probably ADD too

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
like every those

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
those letters kind of like

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
if you live in Los Angeles and you make stuff

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
you're always like

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
interesting thing about your book is that you don't have to now think

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
am I being tacky and fashionable

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
by diagnosing it's just

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
well these are traits these are

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
these are autistic traits you know like

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
whatever which are not rare which are shared by everybody

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
right and I mean

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
when I first came across your

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
community here

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I thought that it was kind of like looking

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
at broad swaths of the spectrum

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
through the other end of the telescope

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
like most people look at

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
you know autism only through the medical

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
end of the telescope

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
you know but if you look at it through the cultural

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
like that's why I called my book neuro tribes

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
instead of like

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
some word related to disorder

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
like I don't claim to know what the order

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
of the universe should be

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
so I avoid the word disorder

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
but it's there's

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
and if you just wanted to sell books you would have called it titties

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
there you go

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
titties inside

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
neurotitties

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
it's a pop-up book

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
someone's buying that domain name right now

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I would bet you anything

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
it already exists

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I think I'm cutting you off to

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
talk about what you were trying to talk about

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
which is that you describe yourself

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
as profoundly neurotypical

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
you're very very

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
outgoing friendly and you admire

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
you're a fan of the autistic community

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
as I also

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
am in your case

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
it's not so much out of a sense of kinship

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
it's almost like a sibling

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
kind of you actually admire

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
the things

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
the qualities that you do not have

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
exactly great minds

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
do not necessarily think a lot

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
and so you've been a messenger

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I mean your book that you've written you've surely noticed

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
that the autistic community

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
tell me if I'm wrong

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
or write about this because that's how I found your book

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
because I just check in with the autistic community

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
because I find them amazing

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
and fascinating and especially in regards

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
to their conflict with groups like Autism Speaks

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
and the ironies that ensue

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I've read more than one

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
essay by an autistic adult

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
sort of celebrating

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
and also rolling their eyes

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
at the fact that it took a neurotypical

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
to be the Marco Polo of Autism's China

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
that's true

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
now these parents are listening

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
that won't listen to us because a neurotypical

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
wrote a New York Times bestseller

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
well at my

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
book launch I was very very happy

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
to see we had a party in the

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Haydn Ashbury in San Francisco where I lived

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
and I was very very happy to see

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
actually autistic people

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
in the audience

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
because usually there's like this huge divide

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
between like the autism speaks

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
parents and the clinicians

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
and the autistic people

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
but kind of everybody was

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
in the same room there

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
and what was really great was

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
at some point in the Q&A afterwards

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
somebody asked me like

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
what do you think the virtues of getting a diagnosis

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
in midlife are

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and so while I'm thinking about it I'm thinking like

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
who the fuck

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I'm not supposed to answer that question

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
we have experts here

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
you know I asked if there was anybody

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
in the autistic section

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
sort of they were sitting together

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I wanted to answer the question

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
and this woman stood up and she said

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
getting a diagnosis in midlife

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
was like finding the Rosetta Stone

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
to myself

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
was like holy fuck

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I couldn't have come up with that

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
is there a lot of tribal pride

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
among autistic

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
well there is now

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
but that's after decades of like being brutalized

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
and exterminated

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
and you know I mean yeah

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
are there groups of like

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
autistic people like playing World of Warcraft

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
in a room right now going this fucking mundane

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
call me up earlier and like

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
is it fun for them to rib us about being neurotypical

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
sure definitely

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
and not only that like one of the first things

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
that I figured out by going to that

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
autistic retreat was that

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
most of the clinical stereotypes about autistic people

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
were completely wrong like there's this

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
belief that autistic people like lack a sense

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
of irony don't get satire

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
and they don't really have a sense of humor

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
and so this one

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
autistic guy who had just been appointed to the National

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Council on Disability

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Ariniaman of the autistic self advocacy

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
network was introduced to the group

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
and so

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
they were doing flap pause

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
which is this

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
it's like turning this stigmatized behavior

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
into a symbol of celebration

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
and so from the back this girl said

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
flap pause

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
it was nice because it also doesn't create

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
this startling burst of sound

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
that freaks them out you know

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
so from the back of the room this young woman said

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
we love you Ari

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
if we were capable of feeling such an emotion

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
hahahaha

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
yeah the

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
the myth of the no feeling thing

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I think that simply comes from

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
the fact that there's this

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
weird skepticism and I keep coming back

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
to this thing I never get to finish

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
this thought because I don't really know what this thought is

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
and it's something to do with the fact that

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
well if you want to be systemic about life

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
like

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
the actual Spock

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
if he was a real alien being

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
that thought logically about things

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
would he or would he not

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
be in favor of eugenics

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
like because when you apply

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
cold this concept of the cold hard

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
logic and he's a

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
human calculator

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
but obviously not

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
honestly not

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
there's more to it than that

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
there's one other passage

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
if you can find it it would be earlier in your book

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
it's about that guy

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
the Tesla of chemistry

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Henry Cavendish

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
yeah my book

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
opens unexpectedly

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
about 200 years ago

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
because that allowed me to describe

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
a very autistic person

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
before there were these layers of clinical cliches

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
yeah

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I have the reactions of the other people around him

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
who had no idea

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
what to make of his fascinating peculiarities

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
or whatever

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
and he was a guy who took

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
the same walk at the same time every night

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
wore the same clothes every day

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
when they would wear out he would tell his tailor

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
to make an identical outfit

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
he ate the same dish at every meal

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
leg of mutton

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
there was a chamber maid

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
who surprised him on the steps

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
with a broom and so he ordered

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
a new set of steps

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
so that it wouldn't happen again

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
that's not the same cold hard logic

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
that goes into genocide

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
there's no laziness there

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
he practically

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
invented science

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
he measured

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
the density of the earth

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
in a shack in his backyard

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
he figured out how to do it with pendulums

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
and it was like the best

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
estimate of the density of the earth for

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
100 years or whatever

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
and he didn't just do science

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
he invented fields of science

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
and yet

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
he was completely

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
immobilized practically at parties

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
he would just stand off to the side

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
listening

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
looking away

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
and that was something that Asperger picked up on

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Connor was like

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
they failed to make eye contact

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
but Asperger was like

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
actually they're learning really a lot about the world

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
they're just not looking at you

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
because looking at you is actually

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
overloading their senses

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
and there was a colleague who described him

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
do you remember the light metaphor

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
the white light

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
a cold light which warms nothing

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
you could

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
find that I'll just use you as a google engine

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
have you been traveling all over the country

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
world doing readings

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
and selling this? well this just came out

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
like two and a half weeks ago so it like

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
popped on the best server list

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
so that's good

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
congratulations

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
don't we need different words

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
for things like compassion

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
in a world where

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
the people who have been responsible

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
for

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
creating a more Roddenberry like world

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
are

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
accused of

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
are describable as not having it

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
and yet the people who have been trying

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
to cure them in childhood

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
are people who are cattle prodding them

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
right right the people who supposedly

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
have the empathy that these people lack

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
are the people sticking cattle prods

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I feel like there's a word we're missing

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
in the English language that maybe an autistic person could

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
invent for us

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
so that we can stop making that

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
there's a distinction we're making that's not 100%

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
accurate about whether they're

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
feeling things

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
and the great thing is that once

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
the internet was finally invented and I talk about how

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
a

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
very autistic person helped invent the first

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
social network that was open to the public

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
actually this guy Lee Felsenstein

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
but anyway the internet gave a place

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
to autistic people where they could

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
talk to each other rather than

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
just talking to clinicians

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
so instead of being isolated patients

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
brought there by their parents

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
they could just talk to each other

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
and one of the first things they figured out was that autism

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
persists into adulthood

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
like believe it or not

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
this is one of the things that most people forget

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
but up until the 70s or 80s

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
really the 80s

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
the diagnosis was not really available

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
to adults or even teenagers

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
and Americans and people say

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
why are the rates of diagnosis going up

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
one reason is that

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
teenagers and adults could not get the diagnosis

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
until the 80s and 90s

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
and that was one thing

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
that Asperger Syndrome was good for

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
it's simply like yeah it's the Wendy's and Burger King

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
of

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
which is neither a good thing or a bad thing

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
it's like we've developed since the early 80s

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
systems that are now available

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
to clinicians to diagnose autism

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
so the diagnosis just

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
went through the roof

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
and also another thing that people I would say under

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
appreciate generally even some autistic people

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
is Rain Man

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
like people think oh what a cliche

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Dustin Hoffman, Raymond Babbitt with the cards

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
and the toothpicks whatever

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
but actually that film was completely

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
revolutionary

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
because even people who had been in autism circles

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
for decades had never seen

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
an autistic adult

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
certainly on screen ever

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
and so Raymond Babbitt made autism

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
recognizable

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
to teachers, to parents

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
to autistic people themselves

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
to clinicians and so

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
that was one of the sort of elements

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
of the perfect storm of autism awareness

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
that created the apparent epidemic

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Steve I know I'm totally ignorant

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
about autism but is it a strictly

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
neurological thing

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
is it a developmental

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
thing in the brain? Yes

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
although we still don't have a biomarker

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
for it so there are no blood tests

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
for autism there are no brain scans for autism

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
like you can't... Can you take autistic

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
like can you scan brains

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and see similarities in autistic brains or not?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Well that's a subject of much debate

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
but the problem is that

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
every six months another study comes out

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
it's too much white matter, it's too little white

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
matter, it's too much connectivity

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
it's too little connectivity

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
it's like there are all these conflicting studies

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
about what the biomarkers of autism are

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
It's certainly hereditary

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
and that was one of the things I asked

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
So on one hand you have a spike in diagnosis

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
because that's I suppose the biggest question

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
that your book would need to answer that someone would come to

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
is what's going on with this autism

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
epidemic

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
which you get right to

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
in the opening of the book

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and slowly answer

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
throughout the book and it seems to be

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
correct me if I'm wrong

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
the two biggest factors are

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
what we just talked about

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
the increased availability

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
of the diagnosis

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
but you hint at

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
early in the book this odd

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
like

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
it's an engineer's disease

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
that it does seem

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
hereditary and that

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
our modern world created

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
by autistics

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
our Jetson world

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
that we all love

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
that we all fantasize about in science fiction

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
that autistics make a reality by actually thinking

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
outside the actual box

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
that that world

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
in a crazy

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
poetic

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
fairy tale makes it possible

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
basically for engineers to fuck more

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Exactly

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
that people who used to be defined

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
by their virginity are now

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
able to hook up

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and you were saying yesterday, I don't know if it was from Steve's book or not

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
that

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Silicon Valley is seeing a big rise of like

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
autistic birth rate or something like that

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
well that was the subject of my article

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
the geek syndrome in 2001

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
and yes that's interesting

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
but and that might

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
be happening it's geneticists call it

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
assortative mating which is basically

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
when people who are carrying

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
traits for a certain condition

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
get together there's more of a chance

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
that their kid will have the condition

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
and that's how I

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
first got into autism because I'm not a parent

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I'm not a relative I now have an autistic trans

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
nephew I will say

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
but

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I got into it because I was on a boat with a hundred

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
computer programmers

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and towards the end of this cruise

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
in Alaska I asked

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
this big programmer guy Larry Wall

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
if I could come to interview him at his house

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and I noticed that

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
he had customized his house

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
like he had turned the buzzer on his

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
clothes dryer to a light

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
so it was not so startling and annoying

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
he said yeah you can come to my house but I should tell you

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
we have a profoundly autistic daughter

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and then

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
like six months later I was writing about another family

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
in Silicon Valley can I come to your house

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
woman said yeah by the way we have an autistic

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
daughter and I thought hmm that's odd

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
and the next day I was in a cafe

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
in San Francisco telling that exact story

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
to a friend of mine and this woman at the next table

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
said oh my god

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
do you realize what's going on

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
there's an epidemic of autism

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
in Silicon Valley

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
and so like the hairs on the back of my neck

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
went up you know and that turned out to be

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
like a doorway through which I

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
stepped into the next you know 15 years

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
of my life and this book

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
is an attempt to get right what

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I sort of bunted on

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
in the geek syndrome because yes

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
a sort of meeting is fascinating

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
all these dungeons and dragons people getting

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
together by talking through screens

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
finding their way through dungeons

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
increasing efficiency

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
right right so it used to be a map

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
on a graph paper now you can like

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
use a computer to get through that dungeon

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
right and so that's interesting

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
but why are autism

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
rates also going up in rural

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Alaska for instance you know might be

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
dungeons and dragons there too but

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
anyway so this was my

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
effort to get right what I had sort

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
of wimped out on in geek

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
syndrome yeah it took me five years it could

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
be a whole I mean it gets into a whole area

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
of like what is the nature of evolution

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
why does a stable fox why does its fur

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
get in value non valuable

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
within one you know what

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
is everything operating on a pure

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Darwinian mutation engine or do we

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
do we store

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
you know what is their feedback going into

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
DNA are we therefore

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
expressing our

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
own evolution through

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
increased incidents of

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
of a more of a

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
disease quote-unquote disease

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
more compatible with

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
an emerging world and also

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
more causal of it

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
that was very well said I must say

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
increased skepticism of

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
pigheaded politicians increased

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
a desire

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
to think laterally increased

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
need to do

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
to create a world that is not

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
an assault on the senses

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I mean is our species

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
surviving the same as those

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
goddamn giraffes with their long necks

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
one of my favorite

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
moments in the book and in

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
autism history is when Asperger

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
asked the kid in his clinic if he's

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
religious and he says I don't

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
like to say I'm not religious I just

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
don't have any proof of God

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
and I feel like he was like you know

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
a lot of people are like that now

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
right you know do you foresee

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
a showdown between the Mondains

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
and the autism

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
did you see a great apocalypse

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
coming down the road

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
there's a continuous showdown

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
we all have to fight the good fight

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
as for told in quadrophenia

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
exactly

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
we are the mods

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I just think

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
it might be

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
that beautiful

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
it's a colleague describing this

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
if I can find it

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
your 200 year old retro diagnosis

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
of this guy who

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
who time and time

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
again I mean he discovered

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Argonne you know before

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
the guy that's credited with discovering Argonne

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Cavendish? Yeah

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
and it was one of the most

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
like just

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
eloquent ways of describing what the guy

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
didn't know he was describing an autistic

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
person

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
it just came from a colleague

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and I thought it was so interesting the distinction between

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
different kinds of light

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
the most probing glimpse into the soul of this

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
elusive genius Henry Cavendish

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
provided by the chemist George Wilson

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
who wrote the first full length biography of Cavendish

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
in 1851 etc

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
he painted Cavendish's emotional life

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
as a series of negations

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
he did not love

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
he did not hate

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
he did not hope

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
he did not fear

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
his brain seems to have been but a calculating engine

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
he was not a poet

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
a priest or a prophet

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
but only a cold clear intelligence

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
reying down pure white light

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
which brightened everything

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
on which it fell

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
but warmed nothing

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I like it

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
and it's 9-11

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
another

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
cold

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
light that

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
warmed nothing

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
well

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
we flew you up from San Francisco

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
is there

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
like

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
do you

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
describe yourself as the prototypical

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
neurotypical you

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
except I'm secretly shy, don't forget that part

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
and then you talked about

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
you said you were married to a fella that is

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
very artistic

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
well, he has more artistic traits than I do

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
and I thought in my head

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
as a

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
hammy tacky host

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I was thinking like is there

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
a way to weave

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
these things

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
as a gay journalist

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
oh my god

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
is there

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
did you ever find yourself looking through that lens

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
as your

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
civil rights movement happening among autistic people

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
here's the thing

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
certainly

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
this is really the story

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
of people walking

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
towards freedom out of the darkness

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
more or less

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and do I relate to that because now I'm a happily married

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
gay man

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
totally

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
yeah

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I guess that's all I wanted

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
was applause

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I'm sorry Steve, are you saying that

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
your husband is autistic?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
no

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
sorry Keith

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
you both have a certain

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
amount of autistic traits

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
so a neurotypical person

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
like you or I could have

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
any number of autistic traits

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
for instance

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
autistic traits are common

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
who knows if there's anyone in this room who thinks they might have autistic traits

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
give me for instance

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
of yours

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
autistic traits of mine

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
in social situations

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I feel like I'm running out of energy

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
and I really need to get some place where I'm

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
by myself and not so worn out

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
by constant attention

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
so that's one

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
obsessive

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
focus

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
once I figured out that

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
this same guy had worked for both Conor

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
and Asperger thus answering one of the huge

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
mysteries of autism history

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I was fucking obsessed

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
like I

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
remember this moment when

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I really wanted to be able to see a room

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
in Vienna in 1938

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
so I literally like

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
plowed through Google images until I

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
found a picture of that room

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
with the portrait of Hitler

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
behind the podium and it was like

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
yes I am God I can see into a room

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
in 1938

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
how would you describe when your research

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
that's a question I have as a

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
dropout journalism major

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
and a

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
because I sometimes find

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I tried to find out how coconuts work

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
the other day and I was astounded

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
that

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
there was no information about it

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
online not the specific kind I needed

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
there was so much of one

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
as a person who doesn't know the mechanism

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
in the coconut that confuses you the most

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
so you didn't get to the bottom of that

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I didn't understand

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I couldn't look I was looking at a coconut

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I had ordered a coconut filled with ice

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
cream from my local vegan store

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
because I'm healthy

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
and I was eating out of

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
the coconut ice cream and I was like

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
this thing is fucking amazing

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
it's so good and I started looking up

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
coconuts and it was like

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
yeah like you could make oil

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
and all that stuff

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
and the thing that kept plaguing me was

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
like why would a tree

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
trees like an apple is designed

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
to make a chimp want to eat it

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
or a raccoon or something so it poops out the

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
seeds somewhere other than where the tree is

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
so I kept thinking like why would you

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
play this hard to get

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
as a tree the answer is obvious

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
to anyone who probably

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
30 people tweeted me in 10 seconds

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
but not until after

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I was amazed that I could google it

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
and within an hour not have found

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
a very very simple obvious answer

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
that probably people who grew up in Hawaii

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
know immediately or whatever

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
it's like they're designed to float

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
they've bypassed mammalian

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
technology and probably predated it

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
a coconut is a little

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
water proof submarine a boat

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
with a little bit of potable water in it

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
and a bunch of sperm and a bunch of coconut egg

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
and it's designed to float

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
to another island and grow to it

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
it's fucking brilliant

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I once had a question like that for Oliver

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Sacks who is the

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
recently deceased unfortunately neurologist

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
who actually wrote forward to my book

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
and was a very good friend of mine and a wonderful guy

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
he wrote books like the man who mistook

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
his wife for a hat anyway

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
we were once in a health food store or whatever

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and I picked up this bunch

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
of sage leaves that were very furry

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
and I knew that Oliver was not only

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
a neurologist but a botanist kind of

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and so I said to him I wonder

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
why sage has such furry leaves

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
and he looked at me and he said because

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
they like it

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
that's a

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
unsatisfying answer

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
and you're like do you like hanging out with me

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
like I

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
wanted you to come have a barbecue but

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
if you're bored or you want to wait in the car

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I was just trying to make small talk man

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
now did you obsess on the sage leaves and go look that up

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
did you ever

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
it was satisfying

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I'm a slow reader and Dan

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
listened to your thing at double speed and made you sound like

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
what's his name

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I'm a fetishist

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
with paper

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I'm kind of a slow reader because

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I have to stop, look up every word I've done

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
or even if it's words I do know

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I go what's the etymology

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
of that and then I'll go down

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
rabbit holes of where did that

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
root come from and then

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I have to go back to a bunch of other pages

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
that reminds me of other words and then I have to look at all the pictures

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
of the inside of the room and if they reference a painting

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I have to look at all the artist paintings

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I did that for five years writing this book

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
well so that's what I wanted to ask

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
of selfishly just to interrupt

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
because that's my thing it's like so

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
if coconuts

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
were president

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
no no no

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
if I can't

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
if I can't

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
just give me a second

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
if I can't find out about coconuts

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
in two hours on the internet

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
my question is how much information

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
is actually on the internet

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
you said this is a 15 year

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
you describe yourself as sitting in stacks of books

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
at universities

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
how much of our information

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
is

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
of what kind is making it over

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
to the sky net

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
is there a bias toward a certain type of information

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
are we learning more about lightsabers

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and less about Bob Dylan

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
or is it

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
more about those two things and we know nothing about

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
if you've spent 15 years researching

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I try to

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
port things into the internet that otherwise

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
might not make it

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
so if you guys have cool shit whatever it is

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
that's not in digital form

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
just try to make it available in digital form

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
for people

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
because some guy 300 years from now

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
is going to be writing the definitive book on something

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and he's going to find your shit

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and it's going to be the central piece

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
in some enormous world solving puzzle

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
but also you're finding out

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
the fact that

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
well we didn't even talk about this by the way

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Asperger

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
he

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Connor

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
to round out his role as villain

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
very clearly

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
if you type

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
those names into the internet you will see that

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
they simultaneously

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
started diagnosing autistics

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
at the same time

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
you actually Woodward and Bernstein

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
to this shit

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
that's the thing

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
for since forever

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
as they say

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
people have said that Asperger

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
and Connor discovered autism virtually

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
simultaneously

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
an amazing synchronicity one of the great medical

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
synchronicities of the 20th century

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
which I even say in the geek syndrome

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
anyway it turns out that

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Asperger had this chief

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
diagnostician named George

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Frankel and he had

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
a Jewish problem with the Nazis

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
he was Jewish

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
and so George

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Frankel was rescued from Vienna

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
in 1938 by this

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
guy in Baltimore named

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Leo Connor

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
so the same guy

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
like for autism

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
heads like that's huge

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
like it's a huge scoop

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
so I'm reading the book and I'm like

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
man this Connor guy what a villain

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and then

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
he was heroic because he saved Jewish

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
scientists

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and clinicians from the Holocaust

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
basically everybody in my book is really

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
complicated and if he buried

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
his connection his inspiration

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
he may have done it because

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Asperger was associated with Nazis

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
it may have been for an altruistic reason

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
right it may have been

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
so yeah here's the deal

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Connor in 1943

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
becomes the world's leading authority on autism

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
somehow

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
for the next several decades he never mentions

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Asperger's work

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
even though Asperger's chief diagnostician

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
and a woman named Anni Weiss

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
also from Asperger's clinic

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
were with Connor when he quote-unquote

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
discovered autism like no one knew this before

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
my book was written

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and so basically

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Connor never mentions Asperger's paper

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
so people say well

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
he just didn't read it it was written in German

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Connor's native language

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
well he somehow overlooked it because it was in

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
the obscure German medical journal

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
one that Connor cited numerous times

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
in his work you know and so

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
the one time that Connor mentions

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Asperger's name in public

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
is in this very dismissive

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
book review written in the 1970s

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
and he says oh yes Asperger

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
what that man discovered was

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
at best a 42nd cousin

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
of my syndrome

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
and has already received serious attention

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
from investigators

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
which was total bullshit it hadn't even been translated

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
into English yet

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
is that just male douchebag ego stuff

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
well no I mean you know is it male douchebag ego

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
or is it that Connor

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
suspected that Asperger was a Nazi

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
yeah is it a Schindler like

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
subversion

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
believe me that was like the big you know if I could like

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
summon people with a time machine

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
and say like why did you do this shit

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
because the problem with burying Asperger

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
in history was that it buried the

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
concept of the spectrum

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
so Connor defined autism very

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
narrowly

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
and whereas Asperger had seen it as this

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
lifelong condition ranging

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
from people who couldn't talk at all to chatty

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
astronomy professors etc

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
all in the upper tiers of society

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
as an indirect if not

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
direct result of that sorry

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
why am I cutting you off to tell you about autism

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
don't worry about it so basically

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Connor

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
buried autism and someone had to

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
find it again because

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
this cognitive psychiatrist in London

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
named Lorna Wing figured out

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
that Connor was wrong by

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
basically walking through a suburb of London

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
called Camberwell looking for autistic

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
kids and oh my god did she ever find

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
them many more than Connor's

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
narrow model would have predicted

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
so she was like who are all these kids

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
these weird kids who would like play their

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
favorite phonograph record 50 times over

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
you know couldn't read social signals

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
or you know one got one

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
teenager had three wristwatches

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
because he kept them to various time zones

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
and guess what in the

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
in 1978 if

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
you're one of those kids and you're born black

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
right because of that

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
legacy of specialization

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
of diagnosis you would get

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
mental retardation you don't come down

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
that Pachinko machine right yeah you

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
don't you're not the kid in the hoodie in

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
the independent movie who's hitting himself in the

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
head you're you're you're just

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
retarded because you're poor

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
and that's like

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
that made me

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
want to

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and you know the anti-vaccine

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
people I don't want to stereotype them either

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
but you know they say stuff like

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Jenny McCarthy once said there were

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
no autistic adults in the past

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
it's all now

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
well that would be news to my

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
many middle-aged autistic friends I have

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
to say but it would also

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
be news to the two generations

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
of autistic people who ended up in institutions

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
so for 30 years

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
between the 40s and the 70s

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Asperger's findings

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
were all they were in a journal

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
they had been there they were just buried

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
right and you know they were like

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
five guys in Eastern Europe

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
who like knew about his work

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
ten guys that was on Earth Tau

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
that was on Earth Tau because

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Lorna Wing did one of the first basic

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
prevalence studies of autism in the general population

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
in other words unlike Connor

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
she didn't wait for autistic

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
kids to come to her office

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
she and a colleague named Judith Gould

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
went out and pounded the pavement

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
and like dug through medical records

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
and special schools and all this

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
to look for autistic kids and she saw so many of them

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
she was like what the fuck

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
like what is going on like why didn't

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
anyone notice these kids before

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
and so then she stumbles over a reference

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
to Asperger's paper

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
and it was actually in a journal that

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Connor edited and it was a paper

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
designed to make Asperger's

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
work look like a separate thing anyway

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
but she's like what is this paper

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
who is this Asperger she didn't speak German

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
her husband did he translated it for her

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
she reads it and it's like this is it

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
this is the autistic continuum

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
that's what she called it at first

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
but she eventually thought continuum was like

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
two maybe two science fiction

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
or something you know too dry

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
so it suggests that

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
there's no distinction

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
spectrum suggests a rainbow

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
right it was like a nice natural

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
image you know

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
so yeah basically the concept

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
of the autism spectrum came

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
from Lorna Wing rediscovering

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Asperger's work after it had been

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
buried by Connor for many many

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
decades

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
is there before

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
we let you go we've milked

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I really appreciate

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000

have really done a good job interviewing you

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I did a good job booking you

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
on our show

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
about autism which all of you

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
clearly have

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I did I did a solid first

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
all of society and I

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
wove gay people into it

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I'm the greatest man alive

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
tonight

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
but I want to throw you a bone

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
from the book and I don't want to just

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
it's a 16 hour book that way

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
can I tell you one thing

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000

bringing this really cool piece of fan art

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
the really cool piece of fan art

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
that somebody made for me about this book

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
was it was bootleg

of this book

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000

it's just in Europe

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
it's not sweetened

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
it's sweetened

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
it has calories on it

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
it's supposed to be like halfway between Diet Coke

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
and other things

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
the chocolate is so good

was I nervous about coming back to Harmontown

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
and did I buy chocolate so everyone would

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
be happy to see me

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000

it's Morrissey's face

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
and a little star at the bottom of the can

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
it's him going like

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
instant energy

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and when DeMorge comes out

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
by the way

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
the song we're hearing tonight is by our good friend

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Titanic Sinclair and it's called The Ghost of Harmontown

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
oh that's good stuff

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
DeMorge apparently

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Erin thought of you when she saw a puddle

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I don't know what I did with the puddles

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
that's just my real

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
it's Cadbury Oreo

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
here we go

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
oh yeah

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
they got a little crash

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
is that a fruit nut

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
smooth mint

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
the fruit nut one is a goodie

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
this is delightful

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
alright well we got for shadow run

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
just right back at it

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
oh yeah can we talk about

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
this enormous piece of fan art

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
speaking of Aspergian fan art

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
as Aspergian

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
can we see what this is

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
it's a piece of cardboard

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
you should turn it

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
with our mayor's image

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
you should turn it and show the angles

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
yeah so the uh

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
this one's no good

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
wow

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
look at that

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
you guys just signed that

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
oh

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
alright

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
it's actually a gift for Dan Harmon

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
oh Dan Harmon

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
you're not the guy that did the

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
masking tape

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
no is that guy here

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
oh okay what's your name

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
fuck you buddy

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
what are your names of friends that made the art for us

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
what's your name

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Elliot France did you do both of these

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
she did that one

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
and your name is what miss? Nicole

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Nicole and Elliot thank you so much it's really really groovy

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
and that guy made me a masking tape

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Harmon it's like all made of masking tape

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
and then like a lacquer over it

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
that I still have

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
and then I accidentally blocked him on twitter

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
he was a casualty of the

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Harmon block uh

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
that we've talked about which has overall

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
given me a great deal of mental stability

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
but there are sometimes

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I had to

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
and else on twitter had to send me a link

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
to a place where people who get Harmon block

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
to congregate

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
and talk about

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
whether they're blocking was

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
just yeah

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and they're very and it's a

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
sad smirk village of

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
do they have different like leagues

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
among them like

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I'm a deserved

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I just saw all I saw was the guy saying

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
like I made him a masking tape

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Harmon and I was like well that

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
shouldn't have been blocked

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
do you remember the circumstances of why you blocked him

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I blocked people who

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
so like if you and I

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
if we're joking around

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
like

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
you know like sometimes there's some

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
like we razz each other

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
sometimes when strangers razz me

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I blocked them taking the mickey

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
yeah

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
like sometimes

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
unearned I have

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
an arbitrary definition for unearned

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
razzing you know I like

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
it's like it's for the reason I started

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
blocking is for my own protection

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I was like well I don't want to get out

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I don't want to just wheaten out of the twitter

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
like I'll just

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
like there's so many people on here that just want to

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
say I love you

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
hear me say I love you back and

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
like why so you just

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
block people but you don't have to hate them

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
or judge them you just go like it's

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
if I make a joke and then somebody says get over yourself

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
like and I go well that's

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
not why I get on twitter

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I love that mute button I love that twitter mute button

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
it's a good button

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
if you say if you mention the words teen and wolf

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
on my twitter

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I think I got somebody by accident

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
today she was making a joke about something else

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
but she said teen wolf and I instantly was like

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
I was like I have a

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
like a standard reply that I have

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
on a little sticky note that I cut

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
and paste to all the people so I don't

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
have to keep writing that I'm not the guy that fucking made

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
teen wolf

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
mute buttons not enough for me that would be enough

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
for a healthy person blocking

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
and specifically I have to also

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
then advertise the block

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
with a hashtag and then I'm like

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
so you have to bury them and then dance

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
in their grave

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
yeah

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
and then sometimes it's tragedy

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
you never just mute you never just go

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
ah cornfield did you kiss

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
the Blarney stone

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I did

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
not kiss the Blarney stone I didn't make it to the

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Blarney stone good because

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
that would be cheating on me

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
you didn't cheat on me

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
you were in Europe for a month

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
more than a month surrounded

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
by handsome non McDonald's

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
indoctrinated men

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
with abdominal muscles

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
they have McDonald's

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
all of them look like Colin Farrell

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
all of them have names like Mally oh Mally

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
they do uh yeah

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
yeah I'll miss that they all it was funny

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
like we I just this last week

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
was shooting I think we'll be a

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
web series around Ireland and

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
wherever we went I was there with

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
two Irish guys that were helping me

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
and they would run into somebody and they'd be like oh you're from

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Limerick do you know Sean O'Connor

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
do you know but like the names are so generic

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
I was like there must be a thousand Sean O'Connor's

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
or like Michael Malley

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
and all that

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
you think it's gonna be

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
a web series sorry you think it's

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
gonna be web series well I shot

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I shot this thing call

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
that I'm calling McGathy in Ireland

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
which is like a parody of a travel

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
show where I'm playing like an exaggerated

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
version of myself going around Ireland

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
and

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
being emotionally

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
self-destructive and stuff and

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I say I say I think it's going to be

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
a web series because I'm not sure

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
exactly what it's going to be maybe it's going to

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
be a I don't know I just shot a lot and figuring

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
out could be about a one woman show

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
sorry one woman show

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
it won't be a one woman

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
show because that would be weird

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
you mean if I if I was to watch all the footage

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
and then transcribe it and then perform it as

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
a one woman show or what about like

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
a mixed media mosaic

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
yeah

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
do you think it could be that you think it could be a

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
mixed media mosaic I think I think that's a good

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I like web series though I'm gonna

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
yeah

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Aaron while you were away Spencer became an idea man

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
but

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
but he's become

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
oddly confined in his thinking about what's

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
possible it's like he used to be so much

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
freer but he's really

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
like he's really he really needs to categorize

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
things out maybe I shouldn't say web series

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
because maybe that that people are like

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
oh web series I love web series

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
it's going to be it's going to be a network

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
television show

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
well you know what's not going to be a network

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
television show

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Harmon quest

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
so we still need to get some

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
asses and seats

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Harmon quest

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
more tranquilizers and you will eventually

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
die it's a

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
that's I mean that's going to happen regardless

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
that's the fun are we having trouble

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
selling our seats if we put the link up oh

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
we're not selling them we're giving them away

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
that's what I mean that's what we're having

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
definite obvious like

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
like the theater seats like a hundred

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
eight eight people and like

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
the one that's on a Saturday night

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
it's like there's two hundred and forty

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
people responded within two minutes and then

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
there's a couple nights where it's like sixty and seventy

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
people well it's not it's better than that we

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
you know there's a couple seats left it's not

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
we're not in any danger you guys

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
make signals Spencer are you going to give us

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
our are you are you

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
oh yeah I mean will I get that someday

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
you know come get it

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
oh

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
I know I know I come

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
on when I hear one

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
so

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
okay I know I missed the boat

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
there's but there's this there's a gentleman

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
in this very room

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
who's been standing against that wall

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
for the whole show

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
what what are you doing

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
you just watching the show okay

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
that's all I wanted to know I didn't

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I thought it'd be rude to ask earlier

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
when a you know Steve was on

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
did you feel like he was like hearing

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
some official capacity I thought he hated

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
you know sitting

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
New York Times bestsellers or something

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
yeah no I thought

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
he was going to kill Steve Silverman

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
and I've been

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
watching

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
what about the other guy is that Steve

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
that's Steve Levy okay

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
yeah so you're wondering who that guy was

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
yeah don't worry just feel

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
weird for the rest of the

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I mean it's only 20 minutes

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
he probably just doesn't have anywhere to sit right

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
there's plenty of places

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
to stand I'm not going to lie I don't have a problem

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
with you standing there but I'm going to comment on it

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
now Steve

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I know you said that you're not like practicing

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
religious Jew but are you

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
is there something that you that we could all

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
like do on Rosh Hashanah like as

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Gentiles and Goyim and what not

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
is like is there some fun thing that we can do

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
to participate in your awesome New Year's

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I mean is there a thing you say

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
is you put on a hat do you do a dance

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
you taught me something before

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
we have a Jewish dissenter over here

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
nope

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
how about close enough

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
no Jews in Ireland

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Saint Goyim

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
you led them to the sea right with a flute

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
there are some but there's only

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
there's only one there

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
there's only one Jewish temple

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
but while I was there I met a lot of people

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
that were like there's one synagogue or temple

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
on all of Ireland yeah really

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
yeah what's that about

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I am

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I mean both rabbis

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
and leprechauns have like

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
there's competition for that corner

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
both of them if you pour salt

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
on their feet they have to give up their gold

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
like

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
and they're both just like

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
they'll if you

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
say well there's just a lot of the stories

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
about leprechauns they have others

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
there's rabbi stories

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
you know there's like rabbi give me your

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
gold and

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
and there's like I'll tie a ribbon

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
around the tree that has

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
the gold under it and then there's like

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
ribbon on every tree

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
and you're like

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
rabbi

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
what Dan's trying to say is

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
happy Rosh Hashanah Jews

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Shana Tova

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I could be right there's only one

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
temple on Dublin I could be right about that

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
was there like a pogrom or a

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
persecution are there just like Jews are like

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Ireland?

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
well yeah because there's no like real

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
there's a reason

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
for it as to like the industrial revolution

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
and stuff and just the Jewish people didn't

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
immigrate to Ireland

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
and also Irish people just think they're bad luck so they put them in a hole

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
and

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
they're obsessed with luck over there

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
it's like their

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
dollar is backed by luck

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
it's like

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
it's either the most ingenious or the worst

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
decision you can ever make like ours is backed by

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
nothing it used to be gold but they converted

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
to luck in 1938

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
so if you have two dollars

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
it's worth four dollars because you're

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
clearly luckier than someone with a dollar

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
and it's very complicated

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
and a lot of people

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
think it's going to lead to a big crash

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
were they

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
talking about fairies and shit over there

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I hear they do that

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
oh the boggard came out this morning

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
or something you know

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Nixie's on the port bow

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I mean they don't

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
they don't talk like when you're ordering your coffee

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
they're not like

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
let the leaf hurry bless you today

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
it's not like that

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
it is definitely like in the background

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
there is like a

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
it does feel like genuinely magic over there

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
and there is like

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
it is part of there

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
what are my new Dublin friends told me

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
that when he was a kid

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
that he was afraid

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
because he believed in fairies

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
because he was a kid

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
and the fairies would come in and climb up

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
into his bed and like pick at his face

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
bed bugs

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
bed bugs

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
they definitely talk about

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
something they do do

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
which took me a little while to get used to

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
when I was down

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I went I busked

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
do you guys know what busking is

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
busking is street performing

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
and I did that in Galway a few days ago

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
and I had

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I had just like a Celtic drum

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
and in the shop when I bought the drum

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I was trying to do it and the woman was like

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
no no no it's up and down like a paint brush

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
and I was like okay so I got it

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
nope nope but you have to leave the store

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
you have to

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
you got it

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
you cannot drum in here any longer

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
so we went out on the street

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
and I like with the drum

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
started out like busking

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
it was also illegal to busk without a license

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
so

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
pretty cool

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I busked in front of Tommy Hilfiger for a little while

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
just advertising Tommy Hilfiger

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
and then I

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
it was on camera when you were alone

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I was

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
both

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
both

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
but I thought it would be really funny to do

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
the soundtrack to rent

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
on the streets of Galway so I did that until

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I met this man that was blowing bubbles

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
named Seamus

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
and you probably met Bubbles too I guess

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
we'll be right back

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
it would be rude to not introduce yourself

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
welcome home

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
welcome back from the emerald isle

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
of lyrical wit

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
and your shitty fat mountain of tits

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
boyfriend who

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
just wants to be loved

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
don't we all

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Seamus was blowing bubbles

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
and

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
felt like I needed more

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
to my act and so I walked up to Seamus

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
and asked him what he was doing and I was like

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
oh I'm blowing bubbles I love blowing bubbles

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
and I said

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
will you blow bubbles near me

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
while I sang and he's like

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
yeah all right

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
sure sure sure

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
and so he picked up

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
he was blowing just one thing of bubbles and I turned

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
and there's a whole line against the wall

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
all of these bottles of bubbles

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
and so I helped him get his bubbles together

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
and the moment that I was like oh Seamus

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I don't know why I didn't assume this

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Seamus isn't neurotypical

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
as he was polishing his

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
bubbles

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I'm not diagnosing him as autistic

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
but obviously he's not

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
anyway he picked up all his bubbles

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
and or not obviously

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
fuck me okay so I picked up all the bubbles

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
helped him with the bubbles and we started

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
singing and I was singing

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
I was just like improvising about people that

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
were walking by

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
and these kids were watching me

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
and these kids were eating their gelato and like

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
laughing and I was like teasing these kids

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
and he stops blowing the bubbles

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
and he says have you ever had sex

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
the bubble

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
bubble guy? yeah Seamus

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
yeah Seamus stopped blowing bubbles

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
oh no he was still blowing bubbles

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
to me to me to me to me

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
and the kids are

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
how old is Seamus?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Seamus is probably late 50's early 60's

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
how old are the kids?

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
they were right in the sweet spot

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
they were good to go Dimarch

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
yeah

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
in your parlance

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
he didn't see the kids

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
also Seamus didn't

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I said that you know we're going to be filming this

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
it's for this silly travel thing so that's what

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
those guys are doing with like this big

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
camera and this boom mic

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
and he was like had no did not care

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
and the kids were far away

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
and he turns to me and says have you had sex

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
and I was like Seamus

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
for shame

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I said

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Seamus I don't want to have that conversation

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
with you and he said ah hi had sex

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
once 40 years ago

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
and he's saying this as he's like blowing

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
bubbles

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
and I look over at the guys who are filming

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
and they can hear everything and they're giving me the

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
like you cool face

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
or in Ireland you grand

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
so

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
he then said

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I had sex 40 years ago

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
with a woman and she was the only lady

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I ever had sex with and she died

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
last year probably because she was so

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
fat and then she's just

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
continuing to blow bubbles

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
and I was like

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
and then he said you know

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
they don't talk about AIDS anymore do they

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
as I was like

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
don't bury the lead Seamus

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
no I think they still

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
talk about AIDS he's like no no no

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
they don't talk about it no more

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
they don't talk about AIDS no more

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I said I know

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
with AIDS and he just continued to blow his bubbles

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
and

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
the saddest thing was that we put out a

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
hat to make money and because I'm a brilliant

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
businesswoman put money in the

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
hat myself so people would be like

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
whoa

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
this must be good

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
yeah yeah

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I made a deal with Seamus that

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
we could split whatever we made

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
and we made nothing

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
so I took out

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
20 euro like a cash

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
20 euro and handed it

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
to him and I was like here you go he's like

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
we made this we made this today I was like

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
yeah yeah we made this

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
made this 20 euro

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
and I gave it to him from the AIDS talk

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Seamus

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
as I walked away from him

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
and I was walking with my friends

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
we had to we were leaving to go

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
to Gale talk which is like a

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
village where they only speak Irish and I

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
just started crying and it was like

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I feel so awful and they're like yes

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
too like let's take a walk

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
that's the end of that sad story

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
wait what made you feel awful

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
yeah

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
well I

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
it just

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I don't know it just

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
kind of hit me with it I don't know it just

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
felt really dark also when I was busking

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
you know what it also was that like at a

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
certain point I thought it would be funny to

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
just list all my insecurities

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
like sing all my insecurities and I felt

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
like I was kind of exploiting myself a little bit

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
um

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I don't know do you guys ever feel that way

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
it's called

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Harmontown

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
um

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
but you just wanted to like you mean because

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
he was sort of uh

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
touched and uh in

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
multiple senses and you wanted to like

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
it was like a dark glimpse like

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
the guy that painted the

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
our house the the guy with the headphones

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
uh yeah like I started

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
crying about that uh well you know I

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
never met him right you know I

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
never felt bad for like we didn't feel bad

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
for Seamus because Seamus I think

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
it was the juxtaposition of like me

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
uh

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
feeling because I was listing all these things that I

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
was insecure about and worried about

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
so it made me like really think about those things

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
just juxtaposed with Seamus

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
who who not only does he blow

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
out bubbles all the time he

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
is always like ah they're just

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
so beautiful the bubbles look at the bubbles

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
and oh look at this bubble and that bubble

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
and then uh there were a couple of times

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
when I was joke I was and I was doing this for

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
the camera like when he would slow down a little bit

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
and I would be like Seamus come on come on

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
let's go let's go let's go and he was like

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
oh yeah yeah yeah and then

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
sometimes he would accidentally blow them in my face

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
but like he was he was like

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
he was happy he was a happy person

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
and then I was like you know

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
I'm beating my drum and like demanding

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
the world to tell me I'm okay and I was like

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
what's wrong with me that was that was why

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
I felt sad but it was great it was great fun

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I also uh

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
it was real good

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I also when I took

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
I was brought up mostly in Southern California

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
so obviously my first time taking

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
surf lessons was in Ireland

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
that's crazy you went surfing

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
yeah yeah with with uh

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
with Alan the surf instructor

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
who was very nice and I'm sorry

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Danny was very handsome but he was very short

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I wish some of these people were women

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
hahahaha

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
would make sense

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
because they're half the population

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I don't understand why everyone in Ireland's a guy

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
yeah

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
that all wants to teach you something

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
right right right well and these stories

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I uh I met I met all these people

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
through uh these wonderful

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
female comedians in Dublin

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
um Alison Spittle

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
and Andrea Ferrell

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
and so they

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
there were plenty there were plenty of women

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
say out with a lot of women

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
just no handsome

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
just no handsome women

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I don't really understand your joke

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
hahahaha

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
oh I see okay yeah

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
he's just connecting dots man

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
should we play a tiny bit of Shatter Run

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
before we uh before we fuck on

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
jury's out on jelly babies

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
do they taste like jelly

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
bears not those

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
they're not like gummy bears at all

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
they're shaped exactly like them

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
but they're uh they're uh

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
no they're very chewy

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I mean not as chewy as gummy bears

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
I mean they're not oh god

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
they're like you just eat them like a

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I'm just noticing that like they're really

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
they're naked except for their shoes

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
look at the cover it's a little creepy

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
yeah

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
and they're all kind of humping something

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
also something that distinguishes them

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
from gummy bears is that their flavors

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
are very distinct

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
yellow and the

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
and the dark ones are gross they're like

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
licorice yeah

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
yeah

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I like licorice

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
it's just interesting to know

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
that that's what Dr. Who was eating the whole time

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Dr. Who eats jelly babies

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
oh it does?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
cool

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I think I can smell your jelly babies from here

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
are they kind of citrusy or like

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
yeah they are do you want to try a jelly

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I don't like I'm not a really like a jelly

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I like to smell your jelly babies

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I don't have any

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I want to go blow bubbles

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I want to watch you blow bubbles

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I smell your jelly babies

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
let's play a brief shutter run

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
shall we just

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
tie a nice little bow on this thing

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
yeah we got

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
we got enough of a crew up here

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
yeah

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
what do you got going on

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
he's just a puddle

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I think it's a green jelly baby

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
what's your what's your verdict on jelly babies

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
it tasted green I had to

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
it tasted green and I looked

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
and it was green

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Timoran is just a simple man

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
that and 90 thoughts about

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
soccer that's all that's going on right now

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I went hurling

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
oh jeez

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I learned hurling

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I played hurling

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
how'd you do

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
well hurling

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
everyone I know from Ireland has a big scar

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
on their face because you

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
give a bunch of kids sticks

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
wrapped in sheet metal

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
the most complex set of tasks to do

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
with that stick

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
you have to carry the

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
spiff or the ball on the stick

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
like an egg and then you have to

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
hit it into a net it's like a combination of

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
football and rugby and it's weird

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
but I played it with a bunch of 8 year old boys

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
meow

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
why do I keep on making pedophile jokes

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
I made a joke about pedophilia

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
surf thing which caused a lot

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
of problems and they kept on calling

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
the guy that was produced the guy

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
with the penis that was producing my show

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
and just demanding

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
that it not be in the show anyway

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
who did

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
the surf instructor and I wasn't even making a joke

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
about them or anything and it wasn't even on camera

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
but it wasn't even their joke

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
why do they have demands

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
they didn't want pedophilia associated

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
with the surf school and they did it so much

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
that I was like I feel like

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
no it is fair but we were like

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
we weren't even filming

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
it's fair to not want pedophilia associated with

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
microscopes but if the owner of a microscope

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
company was that insistent about it

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I'd start investigating

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
and

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
let's put you on a slide

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
and look

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
for pedophilia

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
and he'd be like this is exactly what I didn't want

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
and I'd go yeah

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
he runs a school

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
there's children that come and take surf lessons

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
and we can't be making pedophile jokes

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
is that surfing

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
in children that's a big thing

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
schools are for children man

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I actually don't want to talk anymore about it

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
because I promised him I wouldn't talk anymore

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
what was the name of this

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
we didn't promise him anything

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
this guy sounds like a pedophile to me

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
it's tiny touches

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
full hearts

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
sounds like this guy wants to

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
hang ten years old

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
it's called our little

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
it's called our little secret surf school

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
cowabunghole

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
it's called

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
it's called

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
no one will believe you

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I'm doing dumb puns

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
but you're going really dark

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
it's called doesn't this make you feel special

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I chose you

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:32.000
surf school

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
the surf isn't all that's up

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
my hard dick

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
the reason it's hard is because you're young

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
surf school

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
we don't have to play shadow

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
we can just do ten more minutes of this

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
just take off your surf school

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
we can't play shadow

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
there's no time for shadow run now

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
let's just ride this metaphorical wave

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
into the

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
one of their slogans could be

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
now

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
students

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
now 20% less likely

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
to die by shark attack

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
relative to

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
the ways that they're likely to die

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
from coming to our surf school

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
because the other

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
ways are

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
spiking

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
which include disappearance

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
a wave goodbye

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
to healthy sex in your adulthood

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
surf school

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
the least lucky place in Ireland

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
was there somebody else that we wanted to

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
was there any other business we had to tend to

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
that's not happening

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I got the date wrong on that

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
we had a little secret surprise

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
but we're doing it another time

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
it was Dan and I announcing

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
my new surf school

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Dan Spencer and I

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
have been working on an all nude review

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
it's going to have to wait another week

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
why am I not on it?

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
cause you're out of town

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
you know what

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
a couple of things to warn you about

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Nigel puked on the duvet

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
there's not another one

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
did you clean it up?

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
yeah

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
but

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
it's puke

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
it's not permanent

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
it's puke

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
did you not clean it up really?

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
yeah

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
I took toilet paper and cleaned it up

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
did you spray it with anything?

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
excuse me

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
is this still on the bed?

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
did you shit on the floor?

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
and then there's also

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I would just be prepared

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
I feel like Harvey

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
when you walk in the door

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
I would like to videotape

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
the dog seeing you

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I feel like Harvey may

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
pee

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
he may pee

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
cause he's been peeing

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
he peed all over

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
I came over and he laid on his back

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
and just arched a beautiful little rainbow

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
of pee all over my shoe

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
I think part of that was the steroids

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
from his ear infection medication

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
also the cat's dying

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
welcome home

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
she's on three different

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
types of medication

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
and one of them is a bag of fluid

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
that I've probably told you about

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
cause I've owned cats before

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
once their kidneys start going

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
to those families

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
we're going to have to hang a bag

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
and do the subcutaneous

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
injection into FIV

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Steve do you think it's too late

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
to book another flight

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
back to

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I'm just kidding I was like oh god

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
it'll be grand

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
on a positive note

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Dan informed us of the audience tonight

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
that he'd taken his first shower

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.000
and gone today

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
at least you dressed up for me

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
really

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
the first shower

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
why would I

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
it's fine

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
it's your own life

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
it's your own body

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
what if I share it with you

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I don't know

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
what the first shower

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
in like two months guys

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
that's crazy

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
it's fine it's your own business

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
that's

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
this is going great

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
seems like you cheated on me

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
in Ireland

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
with showers

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
with so many showers

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
with so many showers and babs

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
well

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Dan did you cheat on Aaron

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
with video games

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
yeah

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
I loved them

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I cheated on you

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
with myself

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
with some

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
some good self-discovery

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
I spent a lot of time

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I did masturbate someone was giggling

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
did you bring some tingle sticks along

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
some tingle sticks what are tingle sticks

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
cattle prods

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
here we go

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
oh I see

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
no no no

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
had a great time I spent a lot of time by myself

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
realized that I'm okay

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
it's all good

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
I did play I did a lot of stuff

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
you seem a little unhappy

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
I just got off of a 14 hour flight

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
were you first class

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I was first class

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
and I flew first class

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
what airline

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I feel like we're just

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
British Airways

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
very nice through

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
American frequent fire miles

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
damn

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
well DeMorge we didn't really get to talk to you much tonight

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
do you have final thoughts for us DeMorge

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
no man

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
the biggest thing that happened

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
that doesn't compare to any of this is that I spent

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
a couple of hours

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
going on a rant

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
about a catamized poetry

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
and

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I had a friend who was saying

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
I'm getting into it on my own

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
and there's no place to find it

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
a catamized poetry

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
just poetry that is

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
speaking of masturbating

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
hey up here dude

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
it's a sexual organ

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
we've lost track

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
of poetry maybe 25-30 years ago

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
we don't even know

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
the definition of

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
younger American poets

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
are you a poet?

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
no but I ran the writing program

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
at college and I ran the writing journal

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
with a couple of friends of mine

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
and it's just

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
you get in that habit of just following

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
and keeping up with who the new

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
younger American poets are

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
and

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
so it wasn't an angry rant

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
it was just saying to my friend there are these places

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
all over town, all over the place

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
and they're free and it's frequent and it's often

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
and his face lit up

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
because he generally was

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
reading on his own

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
and loving what he was reading

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
and he discovered how to read a book of poetry

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
which we don't even teach kids anymore

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
we don't teach them how poets come up with a book

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
and what that means about their lives

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
the same way an album comes together

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
and in a lot of cases it's just as exciting

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
impossible to convince you of that right now

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
but

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
if you know it, it's true

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
and you spend a lifetime developing that

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
and stacking it up on top of itself

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
so there was a rant that I won

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
this is in between me screaming about the jets kicking

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
and Cleveland Brown's ass

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
hey it happened

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
our quarterback has a broken jaw

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
the second string guy destroyed you guys

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
the defense looks amazing, our coach is a genius

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
suck it

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
suck it

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
that was a haiku

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
no sports, no sports, no sports

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
and also arson

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
sports suck, definitely sports suck

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
and just

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
and then

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
just a shit show that is arsonal

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
and our french coach sitting in interviews and just going

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
well we had a certain quality

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
and the players were good today

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
and the boys did whatever they did

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
these are the things that I

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I'm single guys

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I was hoping someone would yell no in response to that

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
go ahead

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
you know if you zip your

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
dick into

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
a swimsuit

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
which by the way, don't get a swimsuit with a zipper

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I was going to say that

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
in the ocean, sharks will come

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
cliffhanger

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
cliffhanger

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
