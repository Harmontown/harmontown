--> 00:28.000\nThere is a ghost who lives in Harmontown\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:30.000\nHappy Birthday Shawna\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:33.000\nShawna Tova told all of our Jewish people listening out there\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:36.000\nLet's bring out our Game Master, Shawie, Mrs. Spencer, Quintengan\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:46.000\nOh yeah\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:50.000\nAs he scampers nimbly across the stage, looking at mountain goats\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:56.000\nLet's also welcome the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:58.000\nThank you\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.000\nThank you very much\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:02.000\nYou're too kind\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:06.000\nWell, it's humility\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:07.000\nYou're too kind\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:08.000\nYeah, I don't deserve it\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:09.000\nWhat am I, George Carlin?\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nDeconstructing the...\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:13.000\nWhat am I, Andy Kindler?\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:16.000\nWhat am I, what am I guy?\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nThat's an Andy Kindler joke\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nWe've got to have Andy back on\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:22.000\nI'm very excited tonight\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:24.000\nWe have a best-selling author\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:26.000\nHe's written a landmark book\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nI don't know what you'd call it\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:30.000\nIt kind of bridges, I mean, for those of you\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:33.000\nFor those few of you in the Harmontown demographic\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nWho may be somewhere on the spectrum\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:38.000\nThose rare couple of you\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:42.000\nYou might be aware of a sort of\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:46.000\nOdd kind of tension that exists between\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nThe actually autistic, which is a hashtag that is used\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nYou know, actually autistic\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:58.000\nAnd the really, really beleaguered, frantic\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nSometimes heroic, sometimes unintentionally\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:05.000\nVillainous parents of autistic children\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:10.000\nIt's one of the most ironically divided\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:14.000\nRealms I find\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nEver since I've been writing\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nThe character of Abbott and community\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:21.000\nHave sort of been drawn into this world\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nAnd fascinated by it\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nAnd this guy wrote this book\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nIt makes holding hands\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:29.000\nAcross that schism somehow possible\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nIt's a really good book\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nIf you've ever had questions about autism\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nWhat the hell it is\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:37.000\nWhich we all do because in the 70s\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:39.000\nWe were cattle prodding children still\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:42.000\nLike, well, we can talk about that\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nThey were called tingle sticks\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:49.000\nAnd it was one of the most popular\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nThe guy that adventured\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nThat treatment method was a hero\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:56.000\nTo some of the most loving parents in the world\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:59.000\nBecause he represented a light at the end of a tunnel\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:01.000\nAnd it was so exciting\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nZapping kids for not hugging you\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nAnd then low and behold after a while\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nThey start hugging you\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:09.000\nIt was looked at\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.000\nHow much voltage was coming out of the tingle stick\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:15.000\nIt was tingley\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nIt was a modified cattle prod I assume they\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:21.000\nI don't know how you calibrate it\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nWith an autistic child\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nBecause that's a mistake, right?\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nYou can't calibrate it with an autistic kid\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nYou're going to zap him and go\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:30.000\nWhat do you think?\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:31.000\nAnd he's going to be like\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:34.000\nLemons\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nAll right\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nMaybe up the voltage\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nThat sounds like a joke-making light of autism\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:46.000\nBut obviously, I care\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nObviously\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nObviously\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nIsn't that obvious, people?\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:57.000\nI mean, I read the whole fucking audio book\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nIt's like 12 hours long\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nWait, you finished it?\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nI did by listening to it at double speed\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nNice\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nSo when I told the guy\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nI thought you sounded like Martin Scorsese\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.000\nWell, so you can read it\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:12.000\nYou can hear it at double speed\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nAnd it still scans\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nLike you can still dig it\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:18.000\nYeah, maybe I'm autistic\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nYeah, no\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nI've tried this with other books\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nI tried this with the Scientology book\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nAnd I found myself having to slow it down\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nBut I don't know if it's just the language\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:29.000\nOf his writing\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\nIs a great journalist\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nI'd love to talk to him about that, too\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nI spent so much time reading his book\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nThat I didn't research his career\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nWhich is probably kind of awesome, too\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nHe's just a great journalist\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nBut here's what the book sounds like\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nAt double speed\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nIn the context of a conference\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nAnd the experience proved to be a revelation\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:46.000\nIn ways that they could do\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:47.000\nDown from the outside\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:48.000\nNot all that much happened\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\nThey booed up cups of tea\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:50.000\nThat would still be sitting there hours later\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nCold on the floor\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:52.000\nBecause they suddenly forgot what to do with tea\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:53.000\nBut not distracted\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:55.000\nScorsese, right?\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nMy influence isn't that departed\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nI'm largely a Hitchcockian\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nBut people don't know that\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nThe thing about Hitchcock is\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nHe loved revelation\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.000\nHe loved revelation\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.000\nHe loved revelation\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:07.000\nBut anyways\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:10.000\nWhatever\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:11.000\nI'm in a great mood\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nMy wife is coming home tonight\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:13.000\nShe missed her flight yesterday\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nI'm a little concerned\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nBut I've been seeing the picture\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:23.000\nShe has lost a stone\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nNot a kidney stone\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:25.000\nDamn\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nShe's lost 14 pounds or more\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nWhich apparently the Irish\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:31.000\nPeople use stones to weigh stuff\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:35.000\nWhich doesn't seem scientific\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nBecause they come in and all\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nI mean, which which stone?\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nCould be a heavy one\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nHa ha ha ha ha\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nDid they round up or down\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nTo the nearest stone?\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nI don't even know\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nIf what you're doing is a joke\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nI'm not asking an honest question\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:53.000\nWell, I don't know what a stone is\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nHe weighs seven stone\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:57.000\nWhat is a stone?\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nMetrically, what is a stone?\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:00.000\n20 pounds\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nRight\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nSo yeah, so you weigh seven stones\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:04.000\nWhat if you weigh 125 pounds?\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:05.000\nShe lost a stone and I think\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nHe may have found it\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nWhile she was gone\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nIt was inside a donut\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nAnd I like, I took a bath tonight\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nAnd I was like scrub a scrub scrub\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nLike, like, because I really, I literally\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nAll right, like, I'm accustomed to the fact\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nThat this will elicit a reaction\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nBut in honor of our, of the book\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nWe'll be discussing tonight\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nI say this, I don't care\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nI haven't taken a shower since she left\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nYeah\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nOh, I got whistles\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:33.000\nThat's five weeks\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nPeople are shocked when they hear\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nHow little I am capable of showering\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:38.000\nIs that five weeks?\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nI don't, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nLike, I never thought about it\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:44.000\nI never did it\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:45.000\nYou know, maybe my chiropractor\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nWas probably like, ugh, it's like\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nIt's like a pin cushion\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:56.000\nFull of stink pins\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nI know my chiropractor has OCD\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nAnd like, I know I must be\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nI must constantly challenge his career path\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nEvery time I leave his office\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nHe must be like, why, why, why\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nWhy do I have to care about the human back\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nSo much that this man isn't my life\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nBecause I like, every time I come into the office\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nI have to, because you go, you face a table\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nAnd then it goes, brrr, and you go down\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nBut I have to empty my pockets\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nAnd my pockets are always just like\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nThere's just like, you know, random drugs\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nAnd like, beer bottle caps\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nAnd like, house keys\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nAnd just like wads of money\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nAnd he, he always like, he always\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nLook on his face, he's like\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:43.000\nI might as well be the baby rats\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nAnd he always goes like, he goes like\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nYou have a little bit of lint on your shirt\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:51.000\nAnd I'm like, if he's noticing lint on my shirt\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nHe wants to hang himself\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:58.000\nBecause here's some other stuff on my shirt\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nFive weeks of residue, you know\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nBlood stains from my back acne\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:07.000\nYeah\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nI'm not compatible with a, and he's like\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nBoy, if my mom saw that, like one time\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nHe said about like all my stuff\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nLike he's like, you gotta get a money clip\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:19.000\nLike, you keep telling me that, but 42\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nI think, I think, I think, I think\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nI think everything's kind of baked up here\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nLike I, I got my phone\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nAnd I got my pocket that has all of my money\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nMy wads of money\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nAnd I also feel like I probably lose\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:35.000\nLike $600 a week, which is fair to me\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:38.000\nIt feels like karmic, like, like, like, like\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nBecause do you give to panhandlers\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nOr, and encourage panhandling\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nOr as Spencer does, do you pull over\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nWhen you see a guy recycling cans\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nAnd, like, throw money at him\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:50.000\nThat he didn't ask for it\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nTo encourage industriousness\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nR.W.B.F. Skinner is our job\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nTo program the homeless with our money\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nThe actual solution is just ooze so much cash\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nThat you randomly just, like, you just\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nIt just comes out of you, like\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nIt's actual trickle down\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nYes, with Reagan was alive today\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nHe would be like, this is what I meant\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:17.000\nThe Star Wars initiative\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:21.000\nThat was the idea of, like\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:25.000\nThe Star Wars space station was trickle down\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nJustice, right?\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:30.000\nWe're going to trickle everything down\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nSo Erin's coming back\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nShe may actually walk in during the show\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nShe landed at 7.30\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.000\nI got a text, it may have been, no\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:43.000\nDid you do a little arts and crafts project at home?\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nI did, I did a...\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:49.000\nYeah, I cut out Welcome Home\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nOut of letters\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nAnd hung them from a string\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nYeah?\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nBare minimum\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nRight?\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nBut I really wanted to be there when the dogs are\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nBecause I feel like they're...\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:06.000\nYeah, that would be YouTube-able\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nThat's what's important\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:11.000\nI'm a little nervous about, like\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nI don't know, you know\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nDid you speak every day or talk or text?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nNo, because I'm not good on the phone\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nAnd FaceTime's weird, like\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nShe gets punished for calling me or FaceTiming me\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nBecause I'm like, I wouldn't be able to be with Erin\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nI wouldn't be married to Erin\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nIf text messaging wasn't invented\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nYou know, I wouldn't be anything\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:31.000\nI don't think if I...\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nThey didn't come up with a technology\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nThat allowed me to, like, you know\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nBecause someone calls you on the phone\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nEspecially FaceTime is especially, like\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nIt's just the worst\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nIsn't it the worst of all possible worlds?\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nBecause it's like, you can't...\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nIn a normal face-to-face conversation\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nYou have the option of minimized eye contact\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nYou can't do that with FaceTime\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nYou can't look at a George Jetson screen\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nAnd then just look away\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\nYou have to lock eyes with a deck of card-sized\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:07.000\nVersion of your wife and, like, stare at her\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nAnd then it'll be like\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nYeah, then what did you do?\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nThen I drank some water\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nIt's just not my wife\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nThis is an image of my wife\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nOkay\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nAnd then, inevitably, the other person on the other end\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nGoes like, alright\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nWhich means\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nYou don't love me\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nAnd I'm always like, like, like, what?\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nWhat? And they're like, what?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd I'm like, do you mean I don't love you?\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nLike, what?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nIt's bad\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nFaceTime is bad for me\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nSo, no\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nAnd that's all I... I don't know\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nBut then, on the other hand, like, my cat, Fiv\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nLike, she's sick\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nAnd, like...\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nSo then, like a...\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:54.000\nLike an, you know, like an emotionally, like, kind of\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nStunted person\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nLike, the reason we like animals is because they make a convenient, like\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.000\nBecause they can't, you know, you just... So, of course, I'm like\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nBalling about the cat\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nI, like, punched a wall, which I haven't done in 20 years\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nThere's a big hole in the bedroom wall\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nAnd I was like, like, rolling around in the bed going\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:11.000\nAh!\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nI recorded myself crying\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nBecause halfway through it, I was like, this sounds fake\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nWell, you...\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:24.000\nYou can separate those two parts of your brain that well\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nAnd, like, you're going through such a weird cry that...\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nYeah, no, because it was weird, because I haven't done this in 10 years\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nI don't even remember crying, like, like this\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nLet's see\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nIt's going to sound like Scorsese\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nIs this...\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nWait, there's nothing I need to do, right?\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nI'll just come out of the speaker, grandpa\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nSay, I don't know if...\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nThe suspense is palpable\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nI don't hear anything\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nI must have done...\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nIs this a voice memo or...?\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nDid I do it wrong?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nOh!\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nOh...\n\n13:04.000 -->

my therapist\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nI'm like, okay, this is fucked up\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nMy wife's been gone for a month\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nWhen she calls me on the phone, she walks away from it\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nfeeling unloved\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:15.000\nThe fucking cat that I've totally neglected\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:18.000\nThat's why it's dying, because I don't...\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nThat was incredibly ill when you found it\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nIt was already...\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nIt was FIV positive, but I'm saying\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nOnce we got the dogs, it was like\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nYou need to take that feline shit to the curb\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nGirl friend\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nI don't know why I pause before friend\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nI was trying to think of maybe girl fiv\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nThat's her name\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nShe's been neglected since the dogs arrived\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nI have not\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nShe's been chased away\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nby the dogs\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nShe's repelled by the dogs\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nParticularly Harvey\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nWhen I come over, she comes right at me\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nWhen the dogs are upstairs with you and I'm downstairs\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nShe comes at me and she's like\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nI need a friend really bad\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nShe's so bony\n\n14:58.000 -->

bummer, but I just want to be honest\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nabout that\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nBecause the important thing about that\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nis like, okay, this is not...\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nLet's not celebrate this as a man's bond\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nbetween him and his cat\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nThis is symptomatic of\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nmisappropriated emotional funds\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nYou know\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nAnd I shared that with my therapist\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nAnd I had a really good session based on that\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nAnd she said, you know, it's time\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nIt's time for the chapter\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\ncalled Dan Doesn't Have

17:50.000\nI was kind of scared or delighted\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nthat you were going to launch into just 10 minutes\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nabout airline food or something\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nbecause you were just standing there with the mic\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nHe's going to do stand-up\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nHigh chairs slightly scare me\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nOne wonders if I'm going to teeter off\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nI wish we could\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nThat's a good segue into our talk\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nabout autism\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nBecause the big theme\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nin the book is the realization\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nwhich is ironically realized\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nlong after Hans Asperger\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nsaid it originally\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nHis feelings\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\non the subject lost to the ages\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nuntil recently\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nIt's less about\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\ndiagnosis and treatment than it is about realizing\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nthat there's different kinds of brains\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nand there's a lot of ways we can\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nmake the environment compatible\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nto anybody that we happen to run across\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nThat's true\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nBasically in 1930s Vienna\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nhe started seeing these kids in his clinic\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nwho were interestingly mischievous\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nThey would steal a bunch of shit\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nto build up their chemistry sets\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nThey would get kicked out of schools\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nbecause they didn't take the teacher seriously\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nIt was sort of a clinic of last resort\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nOne kid was\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nthere's a typical thing\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nespecially with mildly autistic people\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nis\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nobsession with\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nparticular areas\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nOne kid was obsessed with poison and was there\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nbecause he had stolen cyanide from his school\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nThere were red flags\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nExactly\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nSome of the kids ended up there\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nthrough the court system and stuff\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nThe thing about this clinic was that\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nit was amazingly progressive place\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nbecause it was half clinic, half school\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nKids wouldn't just bring\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nkids wouldn't just get brought there\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nfor diagnosis or whatever\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nThe people who worked in the clinic actually lived\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nwith the kids and observed them\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\ntying their shoes in the morning\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nif they could or couldn't\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nThat's how they learned to recognize autism\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nAsperger and his colleagues\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nbelieved that autism and autistic traits\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nwere very common\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nIn fact\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nthat people with autistic traits had been\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\naccelerating the evolution of science\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\ntechnology and culture\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nmillennia\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nand we're already familiar\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nto all of us through the sort of pop culture\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\narchetypes of the absent minded professor\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nDr. Who\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nRight, well that wasn't invented yet\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nbut autistic people would soon\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nmake sure that it was\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nIt's not a character\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nbut I mean before the word\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nAsperger which by the way it should be noted\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nAsperger did not\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nHe didn't discover Asperger syndrome\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nHe discovered what we now call the autism spectrum\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nAnd was saying in the beginning\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nThis is a spectrum\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nand it was later\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nwhat was it the 70's when somebody coined\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nthe phrase Asperger syndrome?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nYeah, and that was a marketing term\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nactually because it was\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nan autism diagnosis that did not contain\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nthe word autism\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nand one of the reasons why it proved\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nto be so popular was that\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nit did not carry the heavy burden of shame\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nand stigma that the word autism\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\ncarried because parents\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nhad been blamed for autism not by\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nAsperger, one might note\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nby Leo Connor\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nthe Edison to\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nAsperger's Tesla\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nin the discovery of autism\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nwas a parallel I kept thinking about\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nWhat an appropriate parallel\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nBecause Edison was the more successful one\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nhe was the more neurotypical one\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nand he was better at issuing press releases\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nand he was\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nHe was American\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nand he had two advantages over Asperger\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nHe was, even though he actually\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nwas from Eastern Europe too, he lived\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nin America, he worked at Johns Hopkins Hospital\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nin Baltimore, but\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\neven better from the\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nperspective of history, he didn't work for Nazis\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nlike Hans Asperger did\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nBecause Hans Asperger's wonderful clinic\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nin the University of Vienna Hospital\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nWell, it happened to be in a country\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nthat the Nazis marched into\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nin 1938 to annex\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nfor the German fatherland\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nand so at that point Asperger's\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nposition in his culture became\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nvery, very tricky\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nbecause the Germans, inspired by the way\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nby American eugenics\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nscientists, were attempting to\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nbasically flush\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\npeople with hereditary diseases\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nand disorders out of the gene pool\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nThis is one of the craziest things about this book\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nbecause it's completely unexpected\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:10.000\nThere's probably\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nwhole entire books written about this stuff\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nbut they're probably\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\ntend towards conspiracy\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\ndramas and things like this\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nbut the cold hard facts are that\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nthe things that Hitler's reading\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nwhile he's in jail, before he writes\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nMein Kampf, are coming from our\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nside of the Atlantic\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nWe were becoming obsessed with eugenics\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nand\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nunashamed of them because\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nthey didn't have the current stigma because\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nthere weren't no Hitler yet\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nYou describe\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\na conference where\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nit's like the world's fair\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nof eugenics\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nBy the way, there was a slogan\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nin use at that conference which was\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nechoed in orphan black recently\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nthe self-direction of human evolution\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nthat creepy leaky guy\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nThat was actually a real slogan from\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nthe American eugenics movement\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nand they had like the ideal\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nparagon of civilization\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nwas this white athlete from Harvard\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nThey had statues\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nThey had composites made of the perfect man\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nwhich were based on the\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nten handsomest guys from Harvard\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nor something\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nReally\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nand it was\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nsome of the speeches\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nsome of the panels being done there\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nincluded titles like\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nthe Jewish problem\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nand the Negro problem\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nand all kinds of stuff about Negroes\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nand what are they\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nand what do they want\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nWhy are they hanging around all of a sudden\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nIt was\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nbone-chilling\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nI was completely unexpected because hearing him\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\ntalking into a book about\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nTemple Grandin but I'm seeing like this crazy\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nAlan Moore\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nIt feels like an alternate history where there should\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nbe zeppelins in the sky\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nThat was the thing man\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nThere have been a million books written about\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nAsperger's syndrome or autism or whatever\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nbut they've usually looked at\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nautism through a strictly medical lens\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nand there's actually been\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nvery very little written about Asperger\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nin his clinic and I thought\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nwhy hasn't anyone ever pulled the camera back\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nto see like the burning\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nJewish storefronts\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nYou know\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\neuthanasia going on\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nThat's the irony is that\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nwhat the history is written by the winners\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nand the myth that favors us\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nis that\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nit was the 1920s\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nand late ladies loved short hair\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nand sitting on flagpoles\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nand FDR had a plan\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nfor the kaleidoscope\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nand meanwhile\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nin Europe a growing menace\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nAdolf Hitler invents anti-Semitism\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nand slowly somehow manages\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nto convince half the planet\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nthat it's a great idea\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nand we sort of\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nthe absolute\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nugly truth of it is that\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nthere is an uplifting\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\naspect to it\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nan uplifting irony to the fact that\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nwe're flirting with it in open air\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\ninviting Jewish physicians\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nto a conference\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nto hear talk about the Jewish problem\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nthey weren't banned from the thing it was like\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nlet's just be anti-Semitic just because\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nit's fashionable you can't do anything about it\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nDr. Rosen\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nDo you want to be a doctor or not?\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nSure it couldn't hurt\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nand it's like well why do you talk like that\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nthat's the title of my next conference\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nwhy are you so Jewish\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nand he's like\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nare you there enough?\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nSon of a Tovah\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nand it's the shadow that we cast\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nby being allowed to talk about it\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nby publishing books about it\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nby\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nthe triple irony of\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nthe euphemism of the word eugenics\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nwhich means the good birth\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nthe fact that it took\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nwhat happened then\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nfor everyone to be shamed\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\ninto a proper historical perspective\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nis it's simultaneously\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\ntotally cynical but also\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nkind of like well\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\ngood that's what you get\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nthis is\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nlanguage's thought\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nand thought is deed\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nand you can't just\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nwalk around seething with hatred\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nand be polite about it\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nthat is going to end up\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nbeing the same\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nas actual\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nbad physical things happening\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nand also at some point the Nazis must have been like\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nwhy are the Americans objecting to this\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nwe are just putting their theories into practice\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nthey must have absolutely\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nlike Vonnegut used to use\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nthey must have thought for a while\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nthey could flip a coin\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nwhich side's America going to come in on\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nbecause we were certainly making money from both sides\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nselling oil and bullets\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nbefore we got into the war\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nso\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nI'm sure there were rooms in the Nazi headquarters\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nwhere they were like\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nthere's still a good 40% chance when they finally\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\ncome in\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nguys, Pearl Harbor, ah fuck\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nthey're not going to be able to spin that one\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nI guess they're\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nare we still? yeah, access of evil\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nwhy did we do that\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nwhat have we gotten\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nfree sushi\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nit's bad by the time it gets here\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nit's 1939\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nfree sushi\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nit's a good way to die\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nanyways\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nthat's a huge\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.000\na huge weird side note\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nbut you had to do it\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nyou had to reshine\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nlike long lost light\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\non that fact because\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nAsperger\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nthat it seems to be\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\none of the big answers to the question\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nwhy was this also complicated\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nand arduous\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nwhy is something that's being discovered way back then\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nstill in the 70's being treated with cattle prods\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nand part of the answer is because\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nAsperger is just like bound\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nto, you know, there's pictures of him\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nand there's swastika somewhere in the picture\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nbut the story is worthy\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nof a\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nRobert DeNiro movie or something\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nand the guy was a hero\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nhe didn't like no Nazis\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nwell he was a complex hero\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nhe probably had to make some concessions\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nthat we don't know about\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nto not have his head chopped off\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nbasically\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nyou don't mention any of those in your book\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nbut you paint a picture of a guy who by virtue\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nof his love of these children\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nis absolutely horrified\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nby the idea and he's sort of\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nsome of the ironic concessions\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nDan, could you use the word ironic more tonight?\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\none of the stranger\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nand more poetic concessions\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nthat he makes\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nhe tries to\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nhe tries to make a case for these kids\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\ncontinuing to get treatment because they'll make\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\ngood code breakers one day\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nand if you think about it with Alan Turing\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nin a sense\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nwe use the Aspergerian brain\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nto break the German codes\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nbut they were too busy killing\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nthe children that carried those genes\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nto make use of those talents\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nthe children that invented\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nas they entered adulthood\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nif they were time and time again\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nit's like\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\non one hand we have to eschew the myth\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nI don't think anyone suffers from this myth anymore\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nthe idea that every single person with autism\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nhas some kind of hidden superpower\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nlike an ex-man\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nbut it is true time and time again\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nthat through environmental understanding\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\ndoing the equivalent\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nof a ramp\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nfor someone as bound to a chair\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nwhich in this case\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\ninvolves sort of opening your own mind\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nchanging your own time scale\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nthat\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nthough the people\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nthat suffer from childhood autism\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nthat are raised in that patient of an environment\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nwhich is no easy thing in a capitalist world\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nthough they\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\ndo flourish\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nthey do learn how to communicate in their own\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\ntime and to the extent that\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nthere is disparity between the way they communicate\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nthe thoughts in their heads at mainstream society\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nthey have\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nalways been\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nit's not an exaggeration to say that they are\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nprogressing our society\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nright and one reason why we didn't\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nknow how cool autistic people could be\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nfor a couple of decades\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nwas that they were put in institutions\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nbecause the guy who took credit for discovering autism\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nwho was not Hans Asperger\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nbut this guy Leo Connor\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nsaid that even the special\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\ntalents of his kids like\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nthis kid could recognize 18 symphonies\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nbefore he turned 2\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nhe could correctly identify 18 symphonies\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nbut Connor instead of saying\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\noh this is really cool\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nthis is a specialized form of intelligence\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nwhich is what Asperger said\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nhe called it autistic intelligence\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nbut Connor said oh no no\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nthese kids are just unloved\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\ntheir parents are refrigerator mothers\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nand overambitious fathers\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nso the treatment is to remove the child\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nand put them in an institution\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nand have their family pictures taken out of the family albums\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nquietly and never mentioned again\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\none of the most chilling things is like\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nbefore the rise\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nbetween World War I and World War II\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nthere's a German doctor who

work\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nand also at some point they were being bombarded\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nby propaganda that such children\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nwere a burden on the

34:26.000\nmaking perfect little Aryan children\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nand they used the euthanasia program\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nto do the kinds of\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nesoteric medical experiments\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nthat would have been impossible\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nin cases where the patient was expected to live\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nbasically\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nwhat did you find\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nas you're delving into that\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\ndarkness\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nyou're reading so many books\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nletters\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nyou're knee deep in that world\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\ndid you come away with an impression\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nabout what our obsession\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nwith eugenics was\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nwas it a genuine, was it face\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nvalue, a fear that we were going\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nto mongrelize ourselves\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\ninto extinction, or was it\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nwas it just a\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:08.000\njust a completely dishonest\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\ndo you know what, here's the deal\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nlike while I was writing that chapter\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nI saw an ad\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nfrom some startup dude\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nwho was basically\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nselling some kind of new genomic scanning\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\ntechnology\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nand he was talking about things like autism\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nand ADHD and dyslexia\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nas like glitches in the human program\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nand we can finally fine\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\ntune our own code\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nso that we can eliminate these glitches\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nit was sort of like that's exactly\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nwhat eugenics came out of\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nthe notion that we can perfect humanity\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nby eliminating difference\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nand again\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nI'll use the word irony but\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nreally fittingly because\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nthe neurotypicals\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nthat are the villains in this story if there are any\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nthese neurotypicals were\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\njust to find that word for me what does that mean\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nnon-autistic people and that's a word\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\ninvented by autistic people\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nso it was sort of a hack because\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nit was a wonderful word because\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\ninstead of always being medicalized by us\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nthat allowed them to\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nmedicalize us\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nit was invented on the internet in the late 90s\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nso they seemed to have a capacity\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nfor racism which is not founded on\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nlogic\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nneurotypicals\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nisn't that a little strange\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nI kept waiting\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nto hear stories about\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nHans Asperger\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nhe was surrounded\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nby Nazis and completely incentivized\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nto toe the line\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nto the point where you're cautiously\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nassuming that if we saw every moment of his life\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nwe probably would click our tongues\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nwe probably would\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nand\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nbut he\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nthe weird thing is that\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nwe have this tribe\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nof cognitively\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nvariant people\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nwho because of their seclusion\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nbecause\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nthey tend to propel us\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nsocietally towards things like ham radio\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nwhich\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nwe'll talk about that\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nin a second but how fascinating it is\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nhow it just absolutely is\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nthat autistic people have been trying to make\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nthe internet since before there was internet\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nlaying around\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nand that we all\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nlove that world\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nwe all love emoticons\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nwe all love facebook\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nbut in no uncertain terms\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nit's not because you've done the research now\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nso it might have been tacky\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nbefore reading this book to say\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.000\nthey invented the internet\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nautistic people invented the computer languages\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nthat we use\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nbut it's clear from your book\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\nI mean it is\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:44.000\nit's a general fact that you can say\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nthat's the thing before I wrote this book\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nI wrote for 15 years for wired magazine\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nand so people were constantly saying\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\noh he's on the spectrum\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\noh Bill Gates he's on the spectrum\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nSteve Jobs on the spectrum\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nand so I actually went to look to figure out\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nwhat the history was\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nwhat were these people who would now say would be\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nsuper geeks on the spectrum\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nwhat were they doing before there was an internet\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\ncomputer through morse code\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nover ham radio\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nbecause there was no facial signals to parse\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nyou could\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nobsess about your favorite technology\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nand really get rewarded for it\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nyou could leave your old bullied\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\ngeeky, nerdly identity behind\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nand become like this amazing person on the internet\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nwith your, or not the internet, ham radio\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nwith your call letters\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nand so it was a strict\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nmeritocracy like programming is\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nso it didn't matter if you were a total dork\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nlike if you could do the shit\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nyou were cool\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nand the ham radio\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\ncommunity and also the\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nscience fiction fandom community\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nwere both organized by the same guy\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nwho I write about in the book\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nnamed Hugo Gernsback\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nwho almost certainly had Asperger syndrome\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nand by the way I do want to say\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nI'm not just diagnosing people willy nilly\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nlike if I say in the book that somebody\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nprobably had Asperger syndrome\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nthere's always a higher authority involved\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nlike Oliver Sacks\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nor in this case it's Hugo Gernsback's\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nbiographer Gary Westfall believed he was\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nAspergian. Anyway\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nhe was a very weird guy but he had a\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\ngenius idea which was to\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nmake home electronics\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\navailable to hobbyists rather than\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\njust scientists in other words\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nreally cool kids like they could order\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.000\nstuff from his mail order catalog\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nput it together and become a ham radio\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\noperator and in those catalogs\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nthere's pictures of nerdy kids\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nand now he sort of\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\ndeveloped this culture that when you look\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\nback at the 50s you're like\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nthe whole comic con\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:40.000\neverything kind of all of a sudden comes\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\ntogether it all snaps together\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nthe culture of fandom\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nthe culture of\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\noverlapping with nerdiness\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nour consumption of pop culture\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nthere's always been a fascination with\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nscience fiction associated with\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\npeople on the spectrum and\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nit's because of the\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nability to logically consume it\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nthe fact that you're talking about\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nworlds built from scratch which can make more sense\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nthan the confusing worlds described\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nin Catcher and the Rye or Freight Gatsby\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nit's like I guess he was rich\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nwhat am I learning from this book\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nwhereas it's like\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nZeep Zanflord landed in his\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nspace pod and stepped out it's like I can access\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nevery aspect of this and I can\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nthe first\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nfanzines and in fact the word fandom\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nthe concept of fanaticism\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nfan groups and things that all came out of the ham radio culture\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nwhich was connected to this\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nthis science fiction pulp\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\npulp culture\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\ncomic books and catalogs where you could buy\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nchemistry kits and\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:40.000\nand it was all started by\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\na guy who clearly\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nwanted to create his own world\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nand not only that\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nbut his best bud was Nikola Tesla\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nNikola Tesla had\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nthe chops to design\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nthat future world\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nthat's why I wanted you to bring your book up\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nbecause that's one of the passages I was hoping you could\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nthere's two passages I don't know\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:02.000\nif you can willy-nilly like page them up\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nbut one of them is\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nTesla talking about the future\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\ndescribing\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nwhat the world\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nis going to be like\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\ndo you put Tesla on the spectrum\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nhe wasn't neurotypical I actually don't\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nretro diagnose him but he had many many\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nautistic traits he was like fascinated with\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nglittering things\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nhe was very very honest\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nso like when his two aunts\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nasked him who was more attractive\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nhe said something like well you're not\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nyou're not quite as ugly as the other\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nso he had that aspergian utter frankness\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nyeah\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nwell I have a question but maybe we'll do after you\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nread this passage\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nif I can find it that is\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nmaybe I can talk\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nhere it is I got it\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nokay quote\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nwhen wireless meaning ham

like a no-brainer but yeah\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nkind of that's because we're on a podcast\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nI mean\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nlike Tesla again\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nit's like Tesla and Asperger both\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nprobably not neurotypical\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nand their rivals their successful\n\n42:58.000 -->

43:40.000\nand one of Asperger's artistic traits\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nwas that he was able to\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nresist peer pressure\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nso\n\n43:46.000 -->

43:54.000\nwhich is different from the norm is not necessarily\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\ninferior which was a very\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nun-nazi like thing to say\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nbecause there's a skepticism so that's what I was seeing before\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nmy train of thought got\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nremarkably\n\n44:04.000 -->

where are they going\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nand then that's his conversation\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nis that instead of small talk\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nhe can tell them about our route\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nto take next time they drive\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\ncan I just jump in and tell a little anecdote\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nI went to an autistic

--> 45:24.000\nand the second day that I was there\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nI went up to a guy who I thought was cool\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nthe night before and I said\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nhey man, how'd you sleep? and he said\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nwhy?\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nit was like\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\nan excellent question\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nand I realized like how much\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nfucking energy\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nI put into like reputation management\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nlike every time I walk into a room\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nhi, how'd you sleep? I'm charming\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nyou know\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nwow\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nI have to share this\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nbecause\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nand I have no idea what the person I'm talking about is\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nI'm not certainly not qualified to diagnose\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nanything but there's such a\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nI had an encounter\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nwhere I went up to somebody at a party and I said\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nI stood next to him\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nand I was like this guy\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nhe gets picked down by people\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nI love him\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nI'm an outcast, I'm gonna log some hours here\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nI'm gonna be a wonderful guy\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nand like\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nI'm gonna talk to him, not\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\ncool people\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nand so I stand next to him and I look around the party\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nand I go wow, looks like everybody's here\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nand\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nI just spent the next eight minutes\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nin a monologue\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nabout how I'm like\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nwell I didn't get the list of people\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nthat should be here, I wouldn't be able to compare\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nthe thing, it was\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nmaddening because in my mind I was thinking\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nyou little prick\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nI'm stupid here\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nyou know\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nand it's like that happens on a cellular level all the time\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nin interactions but like\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nwhat's at the core of it of course when you take a step back from it\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nis like you said\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nwhy am I asking how someone slapped\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nwe could have spent that\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\ntime inventing something\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nI love the\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nearly science fiction fandom\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nnickname for neurotypicals was\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nthe mundane\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nand so it's like\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nthose are the people who think they rule the world\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nthe mugwumps\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nhow easy is it to go back and\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nreverse diagnose people\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nare there certain\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\ncan you look back at Dostoevsky or Chaucer\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nare these people like\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nare there a way\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nto kind of definitively say\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nor you can kind of guess\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nwell\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nsome people are much more promiscuous\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nabout their retro diagnosing than I am\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nlike I'm a science writer\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nso I have to be strict\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nis there an etiquette, that's another thing\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\nlike when I was in Wired and I did that interview\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nwhere I told the guy at the end of the interview\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nI was like by the way and I took a quiz online\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nand it's like maybe I don't know that\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nand seeing an imprint I'm like so tacky\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nand where there's tackiness there must be etiquette\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nis there a guiding principle for\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nno\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nsome people seriously self-diagnosed\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nand you know\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nI believe it's called self-diagnosed peer supported\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nin the autistic community\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nso it's like basically if you're\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nif you're allegedly autistic peers say\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nyes you are like us\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nthen it's cool\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nif you just declare\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nyourself autistic\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nand there's no sort of\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nno one to gauge yourself against it's not as cool\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nbut the thing that I'll say is\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\npeople often say to me\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\ndon't you think we're just diagnosing\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nweird kids too much you know\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nI don't actually believe that\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nbecause virtually everyone who I've met\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nwho had an official diagnosis\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nreally did need like\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nspecial forms of support and whatever\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nand had a hard time\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\npassing among the mundane\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:48.000\nin the beginning of your book\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\ntalking about\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nthe emergence of the concept\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nof neurodiversity which is simply to say\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nthat ADHD\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\ndyslexia all these things\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nby the way all of my friends and so they're like\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nJustin Roiland definitely ADHD\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nco-creator of this cartoon I made\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nlike Joel McHale dyslexic\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nRob Schrab dyslexic like probably ADD too\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nlike every those\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nthose letters kind of like\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nif you live in Los Angeles and you make stuff\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nyou're always like\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\ninteresting thing about your book is that you don't have to now think\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nam I being tacky and fashionable\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nby diagnosing it's just\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nwell these are traits these are\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nthese are autistic traits you know like\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nwhatever which are not rare which are shared by everybody\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nright and I mean\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nwhen I first came across your\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\ncommunity here\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nI thought that it was kind of like looking\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nat broad swaths of the spectrum\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nthrough the other end of the telescope\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nlike most people look at\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nyou know autism only through the medical\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nend of the telescope\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nyou know but if you look at it through the cultural\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nlike that's why I called my book neuro tribes\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\ninstead of like\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nsome word related to disorder\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nlike I don't claim to know what the order\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nof the universe should be\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nso I avoid the word disorder\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nbut it's there's\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nand if you just wanted to sell books you would have called it titties\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nthere you go\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\ntitties inside\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:14.000\nneurotitties\n\n50:14.000 -->

50:42.000\nyou're a fan of the autistic community\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nas I also\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nam in your case\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nit's not so much out of a sense of

that you do not have\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nexactly great minds\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\ndo not necessarily think a lot\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nand so you've been a messenger\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nI mean your book that you've written you've surely noticed\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nthat the autistic community\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\ntell me if I'm wrong\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nor write about this because that's how I found your book\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nbecause I just check in with the autistic community\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nbecause I find them amazing\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\nand fascinating and especially in regards\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:18.000\nto their conflict with groups like Autism Speaks\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nand the ironies that ensue\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nI've read more than one\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nessay by an autistic adult\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nsort of celebrating\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nand also rolling their eyes\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nat the fact that it took a neurotypical\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nto be the Marco Polo of Autism's China\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nthat's true\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nnow these parents are listening\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nthat won't listen to us because a neurotypical\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nwrote a New York Times bestseller\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nwell at my\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nbook launch I was very very happy\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nto see we had a party in the\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nHaydn Ashbury in San Francisco where I lived\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nand I was very very happy to see\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nactually autistic people\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nin the audience\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nbecause usually there's like this huge divide\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nbetween like the autism speaks\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nparents and the clinicians\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nand the autistic people\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nbut kind of everybody was\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nin the same room there\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nand what was really great was\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nat some point in the Q&A afterwards\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nsomebody asked me like\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nwhat do you think the virtues of getting a diagnosis\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nin midlife are\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nand so while I'm thinking about it I'm thinking like\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nwho the fuck\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nI'm not supposed to answer that question\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nwe have experts here\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nyou know I asked if there was anybody\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nin the autistic section\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nsort of they were sitting together\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nI wanted to answer the question\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nand this woman stood up and she said\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\ngetting a diagnosis in midlife\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nwas like finding the Rosetta Stone\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nto myself\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nwas like holy fuck\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nI couldn't have come up with that\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nis there a lot of tribal pride\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\namong autistic\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nwell there is now\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nbut that's after decades of like being brutalized\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nand exterminated\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nand you know I mean yeah\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nare there groups of like\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nautistic people like playing World of Warcraft\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nin a room right now going this fucking mundane\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\ncall me up earlier and like\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nis it fun for them to rib us about being neurotypical\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nsure definitely\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nand not only that like one of the first things\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nthat I figured out by going to that\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nautistic retreat was that\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nmost of the clinical stereotypes about autistic people\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nwere completely wrong like there's this\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nbelief that autistic people like lack a sense\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nof irony don't get satire\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nand they don't really have a sense of humor\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nand so this one\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nautistic guy who had just been appointed to the National\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nCouncil on Disability\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nAriniaman of the autistic self advocacy\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nnetwork was introduced to the group\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nand so\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nthey were doing flap pause\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nwhich is this\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nit's like turning this stigmatized behavior\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\ninto a symbol of celebration\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nand so from the back this girl said\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nflap pause\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nit was nice because it also doesn't create\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nthis startling burst of sound\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nthat freaks them out you know\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nso from the back of the room this young woman said\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nwe love you Ari\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nif we were capable of feeling such an emotion\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nhahahaha\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nyeah the\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nthe myth of the no feeling thing\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nI think that simply comes from\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nthe fact that there's this\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nweird skepticism and I keep coming back\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nto this thing I never get to finish\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nthis thought because I don't really know what this thought is\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nand it's something to do with the fact that\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nwell if you want to be systemic about life\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nlike\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nthe actual Spock\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nif he was a real alien being\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nthat thought logically about things\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nwould he or would he not\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nbe in favor of eugenics\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nlike because when you apply\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\ncold this concept of the cold hard\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nlogic and he's a\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nhuman calculator\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\nbut obviously not\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nhonestly not\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nthere's more to it than that\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nthere's one other passage\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nif you can find it it would be earlier in your book\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\nit's about that guy\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nthe Tesla of chemistry\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nHenry Cavendish\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nyeah my book\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nopens unexpectedly\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nabout 200 years ago\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\nbecause that allowed me to describe\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\na very autistic person\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nbefore there were these layers of clinical cliches\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\nyeah\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nI have the reactions of the other people around him\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nwho had no idea\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nwhat to make of his fascinating peculiarities\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nor whatever\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nand he was a guy who took\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nthe same walk at the same time every night\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nwore the same clothes every day\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.000\nwhen they would wear out he would tell his tailor\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nto make an identical outfit\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nhe ate the same dish at every meal\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nleg of mutton\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nthere was a chamber maid\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nwho surprised him on the steps\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nwith a broom and so he ordered\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:48.000\na new set of steps\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:50.000\nso that it wouldn't happen again\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:52.000\nthat's not the same cold hard logic\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:54.000\nthat goes into genocide\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.000\nthere's no laziness there\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nhe practically\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\ninvented science\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\nhe measured\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nthe density of the earth\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nin a shack in his backyard\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nhe figured out how to do it with pendulums\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nand it was like the best\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:12.000\nestimate of the density of the earth for\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\n100 years or whatever\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nand he didn't just do science\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:18.000\nhe invented fields of science\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nand yet\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nhe was completely\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nimmobilized practically at parties\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nhe would just stand off to the side\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nlistening\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nlooking away\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nand that was something that Asperger picked up on\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:34.000\nConnor was like\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nthey failed to make eye contact\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nbut Asperger was like\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nactually they're learning really a lot about the world\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nthey're just not looking at you\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nbecause looking at you is actually\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\noverloading their senses\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nand there was a colleague who described him\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:50.000\ndo you remember the light metaphor\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nthe white light\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\na cold light which warms nothing\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nyou could\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nfind that I'll just use you as a google engine\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nhave you been traveling all over the country\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nworld doing readings\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nand selling this? well this just came out\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nlike two and a half weeks ago so it like\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\npopped on the best server list\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nso that's good\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:16.000\ncongratulations\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\ndon't we need different words\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:24.000\nfor things like compassion\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:26.000\nin a world where\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:28.000\nthe people who have been responsible\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:30.000\nfor\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\ncreating a more Roddenberry like world\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.000\nare\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\naccused of\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:38.000\nare describable as not having it\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.000\nand yet the people who have been trying\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:42.000\nto cure them in childhood\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.000\nare people who are cattle prodding them\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:46.000\nright right the people who supposedly\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nhave the empathy that these people lack\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:50.000\nare the people sticking cattle prods\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.000\nI feel like there's a word we're missing\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nin the English language that maybe an autistic person could\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\ninvent for us\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.000\nso that we can stop making that\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.000\nthere's a distinction we're making that's not 100%\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.000\naccurate about whether they're\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nfeeling things\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:06.000\nand the great thing is that once\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:08.000\nthe internet was finally invented and I talk about how\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\na\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nvery autistic person helped invent the first\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:14.000\nsocial network that was open to the public\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:16.000\nactually this guy Lee Felsenstein\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:18.000\nbut anyway the internet gave a place\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:20.000\nto autistic people where they could\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\ntalk to each other rather than\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\njust talking to clinicians\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:26.000\nso instead of being isolated patients\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nbrought there by their parents\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nthey could just talk to each other\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nand one of the first things they figured out was that autism\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\npersists into adulthood\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nlike believe it or not\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nthis is one of the things that most people forget\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.000\nbut up until the 70s or 80s\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:42.000\nreally the 80s\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.000\nthe diagnosis was not really available\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nto adults or even teenagers\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nand Americans and people say\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nwhy are the rates of diagnosis going up\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.000\none reason is that\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:54.000\nteenagers and adults could not get the diagnosis\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nuntil the 80s and 90s\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nand that was one thing\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nthat Asperger Syndrome was good for\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nit's simply like yeah it's the Wendy's and Burger King\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nof\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nwhich is neither a good thing or a bad thing\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nit's like we've developed since the early 80s\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nsystems that are now available\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nto clinicians to diagnose autism\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.000\nso the diagnosis just\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nwent through the roof\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nand also another thing that people I would say under\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nappreciate generally even some autistic people\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nis Rain Man\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:24.000\nlike people think oh what a cliche\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nDustin Hoffman, Raymond Babbitt with the cards\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:28.000\nand the toothpicks whatever\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nbut actually that film was completely\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.000\nrevolutionary\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:34.000\nbecause even people who had been in autism circles\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nfor decades had never seen\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nan autistic adult\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\ncertainly on screen ever\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:42.000\nand so Raymond Babbitt made autism\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:44.000\nrecognizable\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:46.000\nto teachers, to parents\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nto autistic people themselves\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nto clinicians and so\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nthat was one of the sort of elements\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:54.000\nof the perfect storm of autism awareness\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nthat created the apparent epidemic\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:58.000\nSteve I know I'm totally ignorant\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nabout autism but is it a strictly\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nneurological thing\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nis it a developmental\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nthing in the brain? Yes\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nalthough we still don't have a biomarker\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nfor it so there are no blood tests\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nfor autism there are no brain scans for autism\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nlike you can't... Can you take autistic\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nlike can you scan brains\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nand see similarities in autistic brains or not?\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nWell that's a subject of much debate\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nbut the problem is that\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nevery six months another study comes out\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nit's too much white matter, it's too little white\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nmatter, it's too much connectivity\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nit's too little connectivity\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nit's like there are all these conflicting studies\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nabout what the biomarkers of autism are\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nIt's certainly hereditary\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nand that was one of the things I asked\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nSo on one hand you have a spike in diagnosis\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nbecause that's I suppose the biggest question\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nthat your book would need to answer that someone would come to\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nis what's going on with this autism\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nepidemic\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nwhich you get right to\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nin the opening of the book\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nand slowly answer\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nthroughout the book and it seems to be\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000\ncorrect me if I'm wrong\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nthe two biggest factors are\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nwhat we just talked about\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nthe increased availability\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nof the diagnosis\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nbut you hint at\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nearly in the book this odd\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nlike\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nit's an engineer's disease\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nthat it does seem\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nhereditary and that\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nour modern world created\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nby autistics\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nour Jetson world\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nthat we all love\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nthat we all fantasize about in science fiction\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nthat autistics make a reality by actually thinking\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\noutside the actual box\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nthat that world\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nin a crazy\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\npoetic\n\n01:01:38.000 -->

people who used to be defined\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nby their virginity are now\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nable to hook up\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nand you were saying yesterday, I don't know if it was from Steve's book or not\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nthat\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nSilicon Valley is seeing a big rise of like\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nautistic birth rate or something like that\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nwell that was the subject of my article\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nthe geek syndrome in 2001\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nand yes that's interesting\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nbut and that might\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nbe happening it's geneticists call it\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nassortative mating which is basically\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nwhen people who are carrying\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\ntraits for a certain condition\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nget together there's more of a chance\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nthat their kid will have the condition\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nand that's how I\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nfirst got into autism because I'm not a parent\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nI'm not a relative I now have an autistic trans\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nnephew I will say\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nbut\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nI got into it because I was on a boat with a hundred\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000\ncomputer programmers\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nand towards the end of this cruise\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nin Alaska I asked\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nthis big programmer guy Larry Wall\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nif I could come to interview him at his house\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nand I noticed that\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nhe had customized his house\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nlike he had turned the buzzer on his\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nclothes dryer to a light\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nso it was not so startling and annoying\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nand\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nhe said yeah you can come to my house but I should tell you\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nwe have a profoundly autistic daughter\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nand then\n\n01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nlike six months later I was writing about another family\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nin Silicon Valley can I come to your house\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000\nwoman said yeah by the way we have an autistic\n\n01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000\ndaughter and I thought hmm that's odd\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nand the next day I was in a cafe\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nin San Francisco telling that exact story\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000\nto a friend of mine and this woman at the next table\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nsaid oh my god\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000\ndo you realize what's going on\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nthere's an epidemic of autism\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nin Silicon Valley\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nand so like the hairs on the back of my neck\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nwent up you know and that turned out to be\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nlike a doorway through which I\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nstepped into the next you know 15 years\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nof my life and this book\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nis an attempt to get right what\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000\nI sort of bunted on\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nin the geek syndrome because yes\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000\na sort of meeting is fascinating\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nall these dungeons and dragons people getting\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000\ntogether by talking through screens\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nfinding their way through dungeons\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000\nincreasing efficiency\n\n01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nright right so it used to be a map\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000\non a graph paper now you can like\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nuse a computer to get through that dungeon\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nright and so that's interesting\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nbut why are autism\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nrates also going up in rural\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nAlaska for instance you know might be\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000\ndungeons and dragons there too but\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nanyway so this was my\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\neffort to get right what I had sort\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nof wimped out on in geek\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nsyndrome yeah it took me five years it could\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nbe a whole I mean it gets into a whole area\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nof like what is the nature of evolution\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nwhy does
