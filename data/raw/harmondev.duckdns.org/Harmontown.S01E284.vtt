00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Okay. Hello. I would like to order a burger, please.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay. I mean, usually you would just say what you wanted, like you pulled up to burger spot, but that's fantastic.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
I would like a cheeseburger and a soda and some fries.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Got it. And those are Carolina hot cake fries, or do you want the blisters?

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Are the blisters hot cake style?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Yeah. 100%. They're blasting, man.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Okay. I'll have those.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Great.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Can I take your order?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Welcome to Denny's.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Is there supposed to be another...

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
We've been getting interference.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Listen to him. Hey, can I get your order? Daryl.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
You're interference, man. I mean, go ahead and do the order, but you're going to have to go across the street.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Well, how come I can hear him? Why is there two speakers?

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, okay. So we just bombed Syria.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Right.

01:15.000 --> 01:28.000
And so the Russians are responding with a massive cyber attack. And what's happened is they've created an interference wave that's essentially all the fast food restaurants have mixed up with each other.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
So they knew the number one way to hurt America was to fuck up the fast food distribution chain.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
And it's working.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Seven of our customers committed suicide last week.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
We're going for eight. Can I take your order?

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
You just have to cross the street.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Why do I need to go across the street? You're the same restaurant. The Russians can't make your food different.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
If you want an order from me, you can. I will take your order from you.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
But I am in another restaurant three blocks up.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Whoa.

02:02.000 --> 02:11.000
No!

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
All right. We get we get time and a half.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah. So cool. Per suicide. Thank you, Putin.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Who?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
It's Harmontown time.

02:22.000 --> 02:43.000
Harmontown. Here we go. We're sending. You got to get off the stage.

02:43.000 --> 02:53.000
Here we go.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Okay. Do I start now?

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Here we go, friends. Welcome to the Pre-Singularity Pre-World War Three.

03:02.000 --> 03:17.000
Harmontown presenting your favorite gay master Rob Schrupp.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
And there he is. King of the town, Dan Harmon.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Yo, yo, yo.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Rap with the rap.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Rap with the rap at the top of the show rap.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Put the music in your heart and your feet.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Fuck your mama until she's red like a beat.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Get the beat in the street.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Make your voice go up a couple matches.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
I'm gonna fuck your mama with my dick.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Not doing anything weird.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Stuffin' sick.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Just gonna take her out.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Take her back home and shout into her pussy like a paper bag.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
And then I'll pop it.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
All right. Thank you.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Thank you.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
We're still working out the...

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I like this new format.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Yeah, we're still working with the format.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
This is fantastic.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
We could do this every week.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Change nothing.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
We opened with the drive-thru sketch, a classic.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
A little updated.

04:15.000 --> 04:24.000
There were some added updates of Topical News Nightingale.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
That's right.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Because it's coming.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
If this is your first episode of Harmontown, you've...

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Not for me.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
You shouldn't...

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
This isn't like the other episodes.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
This is a very special episode.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Our comptroller is Duncan Trussell.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Thanks for coming.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Hello, everyone.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Thank you. Good to be here.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Our game master is Rob Schrab.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Game master.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Game master.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Rob Schrab, the game master.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
You're filling in his game master.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I think you're missing a consonant.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Nope.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Not at all.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
What are you accusing him of gaslighting?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Yes.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
And there's no audience.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You're losing.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
You're losing the audience.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Is it...

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I mean, am I allowed to leave the podium and get myself vodka?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Thanks.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Do we have...

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Do we have...

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Cokes or sodas?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Do you have Coke Zero?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Do you have...

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Crystal Pepsi?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Do you have...

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Cherry Seven Up?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I don't know what else we have besides vodka.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
What about Le Quai?

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Will someone please bring Rob a non-alcoholic beverage?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
All right, guys. Here we go.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I just need something sweet.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
This is...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I wouldn't mind...

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Wouldn't mind getting through this one kind of quick.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Which one? The show?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
What's wrong?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Why don't you shorten the show?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I got a hot game of Minecraft going at home.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Why don't you shorten the show?

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I'm thinking maybe I'll start shortening it by ten minutes every week

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
so that no one notices that it's eventually an hour.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
No, this is all water.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
This is water?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Okay, that's kind of like soda.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I gotta say, you know, I haven't been here in a while, man.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
But we've been tightening the format, yeah.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
And this is strange.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
This fits in with everything that's happening.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
You know, it's perfectly exactly what's happening.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
It's like this kind of fantastic collapse.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Do we have no audience last time you were here?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
No, we had an audience.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
We had this beautiful, wonderful audience.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
And now it's just this empty, cavernous space.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
It's like the end of it.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
This is something I've been thinking about a lot is the apocalypse

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
and how the apocalypse is not going to be the way people think

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
the apocalypse would be.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
No big insects.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
What's that?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Sorry.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Keep going.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
No what sex?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
No big insects.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Insects.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
No incest in the apocalypse?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
No big incest.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
No, no, massive incest.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
I think it'll be filled with giant insects.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Like giant bees that fuck their cousins?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
Most insects are essentially practicing massive incest, right?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
You know, I've never looked into that.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
I have no idea.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I suppose every species has some built-in insects.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
I suppose every species has some built-in exogenous safety valve

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
like tries to keep itself from fucking itself.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah, there's probably a safety valve.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
So when you leave for Minecraft, you know, Duncan and I will just,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
you know, we'll mine the store while you go play your game.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Now that sounds like a plan.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah, we could get a lot of stuff done tonight after he'd go.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
We'll probably have an audience again soon.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
You know, we're going to be moving out of here.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Into my butthole.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
I am evicting us so that the great Taiko ITT can make his starburns feature.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I love his trains.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
I mean, the format is crazy right now.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
I know.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, that's why I was doing this.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm trying to get it out of the system because I know we're going to be back in front of an audience soon

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
and then we're not going to be able to do stuff like fake cold opens and things, you know?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
No, I mean, this is like something in it.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
This is like a dream.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
This is like something I would dream.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
I would dream I was doing this with no audience or something like truly like after the world ends,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
a few of us have gone mad.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
There's a few people in an old empty warehouse and we're like, fuck it.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
We'll just do a talk show.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
We all have beers and we're eating our legs.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
I mean, there's something about like if it was like if you walked outside, you would die.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
You know, like there's something about still doing the podcast.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
The responsibility of like, look, people are boarded up in their homes.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Right.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
You know, they're eating their legs or growing beards, but they still this is the only happiness they have.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Oh my God.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I know.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I know what this reminds me of because I was just watching it.

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
You know, one thing that just infuriated me is I realized you cannot download the original dawn of the day from normal meat.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
You have to get it off of YouTube.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
It's low.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
What are you talking about?

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
You as far as I'm aware, you can't get it from Amazon.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
You can't get it from iTunes.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
You can't get it from the normal ways that you would down.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
You could you could torn it.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I'm sure.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
But like, you know, the convenience of just downloading it for like three bucks.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
It's for some.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Who knows why?

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
Because they want you to get the new one because it's probably same money going to the same place and so they want.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
Well, they just put out a 4k version of night of the living dead and they're probably doing a new restoration of that.

10:03.000 --> 10:14.000
I just bought coincidentally somebody took like all of the cuts of the original dawn of the dead because Dario Argento produced it.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
And there was like more different deleted scenes in the Italian version.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Someone did a super cut of both of them.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
And I'm going to get it in the mail this week.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
So I've never seen the Italian version of it.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
That's badass.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
It's a different name, wasn't it?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Was it zombie or something?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I think.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
But that's one of my favorite movies.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
And it starts off and it's sorry, Dan.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
It starts off on a TV studio during the apocalypse and they're trying to process it.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And it's very similar to this, except we're like more low-key.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
They're freaking out.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
But it is like an abandoned news state.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
Like the cameras moving around, people are talking in the background.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
It does have this kind of dead has been show feeling.

11:00.000 --> 11:09.000
Well, in honor of that release, didn't we write a what if we were dawn of the dead sketch?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
So I don't know why you guys are spoiling it so much.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Okay.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
I mean, I said we should segue to this topic to tee up our dawn of the dead sketch that

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
we've been spending so much time on.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
We had our meeting about the show yesterday.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah, when we wrote the burger sketch.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Right.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
It took a long, a team of 15 writers.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Yeah.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Well, yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
So let's start that sketch.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
This is the dawn of the dead sketch.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
They're coming for you.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
It's funnier every time, man.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

11:48.000 --> 11:57.000
Last week on Night of the Living Dead, they're coming to get you, Barbara.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
They're coming for you.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
They've been dead a long time, Barbara.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
They're coming for you.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
You know, man, when I was watching my friend, his throat ripped out by a zombie before I

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
ran in here.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Yes, Barbara.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I thought to myself, I'd never laugh again.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I would go into shock.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I'd go nuts.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
But that fucking thing, man, every time you keep doing that impression from Night of the

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Living Dead is fucking funny.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It's a good one, Bob.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
How did you first learn how funny that was?

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
Oh, the first time I said it, Barbara.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
And Barbara laughed.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
And then you also laughed, Barbara.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Can I be clear on something?

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
You're saying that he's doing it from the movie Night of the Living Dead.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Yes.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
He's doing the impression, ironically, because I slipped on intestines on the way in here.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I did, Barbara.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
All right.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
I just want to be clear, because that's sometimes a thing like Night of the Living Dead is a

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
movie that we can read.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
And the thing defines the thing, Barbara.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
So they're coming to get you, Barbara.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
But here we are.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Can I ask if you...

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I've been saying that all night.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Oh, shit.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Shit.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Sorry, I got it.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
We're live again.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
They're coming.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
All right.

13:33.000 --> 13:42.000
If you are in the Glenbrook area, Recita, Riverside, we have a new list of shelters for you.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Riverside?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Do not go to the schools.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Do not go to the shelters.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
We mentioned in the previous segment, those shelters have been...

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Again.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Seriously, my mom lives in Riverside.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
If you are just tuning in...

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Guys, we're live.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
It's not funny, my mom.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
They're coming to get you.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
The dead have been returning to life...

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
...and murdering the living.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I left the door open.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
It's okay.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
It doesn't...

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
It's okay.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Laughter will get through.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
We...

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Laughter will get through this.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
We have a doctor here, a physiologist in the studio.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
His name was Finch Williams.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
I was my brother.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
He was eating his throat.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
I guess he's no longer with us.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Okay.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Again.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Why isn't somebody doing something?

14:40.000 --> 14:45.680
If someone near you has perished, do not leave the body unattended.

14:45.680 --> 14:51.500
Do not attempt to bury it, burn it, or cut off the head, or drive a sharp object.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.000
Don't do any of that?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
No.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Don't...

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Oh, sorry.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.840
Don't bury the body.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.840
Just hang out with it.

14:58.840 --> 14:59.840
Don't sit shiva.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.840
I think that's what they call it.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.840
Well, you could...

15:02.840 --> 15:04.840
You could try to make it laugh.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.840
You could go, they're coming to get you, Barbara.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.840
It's not funny anymore.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.840
If I was gonna make a zombie laugh, I wouldn't...

15:10.840 --> 15:11.840
It's funny.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.840
It's not...

15:12.840 --> 15:14.840
My mom's probably dead right now, and it's my fault.

15:14.840 --> 15:18.840
Well, I mean, the question is, like, is she really dead if she comes back to life?

15:18.840 --> 15:19.840
Your mom's immortal now.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.840
That's not...

15:20.840 --> 15:21.840
That's not...

15:21.840 --> 15:22.840
You know what I mean?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.840
Your mom's, like, immortally retarded?

15:24.840 --> 15:25.840
Is that what a zombie...

15:25.840 --> 15:29.840
The last thing I said to her is, like, I hope they fucking get you.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.840
It's just your mom's gonna live forever.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.840
You should be happy.

15:32.840 --> 15:33.840
Oh, shit.

15:33.840 --> 15:34.840
Fuck.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.840
You know what?

15:35.840 --> 15:41.840
We're gonna take a brief break from the broadcast, because I left my keys in the helicopter

15:41.840 --> 15:46.840
on the roof, and I'm just gonna run up there, go in the helicopter, grab my keys, and come

15:46.840 --> 15:49.840
back down to hang out here with everybody.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.840
All these funny people, and keep helping people by...

15:53.840 --> 16:02.840
I'm so glad we have that helicopter, because it was ever a reason to have all this shit.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.840
Did you hear something?

16:04.840 --> 16:05.840
Yeah, I heard it.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.840
What did you hear?

16:06.840 --> 16:10.840
I heard a bird flapping really fast.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.840
Yeah, it sounded like a giant hummingbird.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.840
Or...

16:14.840 --> 16:19.840
Helicopter...

16:19.840 --> 16:21.840
And scene.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.840
I thought we were gonna say helicopter together.

16:24.840 --> 16:25.840
Yeah.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.840
We didn't.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.840
Yeah, I mean, it's a good...

16:28.840 --> 16:33.840
So Dawn of the Dead is probably coming out on DVD or something, and so we threw that

16:33.840 --> 16:34.840
together.

16:34.840 --> 16:35.840
Yeah, on DVD.

16:35.840 --> 16:36.840
DVD will come out.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.340
We have some other sketches coming up throughout the show.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.340
King Kong lives.

16:40.340 --> 16:41.840
Try and get your mind off the Trump thing.

16:41.840 --> 16:46.240
You know, we're not doing a lot of current event sketches, but we do, you know, we gotta

16:46.240 --> 16:50.840
do a couple, otherwise we're gonna lose listeners to MSNBC, so...

16:50.840 --> 16:51.840
True.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.840
We try to keep it above the belt.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.840
We try to keep it...

16:55.840 --> 16:58.840
We try to keep it above the belt.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.840
This is wild, man.

17:00.840 --> 17:06.840
Last time I was here, filled with people laughing, no bad...

17:06.840 --> 17:07.840
Do you know why they stopped?

17:07.840 --> 17:08.840
Do you know why they stopped coming?

17:08.840 --> 17:09.840
Yeah, I heard it.

17:09.840 --> 17:10.840
I heard it.

17:10.840 --> 17:11.840
Quality.

17:11.840 --> 17:12.840
Yeah, I heard the quality.

17:12.840 --> 17:13.840
Yeah, we actually...

17:13.840 --> 17:16.840
We dropped our tickets to a penny.

17:16.840 --> 17:18.840
People just aren't coming.

17:18.840 --> 17:20.840
What happened?

17:20.840 --> 17:21.840
It just slid downhill.

17:21.840 --> 17:22.840
Yeah, I just...

17:22.840 --> 17:23.840
What happened?

17:23.840 --> 17:24.840
I started showing up regularly.

17:24.840 --> 17:25.840
I don't...

17:25.840 --> 17:26.840
Is it you?

17:26.840 --> 17:29.840
I remember you spiraled into like some deep, dark existentialism.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.840
Yeah, that's always good.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.840
Then you incurred the wrath of the gods is what happened.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.840
Do you worry about that?

17:37.840 --> 17:43.680
That the reason that the fire department came and shut down Harmontown and that the chaos

17:43.680 --> 17:47.340
is coming from a vortex of that dark...

17:47.340 --> 17:48.340
Remember that?

17:48.340 --> 17:50.340
Like the limit, that thing you went into?

17:50.340 --> 17:53.340
Do you worry that it's like law of attraction stuff?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.340
I'm on the rim.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.340
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure...

17:57.340 --> 18:00.340
I believe that stuff like that is related.

18:00.340 --> 18:04.340
Like, you know, you get dark enough and the universe around you starts reflecting that

18:04.340 --> 18:05.340
darkness.

18:05.340 --> 18:06.340
What do you think about?

18:06.340 --> 18:07.340
What do you think about?

18:07.340 --> 18:08.340
What do you think about?

18:08.340 --> 18:09.340
What do you think about?

18:09.340 --> 18:10.340
What do you think about?

18:10.340 --> 18:11.340
What do you think about?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.340
What do you think about?

18:12.340 --> 18:13.340
What do you think about?

18:13.340 --> 18:14.340
Yeah, but I don't see the merit in...

18:14.340 --> 18:15.340
I mean, I'm trying...

18:15.340 --> 18:18.340
And it's just that I...it's just hard to...

18:18.340 --> 18:24.340
I don't want to...I don't want to disingenuously be happy, you know?

18:24.340 --> 18:26.340
I don't want to, like, force it.

18:26.340 --> 18:30.340
Like, you know, those people that say it takes less muscles to smile and you got to think

18:30.340 --> 18:31.340
positive stuff.

18:31.340 --> 18:32.340
It's just like...

18:32.340 --> 18:33.340
I don't know.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.340
What I like to do is be happy.

18:35.340 --> 18:38.340
I had it out with my therapist Friday.

18:38.340 --> 18:40.340
Let her have it.

18:40.340 --> 18:47.140
And, you know, like, it was a pretty interesting session because it was pretty...you know,

18:47.140 --> 18:54.060
she made it pretty clear, like, I do have an...I do have...you know, I...my big thing is shame.

18:54.060 --> 19:00.140
And the shame doesn't really let me...you know, it just sort of dominates everything.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.140
Like, I'm...

19:01.140 --> 19:02.140
There's a lot of people.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.140
That's a big thing.

19:03.140 --> 19:08.300
I got to try to...the next five years is going to be about replacing the shame with esteem.

19:08.300 --> 19:11.980
You know, the...I just think Terrence McKinnon said, I always think about is that...because

19:11.980 --> 19:15.380
you know, the happy idea, you're supposed to be happy, but that...like, Terrence McKinnon

19:15.380 --> 19:20.780
was saying this thing about how...he was talking about something called shamanic ecstasy.

19:20.780 --> 19:27.700
And like, ecstatic states are not limited to happiness or joy states, but there's ecstatic

19:27.700 --> 19:33.580
sadness, ecstatic shame, ecstatic misery.

19:33.580 --> 19:38.540
And I really like that because it's not an invitation to, like, oh, just be happy.

19:38.540 --> 19:44.220
It's more of an invitation to, like, fully be what you are right now as deep as you can

19:44.220 --> 19:46.020
be, which is what you do.

19:46.020 --> 19:54.380
And even if that thing produces a wave of some kind of psychic repulsion that produces

19:54.380 --> 19:59.420
dark ripples that make the fire department shut down this beautiful fucking theater and

19:59.420 --> 20:03.980
transforms everything into a reflection of the darkness, even that's kind of amazing

20:03.980 --> 20:06.220
because it's like, holy shit, magic's real.

20:06.220 --> 20:10.860
I was looking at it more like, the funny thing is, as much shame as I have, I didn't really

20:10.860 --> 20:12.860
think to blame myself for the fire marshal.

20:12.860 --> 20:16.780
I was actually thinking the fire marshal was bailing me out, like, that that was God,

20:16.780 --> 20:22.100
like, saving me, because I was really...because I was starting to hate the audience.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.100
And I mostly hate myself.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.100
I mean, you can't really hate an audience.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.100
An audience is always...

20:26.100 --> 20:29.340
Are you afraid...are you afraid you're going to hate the audience again when they...

20:29.340 --> 20:30.340
No, no, no.

20:30.340 --> 20:31.980
It's like a rom-com, you know?

20:31.980 --> 20:36.380
We broke up, we spent all this time apart, now I've got long hair.

20:36.380 --> 20:37.660
Why'd you hate them?

20:37.660 --> 20:41.780
I hated...I just hated what we were all going through together, you know?

20:41.780 --> 20:43.780
So it's just brought out the worst in all of us.

20:43.780 --> 20:45.780
You know, I speak for myself.

20:45.780 --> 20:50.020
It's just made me...I was just really sad and all this stuff, so it's like, I'm not

20:50.020 --> 20:54.220
going to have a good relationship with the audience.

20:54.220 --> 21:01.540
It was just like, they're a giant crowd of people that react on certain cues, and like,

21:01.540 --> 21:04.980
that was exactly...you know, it wasn't in the mood for that.

21:04.980 --> 21:10.780
We were all feeling kind of like, really frightened about these concepts of like, crowd dynamics

21:10.780 --> 21:15.820
and stuff, like, how you...you know, what makes people go, ooh, or what makes people

21:15.820 --> 21:21.980
go boo, or yay, or it just kind of...there was no good news to any of it.

21:21.980 --> 21:26.820
It was like, I would come out on stage and I would...I don't ever think about it that

21:26.820 --> 21:33.060
much, but it was just like, my micro flowchart would be...if you slowed it down, would be

21:33.060 --> 21:36.540
something like, okay, so what am I supposed to do?

21:36.540 --> 21:44.420
Ignore how much peril is...I feel how much sadness, how much frustration, how much humiliation,

21:44.420 --> 21:46.660
how much shame, how much rage.

21:46.660 --> 21:52.940
Do I ignore those things, and then become like a kind of...I don't know, like a Regis

21:52.940 --> 21:54.460
Philbin character?

21:54.460 --> 22:01.220
Do I become like, you know, Sean King?

22:01.220 --> 22:05.460
Do I become like...do I become a voice of a generation?

22:05.460 --> 22:08.900
That sounds like a lot of work, and not my generation.

22:08.900 --> 22:14.420
Do I actually have to...you know, it's like an experiment with signal boosting young activists

22:14.420 --> 22:15.420
and stuff.

22:15.420 --> 22:21.060
Like, okay, let's use this platform because it just doesn't feel right to sit around and

22:21.060 --> 22:24.020
talk about how I don't want to tie my shoes anymore, you know?

22:24.020 --> 22:30.020
I was just thinking as you're doing this, like, you know, obviously Jonestown's pretty

22:30.020 --> 22:34.740
sad, but you know, it's kind of like there's like at least one little happy part of it,

22:34.740 --> 22:40.940
which is that Jim Jones killed himself, too, but think how fucked up it would have been

22:40.940 --> 22:46.380
if they walked in there and he's still talking, and there's all those fucking dead bodies

22:46.380 --> 22:50.700
just surrounding him, but he's giving a sermon to the dead bodies.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.340
Damn, that would have been amazing.

22:53.340 --> 22:55.340
He just didn't have the guts.

22:55.340 --> 23:00.460
Do you watch this Wild Wild Country?

23:00.460 --> 23:02.260
Yes, I did, yeah.

23:02.260 --> 23:03.760
Your opinion?

23:03.760 --> 23:07.740
I wish they'd...I thought it was beautiful, like the way they edited it and put it to...I

23:07.740 --> 23:12.500
thought it was beautiful, but I wish they'd focused more on Osho because I think that

23:12.500 --> 23:17.140
like what I love about a good cult documentary is if they put in enough of the cult leader's

23:17.140 --> 23:20.500
philosophy, then it makes me want to join.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
Right.

23:21.500 --> 23:28.660
But not to be one of those...the people that responds this way to that, but I noticed the

23:28.660 --> 23:31.340
same thing, but felt that that was the point.

23:31.340 --> 23:36.060
Then that was what made it really cool was that they actually just focused entirely on

23:36.060 --> 23:42.340
the relationship between the cult and the townspeople to the point where if you were

23:42.340 --> 23:47.980
an alien, you wouldn't know what a cult was, and you spent the whole time going, like,

23:47.980 --> 23:52.900
well, why aren't they a cult, these hillbillies that are like so smug and like have their...they

23:52.900 --> 23:58.860
keep talking about how they have their own way of doing things, and you know, I loved

23:58.860 --> 24:03.700
how you would like love them and hate them like, you know, like up and down and up and

24:03.700 --> 24:11.580
all around, and I think that they just very tastefully inserted like from the Rednecks

24:11.580 --> 24:17.540
perspective, like toward the beginning, like that movie that comes out that everyone gets

24:17.540 --> 24:26.500
to see, like their naked primal scream therapy or whatever, but it was like...didn't it feel

24:26.500 --> 24:35.140
kind of like if they had focused in on this guy who didn't talk for four years and stuff

24:35.140 --> 24:40.300
like that religion was, that they would invite all of your...it would just put you in the

24:40.300 --> 24:44.700
shoes of the Redneck or the shoes of the Convert like you're saying.

24:44.700 --> 24:48.020
I mean, I keep thinking like, kind of what you're saying, like, I guess it must have

24:48.020 --> 24:57.660
been intentional, maybe they're showing like the thing that happens where the gatekeeper

24:57.660 --> 25:02.340
becomes the destination sort of, they're showing like the gross thing, you know, like everyone

25:02.340 --> 25:07.100
focuses on the Pope, you know, instead of...it's like everyone focuses on the representative

25:07.100 --> 25:10.940
of the thing instead of the thing itself, and maybe they wanted to make a point of doing

25:10.940 --> 25:12.620
that without saying that's what they were doing.

25:12.620 --> 25:17.980
I mean, it was good in the sense that it elicits all of these thoughts and makes you wonder,

25:17.980 --> 25:21.060
but maybe I'm just looking for a different documentary, but I could easily just do the

25:21.060 --> 25:23.380
research and read Osho stuff.

25:23.380 --> 25:37.420
Yeah, and Cody was a lover of his quotes and stuff because he was a fun guy because

25:37.420 --> 25:44.700
he had that look, but he would just talk very liberally about sex and stuff.

25:44.700 --> 25:45.700
Right.

25:45.700 --> 25:52.460
But, yeah, I mean, I found myself to, I was like, wait, pump the brakes and let me get

25:52.460 --> 25:53.980
out and smell the roses here.

25:53.980 --> 25:59.980
These people just started carrying assault rifles and dressing like the Joker and stuff

25:59.980 --> 26:00.980
like that.

26:00.980 --> 26:07.380
All these people with their ties and their clean cut beards and like...what is this

26:07.380 --> 26:08.380
cult?

26:08.380 --> 26:13.340
But I think it was good that it was just like...I felt in the end, I was not like weeping at

26:13.340 --> 26:17.820
the end because I felt like I had been thrust into the position of God.

26:17.820 --> 26:26.100
By both these rednecks and these cultists, everybody had just swirled around in this

26:26.100 --> 26:32.740
tidy bowl of conflict and chasing each other and that the whole thing was just...it just

26:32.740 --> 26:33.740
started crying.

26:33.740 --> 26:37.700
I mean, thank God for that guy, the guy that kind of takes you through the whole thing,

26:37.700 --> 26:38.700
the lawyer.

26:38.700 --> 26:39.700
Yeah.

26:39.700 --> 26:40.700
And then he's just like walking with his cane.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.060
I just started like bawling my eyes out.

26:43.060 --> 26:49.380
I think he's just so...it was like he didn't do anything wrong that entire time.

26:49.380 --> 26:59.900
He was a reliable narrator and he was neither a Sheila loyalist nor a trying to abscond

26:59.900 --> 27:00.900
with Osho.

27:00.900 --> 27:05.780
I mean, he was just like...he represented that kind of like when you read Going Clear,

27:05.780 --> 27:09.940
like those Scientologists that are just sort of like, look, I'm getting something out of

27:09.940 --> 27:10.940
this.

27:10.940 --> 27:14.620
Can we stop with the drama?

27:14.620 --> 27:20.220
And that he was a sort of life master, he represented the best that that quote unquote

27:20.220 --> 27:21.220
cult could accomplish.

27:21.220 --> 27:25.620
I think that the reason for its existence was that it made you an effective, happy person

27:25.620 --> 27:27.060
that drew people...

27:27.060 --> 27:28.620
It still goes on, you know?

27:28.620 --> 27:33.260
You didn't have to like leave capitalism behind, you didn't have to have all these extreme

27:33.260 --> 27:37.900
conversations about like, this world is bullshit, they just fucking built a city in the middle

27:37.900 --> 27:38.900
of nowhere.

27:38.900 --> 27:44.380
And then I guess what made me start crying was that you could do all that, you could

27:44.380 --> 27:52.700
ride that wave without falling off the surfboard like he did and then it still just ends with

27:52.700 --> 27:57.220
you with a gray beard like walking around, like you can't surf forever.

27:57.220 --> 28:03.020
You can't...well, I mean, you gotta...it does happen, but it's for that thing to happen,

28:03.020 --> 28:08.220
it takes war, I mean historically, like if you look at it, it's like to get the big paradigm

28:08.220 --> 28:11.060
shift to happen in a serious way.

28:11.060 --> 28:16.460
You know, you know, pulled it off the Mormons, like they were...there was conflict with them,

28:16.460 --> 28:21.180
they fought them for a while, like when a thing like that, when a theocracy bubbles

28:21.180 --> 28:27.060
up or a new idea bubbles up, quite often it seems like the idea bubbles up inside of,

28:27.060 --> 28:33.660
it tries to kill it, especially if it's a contagious idea, they try to...if it's like

28:33.660 --> 28:39.300
a threat to the dominant paradigm and it gets big enough, the helicopters show up, the cops

28:39.300 --> 28:48.460
show up, the fire marshal shows up, yeah, there's a fantastic like closing thought at the end

28:48.460 --> 28:57.580
of that Going Clear book that just, yeah, sort of without bothering to categorize Scientology

28:57.580 --> 29:06.340
as either a good thing or a bad thing, just talking about the history of upstart religion

29:06.340 --> 29:14.860
in the United States and how, yeah, it's...we want to look at all of these things and go,

29:14.860 --> 29:22.500
they either need to live or die, but we coexist with things like Mormonism or Jehovah's Witness

29:22.500 --> 29:30.380
re, whatever you call it, in its noun form, the...but it's like, yeah, these little things,

29:30.380 --> 29:35.420
they're not called cults anymore, you could call Mormonism a cult if you wanted to, but

29:35.420 --> 29:40.780
we don't anymore because we, yeah, we went to, like you said, we jumped them in.

29:40.780 --> 29:45.420
What's up with the Pope now? The Pope's saying that hell doesn't exist?

29:45.420 --> 29:50.660
Excuse me, can I make a bunch of fucking chair sounds now that you're talking? The fuck were

29:50.660 --> 29:53.620
you doing over here? Trying to make a goddamn point?

29:53.620 --> 29:57.180
You were talking for a while, I felt like I was supposed to get cocked at the ball.

29:57.180 --> 30:00.060
Are you making a bookcase? What the fuck is going on?

30:00.060 --> 30:06.140
I'm trying to relax here, you're talking forever, you're not even turning or including me, you're

30:06.140 --> 30:11.140
all in love with Duncan again, you don't even look at me. What do you mean again? You fell

30:11.140 --> 30:13.540
out of love with me? I'm trying to get comfortable.

30:13.540 --> 30:15.900
Wait, you fell out of love with me? No.

30:15.900 --> 30:20.540
You fell out of love with me? Meekie the bookcase.

30:20.540 --> 30:23.540
Dan, you noticed those, I didn't notice those chair sounds.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.540
Oh no. I didn't either.

30:25.540 --> 30:27.540
Yeah, I did. Oh, you did?

30:27.540 --> 30:32.060
Yeah, I know what you were doing, you're like on the fucking vowels of my words, like you're

30:32.060 --> 30:36.260
just, you're like a monkey, you're a naughty monkey.

30:36.260 --> 30:40.260
Well, don't invite me anymore and you'll be the happiest person in the world.

30:40.260 --> 30:45.460
Please, please do the show, Spencer's not going to be here tonight, David says it's

30:45.460 --> 30:50.860
going to be, would you please, please, everybody loves you, come on, please.

30:50.860 --> 30:53.460
That conversation never happened, he's making this up.

30:53.460 --> 30:58.260
I didn't know, I walked to the door, I found out Spencer wasn't here, Jeff wasn't here.

30:58.260 --> 31:04.060
Dan, Dan, I'm just going to read the text you sent me. This is a text from Dan, please,

31:04.060 --> 31:09.060
please, please, please, please, will you please, pretty please, please do the show, Spencer

31:09.060 --> 31:15.460
isn't going to be here, will you please, please, please, please, please, please, come on, come

31:15.460 --> 31:20.860
on, come on, please, please, everyone loves you, please, please, come on.

31:20.860 --> 31:25.260
You guys look, it's MC gun control. What's this?

31:25.260 --> 31:33.660
Yo, yo, it's me, MC gun control. I'm a repeat character.

31:33.660 --> 31:36.660
Well now you are, this is the second time you showed up.

31:36.660 --> 31:41.860
Give me a beat. I'm going to rap about gun control.

31:41.860 --> 31:57.060
Now gun control, MC gun control, guns, awareness of guns, gun control, awareness, a lot of

31:57.060 --> 32:06.460
lethal weapons in the world. The AR-15 can kill 30 people per second.

32:06.460 --> 32:15.060
It's a very, very expensive military grade weapon. I'm MC gun control.

32:20.060 --> 32:22.060
Alright, okay, cut it.

32:22.060 --> 32:25.660
So anyway, what, the Pope says that hell doesn't exist?

32:25.660 --> 32:31.060
I think it's weird because like the Pope said hell doesn't exist and then-

32:31.060 --> 32:32.260
So I heard right.

32:32.260 --> 32:36.660
Didn't he, no, but it was like a misquote or something.

32:36.660 --> 32:38.260
He's walking it back.

32:38.260 --> 32:42.660
He tried to walk it back. I don't know though because it's one of those things that's like

32:42.660 --> 32:47.060
a thing that pops up on the Drudge Report. That's the thing that gets hit.

32:47.060 --> 32:52.460
So I don't know if he, I think it was either a misquote or like it was taken out of context

32:52.460 --> 32:53.460
or something.

32:53.460 --> 33:02.260
But the thing is, eventually they will say that, right? Because-

33:02.260 --> 33:04.260
The Drudge Report?

33:04.260 --> 33:05.460
No, because for-

33:05.460 --> 33:06.260
Won't even look.

33:06.260 --> 33:08.260
Won't even look at me.

33:08.260 --> 33:13.660
For hundreds of years, they were like holding the line and like whether the sun went around

33:13.660 --> 33:15.260
the earth or not.

33:15.260 --> 33:19.860
Well, I think the important question for us all to ask is does hell exist?

33:19.860 --> 33:22.260
Okay, let's break it down. Okay.

33:22.260 --> 33:26.260
All right, so, no.

33:26.260 --> 33:27.260
How do you know?

33:27.260 --> 33:29.860
I guess I don't.

33:29.860 --> 33:30.860
I mean, it gets-

33:30.860 --> 33:31.860
I don't have any proof.

33:31.860 --> 33:32.860
How about that?

33:32.860 --> 33:37.660
Well, I mean, like, it's, I mean, their version of hell might not exist, but one of the creepy

33:37.660 --> 33:41.260
things about black holes, you know, we don't know what the fuck's going on in there.

33:41.260 --> 33:42.260
Yeah.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.260
And like, those things are sucking in galaxies.

33:44.260 --> 33:45.260
Yeah.

33:45.260 --> 33:51.060
And those galaxies, what, if there is a soul, does your soul leave the galaxy or does it

33:51.060 --> 33:52.660
float around the galaxy?

33:52.660 --> 33:54.260
Or does it go to multiple galaxies?

33:54.260 --> 33:56.660
Could a soul get sucked into a black hole?

33:56.660 --> 34:02.060
My point is, like, is there some point of, like, maximum soul compression where you

34:02.060 --> 34:06.460
would be sentient but eternally in some infinite blackness?

34:06.460 --> 34:11.860
I think it's, I think, because your soul doesn't have a mass, it doesn't, it's not

34:11.860 --> 34:16.460
accountable to the laws of speed of light and time.

34:16.460 --> 34:20.760
So, your soul, if there is such a thing, if you can, if you're conscious, this is a

34:20.760 --> 34:28.180
field that exists independently of your, your organ that kind of is representing it corporeally,

34:28.180 --> 34:35.060
then upon death, it's possible that your soul will experience infinity, because time stops,

34:35.060 --> 34:41.620
it stops being in time, and then it's possible that that's not, like, a fun thing for a soul,

34:41.620 --> 34:46.340
that that's, like, being locked in a box, because that's why the universe started is

34:46.340 --> 34:53.140
because God, which was all of us and everything, was, like, locked in nothingness at no time

34:53.140 --> 34:56.780
and was, like, I gotta get out of here, which is what you do when you're a kid and your

34:56.780 --> 35:00.420
brother puts you in a cupboard, like, you experience the same panic, whereas a rabbit

35:00.420 --> 35:04.300
would just hang out, it would just go, I guess I'm locked in a cabinet, but sentience makes

35:04.300 --> 35:10.420
you claustrophobic, because you go, I can't just be nothing, and you freak the fuck out,

35:10.420 --> 35:14.660
and then, and you start thinking about everything, and then, and then you're, like, get me out

35:14.660 --> 35:20.500
of here, and you throw a tantrum, and that's your piece of the Big Bang, which means possibly

35:20.500 --> 35:27.620
when you die, hell, may be the only thing that happens, which is simply you returning

35:27.620 --> 35:35.100
to the state of the universe before it existed, and, but with that one little thing of you,

35:35.100 --> 35:37.500
you want to be, but you can't.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.020
Osho, that's directly quoted from Osho.

35:40.020 --> 35:41.020
Really?

35:41.020 --> 35:45.220
See, that's, that's, that's part of it, and then the other part of it is, hell certainly

35:45.220 --> 35:49.940
exists on planet earth, I mean, people become their own black holes, and they get so compressed

35:49.940 --> 35:57.460
into themselves that every breath is a, is a, is a living hell, so, so you end up in a,

35:57.460 --> 36:03.060
so that happens too, so when the pope says hell doesn't exist, it's like one of, it's

36:03.060 --> 36:07.740
like a time when I think I kind of disagreed with the pope, I mean, maybe if you meant it,

36:07.740 --> 36:13.180
it's like, well, you must mean like the fire pit thing, probably, but certainly like what

36:13.180 --> 36:16.660
you would, people suffer so deeply on this planet.

36:16.660 --> 36:17.660
Right.

36:17.660 --> 36:22.020
It'd be cool if he announced, he said, sorry, I meant hell doesn't exist underneath the

36:22.020 --> 36:29.020
earth when you die, I meant hell exists on earth, and I know where it is, and we have

36:29.020 --> 36:35.300
to go fight them, and then he like, let us, and the, and the, and the fucking Lord of

36:35.300 --> 36:39.900
the Rings score started, and we're just like, that'd be so cool, it'd be cool to be part

36:39.900 --> 36:45.660
of just a, a war on hell, do you not happy we'd be air strikes against hell, it would

36:45.660 --> 36:48.940
be cool right up until the fighting part, like it would be fun just walking there,

36:48.940 --> 36:52.900
right, like you'd be walking probably, because the worst case scenario is you'd get tired

36:52.900 --> 36:58.620
and be left behind, big deal, like, whoops, because I won't make that war war headed to,

36:58.620 --> 37:01.620
but in the meantime, you'd feel like a, you know, I always wanted to be like a migrant

37:01.620 --> 37:05.300
bird, like you'd just like, you'd have that togetherness, you'd be part of a big caravan,

37:05.300 --> 37:06.300
hey where are you guys going?

37:06.300 --> 37:11.660
We're walking to hell, and we're gonna fight all the bookings, and, and then, and then

37:11.660 --> 37:14.660
you just walk and you got your knapsack, and your marshmallows, and your sword.

37:14.660 --> 37:19.300
You wanted to be a, a migrant bird?

37:19.300 --> 37:23.860
Like, dare to dream, man.

37:23.860 --> 37:28.420
I wanted to be a firefighter, a migrant bird.

37:28.420 --> 37:29.820
Well, it's cool.

37:29.820 --> 37:33.540
Danny, what are you going to be when you grow up?

37:33.540 --> 37:36.100
I would like to be a migrant bird.

37:36.100 --> 37:41.460
I mean, it's like, yeah, not a migrating bird, but like, the, the, oh, not, yeah, like a,

37:41.460 --> 37:47.820
like an illegal, like a migrant bird, yeah, a bird that's like, doesn't have its visa.

37:47.820 --> 37:54.900
A bird, a bird that they make, pick up other birds eggs, because it, the economy of its

37:54.900 --> 37:57.260
own bird country is fucked up.

37:57.260 --> 38:01.540
Can you imagine if Trump went that nuts, that he started trying to keep Mexican birds

38:01.540 --> 38:04.180
out of the United States?

38:04.180 --> 38:05.180
That'd be incredible.

38:05.180 --> 38:10.220
We got, but yeah, I mean, like that's, that's a, always, you know, when this, we, we bomb

38:10.220 --> 38:14.140
people and it's all so confusing, and ultimately sad, you just take like, man, it would be

38:14.140 --> 38:18.700
so nice if, if we had something, something real to fight, like we've got all these great

38:18.700 --> 38:24.220
weapons and, and nothing's black, black or white, and it's always so confusing.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.860
How glorious would it be, man?

38:26.860 --> 38:31.060
Just if Trump came out and he's like, we have found the gateway to hell.

38:31.060 --> 38:32.820
Here's the videotape of it.

38:32.820 --> 38:33.820
Look, here.

38:33.820 --> 38:41.700
And Tim peeing on a prostitute's mattress, that's why the p-tape, the thing is all screwed

38:41.700 --> 38:42.700
up.

38:42.700 --> 38:43.700
You didn't get the facts right.

38:43.700 --> 38:44.700
He's like, there's no p-tape for the longest time.

38:44.700 --> 38:48.500
And then he's like, look, do you, did you ever think, finally they got the p-tape and

38:48.500 --> 38:53.860
he's like, listen, don't, I'm telling you, while I was making those hookers pee, a gate

38:53.860 --> 38:54.860
to hell opened.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.220
It was part of a ritual.

38:56.220 --> 38:57.300
That's why I didn't want you to see it.

38:57.300 --> 38:59.940
I'm proud of making people pee on the Obama's bed.

38:59.940 --> 39:02.940
As most of you suspected, that's not a deal breaker for me.

39:02.940 --> 39:04.780
I'm a Nazi and a rapist.

39:04.780 --> 39:06.540
I don't care what you think of me.

39:06.540 --> 39:09.820
I do care if hell overtakes the earth.

39:09.820 --> 39:14.140
And on that p-tape is the gateway to hell.

39:14.140 --> 39:18.740
And then, and then Rachel Maddow's like, nice try clown.

39:18.740 --> 39:19.900
And then she presses play.

39:19.900 --> 39:25.460
And then it's like, but it's like fun because it's like, yeah, there's like, there's like

39:25.460 --> 39:33.220
bad guys that are just like, made of shit and they got horns and, you know, and they're

39:33.220 --> 39:39.740
like, and then, and then like, you could, you could fight them like with your friends.

39:39.740 --> 39:42.060
You could fight them as part of the army.

39:42.060 --> 39:44.020
Like, what are you doing, man?

39:44.020 --> 39:45.780
We shoot people are down the street.

39:45.780 --> 39:46.780
Come over.

39:46.780 --> 39:47.780
They, they have horns.

39:47.780 --> 39:50.780
You could choose if you wanted to be like a guerrilla fighter, like street to street

39:50.780 --> 39:54.420
or just like hang out with your friends and like, like, because it's like, it's just,

39:54.420 --> 39:56.020
it's just reality versus hell.

39:56.020 --> 40:02.940
So it's like not, yeah, there's an army version, but it's for people who, who enjoy that kind

40:02.940 --> 40:03.940
of thing.

40:03.940 --> 40:09.180
Well, that's, that's one of the satanic aspects of war, isn't it, is that it's like, it takes

40:09.180 --> 40:15.340
exactly what people want to do, which is to build stuff together and like, and blow things

40:15.340 --> 40:21.020
up and set things on fire and have fun together and like, and survive together.

40:21.020 --> 40:27.500
And then it takes that thing and transforms it into like a bond, like nothing is more

40:27.500 --> 40:32.020
bonding than being like going out in a stressful situation with your pals.

40:32.020 --> 40:33.020
People want to have a mission.

40:33.020 --> 40:34.020
They like going camping.

40:34.020 --> 40:35.020
They like building things.

40:35.020 --> 40:36.020
Yeah.

40:36.020 --> 40:37.020
I don't.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.020
You don't like camping?

40:38.020 --> 40:40.020
Ask me again.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.020
Do you like camping?

40:41.020 --> 40:42.020
No.

40:42.020 --> 40:43.020
You went on a bad camping trip.

40:43.020 --> 40:44.020
What?

40:44.020 --> 40:45.020
You just went on a few bad camping trips.

40:45.020 --> 40:46.020
All of them.

40:46.020 --> 40:47.020
I don't.

40:47.020 --> 40:48.020
Why would I?

40:48.020 --> 40:49.020
How many camping trips have you gone on?

40:49.020 --> 40:51.020
I don't remember because I tried to black them out.

40:51.020 --> 40:52.020
Come on.

40:52.020 --> 40:53.020
You can remember.

40:53.020 --> 40:54.020
That's ridiculous.

40:54.020 --> 40:55.020
How many camping trips?

40:55.020 --> 40:56.020
You can't, you got to think back.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.020
Like you, with it under 10 or over 10?

40:58.020 --> 40:59.020
Under 10.

40:59.020 --> 41:00.020
See, you went on some bad trips.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.020
Yeah.

41:01.020 --> 41:03.020
And they were all with your parents and you were 10 and you were.

41:03.020 --> 41:04.020
All right.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.860
Let's go on a camping trip.

41:05.860 --> 41:06.860
That would be fun.

41:06.860 --> 41:09.820
That's the next version of Harmontown.

41:09.820 --> 41:12.020
Deep in the fucking forest.

41:12.020 --> 41:14.020
Just Dan and me.

41:14.020 --> 41:15.020
Hunting.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.020
No hunting.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.020
I don't hunt.

41:17.020 --> 41:22.020
The irony, we should dress the set as a camping site in a sitcom.

41:22.020 --> 41:24.020
And then we try to have a campfire.

41:24.020 --> 41:28.020
And then the ultimate irony is because the fire marshal shut us down, the whole fucking

41:28.020 --> 41:31.020
stage goes up in flames.

41:31.020 --> 41:35.020
Do you think there would be at least a couple of happy firemen?

41:35.020 --> 41:38.020
There would be a sense of, I told you.

41:38.020 --> 41:43.020
As they're dragging your charred corpse out, they're like, we tried to save you.

41:43.020 --> 41:47.020
But they saved us from the audience, the audience didn't start us on fire.

41:47.020 --> 41:51.020
I mean, really, if you knew that you were in a simulator, you're going to live forever,

41:51.020 --> 41:55.020
you get to repeat everything, wouldn't in one of those versions the last Harmontown

41:55.020 --> 41:57.020
be you self-emolating?

41:57.020 --> 42:00.020
I don't know.

42:00.020 --> 42:03.020
I think it would have to be at least one.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.020
Oh, God.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.020
I mean, that would just be incredible.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.020
That could save the world.

42:07.020 --> 42:15.020
I'd have to have massive guarantees about that not being the end.

42:15.020 --> 42:19.020
And also, ouch, regardless.

42:19.020 --> 42:20.020
Well, I mean, there's morphine.

42:20.020 --> 42:23.020
There's ways we could prop your body up, make it seem like you're awake.

42:23.020 --> 42:25.020
True.

42:25.020 --> 42:27.020
Use some kind of scarce crow.

42:27.020 --> 42:29.020
You run a studio, man.

42:29.020 --> 42:31.020
There's got to be a way to get the props to hold you up.

42:31.020 --> 42:33.020
Get Tycho to animate that.

42:33.020 --> 42:36.020
Get Tycho to animate that.

42:36.020 --> 42:40.020
You animate the flames on you with Tycho.

42:40.020 --> 42:42.020
You can do it.

42:42.020 --> 42:44.020
Him and Bubbles.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.020
And Tycho's animating Bubbles.

42:46.020 --> 42:50.020
He can animate you emulating yourself.

42:50.020 --> 42:52.020
I don't know, man.

42:52.020 --> 42:54.020
I mean, I'm not suggesting self-emolation.

42:54.020 --> 43:02.020
But if you think in terms of badass ends of podcasts or series, that would be really smart.

43:02.020 --> 43:04.020
That'll spread all around the world.

43:04.020 --> 43:09.020
You know what would be cool is that in the comment section underneath the YouTube video,

43:09.020 --> 43:15.020
you'd be five comments in before someone commented,

43:15.020 --> 43:20.020
looks like we need to legislate fire control.

43:20.020 --> 43:24.020
And then the whole thing would just turn into people arguing about guns.

43:24.020 --> 43:28.020
Under my fucking burning death on YouTube.

43:28.020 --> 43:34.020
Every YouTube video was like, oh, it's a girl that balance a spoon on her nose.

43:34.020 --> 43:41.020
And then five comments down, somebody goes, hmm, maybe that spoon should be given to Syria.

43:41.020 --> 43:46.020
And then everyone just like, what are comment sections for anyways?

43:46.020 --> 43:49.020
No, that's one of the things people are worried about with AIs.

43:49.020 --> 43:51.020
It's just going to eternally destroy.

43:51.020 --> 43:53.020
They're going to get rid of the comment sections.

43:53.020 --> 43:56.020
It's going to embed itself into all comment sections.

43:56.020 --> 43:59.020
It's going to be able to comment on the section.

43:59.020 --> 44:06.020
It'll just always just be like some kind of chaos running through that dialogue forever.

44:06.020 --> 44:10.020
Well, I don't know, man.

44:10.020 --> 44:12.020
It's really, really interesting.

44:12.020 --> 44:13.020
I like it.

44:13.020 --> 44:14.020
I like the experiment you're doing.

44:14.020 --> 44:15.020
It's pretty cool.

44:15.020 --> 44:17.020
It's pretty cool.

44:17.020 --> 44:18.020
Yeah, we tried different stuff.

44:18.020 --> 44:22.020
We tried to do it like Howard Stern style in the VO booth.

44:22.020 --> 44:27.020
I was like, eh, you know, I could do any podcast like that.

44:27.020 --> 44:29.020
And I was like, all right, well, let's go back on the stage.

44:29.020 --> 44:30.020
We just have nobody there.

44:30.020 --> 44:32.020
Let's get it's ups and downs.

44:32.020 --> 44:37.020
Well, it's like, it's like, I guess one thing I don't know that anyone, I'm just trying to think of a

44:37.020 --> 44:43.020
late night show or a show in this format with no audience where it's just this.

44:43.020 --> 44:46.020
I'd have to go back to the Alan Havy show late night.

44:46.020 --> 44:47.020
Yeah, basic cable.

44:47.020 --> 44:48.020
That's what it was.

44:48.020 --> 44:53.020
Yeah, Nick Bacchai is Andy Richter and it was kind of like quiet.

44:53.020 --> 44:55.020
Wasn't there an audience of one or something?

44:55.020 --> 45:00.020
Yeah, I think there was like, I mean, you can always like hear a couple people chuckling here and there.

45:00.020 --> 45:06.020
It reminds me of like local TV or Joe Bob Briggs like monster vision where it just, it was obvious.

45:06.020 --> 45:11.020
It was just one guy in a studio like this with maybe three people.

45:11.020 --> 45:12.020
Yeah.

45:12.020 --> 45:14.020
Laughing behind the camera.

45:14.020 --> 45:23.020
There's a guy tweeted at me and he was like, and it's like several tweets chained together and he's like, I, I know you, I know you

45:23.020 --> 45:33.020
think it's easier to, I can't remember what his presuppositions were, but he was like, like, I urge you to listen to the early episodes.

45:33.020 --> 45:35.020
I think you'll find that they're better.

45:35.020 --> 45:42.020
Like he was like really like breaking it to me that the podcast is worse when there's no fucking audience.

45:42.020 --> 45:47.020
So it's like, like responding to him going like, what is your point?

45:47.020 --> 45:49.020
Like, what do you think is at stake here?

45:49.020 --> 45:50.020
I don't understand.

45:50.020 --> 45:53.020
Well, I don't, I think he's probably saying like, it's not that the podcast is worse.

45:53.020 --> 46:02.020
It's like, if you do a format that's generally made for an audience minus the audience, it produces and then you add to it.

46:02.020 --> 46:10.020
No, I didn't know this guy was, I can guarantee you this guy was basically, he was like, he wanted the audience back and thought that

46:10.020 --> 46:14.020
even though he said he'd just finished listening to all of the episodes.

46:14.020 --> 46:20.020
So I don't know how you get through that without the information that this isn't really a choice.

46:20.020 --> 46:30.020
Like so, to like weigh in and go, I don't know, it's kind of like you're out in the middle of nowhere and like your, your truck has got one tire in the ditch

46:30.020 --> 46:33.020
and people are like trying to get a piece of wood under the tire.

46:33.020 --> 46:40.020
But then some other people are like, well, maybe if we sing and dance, like, who says, who says this wasn't our destination?

46:40.020 --> 46:49.020
And like, as long as the truck's not working and all this stuff is just to have, have one guy there going like, you know, I think if you really think about it,

46:49.020 --> 46:55.020
pound for pound, what we're going through right now is actually worse than, than what, what was happening yesterday.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.020
Right.

46:56.020 --> 46:57.020
I was like, thanks, Miles.

46:57.020 --> 46:58.020
No shit, right?

46:58.020 --> 46:59.020
No shit, man.

46:59.020 --> 47:01.020
His name was Miles?

47:01.020 --> 47:03.020
He was to me.

47:03.020 --> 47:07.020
That's a great name for somebody commenting on a truck that stopped.

47:07.020 --> 47:09.020
Miles to go.

47:09.020 --> 47:11.020
Miles Togo.

47:11.020 --> 47:12.020
Miles to go.

47:12.020 --> 47:13.020
Togo.

47:13.020 --> 47:16.020
But yeah, we will soon be back in front of an audience.

47:16.020 --> 47:25.020
But then, you know, be careful what you wish for, because I think, you know, there's going to come a point, you know, that's, that's going to be like a return threshold.

47:25.020 --> 47:31.020
And then, you know, those are, that's how stories end.

47:31.020 --> 47:36.020
We just go, okay, we did it, we did this, then we did that, then we did this, then we did it like this.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.020
Yay.

47:37.020 --> 47:41.020
And it's going to be like 45, like, what?

47:41.020 --> 47:45.020
What do we, what do we, what do we, what do we, you're 45?

47:45.020 --> 47:46.020
Yeah.

47:46.020 --> 48:06.020
I'm saying like, there may come a day when, when the appropriate thing for me to do for my own happiness and to, and to evolve is actually has not only nothing to do with a public life, but also, in fact, maybe actually be counter to a public life.

48:06.020 --> 48:07.020
You know what I mean?

48:07.020 --> 48:10.020
Like, do you think you're resisting something?

48:10.020 --> 48:12.020
Do you feel resistant?

48:12.020 --> 48:18.020
Uh, in what, what, uh, can you get more specific?

48:18.020 --> 48:33.020
Just like, you know, like when you're in a situation and you, and you realize you don't want to be in that situation, it could be in, you know, in general, like, do you, do you think you're, you're, you find yourself feeling like resisting what's happening more, more often than not?

48:33.020 --> 48:57.020
I, I, I find myself trying to, trying to find my bliss in situations that by definition, and that's a very appropriate phrase by definition, because everything by definition, like, kind of excludes, it starts to run counter to bliss following.

48:57.020 --> 49:02.020
So, so like, let's, so you do something fun and then you say, let's do something fun every week.

49:02.020 --> 49:03.020
Yeah.

49:03.020 --> 49:06.020
And then you can, you gotta strike that balance.

49:06.020 --> 49:07.020
You just do.

49:07.020 --> 49:08.020
Everybody does.

49:08.020 --> 49:10.020
Like, like, okay, we're going to have a book club.

49:10.020 --> 49:11.020
We're going to get together every Wednesday.

49:11.020 --> 49:26.020
And, you know, a big boy understands that sometimes if you're getting together every single Wednesday for your book club, yeah, there's going to be some Wednesdays when you're not the one who's so stoked about showing up on Wednesday.

49:26.020 --> 49:33.020
Yeah, you're kind of an asshole if you show up, therefore, on Wednesday with this, like, kill the book club vibe.

49:33.020 --> 49:34.020
Right.

49:34.020 --> 49:44.020
Because for all you know, everybody else, on that particular Wednesday, is like, kind of in a good mood and like, like, like, actually the book club is there to carry them, you know?

49:44.020 --> 49:45.020
Yeah.

49:45.020 --> 49:49.020
And it's, it's, this is, it's the nature of things.

49:49.020 --> 49:53.020
You start, you schedule them, you make them regular, you decide to do them.

49:53.020 --> 50:09.020
You, you, you, and, and there's always going to be this, like, struggle to balance the, uh, let's, let's always do this with, oh, and by the way, let's always do whatever the fuck we feel like doing.

50:09.020 --> 50:17.020
I mean, I, that, that thing that you are doing with this thing has always blown me away because it is the regularity of it, the complexity of it.

50:17.020 --> 50:23.020
The, the getting, getting here, even now doing it like this is, it's insane.

50:23.020 --> 50:35.020
Like when I do my podcast, I go into my studio, I get high, I've got synthesizers and I just putter around in there until something like happens that I like and it's, it's very private.

50:35.020 --> 50:41.020
Like they were telling me that you were, you felt good that you were able to do this minus an audience.

50:41.020 --> 50:47.020
And I was thinking like, holy shit, man, I mean, like doing it with an audience is madness.

50:47.020 --> 50:48.020
It's madness.

50:48.020 --> 50:52.020
It's such a, when I go on tour with my podcast, that's like a, it's heavy for me.

50:52.020 --> 51:10.020
Like that's a, it's a huge, it feels like big and like any kind of time I do a live show, it feels like really just very intense and less like what it is when I record it, which is just a day of just allowing whatever happens app to happen.

51:10.020 --> 51:15.020
So it's, I don't, I mean, I could understand you feeling starting to really feel weird about what you've been doing.

51:15.020 --> 51:16.020
It makes sense to me.

51:16.020 --> 51:20.020
I hope I don't seem like I'm judging the way that you're feeling because I get it, man.

51:20.020 --> 51:21.020
It's just, I get it.

51:21.020 --> 51:29.020
I think it's, it's just very hyper pressurized what you've been doing, a weekly live show in front of a really smart audience.

51:29.020 --> 51:32.020
Some of whom are really fucking mean.

51:32.020 --> 51:48.020
The challenge is to, yeah, is to, it's a high pressure thing to decide that you're going to do something every week and then the, and then the fun worthwhile pressure is, or the fun worthwhile activity is.

51:48.020 --> 51:50.020
It was once squeak.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.020
I moved.

51:51.020 --> 51:52.020
I can't move.

51:52.020 --> 51:53.020
I think that was an accident.

51:53.020 --> 51:59.020
It was, it was, it was, I moved, my foot was falling asleep and I put it on the floor.

51:59.020 --> 52:03.020
The fun worthwhile activity is trying to figure out how to take something that you've, you've determined you guys.

52:03.020 --> 52:05.020
He looked at me like I spit in his drink.

52:05.020 --> 52:17.020
And then also, like, like, continue to be like, okay, well then, on top of that, then how is it always different and challenging and fun or whatever, whatever that word is, chaotic or something, you know?

52:17.020 --> 52:36.020
Like, it, I think that, I think that a nice death that's occurred with this venue is the death of my idea that it was going to ever grow into a, into any, into something that had more structure, you know?

52:36.020 --> 52:48.020
I thought, like, maybe that would grow, like, like you put up a trellis and then, like, a crazy, chaotic thing that just grows by nature uses the trellis.

52:48.020 --> 52:58.020
So the combination of the, of the out of the moment, like backbreaking carpentry, plus the, it's okay that thing, everything's just going to grow over this.

52:58.020 --> 53:03.020
That's, that's my fantasy of doing things, you know, that aren't for money.

53:03.020 --> 53:07.020
Like, you go like, oh, wow, it's cool that we grew that thing into this thing.

53:07.020 --> 53:16.020
Channel 101, like, grew into this thing and like, it wasn't, it was neither based on us not giving a shit, nor was it based on us giving too much of a shit.

53:16.020 --> 53:21.020
It was just sort of like, just grew.

53:21.020 --> 53:24.020
Well, this thing's still growing, just not growing what you thought it would.

53:24.020 --> 53:27.020
Yeah, exactly. I think that's an important part of its growth.

53:27.020 --> 53:34.020
Is the, you know, there was a part of Point Channel 101's history when Sharab and I were like, are we going to keep being the ones with our thumb on the switch?

53:34.020 --> 53:42.020
Because the thing started this idea that the audience is always in charge and then we kind of tweaked the system to allow for us to not even be involved.

53:42.020 --> 53:44.020
And that was an important thing.

53:44.020 --> 53:54.020
Like, likewise, this, this, the growth of this show, I think this is an interesting chapter because it's like, I was like, let's move it to Star Burns.

53:54.020 --> 54:00.020
And let's like, for the subscribers, we could have like video segments and we could, you know, I just had these ambitions.

54:00.020 --> 54:03.020
I never made the mistake of thinking, oh, I'm going to work really hard on the show.

54:03.020 --> 54:11.020
But I always thought, I made the mistake of thinking, oh, we'll move in and we'll set up a foundation and then shit will grow on top of that.

54:11.020 --> 54:16.020
Like, everyone will keep wanting to add to it and it'll like, grow into this thing.

54:16.020 --> 54:20.020
And, and then the fucking election happened.

54:20.020 --> 54:32.020
And then I, and then it just like, nobody, nobody, nobody, it's just like, we all across the entire country, like the music changed for everybody.

54:32.020 --> 54:43.020
It didn't matter what dance move you were about to do and what plans you had with other people, just like all of it, you know, it was just like fucking everything shifted.

54:43.020 --> 54:47.020
And then, and then the smart creative people are like, okay, how do we adapt to this?

54:47.020 --> 54:52.020
But there's no question that it was just like, like, it kind of disrupted everything.

54:52.020 --> 54:56.020
You feel like this is related to the election.

54:56.020 --> 54:57.020
Yes.

54:57.020 --> 55:01.020
This is connected to the political climate of the United States.

55:01.020 --> 55:15.020
I don't know if it's connected to the political climate, but it's definitely connected to the event of, of like the election and it's like social repercussions and things. Yes.

55:15.020 --> 55:24.020
Like, you know, so like on Friday night, I had a little, a little party and I was like, fuck, man, like this is how selfish I am.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.020
I'm like, fuck, God damn it.

55:26.020 --> 55:30.020
World War Three is going to start on the night of this party that I'm throwing.

55:30.020 --> 55:38.020
And I was like, bummed because it's like, everybody's going to come and then there's going to be nuclear war or something and it's going to like fuck up the party.

55:38.020 --> 55:41.020
And I was like, I was like, God damn, that's such a selfish thought.

55:41.020 --> 55:51.020
But then I realized like, whoa, man, like you're, I started getting anxious, you know, beyond that, you know, I started getting scared and worried and nervous about World War Three.

55:51.020 --> 55:54.020
And then, and dying.

55:54.020 --> 55:57.020
And then I kind of realized like, oh, I have no control over that.

55:57.020 --> 55:59.020
Like there's nothing I could do.

55:59.020 --> 56:01.020
There's no phone calls to be made.

56:01.020 --> 56:03.020
There's nothing to be done about this.

56:03.020 --> 56:15.020
These are massive, massive gears that are turning and that, you know, I don't know much of what can really be done about it right now, like in this single moment.

56:15.020 --> 56:31.020
Do you think that's naive or like a form of nihilism or to just suddenly just realize like, oh, actually, I don't really care about the president or political climates or empires or governors or principalities or powers.

56:31.020 --> 56:39.020
I'm just using, my mind is becoming attached to that because there's a bigger problem I'm trying to avoid.

56:39.020 --> 56:45.020
No, I don't, I don't think there's anything weird or wrong with that.

56:45.020 --> 56:49.020
I think, isn't that pretty much how you felt the entire time?

56:49.020 --> 56:51.020
And isn't everybody just catching up with you?

56:51.020 --> 56:52.020
No, I don't know.

56:52.020 --> 56:53.020
I don't, I go back and forth.

56:53.020 --> 56:56.020
Everyone's just exhausted and tired of caring.

56:56.020 --> 56:58.020
Yeah, you never really did care.

56:58.020 --> 57:00.020
You knew it was dumb before everybody else.

57:00.020 --> 57:11.020
Like it was, some of us tried and it like herniated our fucking embarrassingly putty like muscles of like and revealed that we were hypocrites.

57:11.020 --> 57:15.020
And yeah, everyone is tired now.

57:15.020 --> 57:21.020
And it, yeah, no, there's nothing, there's nothing wrong with that mode of thinking.

57:21.020 --> 57:25.020
I'm, I didn't even know that we were about to be in World War Three.

57:25.020 --> 57:29.020
The student has become the master in that regard.

57:29.020 --> 57:46.020
So I was minecrafting, like where there is no war and there is no president and, you know, I'm waiting, waiting to, you know, waiting to cash in and head for the hills.

57:46.020 --> 57:49.020
Man, this is great, man.

57:49.020 --> 57:50.020
I'm reading this book right now.

57:50.020 --> 57:51.020
This is perfect.

57:51.020 --> 57:55.020
It's, it's this new book by the Zen Roshi Roshi Joan Halifax.

57:55.020 --> 57:57.020
I think it's called standing on the edge.

57:57.020 --> 58:11.020
It's really good, but it's about edge states and it talks about like, you know, altruism, healthy altruism and unhealthy altruism and how like a person who's like got a really good heart.

58:11.020 --> 58:24.020
You really want things to be better, really wants things to be better in the world can like fall over the edge into absolute despair and absolute just, just broken heartedness.

58:24.020 --> 58:27.020
And like she, she gives all these examples. She's amazing.

58:27.020 --> 58:33.020
She like, you know, I'm like planning parties and like, like having a really fun life.

58:33.020 --> 58:40.020
She's like does, she like flies to, you know, there's just that big earthquake that happened recently.

58:40.020 --> 58:41.020
I think it was in Nepal, right?

58:41.020 --> 58:42.020
Where's that big earthquake?

58:42.020 --> 58:43.020
Where was that?

58:43.020 --> 58:53.020
There's like a massive, it wasn't recent recently, but the point is she like flies to places where people are suffering and sets up camps and gets blankets flown in.

58:53.020 --> 58:55.020
And like just tries to help.

58:55.020 --> 58:59.020
And she doesn't do it in a real flashy showy way.

58:59.020 --> 59:00.020
I've met her.

59:00.020 --> 59:01.020
She's just, this is just what she does.

59:01.020 --> 59:03.020
She's like, oh, here we are on planet earth.

59:03.020 --> 59:04.020
Here's what you do.

59:04.020 --> 59:16.020
And so she encounters people who do, who are doing those things with her and she watches some people get just fucking shattered on their altruism.

59:16.020 --> 59:19.020
Just get broken apart in their compassion.

59:19.020 --> 59:21.020
How do they get broken apart?

59:21.020 --> 59:25.020
Because what happens is, is like you become bitter.

59:25.020 --> 59:27.020
You go out there to help.

59:27.020 --> 59:30.020
You have an expectation that you're going to make things better.

59:30.020 --> 59:37.020
You come into contact with a really, a reality, which is that, oh, really, you're not going to make everything better.

59:37.020 --> 59:41.020
In fact, things might be getting worse while you're trying to make things better.

59:41.020 --> 59:46.020
But in your mind, you are like, oh, no, I'm going to do it or it could be done or it might be.

59:46.020 --> 59:56.020
But suddenly you're watching people bring their children to triage centers where it's like, no, that kid's going to die.

59:56.020 --> 01:00:00.020
And you're watching that happen day after day after day after day.

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.020
It's kind of what you do with animals, Rob.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.020
You know what I mean?

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:12.020
And if you don't watch what you're doing and you fall on the other side, what ends up happening is the darkness consumes you.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:16.020
You know, it's that classic thing, the thing you're fighting you become.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.020
And you don't even realize it's happened to you.

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.020
And then suddenly you're all broken apart by it.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.020
And then the fucking thing won.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020
Then it won.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:29.020
You know, that's the crazy thing about it is the way the darkness wins is not by killing people who are fighting it.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.020
It wins by getting into their hearts.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.020
And then, you know what I mean?

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.020
Like Sith style.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.020
Sorry to use a star.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.020
It's like that.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.020
It gets you.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.020
You don't even know it got you.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.020
It's a cool book.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.020
It's really good.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.020
I really love it.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.020
What's it called?

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.020
I think it's called Standing on the Edge.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.020
You mind if I Google it real quick?

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.020
I'll tell you.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.020
It's about edge states.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.020
Yeah, Dan and I will talk while you do that.

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.020
Hey, Dan.

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.020
What would you do today?

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.020
You did some Minecraft.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.020
That must have been fun.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.020
Yeah.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.020
I just finished level three.

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.020
No?

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.020
Are there levels in Minecraft?

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.020
Well, if you don't know, why would you cut me off?

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.020
You asked me about Minecraft.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.020
I'm trying to reach out and make a connection.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.020
I don't have to.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.020
I'm trying to make an emotional bid.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:14.020
OK, well, can I answer it?

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.020
Can I tell you about Minecraft a little bit?

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.020
Yes.

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.020
Yeah, there's that fire behind your eyes.

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.020
You don't want to hear about Minecraft.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.020
I got no internet in here.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:29.020
Just Google the new book by Joan.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:32.020
I just finished gathering all of the necessary ingredients

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:38.020
for a tier one void resource, void or miner

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.020
from the environmental tech pack in Minecraft.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.020
That's badass.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.020
Yeah, it took a great deal of diamonds and other materials

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.020
that were hard to come by.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:58.020
I went to Monster Palooza this afternoon with Kumail and Jonah.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:05.020
And we looked at Monster Paloozas.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.020
You mean masks?

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.020
Yes.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:14.020
Masks and bootleg DVDs.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:18.020
My therapist told me the name of some guy that, I don't know,

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:22.020
because I said, oh, you know how you taught me to deal

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:26.020
with relationships, like explaining rules and stuff?

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:29.020
Is there rules for how to be interested in people?

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:34.020
Because it seems like that's become what we're really talking

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:41.020
about for me is like, well, when I talk about the election,

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:46.020
I don't mean, oh, everything changed because of who became president.

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:51.020
I mean, we all, like, our whole mission statement changed.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:56.020
And therefore, me as a parasite, as a person who's just always

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:00.020
wanted to fit in or make people like me or not get beat up

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:03.020
or just be funny or whatever, that scrambled my signal.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:11.020
So, like, that's a good thing because then you finally get to a place

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:15.020
where you're like, OK, so let's just care about Dan.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.020
What do you want?

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.020
Right.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:21.020
And then you go, OK, well, I'm going to lock that down, that down.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.020
OK.

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.020
And then what's left is sort of like other people.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.020
Like, what am I supposed to, how am I supposed to interact with them?

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:34.020
And it's like, you know, I guess I'm, you know,

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.020
and the therapist gave me some materials or something to look at.

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.020
But I kind of like, it's just like a sink full of dishes.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:45.020
Like, I don't want to learn how to interact with people.

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.020
She's like trying to show you.

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.020
I don't understand.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.020
I'm not.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.020
I don't know either because it's like I haven't unpacked it.

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:55.020
You know, it's like, like, oh, look up this guy, read his book,

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.020
watch his Ted talk.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:02.020
You know, like, you'll enter this realm of like, this guy is like a guy who,

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:07.020
like, the area, the thing that you're talking about this guy would be helpful,

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.020
you know?

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.020
Right.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.020
But I don't, I just wrote it down and I'm like, I don't know.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.020
Yeah.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.020
I don't know.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.020
All that stuff is like, when I go to these Ramdas retreats,

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.020
they always talk about mind versus heart,

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.020
like being up in your head versus in your heart.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.020
And all that stuff is so heady.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.020
It's all mental.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.020
It's all like, you're up in your head.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.020
It's like, those books will get you up in your head.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020
Now that's bad.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.020
Books are great.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.020
But like, some of those, it's like, as opposed to just like, oh,

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.020
I love it because it's so simple.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.020
Because it's like, just what you're in right now, it's perfect.

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020
It's fine.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:43.020
Even if the thing you're in right now is just this simmering cauldron of whatever it is.

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:47.020
It's that idea of like, yeah, that's where we're at right now.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.020
I'm that thing.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.020
And then feel that without any expectation.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.020
Like, oh, I'm going to change it.

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:57.020
That's this thing that, what's her name, Pima Chodron, another Buddhist teacher.

01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:04.020
She says, people say, oh, we're going to start meditating because we want to be a better person.

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:08.020
And she says, that's an aggression against the you that you are right now.

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:11.020
The idea is not to meditate to become a better person.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:18.020
The idea is to meditate so that you could be yourself more fully, feel yourself more fully.

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.020
I love that idea.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.020
It's just so fun to just play around with the idea that where you're at right now, this,

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:27.020
this where you're at, this where you're at, fucking, it's perfect.

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:31.020
Yeah, I find myself like, I've gotten to some dark places.

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.020
I've been really upset.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.020
I was connected to my dog getting sick and stuff.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:38.020
Are these things like Q like operas in your head?

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.020
Yes.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:47.020
Like pockets of magma and things like, OK, now I have an excuse to flush that vein of lava.

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:52.020
So I don't know what's going on down there, but I know on top, it's like the reality,

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:56.020
not the illusion, is numbness and stillness.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:02.020
And so then I have these conversations with people like my therapist or just anybody who's like actually interested.

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.020
It goes like, well, what, where are you really at?

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:14.020
And then I found myself going, well, I guess, you know, come see come saw like, like, and then the, like, oh, what do you mean?

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.020
Don't you think this?

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:21.020
It's like the other person like wants so much more than stillness and numbness and they can have it.

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.020
But then that's, that's, that's fracking.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:28.020
Like, it's like, OK, where you're going to pierce me and you're going to dig down.

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:36.020
And it's not necessarily more true what's boiling down beneath in the core of the earth.

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:40.020
Like that's no more the earth than the crust and the polar ice caps and all this stuff.

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:46.020
Like I, I just feel on my surface right now, like I just like numb.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.020
Yeah.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.020
So numb.

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.020
Yeah.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:53.020
Like I just reduced to like, but that's nice.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:07:02.020
What I noticed in my behavior is like, well, you haven't gotten on Twitter in like three days and you didn't even do it by saying you were going to quit Twitter for three days.

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:05.020
Like you forgot to get on Twitter because you're fucking numb.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:10.020
And when numbness comes, also you don't need to self abuse.

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:19.020
What is the, so how would you, like if you had to, instead of just saying numbness, like how would you describe the numbness?

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.020
What, what is it?

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:24.020
How would you describe it if you couldn't use the word numb?

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.020
Stasis.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.020
I don't know.

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.020
I mean, it's like, it's like, is it, if it were, is it solid?

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:36.020
Is it like malleable? Is it, is it, is it changing?

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:38.020
Does it come and go?

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.020
Would it have a color associated with it?

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.020
Is it opaque?

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:45.020
Like how would you just, what is it?

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:56.020
I think, I feel like it's like, I don't know if I controlled it or someone else did, but I feel like it's like going around the house and like shutting off.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:05.020
Like, like, it's, it's, it's like, like, like, like, there's like white noise that you get used to.

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.020
You're just like, oh, I'm on a submarine.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:11.020
So like, I just hear all the time background noise sounds like this.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.020
Because that's what it takes to run a submarine.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:20.020
And then, like, it's just silent running.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:27.020
Like, you just like, oh, one by one, you're just turning off equipment.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:33.020
And I don't know if I did that or if that's like a Russian weapon that, or, you know what I mean?

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.020
Like, I'm not going to claim credit for it.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.020
It's just a, it's just a thing that has happened.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.020
That's the state.

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.020
You feel, you feel like it's like a shutting down.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.020
Yeah.

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:47.020
It's like an energy that's sort of, there was some energy and then that energy is now turning itself off.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:53.020
Yeah, like, like, like, but, but for a purpose, like waiting, it's about time.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:09:02.020
It's about, like, we were being counterproductive with the worrying and the, and the pinging and the periscoping and all those things.

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:16.020
So, like, okay, go deep and shut everything off and just, you know, like, and because it, not because nothing is important, because everything is important.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.020
Because we're hunting the red October.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.020
I don't know.

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:24.020
Like, like, like it's, it's, it's, it's the time for, for nothing right now.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.020
It doesn't feel purposeless.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.020
Right.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:36.020
I feel, if I thought that this was my new life, I'd put a bullet in my head because I'd be like, well, that's boring, but I feel anticipation.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:44.020
I feel like, like, okay, this chapter is wrapping up.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:51.020
Like, everything, all of my energy creatively is being put into, like, tying knots on things.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.020
Going like, okay, let me just get this off my plate.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.020
Not, okay, say no to that pitch.

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.020
Don't do that.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.020
Don't start that.

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.020
Don't promise that.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:08.020
And then, like, let everything, like, like, come down to a, to a, to a, to a point of complete silence.

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:19.020
And then, so that the orchestra can start and the metaphor mixer can, can mix the metaphor of the submarine and the orchestra.

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.020
Monster Palooza.

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:25.020
Who gives a fuck about that stupid ass fucking.

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.020
Camille.

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:27.020
Jonim.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020
Great.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.020
Me.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:30.020
Well, what?

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.020
Did you buy any masks?

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:36.020
I didn't, but I bought a bunch of DVDs that I'm going to watch when I get home.

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.020
I bought a Zacharley album.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.020
Monster album.

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:46.020
Zacharley Monster album.

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:51.020
I'm going to listen to that on my turntable.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.020
And I bought some DVDs.

01:10:54.020 --> 01:11:09.020
I'm mad because I got that, that breathalyzer keychain and I was, like, really excited about it, but you have to wait 15 minutes to get an accurate reading.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.020
Which makes no sense.

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.020
That sucks so bad.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.020
You have to wait.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.020
You have to breathe on it.

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:19.020
Here's the, here's the directions for the breathalyzer.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.020
Stop drinking.

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.020
Wait 20 minutes.

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.020
Blow into the thing and then you'll know how drunk you are.

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:29.020
Motherfucker, if I had the presence of mind.

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:36.020
I got the thing because it was 60 bucks and I thought, oh, this might be a cool way to, like, create awareness.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:39.020
You know, I would just, like, start putting a number.

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:48.020
If I'm, you know, if I am an asshole, if I'm angry, if I, you know, like, start putting, like, road fliers on.

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.020
No, man, that's cool.

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.020
Shit, the last time I blew a.8, I, you know, I-

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.020
I was.8, by the way.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.020
He doesn't call me anymore.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.020
Dude, that's cool. That's like, there's this-

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.020
Thanks, man. I just pulled that out of my ass right now.

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:10.020
But do you think the cops, do you think the ones the cops use?

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:17.020
Like, like, like, do you think, if you get pulled over by the cops and they go, like, are you, do you want to blow into this thing?

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.020
Like, are you actually supposed to say,

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.020
well, you want to give me 20 minutes because I just finished drinking?

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.020
Or take me to dinner.

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:28.020
Like, it's counterintuitive, but maybe their dirty little secret is that they're like,

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:35.020
they ask you, are you willing to blow a breathalyzer and because your instinct as a drunk driver is to say,

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:41.020
or they go, or they, maybe they, I've never been pulled over, like, and checked like that,

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:47.020
but maybe they say, when's the last time you had a drink?

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:53.020
And if you say, I just had one like five minutes ago before I got in my car,

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:58.020
the irony is, you're allowed to wait 15 more minutes,

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.020
but no one wants to say that because it sounds like a confession of drunk driving.

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.020
Wait, you have to wait 15 minutes before you blow into it?

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.020
Yeah.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:11.020
But I'm hoping that that's a function of the cheap, shitty keychain thing that I got.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.020
I heard-

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.020
It makes sense, though. It's an ecstamic.

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:20.020
Isn't there like, they give you a choice, you can blow in the breathalyzer here,

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:25.020
or you can go down to the station and blow into the breathalyzer there.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:27.020
Don't they give you a choice? I heard that.

01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.020
Yeah.

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:34.020
And then they say, you know, go down to the station because by the time you get to the station,

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:38.020
you'll probably sober up enough to not be drunk driving.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:44.020
Or if their equipment works the same way as this piece of shit I got from Amazon,

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:52.020
sober or not, your result, if you just, like, you know, within 20 minutes,

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:55.020
is just off the fucking charts. It's not accurate.

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.020
It's not accurate.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:04.020
But I'm thinking, come on, it's got to be just because the cheap ones, I don't know.

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:07.020
Get a $70 one.

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.020
Get a fancy one.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020
Get a fancy one.

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.020
That seems like good money after bad.

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:16.020
Why don't you get a fancy one, get one with your name on it.

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:18.020
A designer breathalyzer.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.020
Yeah.

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:20.020
For a soggy breathalyzer.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.020
Just do it. Just do it. Just let it all hang out.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.020
What's another $10?

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.020
That's awesome.

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.020
Just do it.

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.020
It would be amazing.

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:32.020
Wouldn't it be great if they had technology that was so-

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:38.020
Like, if you could digitally know immediately how drunk you were,

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.020
like, if it was as simple as GPS, like, you don't have to put any effort into it,

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:46.020
and then you could just choose to send your Twitter or your phone in general,

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:51.020
your text messages, but, like, you choose your settings, like, when you're sober,

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:55.020
but, like, look, you are Andy Dick right now.

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.020
Right.

01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:01.020
And you're about to text your so-and-so, like, you could create lists of people.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:05.020
If they could hook it up, if your Apple Watch could connect to your iPhoto library,

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:09.020
so that underneath each photo, it showed your blood alcohol level.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.020
Yeah.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.020
That'd be incredible.

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:20.020
You could set your email settings to be like, hey, like, when you were sober,

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:25.020
you made me promise that when you clicked send on an email, I would go,

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:30.020
okay, I sent it, and then wait six hours, and then review.

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.020
You know, and then you'd be like, God damn it.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.020
I don't know.

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.020
What's the worst drunk email you ever sent?

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.020
Oh, God.

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.020
I don't know.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:42.020
I mean, I stopped using emails so long ago.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.020
Like...

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:47.020
What do you think's the worst drunk tweet you ever did?

01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:51.020
I don't know.

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:52.020
I don't know.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:57.020
I mean, like, the drunkest, most out-of-control stuff, I think, was just, like,

01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:00.020
there was an article about it.

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:04.020
I yelled at some kid for three hours or something.

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:07.020
You're a sober guy, Rob, huh?

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.020
No, I fucking drank.

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:13.020
You ever blast out any drunk tweets?

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:15.020
Yeah, but nothing angry.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.020
Just something stupid.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:21.020
I'm trying to think of what's the dumbest thing I've ever tweeted.

01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:26.020
It's hard to categorize it.

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.020
Probably be easier to isolate.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.020
I got really drunk at a party once, and I said,

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.020
oh, I'm going to go fuck those black girls or something like that.

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.020
I think that's probably...

01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:40.020
And I think I screamed that to you from across the party.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:43.020
I think that's probably the worst thing I've ever done.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.020
You muttered it through gritted teeth to me and Jeff.

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:48.020
Oh, God, that was a bad...

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.020
That was the worst.

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.020
You were lonely.

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:54.020
I was ugly lonely.

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:56.020
I was just like...

01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:58.020
I did not like that time in my life.

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:03.020
That was a really, really dark time.

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.020
I think we've all been there.

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.020
Ugly lonely?

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.020
Ugly lonely and drunk.

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.020
Fuck, man.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:15.020
The only thing that makes you graceful lonely

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:20.020
is time, which is really just saying your taste buds go dead.

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:24.020
There's no hero or villain in that process.

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:26.020
It's like, from my experience,

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:32.020
if you don't know loneliness enough yet,

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:35.020
you overreact to it and act like a big fucking tool

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:39.020
that is going to embarrass you later when you become mature,

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:43.020
which becoming mature does not involve you going to a crossroads

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:48.020
and learning the blues because you really wanted to evolve yourself.

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:53.020
The laziest, least mature people become mature

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:55.020
because they get old and tired

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.020
and they start experiencing the same fucking shit over and over again

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:01.020
because they don't make any effort to change.

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:04.020
So they're lonely a million times and then they're like,

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.020
this isn't so bad, it's kind of like the last time

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:08.020
and I know it'll end again.

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:11.020
And that's not wisdom and it shouldn't be...

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:16.020
I hate that we, when we get old, like, high road young people,

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:20.020
when really it's just like, yeah, yeah, like,

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:24.020
Spider-Man 4 is the third movie you've ever seen.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.020
Like, why are we arguing?

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.020
I've seen 700 more movies than you.

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:33.020
I don't remember the last 30 because my brain is dying.

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:39.020
It's just like, we don't do anything heroic to transform.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:42.020
We don't like gain, we don't level up because we're good people.

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:46.020
We just keep living and tasting shit and we get bored with it.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:48.020
Well, that's the one thing I love about Buddhism

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:51.020
is the concept of fundamental dissatisfaction,

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:55.020
which is the idea that, oh, no, that is actually to be human.

01:18:55.020 --> 01:19:03.020
So I think the big lie that comes from all the fucking Spider-Man movies

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:06.020
and all the movies and lots of stuff is we tell these people,

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:09.020
no, no, no, no, it gets better.

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:13.020
That'll go away, that gnawing, empty thing inside of you,

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.020
that'll go away.

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:17.020
And in Buddhism it's like, no, that's like a fish saying,

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.020
one day I'm going to be dry.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:21.020
Well, when you're dry, you're dead fish,

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.020
and in the same way for a human to think that that thing goes away

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.020
is one of the great ways a human tortures itself.

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.020
You know, also the idea of looking forward to it,

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.020
like, that's a good thing.

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.020
That would be like saying, the best example I can think of

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:41.020
is imagine if these Parkland kids, that whatever comes of what they did,

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.020
just imagine if they had been cool enough to realize how little

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:51.020
they'll care in 10 years, or had they taken cues from all the people previous.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:55.020
They reacted from the place that they were in,

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:59.020
and it was like they didn't react like 30-year-olds or 40-year-olds,

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:02.020
and as a result, they got shit done.

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:08.020
And young filmmakers, and everything young,

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:11.020
we worship youth, but we make fun of its naivete.

01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:17.020
Like, wisdom is just dying a little bit.

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.020
It's just going like, yeah, it gets a little boring.

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:23.020
I remember my dad, I was like 25, and he was however old he was,

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:26.020
and I just couldn't believe how old my dad was.

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.020
And I was like, it was a legitimate question in my head,

01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.020
and I was like, if he was any other human being,

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:35.020
I would know that this would be tacky and rude,

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:38.020
and then I might get punched, or just that it would be hurtful,

01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.020
but it's like, your dad's here, just like, fuck it.

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:45.020
This is the guy I can ask this question, because fuck him.

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:49.020
And I was like, so now that you're this old,

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:54.020
are you scared that you're going to die and stuff?

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:58.020
Which is really gnawing at me as a guy in my 20s.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:01.020
I was really thinking about what it must be,

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:03.020
to have to think about death all the time.

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:05.020
And I remember my dad being like,

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:08.020
eh, eh, eh.

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:14.020
He's kind of been alive a long time.

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:17.020
He starts to get kind of boring.

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.020
Yeah, depressed.

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.020
Well, I don't know who characterized my dad as a depressed guy.

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:25.020
Well, I mean, I disagree with you in what you're saying,

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.020
and I used to think that.

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:30.020
I don't think that's true, and I used to think it though.

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:33.020
I know people think that, but when I've been numbed down,

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:37.020
I've thought that, but I don't think that's actually it for me.

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:40.020
Well, I certainly don't want to make the mistake of going like,

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:44.020
I figured it out, that's the one law by which the universe goes.

01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:48.020
I keep going because I know that there's this other...

01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.020
I think the beauty of it is,

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:53.020
you stumble upon something really beautiful,

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:58.020
and you're like, you know, man, I kind of like came out of the closet

01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.020
with this Ram Dass stuff, you know, I have a guru,

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.020
and I'm really, I feel really good,

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:06.020
and I used to feel really bad, and I feel really, really good,

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:10.020
and I feel love in my life, and I feel really good.

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:13.020
I know it's like, it feels lame to say that,

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:17.020
but I used to think like what you, the way you're talking,

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:21.020
I used to think it was like an infinite Mordor escape or something,

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:25.020
and that it just goes on forever, kind of never ending Mordor escape,

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:27.020
and in fact, maybe it just gets worse and worse,

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:30.020
and then what happens is all this fucking shit the hippies are saying,

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:33.020
you hear it, and from that Mordor escape,

01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:37.020
and you think, shut the fuck up, that can't be real, it's not real,

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.020
but then you kind of, that's the entry way, you know,

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.020
and then you start, like what I would do is kind of like,

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.020
you know, I'm going to be like this like anthropologist,

01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:49.020
I'm going to go into this, and I'm going to find out where it's not real,

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:53.020
by being part of it, and then you start realizing it's real,

01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.020
and then that thing that you're talking about,

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.020
that afflicts a great many people,

01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:01.020
which is that sense of like, oh fuck, my brain's rotting, I'm getting old,

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:04.020
it just gets boring, this is terrible, oh my, like that thing,

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:09.020
you realize, oh my god, it doesn't have to be like that, for real,

01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:11.020
and now you're in a real predicament,

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:15.020
because you either have to, when people are saying things like what you're saying,

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:20.020
you have to decide like, oh my god, am I going to be the fucking guy who says that thing,

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:23.020
or am I going to keep my mouth shut about it,

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:27.020
or am I going to be cynical, or try to tune into like that,

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:30.020
and now it's like fuck, I have to say it,

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:32.020
because it's incredibly unethical if I don't,

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.020
and you know what I mean, it's incredibly unethical to be like,

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:37.020
no, I know what you mean, you know, or to not say it,

01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:43.020
it's actually, it doesn't work like that, you know, it can, if it can,

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:47.020
and that's okay, and the lineage I've become part of,

01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:50.020
the paradigm is not one incarnation,

01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.020
it's like we get many, many, many of these things,

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.020
and that is not to say to take it for granted,

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:58.020
but it's also to say in this one, you really just might be miserable for the entire incarnation,

01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:02.020
but they don't say that with like a,

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.020
you really might be miserable for this entire incarnation,

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:07.020
if you don't do what they say, they just might say like,

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:10.020
yeah, this one, it might be a sad one for you,

01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:13.020
and that's okay, that's okay,

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.020
not to be like, no, you should be better,

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:18.020
they're like, no, this is a perfect universe.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:22.020
I wish there was more standardized language about mood and stuff,

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:26.020
I feel like, I feel like if I answer the question honestly,

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.020
like how are you doing in a bar to someone,

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.020
and like very often people will be like,

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:37.020
oh, you're so hard on yourself, or hope you get better,

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:40.020
and stuff, and I'll be like, well, wait, you don't understand,

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:42.020
I'm incredibly happy.

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.020
Yeah, that's it, yeah.

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:48.020
Like, I'm just ashamed of myself by default,

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:50.020
like I'm filled with shame,

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.020
which is like a mechanism,

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.020
like it's like my plumbing needs to be like,

01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:00.020
like wrenched a little bit in therapy and stuff,

01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.020
because I was just like, just flooded,

01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:05.020
I just run on shame,

01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:08.020
like a device could run on water, it could run on steam,

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.020
it could run on oil,

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.020
it's like, I just like, just shame,

01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:18.020
just like, is the lubricant, shame is the fucking like...

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:20.020
Another way to put that would be,

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:22.020
the thing you currently think you are,

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:25.020
thinks it runs on shame, you know?

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.020
But that's not, you know, the idea is like,

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:31.020
really the thing that you are is much bigger

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.020
than a thing that thinks it runs on shame.

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.020
Part of what, another way to put it would be,

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.020
there is shame here, or there is shame.

01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:40.020
Another way to put it, it's called noting in Buddhism,

01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.020
you just watch it, shame.

01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.020
And then what you're doing is like something

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.020
that Sharon Salzberg calls add-ons,

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:50.020
so shame happens, you feel shame.

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.020
That's it, there is shame.

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:55.020
But then the mind starts attaching all this shit to the shame, right?

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:58.020
So now it becomes like this sort of recursion,

01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.020
it just goes on and on and on with the mind saying,

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:02.020
oh, because of there's shame, this must be this,

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.020
this must be that, and that must be that, and that.

01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.020
So that's called in Buddhism the poisoned arrow.

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:10.020
You get hit by the arrow, that's the first pain, shame.

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:13.020
Usually it's a triggering thing, it's not even shame,

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.020
it's like something happens, and the event is the arrow.

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.020
And then that, then shame, and then all the add-ons.

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:21.020
But really it's just shame, there is shame here,

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.020
in this field of matter called my human body.

01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:27.020
And then that's it, you just sit with it.

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.020
And then when the add-ons come, all this other stuff too,

01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:32.020
it's like, okay, that's there too.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:38.020
But to say I'm a machine that runs on shame is true now.

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:40.020
You know what I mean?

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.020
Yeah, I didn't mean to proclaim it as like,

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:48.020
I'm definitely, the whole thing is like an expression of like,

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.020
I am changing and I'm going to change.

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:55.020
I'm not resigned to the way that I run shit,

01:26:55.020 --> 01:27:01.020
but I like, yeah, I just kind of like,

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:05.020
I just feel like, I feel like it's, it's just like,

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:08.020
people go like, they listen to me talking and they go like,

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:11.020
oh he's so depressed and he's so sad or he's so, you know,

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:14.020
and then I go like, well no, if you talk like the way I'm talking,

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.020
then that might be indicative,

01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:19.020
these might be words that you would only say,

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.020
if you were about to put a gun in your mouth.

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.020
Yes, but like, because of how fucked up I am,

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.020
like, this is like, like, you know,

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:31.020
these are my metaphors and this is my language and this is,

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:33.020
this is my baseline.

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:36.020
It does need to be improved and lightened,

01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:43.020
but that's the same as like, somebody who's middle class saying,

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:45.020
I need to be rich.

01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:47.020
Like the middle class person is like,

01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:52.020
my middle line is just, there's a legubriousness to the,

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:55.020
to the language, because it's based on shame.

01:27:55.020 --> 01:28:00.020
Because like, I went into my therapist's office and it was like,

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:03.020
she's like, how did, how did, how did it go with Nigel and all this stuff?

01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:06.020
And it was like, he's good, he's better.

01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:08.020
So I saw him in a much better mood.

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.020
I'm feeling very good now.

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:13.020
Nigel's feeling better because our last session,

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:16.020
Nigel was very sick and I was very,

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:19.020
very upset and I was like, I was,

01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:22.020
I was saying like, I have this,

01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:26.020
like, I don't know where to put this rage and shame.

01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:29.020
Like I can't get rid of it and she,

01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:33.020
she, we spent the entire hour doing all these exercises of like,

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:36.020
going underneath this layer and that layer and all this stuff.

01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:40.020
And then we, we went out in the sidewalk and walked like a fucking python sketch

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:42.020
and whatever the fuck and like,

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:45.020
all of it had different effects and things,

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.020
but, and it wasn't about it working or not working,

01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:51.020
but the bottom line is it came back to the office and I was like,

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.020
she's like, how's that?

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:56.020
And I'm like, it's, I'm, it's on fire.

01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:01.020
Like, like, thanks for blowing on it or putting a blanket over it for a second,

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:04.020
but the blanket is flammable and it's like, there is a fire.

01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:08.020
I can't, I just want to beat something to death.

01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:09.020
I want to kill.

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.020
I want to hurt.

01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:13.020
I want to finish something.

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.020
I want to hurt something.

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:19.020
And I, and I, and I know I'm not supposed to want that and I can't blah, blah, blah.

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:22.020
And, and, and, you know, we got through that session.

01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:24.020
So then a week later, I come, I come back in.

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:27.020
Now during that week, Nigel gets better.

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:31.020
So then I sit in the chair and she goes like, how are you, how is it going?

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.020
Well, Nigel's better.

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.020
So I feel fucking great.

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:36.020
I walked into that room on a rainbow.

01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:41.020
I was like, one of those days where I'm like, well, this is 200 bucks wasted because I feel great.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:48.020
Um, but, and then she's like, well, so see, making progress, right?

01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:54.020
And I'm like, and then the whole session is based on the fact that my response to that was like, no, no progress made whatsoever.

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.020
Absolutely none.

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.020
Yeah.

01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:00.020
The only thing that happened is my dog got better.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:03.020
I didn't learn how to handle anything.

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:09.020
And she's like, no, but you, you, when, when your cat got sick, you punched a wall.

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:12.020
Yes. This time, did you punch a wall?

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.020
No, I did not.

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:20.020
So we would call that, uh, progress for the wall mason's union.

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:35.020
Like, like, like if Jack the Ripper chokes a hooker to death on Monday and then on Wednesday, like he just sits in a pub and and draws pictures in his notebook about of dead hookers.

01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:44.020
Great day for hookers, great amount of progress from Monday to Wednesday for his victims, not for him.

01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:46.020
Not in my opinion.

01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:48.020
And so we fought and fought.

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:49.020
I mean, I fought.

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:58.020
Like, but then by the end of the session, she was like, she basically was like the whole time was like making me realize how hard you're fighting.

01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:02.020
You don't want to say that you are better.

01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:04.020
Well, I mean, maybe you're not.

01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:06.020
And then the other question is like, she didn't want it.

01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:10.020
She was like, she was like asking me, like, does your God believe in incremental change?

01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:18.020
Your God willing to, does your God think that a little bit of progress is, is, is good enough?

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.020
And I was like, the honest answer is no.

01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:30.020
No, I do not worship a God that gives out medals for, for doing better than yesterday by a skosh.

01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:34.020
I don't, and that's because I created that God and etc.

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:36.020
You created the God.

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.020
I sure did, motherfucker.

01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:38.020
Damn.

01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.020
Created yours too.

01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.020
What is that?

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:41.020
What's up, Kyle?

01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:42.020
Is that a 3D printer?

01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:43.020
How do you do it?

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:44.020
I fucking pray.

01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.020
How do you create a God?

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.020
I pray.

01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.020
That's how you do it.

01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.020
Just prayer.

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:50.020
Dear God, make a God for Duncan.

01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:52.020
What God did you pray to to make the God?

01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:55.020
Master God, root God, super user God.

01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:57.020
Based God.

01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:59.020
Man, you got to start listening a little bit.

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:01.020
That's, you know, not to give you a prescription.

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.020
I know you turned me on to a little bit.

01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.020
I love a little bit.

01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:04.020
You're doing great.

01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:09.020
But yeah, the answer is to, you know, say thank you, based God and hope for His blessings.

01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.020
And then, you know, who knows?

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:13.020
Not that you need anyone's blessings or anything like that, but.

01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:14.020
Have you heard little B?

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:17.020
Squeaky chair?

01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:18.020
Oh, okay.

01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.020
We heard his feelings.

01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:24.020
You, the other thing I keep thinking is like, man, what is your definition of, I mean,

01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.020
forget the whole God thing.

01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.020
What's your definition of I?

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:28.020
Like, what do you think you are?

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.020
The definition of what?

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.020
Of you.

01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:31.020
Of you.

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.020
What do you think you are?

01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:33.020
Let me answer that.

01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:36.020
Thank you.

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:38.020
He's great.

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:40.020
You're great.

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:41.020
What else?

01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.020
Like, what do you think you are?

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:47.020
What are you?

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:57.020
I'm a fragment of an explosion of a thing that only knew that being was better than not

01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:58.020
being.

01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:07.020
And, yeah, I'm a shard with, like, different amounts of this and that in it than other

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:09.020
shards because it's not uniform.

01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.020
How big are you?

01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.020
Shard-sized?

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.020
What size?

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.020
Like your human size?

01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:16.020
Six foot, 240 feet.

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.020
You think that's your size?

01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.020
Are you getting it?

01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:25.020
Do I see myself on a kind of map as, like, somehow more important than other people?

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.020
No, not that at all.

01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:31.020
I'm saying, like, you know, when you start self-referencing in any situation, you already

01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:35.020
know this, I know, but you start self-referencing, you immediately are stuck with it.

01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:38.020
Like, you talk about, when I say this, it's going to sound like I'm saying, you talk about

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.020
yourself a lot, but we all do.

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.020
You talk about yourself a lot.

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:44.020
I'm this thing, I'm that thing, this is what I am, this is how I feel, this is who I am,

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.020
this is what I am.

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:49.020
And then you start playing this game where you're like, okay, okay, who's talking about

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.020
me?

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.020
Like, what's that?

01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:58.020
What's it saying what Dan is?

01:33:58.020 --> 01:33:59.020
What's that?

01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:02.020
You know, the watcher is what they call it, or the witness.

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:04.020
Yeah, I don't know.

01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:06.020
That thing's interesting, huh?

01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:07.020
It's like, what is that?

01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:09.020
It's this thing watching you.

01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:13.020
And it's making this comment, you're making a comment there, it's watching the commentary

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:14.020
in fact.

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:20.020
It reminds me of the thing that my therapist pointed out because I was saying, like, look,

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:25.020
I think the thing is, the problem is, like, she said, does your God have standards or

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:26.020
does he have compassion?

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.020
Does he just have standards or does he have compassion?

01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:32.020
I said, honestly, the honest answer, even though I'm going to fucking yell that for it, I could

01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:37.020
lie and say he has compassion and then be like, no, I'll tell you the truth.

01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:39.020
My God has just standards.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.020
Why?

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.020
Why doesn't he have compassion?

01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:46.020
Because compassion is the idea that God looks like rooting for you and that's an insane

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.020
thing to do.

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:56.520
And so it was like those AI, those robots on the YouTube videos, the guy from MIT that

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.520
created them, you know how he expresses his love for that thing, his pride in that thing

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.620
and his desire that it be the best robot it can be, his foot comes into frame and he tries

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:11.020
to kick it the fuck over as hard as he can because he created it for the purpose of proving

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:17.020
that it can overcome that and it can walk like a God no matter if God's foot comes in

01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:21.020
and goes like, no, fuck you, you thought you knew everything about walking, now fuck you.

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.020
Right.

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:25.520
And then the robot goes like this and then it starts walking and that's when you're watching

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.020
YouTube and you go, shit, we're going to be hunted to extinction because you're recognizing

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:32.020
superiority.

01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:35.020
You're not going like, oh, look at its stumble.

01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:39.020
You're like, oh, shit, that motherfucker knows how to walk when it gets kicked.

01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:46.520
Anyways, I was trying to explain that to her and then she was like, so how did you not

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:53.020
meet God's standards when Nigel got sick and was like, because I already learned this shit

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:57.520
and then I said, I said, you know, I recognize that I was doing this script, I got to finish

01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:01.620
this script because like you said, I'm sitting on this script because it's my last chance

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:05.980
to make myself miserable and then once I finish this script, like now I can, what I'm afraid

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:10.740
of doing is moving on and like dealing with life, you know, instead of just like sucking

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:15.320
my thumb and going like, oh, I got a deadline, it's kind of similar to Minecraft, like it's

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:20.180
just like, you just dig a little hole where you control whether you're miserable or you

01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:23.500
control the cause of your misery, you think.

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:27.260
And then I was like, okay, finish the script because you know what, it's time to move on

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:34.660
because Cody might get sick, anyone might get sick, the Syria might explode, everyone

01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:38.860
might get leukemia on my block, like I might find a ball in my nuts and a nut in my balls

01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:44.500
and like, it's time to join that fray, it's called life and I had made up my mind that

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:49.780
I was ready to do that and then God gave me the little as tiny as little nibble of life's

01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:55.220
caviar called, your dog is like trembling and I was like, and then she stopped me and

01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.540
said, all right, stop right there, stop.

01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:04.020
The characterization of your dog trembling and vomiting and needing to be taken to the

01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:13.340
hospital as a little nibble of caviar is called a distortion.

01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:22.820
Like you have chosen to believe in a God that has bigger fish to fry than your dog and the

01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.180
things that make you upset.

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:34.140
So that's what I want you to think about is like, why, you know, the God that you chose

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:39.060
isn't the actual one true one, you know it's a model, why would you choose your model to

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:42.860
be so fucking like distorted?

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:46.380
I don't mean to do this, but my question would be, who's choosing?

01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:47.380
Who is this?

01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:51.660
Well, I'm saying, isn't this like a kind of like chicken egg thing where you go, if you're

01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:55.580
a miserable person, you create a miserable God and the God, you know, you, or you have

01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:59.860
to, you, that's like the God thing is like a few years, like a few, like whether there's

01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:04.740
a God or not a God, you're still still dealing with this like interesting thing that happens

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:08.940
with a human, which is there is this field of awareness, miserable person, you have a

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.460
miserable map of the universe, well, you have the miserable person, the miserable person

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:14.880
is within a field of awareness.

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.900
There's a field of, so like in the Bhagavad Gita, they say there is the field and the

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:19.740
knower of the field.

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:24.180
So what happens with humans is we get caught up in the, in the field.

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:28.540
So and then that's when all the things start happening, like you get caught up in the field.

01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:32.780
So you're like, when I get caught up in my field, myself, my life, my self, I become

01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:37.980
selfish, literally selfish because I'm deeply caught in my own self, like deeply caught

01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:40.980
in my, my own self, that's selfishness.

01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.740
And so, but then when you start playing around with this concept of like, wait a minute,

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:50.660
wait a minute, there is awareness here that seems to be watching this thing happen, right?

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.660
Uh-huh.

01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:57.100
That is where, is where it gets interesting because when you start like playing around

01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.900
with that field of awareness, like you, you know, you look in the mirror, you can't look

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.180
back at, you can't, you, you have to look in the mirror to see yourself.

01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.260
You can't see yourself right now.

01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:06.660
It's a similar problem.

01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:09.140
This is this, this field of awareness.

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.740
What is it?

01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.620
Is it consciousness?

01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:13.620
What is it?

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.660
But within that field, all the drama is happening, right?

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:21.820
The drama is happening within the field of awareness and the field of awareness is watching.

01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:30.100
So the practice or one of the practice and mindfulness is not to change anything, not

01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:33.740
to change anything except to watch.

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:34.740
Now we're watching.

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:40.220
In other words, we are trying to shift ourselves from being the field to identifying with the

01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:42.000
knower of the field.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.500
And so the concept is moving from individual identity to soul, to the soul identity or

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.660
the universal consciousness.

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:52.660
That's the practice.

01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:54.160
Did you fucking fart?

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:56.140
I think it was a fart, not the chair.

01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:58.140
Oh, no, no, it was a smell.

01:39:58.140 --> 01:39:59.140
I smelled sulfur.

01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:00.140
That was a...

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.460
Well, that could be because you're talking about this pagan talk.

01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.220
No, but I really like that.

01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:05.220
That's interesting.

01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:11.340
It's sort of like awareness of awareness, like identification with the awareness.

01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:12.340
Yeah, that's it.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:16.860
Because if there's a camera there to make you feel ashamed, if you look fat from a certain

01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:23.500
angle, stop reacting to that by like people walk by a camera in a department store window

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:30.100
and we get all confused and we start waving our arms and stuff, become the camera for

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.100
a second.

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:32.780
That's what you're trying to do anyway.

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.780
Yeah.

01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:37.060
You're sitting there wondering how fat you are or what you're doing wrong and all that

01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:42.420
stuff like, oh, the invitation is to become a more objective point of view because other

01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:48.340
people will enter that frame, you'll become a character and you'll become a shard along

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:49.340
with everybody else.

01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:50.340
That's it.

01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.780
Like you put your money where your mouth is instead of reacting to seeing yourself on

01:40:52.780 --> 01:41:00.620
the scoreboard by getting more obsessed with your bald spot, you go, holy shit, I'm looking

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:03.180
at myself from the perspective of a stadium.

01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.260
He has a bald spot.

01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:05.260
So does he.

01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:10.700
So does who else does and what is, you know, like, yeah, that's very interesting.

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.100
It's interesting.

01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:13.100
It's interesting.

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:18.020
And the only thing is it's like, they wouldn't say you or you become that.

01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:23.180
They say you are that and that thing has become entangled in this thing.

01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:24.180
Yeah.

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.180
So it's not that you become it.

01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.180
It's actually that's what you are.

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.180
No, that's what you were in the first place.

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:28.180
Otherwise you wouldn't.

01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:29.180
We wouldn't talk the way we do.

01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:31.020
We go like, oh, I'm such a piece of shit.

01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:33.380
Like, well, it sounds like you're talking about a character.

01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:34.380
Yeah, that's it.

01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:36.460
Like, like, so you're already David Milch.

01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.460
Like you're not.

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:38.460
You've never been elsewhere.

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:43.060
And Jen, like, like, that you, you were always David Milch, like, like now, now what you

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:47.860
have to do is remember that you're not like, you know, that there is no deadwood and that

01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.380
you're it's a fucking set.

01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:50.460
And that's exactly it.

01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.460
Self remembering.

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:52.460
Yeah.

01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:53.460
Remembering your true identity.

01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.460
You know, David.

01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.460
Got to remember those feet.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.460
David Milch.

01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.460
David Milch.

01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:01.180
You may be in David Milch, man.

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:02.180
All right.

01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:05.940
Well, I feel like I'm David Milch right now.

01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:10.940
I sure wish we could keep this going forever, but I'm going through a David Milch situation.

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:14.260
Who is David Milch?

01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:15.460
I feel like David.

01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.460
Do you feel David Milch?

01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:19.100
I'm sure he, I don't know if he exists.

01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:21.740
I mean, I could imagine him just based on his name.

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:22.980
I feel Milch.

01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:24.940
Who is Milch?

01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.300
What is Milch?

01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.300
Where is Milch?

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:28.300
Yeah.

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:29.300
Here.

01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:30.300
Oh.

01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:31.300
I feel like this.

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.900
I am David Milch.

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:36.420
I feel like David Milch.

01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:38.860
Do not mock me with.

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:44.740
I feel like David Milch to you.

01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.580
I will.

01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:50.060
I feel like David Milch.

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:55.420
I arise in the places where I feel welcome.

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.820
Where I'm feeling David Milch.

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:59.180
I'm feeling David Milch.

01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:02.620
David Milch is not feeling you.

01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.940
David Milch will depart.

01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:09.940
That's white noise, man.

01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:10.940
You guys fucked it.

01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:11.940
What did you do?

01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:12.940
You scared David Milch away.

01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:13.940
He's here.

01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:14.940
He's always here watching.

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:15.940
All right.

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:17.740
Well, David Milch is in my heart.

01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.740
Yeah.

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.460
As long as we remember.

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.460
Just remember him.

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:22.460
Remember.

01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:23.460
Remember me.

01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.460
Remember Milch.

01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:25.460
Remember.

01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:28.340
You guys see Coco.

01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:29.980
It's about remembering people.

01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.620
The sign language gorilla.

01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:36.140
You'll never forget Coco.

01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.140
No.

01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.140
She will.

01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:40.060
That gorilla has made me cry so many times.

01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:43.900
I saw a GIF of Robin Williams tickling Coco.

01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.020
Kill you every time.

01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:51.860
And I got all misty eyed because Coco was laughing and doing like this and Robin was

01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:58.860
going, huh, huh, huh, Mindy, and it was beautiful.

01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:00.740
I just said GIF instead of GIF.

01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:01.740
I know.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:02.740
I noticed that.

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:04.540
Did you guys think I was smart?

01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:05.540
Yeah.

01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.540
You know, I thought.

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.540
It's a graphic interface.

01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:21.540
I thought maybe Monster Palooza was sharing a hotel with WIAC2.html.

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:23.100
Because you were listening.

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:25.220
I heard the GIF pronunciation.

01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.220
Yeah.

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.020
I meant Monster Palooza.

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:31.700
Yeah, I heard that.

01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:39.140
You went to a fucking convention in a, you know what, I'm not, it's not my job to be

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:40.140
jealous of you.

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.140
I don't care.

01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:45.060
No, it is not your job to care about me at all.

01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:46.060
Yeah.

01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:47.380
No, you don't get paid for caring.

01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:50.300
I wasn't put here for that.

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.140
I'll tell you what you were put here for.

01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:54.060
Oh my God, David Milch.

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:55.060
Milch is back.

01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:56.060
Yeah.

01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.340
Can you talk some sense into Harmon?

01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:00.020
He's really bumming my nuts.

01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.020
He's being mean.

01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:02.740
He's being, you know, Harmon, you're being mean.

01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:04.420
Yeah, but that's what you're supposed to be.

01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:08.020
Rob, Schrab, you were written to antagonize Dan Harmon.

01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.020
I'm written.

01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:14.620
Yes, you are written and not well.

01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:17.740
You are a placeholder character.

01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:18.740
Jesus, Milch.

01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:19.740
Lighten up.

01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:20.740
Schrab's awesome.

01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:21.740
That's really mean.

01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:22.740
What the fuck are you doing?

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:23.740
It's one of the sweetest guys on earth.

01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:26.740
He tweets dogs that are, he saves dogs.

01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:32.740
Duncan Trussell, I added you in the third draft of this reality in response to a network

01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:33.740
note.

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:34.740
Jesus Christ.

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.260
Milch, what the fuck?

01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:37.260
I was being sarcastic.

01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:38.260
Oh my God.

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:39.260
I'm sarcastic.

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:42.820
I'm like a sarcastic, shitty thought of yours.

01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:48.100
I wanted to teach them a lesson for asking the writer to add intelligence.

01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:51.980
I don't feel like Dan Milch to you at all anymore.

01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:53.300
Excuse me?

01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.700
I don't feel like David Milch at all to you.

01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:59.060
I think David Milch needs to get Milched.

01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:00.580
That's a problem.

01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:05.900
No character can Milch, David Milch.

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.940
I Milch you.

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:08.940
What?

01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.940
Fuck.

01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:10.940
Hey, David.

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:11.940
Yes.

01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:19.460
Did you see Dredd, the Judge Dredd movie?

01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.460
Yeah.

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.460
Yes.

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.740
Did you like it?

01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:24.020
I wrote it.

01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:25.020
You wrote it?

01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:26.620
I wrote the people that wrote it.

01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:28.340
Did you like them?

01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:31.420
I don't like any of my characters.

01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:32.420
Okay.

01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:34.420
Who wrote you, Milch?

01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:46.980
A question asked only on the page.

01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:51.300
For those off the page, no, there is no answer.

01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:52.460
There definitely isn't an answer.

01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:53.540
That's not an answer.

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:55.060
That's a shit answer, Milch.

01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:56.060
Who wrote you?

01:46:56.060 --> 01:47:02.860
You sit on the margins and between my brads and ponder your fate and your monologues.

01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:06.220
You don't understand how it works.

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:09.220
Off the page, no one asks those questions.

01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:12.420
Off the page, there is only Milch.

01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:15.540
So you just have always been forever?

01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:20.540
There was a time before Milch.

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:21.540
BM?

01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:22.540
BM?

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:23.540
Yes.

01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:36.180
So BM was literally the time before you.

01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:38.820
You're the result of BM.

01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:39.820
It's a paradoxical expression.

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:41.860
Have you ever thought of that, Milch?

01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:42.860
How's that feel?

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:45.140
You're just a bow movement, Milch.

01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:48.940
You're just a thing that the universe shat out and started writing characters.

01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:50.860
Got all milch-y.

01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.980
Came out all milch-y.

01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:55.660
I feel unwelcome here.

01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:56.660
I will fade out.

01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:00.980
Go back to Milmac.

01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:02.660
Go back to Milmac, Milch.

01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:03.660
Cool.

01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:05.620
You got a scared Milch away, I guess.

01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:06.620
BM.

01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:07.620
Post-milch.

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:08.620
I like it.

01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:10.900
Fucking Milmac cat-eating, motherfucker.

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:11.900
Angry old Milch.

01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:12.900
Yeah.

01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:13.900
Someway.

01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:14.900
Gulking around the universe.

01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:15.900
Go away, Milch.

01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:18.180
What happened to David Milch after he put his dick in the beans?

01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:19.180
Did he?

01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.980
Who the fuck is David Milch?

01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:23.100
He's the creator of NYPD Blue and Deadwood.

01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.900
He put his dick in beans?

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:30.020
Beans is this woman that was a set decorator on the show.

01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:32.660
He's the craziest person I've never heard of.

01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:40.380
We were told on the anecdote where David Milch at the craft service table or at a party

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.380
or something.

01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:44.860
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.860
Maybe it was.

01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:46.860
Yeah, I'm speaking out of school.

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:55.340
I was probably from, I don't know, it was like, you were hanging out with Chris McKenna.

01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:58.220
But there were a bunch of people that saw it.

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.180
David Milch put his dick in some beans.

01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:01.180
What?

01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:02.180
And then a-

01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:04.380
How does that ruin you or how does that get out there?

01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:05.380
At a party.

01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:08.140
Well, because there was a bunch of it, because he was like, basically like he took some beans

01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:13.340
from the craft service table and then he like, he like had his dick in beans and then like-

01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:20.620
And somebody said, everybody's like waiting in line to get their food and then he's just

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:24.980
like doing that and everybody's like, do you mind?

01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:29.580
The way I was introduced to the concept was that there were writers who were saying like

01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:36.020
they, among each other, like they use the expression like, oh man, I really put my dick

01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:37.020
in the beans.

01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:38.020
Like to mean like-

01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:39.020
Is it supposed to feel good?

01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:40.020
I bet it feels great.

01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.020
Is that what he did?

01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:45.260
I mean, no, he wasn't doing it to feel good, he was doing a bit about like, and I know

01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:48.460
you have more questions about why he did it, but I don't know, but this is like, their

01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:52.060
perspective was that he had did it and then it was like, there was a weird silence and

01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:57.980
because the guy in charge put his dick in beans and then so then thereafter it was an

01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:05.780
expression among these writers of like, oh shit, I overreached, I was feeling my oats

01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:15.500
or I kind of like, I just sort of fell on my face or, but I did it because I wanted

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:16.500
it to be-

01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:21.340
I feel like the scenario was like, Milt was like trying to be funny, whips out his dick,

01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:25.540
puts it in the beans and everybody kind of went, oh, they were like, yep, floor and then

01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:30.620
he went, oh, too far, all right, I guess we're not going to laugh at me putting my dick in

01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:33.820
the beans, okay.

01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:36.820
What did you bring to the table, bananas?

01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:42.220
But I do think it would, I mean, not that it doesn't matter because it's really missing

01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:47.580
the point, but I do think that like, it would probably feel good to put your dick in beans.

01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:50.540
Warm or cold, don't even think about it, warm or cold.

01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:51.540
Okay, great point.

01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:52.540
It's not going to be-

01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.540
Don't even think about it.

01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:58.260
What do you mean, of course warm, warm beans, yeah, cold beans, you want to put your dick

01:50:58.260 --> 01:50:59.860
in warm beans, not cold beans.

01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:07.100
Do you ever do food sex stuff like, I tried that in my 20s because you know, you see it

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:10.460
in like Playboy videos or whatever and they're like, oh, let's get out the honey and the

01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:11.460
whipped cream and then it's like-

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:12.460
Okay, yeah.

01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:13.460
It took one time to-

01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:14.460
I was like, yeah.

01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:15.460
This is gross.

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.460
It's all pu-bee.

01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:17.460
It's all pu-bee.

01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:21.780
You're like sticky, like who wants to, like if someone came up to you and said like, hey,

01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:25.900

01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:29.980
Speak for yourself.

01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:34.980
Your girlfriend would suddenly become sexy if she had whipped cream like now, like a-

01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:38.460
whipped cream is usually experienced in a contained environment.

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:39.980
It's on top of frozen ice cream and stuff.

01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:43.780
You put it on a tit and then it's like, now there's, you get to see what whipped cream

01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:44.780
is made of.

01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:49.220
You ever like spill like soda on your like linoleum and then you don't get to it right

01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:55.180
away and then you walk across it with your socks and it's got like dog hair right?

01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:56.180
Now add cum.

01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:57.180
Yeah.

01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:00.460
That's what we're talking about.

01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:01.460
All right.

01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:08.020
Well, should have started there, but that's another episode of Harmontown.

01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:13.940

I don't understand how time works.

01:52:54.820 --> 01:53:02.980
I tell time by seasons of television shows and, uh, ex-wives, like, I don't know what

01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:07.100

Yeah, it's coming out, man.

That's a million years from now.

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:17.660
It's a million years from now.

01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:21.020
Thank you, David Miltz.

01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:22.620

Thank you, Duncan Tressel, for coming.

01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:28.340
Don't be dissuaded by this.

We'll have an- next time you get invited to do the show-

01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:32.180
I loved it.

01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:38.020
Uh, you'll probably be an audience, but even if there's not, you would love it anyway.

01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:39.020
Yeah, man.

01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:40.180
I mean, yeah, let's do it.

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.180
More of these.

01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:43.180
Thank you, Rob Schrab, for giving me my iPad back.

01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:44.900
Uh, could've charged it.

01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:46.700
Say thank you, thank you, based God.

01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:51.340
Thank you, based God, for helping me win the NBA playoffs.

01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:54.500
Pretty good.

01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:56.980
Can you get cursed by him if you're not in the NBA?

01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:57.980
Man.

01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:01.700
He's very care- the base God, it doesn't throw those curses out.

01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:07.460
He drops like some sick, sick base, man.

01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:09.620
It's not even my place to talk about it.

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:10.620
It's good you said that.

01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:11.620
It's sick.

01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:12.620
All right.

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:13.620
It's Miltz.

01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:16.740
It's all Miltz-y.

01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:17.740
That's it.

01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:18.740
Enjoy your lives.

01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:22.340
I'll see you when I'm working out tomorrow on Instagram.

01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:49.340
I'm just trying to realize how dumb you are.

01:54:52.340 --> 01:55:17.340
I'm just trying to realize how dumb you are.

01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:21.340
I'm just trying to realize how dumb you are.
