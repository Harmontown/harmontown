{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:08.000\nOkay. Hello. I would like to order a burger, please.\n\n00:08.000 --> 00:16.000\nOkay. I mean, usually you would just say what you wanted, like you pulled up to burger spot, but that's fantastic.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:22.000\nI would like a cheeseburger and a soda and some fries.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:27.000\nGot it. And those are Carolina hot cake fries, or do you want the blisters?\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:33.000\nAre the blisters hot cake style?\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:36.000\nYeah. 100%. They're blasting, man.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:39.000\nOkay. I'll have those.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:40.000\nGreat.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:43.000\nCan I take your order?\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:46.000\nWelcome to Denny's.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:50.000\nIs there supposed to be another...\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:53.000\nWe've been getting interference.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:59.000\nListen to him. Hey, can I get your order? Daryl.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:04.000\nYou're interference, man. I mean, go ahead and do the order, but you're going to have to go across the street.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:10.000\nWell, how come I can hear him? Why is there two speakers?\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:14.000\nWell, okay. So we just bombed Syria.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:15.000\nRight.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:28.000\nAnd so the Russians are responding with a massive cyber attack. And what's happened is they've created an interference wave that's essentially all the fast food restaurants have mixed up with each other.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:34.000\nSo they knew the number one way to hurt America was to fuck up the fast food distribution chain.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:35.000\nAnd it's working.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:39.000\nSeven of our customers committed suicide last week.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nWe're going for eight. Can I take your order?\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:47.000\nYou just have to cross the street.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:51.000\nWhy do I need to go across the street? You're the same restaurant. The Russians can't make your food different.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:55.000\nIf you want an order from me, you can. I will take your order from you.\n\n01:55.000 --> 02:01.000\nBut I am in another restaurant three blocks up.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:02.000\nWhoa.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:11.000\nNo!\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:14.000\nAll right. We get we get time and a half.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:18.000\nYeah. So cool. Per suicide. Thank you, Putin.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:19.000\nWho?\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:22.000\nIt's Harmontown time.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:43.000\nHarmontown. Here we go. We're sending. You got to get off the stage.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:53.000\nHere we go.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:56.000\nOkay. Do I start now?\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:02.000\nHere we go, friends. Welcome to the Pre-Singularity Pre-World War Three.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:17.000\nHarmontown presenting your favorite gay master Rob Schrupp.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:23.000\nAnd there he is. King of the town, Dan Harmon.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:26.000\nYo, yo, yo.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nRap with the rap.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nRap with the rap at the top of the show rap.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:32.000\nPut the music in your heart and your feet.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nFuck your mama until she's red like a beat.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nGet the beat in the street.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nMake your voice go up a couple matches.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\nI'm gonna fuck your mama with my dick.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nNot doing anything weird.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:46.000\nStuffin' sick.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:48.000\nJust gonna take her out.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:53.000\nTake her back home and shout into her pussy like a paper bag.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:56.000\nAnd then I'll pop it.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nAll right. Thank you.\n\n03:58.000 --> 03:59.000\nThank you.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:01.000\nWe're still working out the...\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nI like this new format.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nYeah, we're still working with the format.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:06.000\nThis is fantastic.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:07.000\nWe could do this every week.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:08.000\nChange nothing.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:13.000\nWe opened with the drive-thru sketch, a classic.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nA little updated.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:24.000\nThere were some added updates of Topical News Nightingale.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nThat's right.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:26.000\nBecause it's coming.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:31.000\nIf this is your first episode of Harmontown, you've...\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nNot for me.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nYou shouldn't...\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nThis isn't like the other episodes.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nThis is a very special episode.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nOur comptroller is Duncan Trussell.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:42.000\nThanks for coming.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.000\nHello, everyone.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nThank you. Good to be here.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nOur game master is Rob Schrab.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\nGame master.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:50.000\nGame master.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nRob Schrab, the game master.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nYou're filling in his game master.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:56.000\nI think you're missing a consonant.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nNope.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nNot at all.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nWhat are you accusing him of gaslighting?\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nYes.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nAnd there's no audience.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nYou're losing.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nYou're losing the audience.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:11.000\nIs it...\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nI mean, am I allowed to leave the podium and get myself vodka?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nOh, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nThanks.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nDo we have...\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nDo we have...\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nCokes or sodas?\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nDo you have Coke Zero?\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nDo you have...\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nCrystal Pepsi?\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nDo you have...\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nCherry Seven Up?\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nI don't know what else we have besides vodka.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nWhat about Le Quai?\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:40.000\nWill someone please bring Rob a non-alcoholic beverage?\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nAll right, guys. Here we go.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nI just need something sweet.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nThis is...\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nI wouldn't mind...\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nWouldn't mind getting through this one kind of quick.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nWhich one? The show?\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\nYeah.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.000\nWhat's wrong?\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nWhy don't you shorten the show?\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nI got a hot game of Minecraft going at home.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nWhy don't you shorten the show?\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:06.000\nI'm thinking maybe I'll start shortening it by ten minutes every week\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nso that no one notices that it's eventually an hour.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nNo, this is all water.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nThis is water?\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nOkay, that's kind of like soda.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nI gotta say, you know, I haven't been here in a while, man.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nBut we've been tightening the format, yeah.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nAnd this is strange.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:27.000\nThis fits in with everything that's happening.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:31.000\nYou know, it's perfectly exactly what's happening.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:35.000\nIt's like this kind of fantastic collapse.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nDo we have no audience last time you were here?\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nNo, we had an audience.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nWe had this beautiful, wonderful audience.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nAnd now it's just this empty, cavernous space.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nIt's like the end of it.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nThis is something I've been thinking about a lot is the apocalypse\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:57.000\nand how the apocalypse is not going to be the way people think\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nthe apocalypse would be.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:00.000\nNo big insects.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:01.000\nWhat's that?\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nSorry.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nKeep going.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:04.000\nNo what sex?\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nNo big insects.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nInsects.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nNo incest in the apocalypse?\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:09.000\nYeah.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nNo big incest.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nNo, no, massive incest.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:20.000\nI think it'll be filled with giant insects.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nLike giant bees that fuck their cousins?\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nYeah.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:31.000\nMost insects are essentially practicing massive incest, right?\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nYou know, I've never looked into that.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:34.000\nI have no idea.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nI suppose every species has some built-in insects.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:42.000\nI suppose every species has some built-in exogenous safety valve\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nlike tries to keep itself from fucking itself.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nYeah, there's probably a safety valve.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:56.000\nSo when you leave for Minecraft, you know, Duncan and I will just,\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nyou know, we'll mine the store while you go play your game.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nNow that sounds like a plan.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:06.000\nYeah, we could get a lot of stuff done tonight after he'd go.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:10.000\nWe'll probably have an audience again soon.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nYou know, we're going to be moving out of here.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nInto my butthole.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:21.000\nI am evicting us so that the great Taiko ITT can make his starburns feature.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nI love his trains.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nI mean, the format is crazy right now.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nI know.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nWell, that's why I was doing this.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nI'm trying to get it out of the system because I know we're going to be back in front of an audience soon\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:37.000\nand then we're not going to be able to do stuff like fake cold opens and things, you know?\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nNo, I mean, this is like something in it.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nThis is like a dream.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nThis is like something I would dream.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:47.000\nI would dream I was doing this with no audience or something like truly like after the world ends,\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\na few of us have gone mad.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nThere's a few people in an old empty warehouse and we're like, fuck it.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:53.000\nWe'll just do a talk show.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nWe all have beers and we're eating our legs.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nYeah.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:03.000\nI mean, there's something about like if it was like if you walked outside, you would die.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nYou know, like there's something about still doing the podcast.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nYeah.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:12.000\nThe responsibility of like, look, people are boarded up in their homes.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nRight.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:18.000\nYou know, they're eating their legs or growing beards, but they still this is the only happiness they have.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nOh my God.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nI know.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nI know what this reminds me of because I was just watching it.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:30.000\nYou know, one thing that just infuriated me is I realized you cannot download the original dawn of the day from normal meat.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nYou have to get it off of YouTube.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nIt's low.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\nYou as far as I'm aware, you can't get it from Amazon.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nYou can't get it from iTunes.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nYou can't get it from the normal ways that you would down.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nYou could you could torn it.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:44.000\nI'm sure.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:48.000\nBut like, you know, the convenience of just downloading it for like three bucks.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nIt's for some.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nWho knows why?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:56.000\nBecause they want you to get the new one because it's probably same money going to the same place and so they want.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:03.000\nWell, they just put out a 4k version of night of the living dead and they're probably doing a new restoration of that.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:14.000\nI just bought coincidentally somebody took like all of the cuts of the original dawn of the dead because Dario Argento produced it.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:20.000\nAnd there was like more different deleted scenes in the Italian version.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nSomeone did a super cut of both of them.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nAnd I'm going to get it in the mail this week.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nSo I've never seen the Italian version of it.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nThat's badass.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nIt's a different name, wasn't it?\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nWas it zombie or something?\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nI think.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nYeah.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nBut that's one of my favorite movies.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nAnd it starts off and it's sorry, Dan.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:41.000\nIt starts off on a TV studio during the apocalypse and they're trying to process it.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:45.000\nAnd it's very similar to this, except we're like more low-key.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nThey're freaking out.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:51.000\nBut it is like an abandoned news state.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:55.000\nLike the cameras moving around, people are talking in the background.\n\n10:55.000 --> 11:00.000\nIt does have this kind of dead has been show feeling.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:09.000\nWell, in honor of that release, didn't we write a what if we were dawn of the dead sketch?\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:10.000\nYeah.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nSo I don't know why you guys are spoiling it so much.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nOkay.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:17.000\nI mean, I said we should segue to this topic to tee up our dawn of the dead sketch that\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nwe've been spending so much time on.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nWe had our meeting about the show yesterday.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:22.000\nYeah, when we wrote the burger sketch.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nRight.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:26.000\nIt took a long, a team of 15 writers.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nYeah.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.000\nYeah.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\nSo let's start that sketch.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:37.000\nThis is the dawn of the dead sketch.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:41.000\nThey're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nThey're coming for you.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nIt's funnier every time, man.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nThey're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:57.000\nLast week on Night of the Living Dead, they're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nThey're coming for you.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:03.000\nThey've been dead a long time, Barbara.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nThey're coming for you.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nThey're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:17.000\nYou know, man, when I was watching my friend, his throat ripped out by a zombie before I\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nran in here.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nYes, Barbara.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nI thought to myself, I'd never laugh again.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nI would go into shock.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nI'd go nuts.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:28.000\nBut that fucking thing, man, every time you keep doing that impression from Night of the\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:31.000\nLiving Dead is fucking funny.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nIt's a good one, Bob.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nHow did you first learn how funny that was?\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:42.000\nOh, the first time I said it, Barbara.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd Barbara laughed.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nAnd then you also laughed, Barbara.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nCan I be clear on something?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nYou're saying that he's doing it from the movie Night of the Living Dead.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:56.000\nYes.\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:02.000\nHe's doing the impression, ironically, because I slipped on intestines on the way in here.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nI did, Barbara.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nAll right.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:09.000\nI just want to be clear, because that's sometimes a thing like Night of the Living Dead is a\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nmovie that we can read.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nAnd the thing defines the thing, Barbara.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:19.000\nSo they're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nBut here we are.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nThey're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nCan I ask if you...\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nI've been saying that all night.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nThey're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:28.000\nOh, shit.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:29.000\nShit.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nSorry, I got it.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:31.000\nWe're live again.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:32.000\nThey're coming.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nAll right.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:42.000\nIf you are in the Glenbrook area, Recita, Riverside, we have a new list of shelters for you.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nRiverside?\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nDo not go to the schools.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nDo not go to the shelters.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nWe mentioned in the previous segment, those shelters have been...\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:55.000\nThey're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nAgain.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nSeriously, my mom lives in Riverside.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nIf you are just tuning in...\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nThey're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nGuys, we're live.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nIt's not funny, my mom.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nThey're coming to get you.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nThe dead have been returning to life...\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nThey're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\n...and murdering the living.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nThey're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nI left the door open.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nIt's okay.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nIt doesn't...\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nIt's okay.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nLaughter will get through.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nWe...\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:20.000\nLaughter will get through this.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:25.000\nWe have a doctor here, a physiologist in the studio.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.000\nHis name was Finch Williams.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:31.000\nI was my brother.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nHe was eating his throat.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:37.000\nI guess he's no longer with us.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nOkay.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nAgain.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nWhy isn't somebody doing something?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:45.680\nIf someone near you has perished, do not leave the body unattended.\n\n14:45.680 --> 14:51.500\nDo not attempt to bury it, burn it, or cut off the head, or drive a sharp object.\n\n14:51.500 --> 14:53.000\nDon't do any of that?\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nNo.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nDon't...\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.840\nDon't bury the body.\n\n14:57.840 --> 14:58.840\nJust hang out with it.\n\n14:58.840 --> 14:59.840\nDon't sit shiva.\n\n14:59.840 --> 15:01.840\nI think that's what they call it.\n\n15:01.840 --> 15:02.840\nWell, you could...\n\n15:02.840 --> 15:04.840\nYou could try to make it laugh.\n\n15:04.840 --> 15:07.840\nYou could go, they're coming to get you, Barbara.\n\n15:07.840 --> 15:08.840\nIt's not funny anymore.\n\n15:08.840 --> 15:10.840\nIf I was gonna make a zombie laugh, I wouldn't...\n\n15:10.840 --> 15:11.840\nIt's funny.\n\n15:11.840 --> 15:12.840\nIt's not...\n\n15:12.840 --> 15:14.840\nMy mom's probably dead right now, and it's my fault.\n\n15:14.840 --> 15:18.840\nWell, I mean, the question is, like, is she really dead if she comes back to life?\n\n15:18.840 --> 15:19.840\nYour mom's immortal now.\n\n15:19.840 --> 15:20.840\nThat's not...\n\n15:20.840 --> 15:21.840\nThat's not...\n\n15:21.840 --> 15:22.840\nYou know what I mean?\n\n15:22.840 --> 15:24.840\nYour mom's, like, immortally retarded?\n\n15:24.840 --> 15:25.840\nIs that what a zombie...\n\n15:25.840 --> 15:29.840\nThe last thing I said to her is, like, I hope they fucking get you.\n\n15:29.840 --> 15:31.840\nIt's just your mom's gonna live forever.\n\n15:31.840 --> 15:32.840\nYou should be happy.\n\n15:32.840 --> 15:33.840\nOh, shit.\n\n15:33.840 --> 15:34.840\nFuck.\n\n15:34.840 --> 15:35.840\nYou know what?\n\n15:35.840 --> 15:41.840\nWe're gonna take a brief break from the broadcast, because I left my keys in the helicopter\n\n15:41.840 --> 15:46.840\non the roof, and I'm just gonna run up there, go in the helicopter, grab my keys, and come\n\n15:46.840 --> 15:49.840\nback down to hang out here with everybody.\n\n15:49.840 --> 15:53.840\nAll these funny people, and keep helping people by...\n\n15:53.840 --> 16:02.840\nI'm so glad we have that helicopter, because it was ever a reason to have all this shit.\n\n16:02.840 --> 16:04.840\nDid you hear something?\n\n16:04.840 --> 16:05.840\nYeah, I heard it.\n\n16:05.840 --> 16:06.840\nWhat did you hear?\n\n16:06.840 --> 16:10.840\nI heard a bird flapping really fast.\n\n16:10.840 --> 16:13.840\nYeah, it sounded like a giant hummingbird.\n\n16:13.840 --> 16:14.840\nOr...\n\n16:14.840 --> 16:19.840\nHelicopter...\n\n16:19.840 --> 16:21.840\nAnd scene.\n\n16:21.840 --> 16:24.840\nI thought we were gonna say helicopter together.\n\n16:24.840 --> 16:25.840\nYeah.\n\n16:25.840 --> 16:26.840\nWe didn't.\n\n16:26.840 --> 16:28.840\nYeah, I mean, it's a good...\n\n16:28.840 --> 16:33.840\nSo Dawn of the Dead is probably coming out on DVD or something, and so we threw that\n\n16:33.840 --> 16:34.840\ntogether.\n\n16:34.840 --> 16:35.840\nYeah, on DVD.\n\n16:35.840 --> 16:36.840\nDVD will come out.\n\n16:36.840 --> 16:39.340\nWe have some other sketches coming up throughout the show.\n\n16:39.340 --> 16:40.340\nKing Kong lives.\n\n16:40.340 --> 16:41.840\nTry and get your mind off the Trump thing.\n\n16:41.840 --> 16:46.240\nYou know, we're not doing a lot of current event sketches, but we do, you know, we gotta\n\n16:46.240 --> 16:50.840\ndo a couple, otherwise we're gonna lose listeners to MSNBC, so...\n\n16:50.840 --> 16:51.840\nTrue.\n\n16:51.840 --> 16:53.840\nWe try to keep it above the belt.\n\n16:53.840 --> 16:55.840\nWe try to keep it...\n\n16:55.840 --> 16:58.840\nWe try to keep it above the belt.\n\n16:58.840 --> 17:00.840\nThis is wild, man.\n\n17:00.840 --> 17:06.840\nLast time I was here, filled with people laughing, no bad...\n\n17:06.840 --> 17:07.840\nDo you know why they stopped?\n\n17:07.840 --> 17:08.840\nDo you know why they stopped coming?\n\n17:08.840 --> 17:09.840\nYeah, I heard it.\n\n17:09.840 --> 17:10.840\nI heard it.\n\n17:10.840 --> 17:11.840\nQuality.\n\n17:11.840 --> 17:12.840\nYeah, I heard the quality.\n\n17:12.840 --> 17:13.840\nYeah, we actually...\n\n17:13.840 --> 17:16.840\nWe dropped our tickets to a penny.\n\n17:16.840 --> 17:18.840\nPeople just aren't coming.\n\n17:18.840 --> 17:20.840\nWhat happened?\n\n17:20.840 --> 17:21.840\nIt just slid downhill.\n\n17:21.840 --> 17:22.840\nYeah, I just...\n\n17:22.840 --> 17:23.840\nWhat happened?\n\n17:23.840 --> 17:24.840\nI started showing up regularly.\n\n17:24.840 --> 17:25.840\nI don't...\n\n17:25.840 --> 17:26.840\nIs it you?\n\n17:26.840 --> 17:29.840\nI remember you spiraled into like some deep, dark existentialism.\n\n17:29.840 --> 17:31.840\nYeah, that's always good.\n\n17:31.840 --> 17:35.840\nThen you incurred the wrath of the gods is what happened.\n\n17:35.840 --> 17:37.840\nDo you worry about that?\n\n17:37.840 --> 17:43.680\nThat the reason that the fire department came and shut down Harmontown and that the chaos\n\n17:43.680 --> 17:47.340\nis coming from a vortex of that dark...\n\n17:47.340 --> 17:48.340\nRemember that?\n\n17:48.340 --> 17:50.340\nLike the limit, that thing you went into?\n\n17:50.340 --> 17:53.340\nDo you worry that it's like law of attraction stuff?\n\n17:53.340 --> 17:55.340\nI'm on the rim.\n\n17:55.340 --> 17:57.340\nYeah, I mean, I'm sure...\n\n17:57.340 --> 18:00.340\nI believe that stuff like that is related.\n\n18:00.340 --> 18:04.340\nLike, you know, you get dark enough and the universe around you starts reflecting that\n\n18:04.340 --> 18:05.340\ndarkness.\n\n18:05.340 --> 18:06.340\nWhat do you think about?\n\n18:06.340 --> 18:07.340\nWhat do you think about?\n\n18:07.340 --> 18:08.340\nWhat do you think about?\n\n18:08.340 --> 18:09.340\nWhat do you think about?\n\n18:09.340 --> 18:10.340\nWhat do you think about?\n\n18:10.340 --> 18:11.340\nWhat do you think about?\n\n18:11.340 --> 18:12.340\nWhat do you think about?\n\n18:12.340 --> 18:13.340\nWhat do you think about?\n\n18:13.340 --> 18:14.340\nYeah, but I don't see the merit in...\n\n18:14.340 --> 18:15.340\nI mean, I'm trying...\n\n18:15.340 --> 18:18.340\nAnd it's just that I...it's just hard to...\n\n18:18.340 --> 18:24.340\nI don't want to...I don't want to disingenuously be happy, you know?\n\n18:24.340 --> 18:26.340\nI don't want to, like, force it.\n\n18:26.340 --> 18:30.340\nLike, you know, those people that say it takes less muscles to smile and you got to think\n\n18:30.340 --> 18:31.340\npositive stuff.\n\n18:31.340 --> 18:32.340\nIt's just like...\n\n18:32.340 --> 18:33.340\nI don't know.\n\n18:33.340 --> 18:35.340\nWhat I like to do is be happy.\n\n18:35.340 --> 18:38.340\nI had it out with my therapist Friday.\n\n18:38.340 --> 18:40.340\nLet her have it.\n\n18:40.340 --> 18:47.140\nAnd, you know, like, it was a pretty interesting session because it was pretty...you know,\n\n18:47.140 --> 18:54.060\nshe made it pretty clear, like, I do have an...I do have...you know, I...my big thing is shame.\n\n18:54.060 --> 19:00.140\nAnd the shame doesn't really let me...you know, it just sort of dominates everything.\n\n19:00.140 --> 19:01.140\nLike, I'm...\n\n19:01.140 --> 19:02.140\nThere's a lot of people.\n\n19:02.140 --> 19:03.140\nThat's a big thing.\n\n19:03.140 --> 19:08.300\nI got to try to...the next five years is going to be about replacing the shame with esteem.\n\n19:08.300 --> 19:11.980\nYou know, the...I just think Terrence McKinnon said, I always think about is that...because\n\n19:11.980 --> 19:15.380\nyou know, the happy idea, you're supposed to be happy, but that...like, Terrence McKinnon\n\n19:15.380 --> 19:20.780\nwas saying this thing about how...he was talking about something called shamanic ecstasy.\n\n19:20.780 --> 19:27.700\nAnd like, ecstatic states are not limited to happiness or joy states, but there's ecstatic\n\n19:27.700 --> 19:33.580\nsadness, ecstatic shame, ecstatic misery.\n\n19:33.580 --> 19:38.540\nAnd I really like that because it's not an invitation to, like, oh, just be happy.\n\n19:38.540 --> 19:44.220\nIt's more of an invitation to, like, fully be what you are right now as deep as you can\n\n19:44.220 --> 19:46.020\nbe, which is what you do.\n\n19:46.020 --> 19:54.380\nAnd even if that thing produces a wave of some kind of psychic repulsion that produces\n\n19:54.380 --> 19:59.420\ndark ripples that make the fire department shut down this beautiful fucking theater and\n\n19:59.420 --> 20:03.980\ntransforms everything into a reflection of the darkness, even that's kind of amazing\n\n20:03.980 --> 20:06.220\nbecause it's like, holy shit, magic's real.\n\n20:06.220 --> 20:10.860\nI was looking at it more like, the funny thing is, as much shame as I have, I didn't really\n\n20:10.860 --> 20:12.860\nthink to blame myself for the fire marshal.\n\n20:12.860 --> 20:16.780\nI was actually thinking the fire marshal was bailing me out, like, that that was God,\n\n20:16.780 --> 20:22.100\nlike, saving me, because I was really...because I was starting to hate the audience.\n\n20:22.100 --> 20:23.100\nAnd I mostly hate myself.\n\n20:23.100 --> 20:25.100\nI mean, you can't really hate an audience.\n\n20:25.100 --> 20:26.100\nAn audience is always...\n\n20:26.100 --> 20:29.340\nAre you afraid...are you afraid you're going to hate the audience again when they...\n\n20:29.340 --> 20:30.340\nNo, no, no.\n\n20:30.340 --> 20:31.980\nIt's like a rom-com, you know?\n\n20:31.980 --> 20:36.380\nWe broke up, we spent all this time apart, now I've got long hair.\n\n20:36.380 --> 20:37.660\nWhy'd you hate them?\n\n20:37.660 --> 20:41.780\nI hated...I just hated what we were all going through together, you know?\n\n20:41.780 --> 20:43.780\nSo it's just brought out the worst in all of us.\n\n20:43.780 --> 20:45.780\nYou know, I speak for myself.\n\n20:45.780 --> 20:50.020\nIt's just made me...I was just really sad and all this stuff, so it's like, I'm not\n\n20:50.020 --> 20:54.220\ngoing to have a good relationship with the audience.\n\n20:54.220 --> 21:01.540\nIt was just like, they're a giant crowd of people that react on certain cues, and like,\n\n21:01.540 --> 21:04.980\nthat was exactly...you know, it wasn't in the mood for that.\n\n21:04.980 --> 21:10.780\nWe were all feeling kind of like, really frightened about these concepts of like, crowd dynamics\n\n21:10.780 --> 21:15.820\nand stuff, like, how you...you know, what makes people go, ooh, or what makes people\n\n21:15.820 --> 21:21.980\ngo boo, or yay, or it just kind of...there was no good news to any of it.\n\n21:21.980 --> 21:26.820\nIt was like, I would come out on stage and I would...I don't ever think about it that\n\n21:26.820 --> 21:33.060\nmuch, but it was just like, my micro flowchart would be...if you slowed it down, would be\n\n21:33.060 --> 21:36.540\nsomething like, okay, so what am I supposed to do?\n\n21:36.540 --> 21:44.420\nIgnore how much peril is...I feel how much sadness, how much frustration, how much humiliation,\n\n21:44.420 --> 21:46.660\nhow much shame, how much rage.\n\n21:46.660 --> 21:52.940\nDo I ignore those things, and then become like a kind of...I don't know, like a Regis\n\n21:52.940 --> 21:54.460\nPhilbin character?\n\n21:54.460 --> 22:01.220\nDo I become like, you know, Sean King?\n\n22:01.220 --> 22:05.460\nDo I become like...do I become a voice of a generation?\n\n22:05.460 --> 22:08.900\nThat sounds like a lot of work, and not my generation.\n\n22:08.900 --> 22:14.420\nDo I actually have to...you know, it's like an experiment with signal boosting young activists\n\n22:14.420 --> 22:15.420\nand stuff.\n\n22:15.420 --> 22:21.060\nLike, okay, let's use this platform because it just doesn't feel right to sit around and\n\n22:21.060 --> 22:24.020\ntalk about how I don't want to tie my shoes anymore, you know?\n\n22:24.020 --> 22:30.020\nI was just thinking as you're doing this, like, you know, obviously Jonestown's pretty\n\n22:30.020 --> 22:34.740\nsad, but you know, it's kind of like there's like at least one little happy part of it,\n\n22:34.740 --> 22:40.940\nwhich is that Jim Jones killed himself, too, but think how fucked up it would have been\n\n22:40.940 --> 22:46.380\nif they walked in there and he's still talking, and there's all those fucking dead bodies\n\n22:46.380 --> 22:50.700\njust surrounding him, but he's giving a sermon to the dead bodies.\n\n22:50.700 --> 22:53.340\nDamn, that would have been amazing.\n\n22:53.340 --> 22:55.340\nHe just didn't have the guts.\n\n22:55.340 --> 23:00.460\nDo you watch this Wild Wild Country?\n\n23:00.460 --> 23:02.260\nYes, I did, yeah.\n\n23:02.260 --> 23:03.760\nYour opinion?\n\n23:03.760 --> 23:07.740\nI wish they'd...I thought it was beautiful, like the way they edited it and put it to...I\n\n23:07.740 --> 23:12.500\nthought it was beautiful, but I wish they'd focused more on Osho because I think that\n\n23:12.500 --> 23:17.140\nlike what I love about a good cult documentary is if they put in enough of the cult leader's\n\n23:17.140 --> 23:20.500\nphilosophy, then it makes me want to join.\n\n23:20.500 --> 23:21.500\nRight.\n\n23:21.500 --> 23:28.660\nBut not to be one of those...the people that responds this way to that, but I noticed the\n\n23:28.660 --> 23:31.340\nsame thing, but felt that that was the point.\n\n23:31.340 --> 23:36.060\nThen that was what made it really cool was that they actually just focused entirely on\n\n23:36.060 --> 23:42.340\nthe relationship between the cult and the townspeople to the point where if you were\n\n23:42.340 --> 23:47.980\nan alien, you wouldn't know what a cult was, and you spent the whole time going, like,\n\n23:47.980 --> 23:52.900\nwell, why aren't they a cult, these hillbillies that are like so smug and like have their...they\n\n23:52.900 --> 23:58.860\nkeep talking about how they have their own way of doing things, and you know, I loved\n\n23:58.860 --> 24:03.700\nhow you would like love them and hate them like, you know, like up and down and up and\n\n24:03.700 --> 24:11.580\nall around, and I think that they just very tastefully inserted like from the Rednecks\n\n24:11.580 --> 24:17.540\nperspective, like toward the beginning, like that movie that comes out that everyone gets\n\n24:17.540 --> 24:26.500\nto see, like their naked primal scream therapy or whatever, but it was like...didn't it feel\n\n24:26.500 --> 24:35.140\nkind of like if they had focused in on this guy who didn't talk for four years and stuff\n\n24:35.140 --> 24:40.300\nlike that religion was, that they would invite all of your...it would just put you in the\n\n24:40.300 --> 24:44.700\nshoes of the Redneck or the shoes of the Convert like you're saying.\n\n24:44.700 --> 24:48.020\nI mean, I keep thinking like, kind of what you're saying, like, I guess it must have\n\n24:48.020 --> 24:57.660\nbeen intentional, maybe they're showing like the thing that happens where the gatekeeper\n\n24:57.660 --> 25:02.340\nbecomes the destination sort of, they're showing like the gross thing, you know, like everyone\n\n25:02.340 --> 25:07.100\nfocuses on the Pope, you know, instead of...it's like everyone focuses on the representative\n\n25:07.100 --> 25:10.940\nof the thing instead of the thing itself, and maybe they wanted to make a point of doing\n\n25:10.940 --> 25:12.620\nthat without saying that's what they were doing.\n\n25:12.620 --> 25:17.980\nI mean, it was good in the sense that it elicits all of these thoughts and makes you wonder,\n\n25:17.980 --> 25:21.060\nbut maybe I'm just looking for a different documentary, but I could easily just do the\n\n25:21.060 --> 25:23.380\nresearch and read Osho stuff.\n\n25:23.380 --> 25:37.420\nYeah, and Cody was a lover of his quotes and stuff because he was a fun guy because\n\n25:37.420 --> 25:44.700\nhe had that look, but he would just talk very liberally about sex and stuff.\n\n25:44.700 --> 25:45.700\nRight.\n\n25:45.700 --> 25:52.460\nBut, yeah, I mean, I found myself to, I was like, wait, pump the brakes and let me get\n\n25:52.460 --> 25:53.980\nout and smell the roses here.\n\n25:53.980 --> 25:59.980\nThese people just started carrying assault rifles and dressing like the Joker and stuff\n\n25:59.980 --> 26:00.980\nlike that.\n\n26:00.980 --> 26:07.380\nAll these people with their ties and their clean cut beards and like...what is this\n\n26:07.380 --> 26:08.380\ncult?\n\n26:08.380 --> 26:13.340\nBut I think it was good that it was just like...I felt in the end, I was not like weeping at\n\n26:13.340 --> 26:17.820\nthe end because I felt like I had been thrust into the position of God.\n\n26:17.820 --> 26:26.100\nBy both these rednecks and these cultists, everybody had just swirled around in this\n\n26:26.100 --> 26:32.740\ntidy bowl of conflict and chasing each other and that the whole thing was just...it just\n\n26:32.740 --> 26:33.740\nstarted crying.\n\n26:33.740 --> 26:37.700\nI mean, thank God for that guy, the guy that kind of takes you through the whole thing,\n\n26:37.700 --> 26:38.700\nthe lawyer.\n\n26:38.700 --> 26:39.700\nYeah.\n\n26:39.700 --> 26:40.700\nAnd then he's just like walking with his cane.\n\n26:40.700 --> 26:43.060\nI just started like bawling my eyes out.\n\n26:43.060 --> 26:49.380\nI think he's just so...it was like he didn't do anything wrong that entire time.\n\n26:49.380 --> 26:59.900\nHe was a reliable narrator and he was neither a Sheila loyalist nor a trying to abscond\n\n26:59.900 --> 27:00.900\nwith Osho.\n\n27:00.900 --> 27:05.780\nI mean, he was just like...he represented that kind of like when you read Going Clear,\n\n27:05.780 --> 27:09.940\nlike those Scientologists that are just sort of like, look, I'm getting something out of\n\n27:09.940 --> 27:10.940\nthis.\n\n27:10.940 --> 27:14.620\nCan we stop with the drama?\n\n27:14.620 --> 27:20.220\nAnd that he was a sort of life master, he represented the best that that quote unquote\n\n27:20.220 --> 27:21.220\ncult could accomplish.\n\n27:21.220 --> 27:25.620\nI think that the reason for its existence was that it made you an effective, happy person\n\n27:25.620 --> 27:27.060\nthat drew people...\n\n27:27.060 --> 27:28.620\nIt still goes on, you know?\n\n27:28.620 --> 27:33.260\nYou didn't have to like leave capitalism behind, you didn't have to have all these extreme\n\n27:33.260 --> 27:37.900\nconversations about like, this world is bullshit, they just fucking built a city in the middle\n\n27:37.900 --> 27:38.900\nof nowhere.\n\n27:38.900 --> 27:44.380\nAnd then I guess what made me start crying was that you could do all that, you could\n\n27:44.380 --> 27:52.700\nride that wave without falling off the surfboard like he did and then it still just ends with\n\n27:52.700 --> 27:57.220\nyou with a gray beard like walking around, like you can't surf forever.\n\n27:57.220 --> 28:03.020\nYou can't...well, I mean, you gotta...it does happen, but it's for that thing to happen,\n\n28:03.020 --> 28:08.220\nit takes war, I mean historically, like if you look at it, it's like to get the big paradigm\n\n28:08.220 --> 28:11.060\nshift to happen in a serious way.\n\n28:11.060 --> 28:16.460\nYou know, you know, pulled it off the Mormons, like they were...there was conflict with them,\n\n28:16.460 --> 28:21.180\nthey fought them for a while, like when a thing like that, when a theocracy bubbles\n\n28:21.180 --> 28:27.060\nup or a new idea bubbles up, quite often it seems like the idea bubbles up inside of,\n\n28:27.060 --> 28:33.660\nit tries to kill it, especially if it's a contagious idea, they try to...if it's like\n\n28:33.660 --> 28:39.300\na threat to the dominant paradigm and it gets big enough, the helicopters show up, the cops\n\n28:39.300 --> 28:48.460\nshow up, the fire marshal shows up, yeah, there's a fantastic like closing thought at the end\n\n28:48.460 --> 28:57.580\nof that Going Clear book that just, yeah, sort of without bothering to categorize Scientology\n\n28:57.580 --> 29:06.340\nas either a good thing or a bad thing, just talking about the history of upstart religion\n\n29:06.340 --> 29:14.860\nin the United States and how, yeah, it's...we want to look at all of these things and go,\n\n29:14.860 --> 29:22.500\nthey either need to live or die, but we coexist with things like Mormonism or Jehovah's Witness\n\n29:22.500 --> 29:30.380\nre, whatever you call it, in its noun form, the...but it's like, yeah, these little things,\n\n29:30.380 --> 29:35.420\nthey're not called cults anymore, you could call Mormonism a cult if you wanted to, but\n\n29:35.420 --> 29:40.780\nwe don't anymore because we, yeah, we went to, like you said, we jumped them in.\n\n29:40.780 --> 29:45.420\nWhat's up with the Pope now? The Pope's saying that hell doesn't exist?\n\n29:45.420 --> 29:50.660\nExcuse me, can I make a bunch of fucking chair sounds now that you're talking? The fuck were\n\n29:50.660 --> 29:53.620\nyou doing over here? Trying to make a goddamn point?\n\n29:53.620 --> 29:57.180\nYou were talking for a while, I felt like I was supposed to get cocked at the ball.\n\n29:57.180 --> 30:00.060\nAre you making a bookcase? What the fuck is going on?\n\n30:00.060 --> 30:06.140\nI'm trying to relax here, you're talking forever, you're not even turning or including me, you're\n\n30:06.140 --> 30:11.140\nall in love with Duncan again, you don't even look at me. What do you mean again? You fell\n\n30:11.140 --> 30:13.540\nout of love with me? I'm trying to get comfortable.\n\n30:13.540 --> 30:15.900\nWait, you fell out of love with me? No.\n\n30:15.900 --> 30:20.540\nYou fell out of love with me? Meekie the bookcase.\n\n30:20.540 --> 30:23.540\nDan, you noticed those, I didn't notice those chair sounds.\n\n30:23.540 --> 30:25.540\nOh no. I didn't either.\n\n30:25.540 --> 30:27.540\nYeah, I did. Oh, you did?\n\n30:27.540 --> 30:32.060\nYeah, I know what you were doing, you're like on the fucking vowels of my words, like you're\n\n30:32.060 --> 30:36.260\njust, you're like a monkey, you're a naughty monkey.\n\n30:36.260 --> 30:40.260\nWell, don't invite me anymore and you'll be the happiest person in the world.\n\n30:40.260 --> 30:45.460\nPlease, please do the show, Spencer's not going to be here tonight, David says it's\n\n30:45.460 --> 30:50.860\ngoing to be, would you please, please, everybody loves you, come on, please.\n\n30:50.860 --> 30:53.460\nThat conversation never happened, he's making this up.\n\n30:53.460 --> 30:58.260\nI didn't know, I walked to the door, I found out Spencer wasn't here, Jeff wasn't here.\n\n30:58.260 --> 31:04.060\nDan, Dan, I'm just going to read the text you sent me. This is a text from Dan, please,\n\n31:04.060 --> 31:09.060\nplease, please, please, please, will you please, pretty please, please do the show, Spencer\n\n31:09.060 --> 31:15.460\nisn't going to be here, will you please, please, please, please, please, please, come on, come\n\n31:15.460 --> 31:20.860\non, come on, please, please, everyone loves you, please, please, come on.\n\n31:20.860 --> 31:25.260\nYou guys look, it's MC gun control. What's this?\n\n31:25.260 --> 31:33.660\nYo, yo, it's me, MC gun control. I'm a repeat character.\n\n31:33.660 --> 31:36.660\nWell now you are, this is the second time you showed up.\n\n31:36.660 --> 31:41.860\nGive me a beat. I'm going to rap about gun control.\n\n31:41.860 --> 31:57.060\nNow gun control, MC gun control, guns, awareness of guns, gun control, awareness, a lot of\n\n31:57.060 --> 32:06.460\nlethal weapons in the world. The AR-15 can kill 30 people per second.\n\n32:06.460 --> 32:15.060\nIt's a very, very expensive military grade weapon. I'm MC gun control.\n\n32:20.060 --> 32:22.060\nAlright, okay, cut it.\n\n32:22.060 --> 32:25.660\nSo anyway, what, the Pope says that hell doesn't exist?\n\n32:25.660 --> 32:31.060\nI think it's weird because like the Pope said hell doesn't exist and then-\n\n32:31.060 --> 32:32.260\nSo I heard right.\n\n32:32.260 --> 32:36.660\nDidn't he, no, but it was like a misquote or something.\n\n32:36.660 --> 32:38.260\nHe's walking it back.\n\n32:38.260 --> 32:42.660\nHe tried to walk it back. I don't know though because it's one of those things that's like\n\n32:42.660 --> 32:47.060\na thing that pops up on the Drudge Report. That's the thing that gets hit.\n\n32:47.060 --> 32:52.460\nSo I don't know if he, I think it was either a misquote or like it was taken out of context\n\n32:52.460 --> 32:53.460\nor something.\n\n32:53.460 --> 33:02.260\nBut the thing is, eventually they will say that, right? Because-\n\n33:02.260 --> 33:04.260\nThe Drudge Report?\n\n33:04.260 --> 33:05.460\nNo, because for-\n\n33:05.460 --> 33:06.260\nWon't even look.\n\n33:06.260 --> 33:08.260\nWon't even look at me.\n\n33:08.260 --> 33:13.660\nFor hundreds of years, they were like holding the line and like whether the sun went around\n\n33:13.660 --> 33:15.260\nthe earth or not.\n\n33:15.260 --> 33:19.860\nWell, I think the important question for us all to ask is does hell exist?\n\n33:19.860 --> 33:22.260\nOkay, let's break it down. Okay.\n\n33:22.260 --> 33:26.260\nAll right, so, no.\n\n33:26.260 --> 33:27.260\nHow do you know?\n\n33:27.260 --> 33:29.860\nI guess I don't.\n\n33:29.860 --> 33:30.860\nI mean, it gets-\n\n33:30.860 --> 33:31.860\nI don't have any proof.\n\n33:31.860 --> 33:32.860\nHow about that?\n\n33:32.860 --> 33:37.660\nWell, I mean, like, it's, I mean, their version of hell might not exist, but one of the creepy\n\n33:37.660 --> 33:41.260\nthings about black holes, you know, we don't know what the fuck's going on in there.\n\n33:41.260 --> 33:42.260\nYeah.\n\n33:42.260 --> 33:44.260\nAnd like, those things are sucking in galaxies.\n\n33:44.260 --> 33:45.260\nYeah.\n\n33:45.260 --> 33:51.060\nAnd those galaxies, what, if there is a soul, does your soul leave the galaxy or does it\n\n33:51.060 --> 33:52.660\nfloat around the galaxy?\n\n33:52.660 --> 33:54.260\nOr does it go to multiple galaxies?\n\n33:54.260 --> 33:56.660\nCould a soul get sucked into a black hole?\n\n33:56.660 --> 34:02.060\nMy point is, like, is there some point of, like, maximum soul compression where you\n\n34:02.060 --> 34:06.460\nwould be sentient but eternally in some infinite blackness?\n\n34:06.460 --> 34:11.860\nI think it's, I think, because your soul doesn't have a mass, it doesn't, it's not\n\n34:11.860 --> 34:16.460\naccountable to the laws of speed of light and time.\n\n34:16.460 --> 34:20.760\nSo, your soul, if there is such a thing, if you can, if you're conscious, this is a\n\n34:20.760 --> 34:28.180\nfield that exists independently of your, your organ that kind of is representing it corporeally,\n\n34:28.180 --> 34:35.060\nthen upon death, it's possible that your soul will experience infinity, because time stops,\n\n34:35.060 --> 34:41.620\nit stops being in time, and then it's possible that that's not, like, a fun thing for a soul,\n\n34:41.620 --> 34:46.340\nthat that's, like, being locked in a box, because that's why the universe started is\n\n34:46.340 --> 34:53.140\nbecause God, which was all of us and everything, was, like, locked in nothingness at no time\n\n34:53.140 --> 34:56.780\nand was, like, I gotta get out of here, which is what you do when you're a kid and your\n\n34:56.780 --> 35:00.420\nbrother puts you in a cupboard, like, you experience the same panic, whereas a rabbit\n\n35:00.420 --> 35:04.300\nwould just hang out, it would just go, I guess I'm locked in a cabinet, but sentience makes\n\n35:04.300 --> 35:10.420\nyou claustrophobic, because you go, I can't just be nothing, and you freak the fuck out,\n\n35:10.420 --> 35:14.660\nand then, and you start thinking about everything, and then, and then you're, like, get me out\n\n35:14.660 --> 35:20.500\nof here, and you throw a tantrum, and that's your piece of the Big Bang, which means possibly\n\n35:20.500 --> 35:27.620\nwhen you die, hell, may be the only thing that happens, which is simply you returning\n\n35:27.620 --> 35:35.100\nto the state of the universe before it existed, and, but with that one little thing of you,\n\n35:35.100 --> 35:37.500\nyou want to be, but you can't.\n\n35:37.500 --> 35:40.020\nOsho, that's directly quoted from Osho.\n\n35:40.020 --> 35:41.020\nReally?\n\n35:41.020 --> 35:45.220\nSee, that's, that's, that's part of it, and then the other part of it is, hell certainly\n\n35:45.220 --> 35:49.940\nexists on planet earth, I mean, people become their own black holes, and they get so compressed\n\n35:49.940 --> 35:57.460\ninto themselves that every breath is a, is a, is a living hell, so, so you end up in a,\n\n35:57.460 --> 36:03.060\nso that happens too, so when the pope says hell doesn't exist, it's like one of, it's\n\n36:03.060 --> 36:07.740\nlike a time when I think I kind of disagreed with the pope, I mean, maybe if you meant it,\n\n36:07.740 --> 36:13.180\nit's like, well, you must mean like the fire pit thing, probably, but certainly like what\n\n36:13.180 --> 36:16.660\nyou would, people suffer so deeply on this planet.\n\n36:16.660 --> 36:17.660\nRight.\n\n36:17.660 --> 36:22.020\nIt'd be cool if he announced, he said, sorry, I meant hell doesn't exist underneath the\n\n36:22.020 --> 36:29.020\nearth when you die, I meant hell exists on earth, and I know where it is, and we have\n\n36:29.020 --> 36:35.300\nto go fight them, and then he like, let us, and the, and the, and the fucking Lord of\n\n36:35.300 --> 36:39.900\nthe Rings score started, and we're just like, that'd be so cool, it'd be cool to be part\n\n36:39.900 --> 36:45.660\nof just a, a war on hell, do you not happy we'd be air strikes against hell, it would\n\n36:45.660 --> 36:48.940\nbe cool right up until the fighting part, like it would be fun just walking there,\n\n36:48.940 --> 36:52.900\nright, like you'd be walking probably, because the worst case scenario is you'd get tired\n\n36:52.900 --> 36:58.620\nand be left behind, big deal, like, whoops, because I won't make that war war headed to,\n\n36:58.620 --> 37:01.620\nbut in the meantime, you'd feel like a, you know, I always wanted to be like a migrant\n\n37:01.620 --> 37:05.300\nbird, like you'd just like, you'd have that togetherness, you'd be part of a big caravan,\n\n37:05.300 --> 37:06.300\nhey where are you guys going?\n\n37:06.300 --> 37:11.660\nWe're walking to hell, and we're gonna fight all the bookings, and, and then, and then\n\n37:11.660 --> 37:14.660\nyou just walk and you got your knapsack, and your marshmallows, and your sword.\n\n37:14.660 --> 37:19.300\nYou wanted to be a, a migrant bird?\n\n37:19.300 --> 37:23.860\nLike, dare to dream, man.\n\n37:23.860 --> 37:28.420\nI wanted to be a firefighter, a migrant bird.\n\n37:28.420 --> 37:29.820\nWell, it's cool.\n\n37:29.820 --> 37:33.540\nDanny, what are you going to be when you grow up?\n\n37:33.540 --> 37:36.100\nI would like to be a migrant bird.\n\n37:36.100 --> 37:41.460\nI mean, it's like, yeah, not a migrating bird, but like, the, the, oh, not, yeah, like a,\n\n37:41.460 --> 37:47.820\nlike an illegal, like a migrant bird, yeah, a bird that's like, doesn't have its visa.\n\n37:47.820 --> 37:54.900\nA bird, a bird that they make, pick up other birds eggs, because it, the economy of its\n\n37:54.900 --> 37:57.260\nown bird country is fucked up.\n\n37:57.260 --> 38:01.540\nCan you imagine if Trump went that nuts, that he started trying to keep Mexican birds\n\n38:01.540 --> 38:04.180\nout of the United States?\n\n38:04.180 --> 38:05.180\nThat'd be incredible.\n\n38:05.180 --> 38:10.220\nWe got, but yeah, I mean, like that's, that's a, always, you know, when this, we, we bomb\n\n38:10.220 --> 38:14.140\npeople and it's all so confusing, and ultimately sad, you just take like, man, it would be\n\n38:14.140 --> 38:18.700\nso nice if, if we had something, something real to fight, like we've got all these great\n\n38:18.700 --> 38:24.220\nweapons and, and nothing's black, black or white, and it's always so confusing.\n\n38:24.220 --> 38:26.860\nHow glorious would it be, man?\n\n38:26.860 --> 38:31.060\nJust if Trump came out and he's like, we have found the gateway to hell.\n\n38:31.060 --> 38:32.820\nHere's the videotape of it.\n\n38:32.820 --> 38:33.820\nLook, here.\n\n38:33.820 --> 38:41.700\nAnd Tim peeing on a prostitute's mattress, that's why the p-tape, the thing is all screwed\n\n38:41.700 --> 38:42.700\nup.\n\n38:42.700 --> 38:43.700\nYou didn't get the facts right.\n\n38:43.700 --> 38:44.700\nHe's like, there's no p-tape for the longest time.\n\n38:44.700 --> 38:48.500\nAnd then he's like, look, do you, did you ever think, finally they got the p-tape and\n\n38:48.500 --> 38:53.860\nhe's like, listen, don't, I'm telling you, while I was making those hookers pee, a gate\n\n38:53.860 --> 38:54.860\nto hell opened.\n\n38:54.860 --> 38:56.220\nIt was part of a ritual.\n\n38:56.220 --> 38:57.300\nThat's why I didn't want you to see it.\n\n38:57.300 --> 38:59.940\nI'm proud of making people pee on the Obama's bed.\n\n38:59.940 --> 39:02.940\nAs most of you suspected, that's not a deal breaker for me.\n\n39:02.940 --> 39:04.780\nI'm a Nazi and a rapist.\n\n39:04.780 --> 39:06.540\nI don't care what you think of me.\n\n39:06.540 --> 39:09.820\nI do care if hell overtakes the earth.\n\n39:09.820 --> 39:14.140\nAnd on that p-tape is the gateway to hell.\n\n39:14.140 --> 39:18.740\nAnd then, and then Rachel Maddow's like, nice try clown.\n\n39:18.740 --> 39:19.900\nAnd then she presses play.\n\n39:19.900 --> 39:25.460\nAnd then it's like, but it's like fun because it's like, yeah, there's like, there's like\n\n39:25.460 --> 39:33.220\nbad guys that are just like, made of shit and they got horns and, you know, and they're\n\n39:33.220 --> 39:39.740\nlike, and then, and then like, you could, you could fight them like with your friends.\n\n39:39.740 --> 39:42.060\nYou could fight them as part of the army.\n\n39:42.060 --> 39:44.020\nLike, what are you doing, man?\n\n39:44.020 --> 39:45.780\nWe shoot people are down the street.\n\n39:45.780 --> 39:46.780\nCome over.\n\n39:46.780 --> 39:47.780\nThey, they have horns.\n\n39:47.780 --> 39:50.780\nYou could choose if you wanted to be like a guerrilla fighter, like street to street\n\n39:50.780 --> 39:54.420\nor just like hang out with your friends and like, like, because it's like, it's just,\n\n39:54.420 --> 39:56.020\nit's just reality versus hell.\n\n39:56.020 --> 40:02.940\nSo it's like not, yeah, there's an army version, but it's for people who, who enjoy that kind\n\n40:02.940 --> 40:03.940\nof thing.\n\n40:03.940 --> 40:09.180\nWell, that's, that's one of the satanic aspects of war, isn't it, is that it's like, it takes\n\n40:09.180 --> 40:15.340\nexactly what people want to do, which is to build stuff together and like, and blow things\n\n40:15.340 --> 40:21.020\nup and set things on fire and have fun together and like, and survive together.\n\n40:21.020 --> 40:27.500\nAnd then it takes that thing and transforms it into like a bond, like nothing is more\n\n40:27.500 --> 40:32.020\nbonding than being like going out in a stressful situation with your pals.\n\n40:32.020 --> 40:33.020\nPeople want to have a mission.\n\n40:33.020 --> 40:34.020\nThey like going camping.\n\n40:34.020 --> 40:35.020\nThey like building things.\n\n40:35.020 --> 40:36.020\nYeah.\n\n40:36.020 --> 40:37.020\nI don't.\n\n40:37.020 --> 40:38.020\nYou don't like camping?\n\n40:38.020 --> 40:40.020\nAsk me again.\n\n40:40.020 --> 40:41.020\nDo you like camping?\n\n40:41.020 --> 40:42.020\nNo.\n\n40:42.020 --> 40:43.020\nYou went on a bad camping trip.\n\n40:43.020 --> 40:44.020\nWhat?\n\n40:44.020 --> 40:45.020\nYou just went on a few bad camping trips.\n\n40:45.020 --> 40:46.020\nAll of them.\n\n40:46.020 --> 40:47.020\nI don't.\n\n40:47.020 --> 40:48.020\nWhy would I?\n\n40:48.020 --> 40:49.020\nHow many camping trips have you gone on?\n\n40:49.020 --> 40:51.020\nI don't remember because I tried to black them out.\n\n40:51.020 --> 40:52.020\nCome on.\n\n40:52.020 --> 40:53.020\nYou can remember.\n\n40:53.020 --> 40:54.020\nThat's ridiculous.\n\n40:54.020 --> 40:55.020\nHow many camping trips?\n\n40:55.020 --> 40:56.020\nYou can't, you got to think back.\n\n40:56.020 --> 40:58.020\nLike you, with it under 10 or over 10?\n\n40:58.020 --> 40:59.020\nUnder 10.\n\n40:59.020 --> 41:00.020\nSee, you went on some bad trips.\n\n41:00.020 --> 41:01.020\nYeah.\n\n41:01.020 --> 41:03.020\nAnd they were all with your parents and you were 10 and you were.\n\n41:03.020 --> 41:04.020\nAll right.\n\n41:04.020 --> 41:05.860\nLet's go on a camping trip.\n\n41:05.860 --> 41:06.860\nThat would be fun.\n\n41:06.860 --> 41:09.820\nThat's the next version of Harmontown.\n\n41:09.820 --> 41:12.020\nDeep in the fucking forest.\n\n41:12.020 --> 41:14.020\nJust Dan and me.\n\n41:14.020 --> 41:15.020\nHunting.\n\n41:15.020 --> 41:16.020\nNo hunting.\n\n41:16.020 --> 41:17.020\nI don't hunt.\n\n41:17.020 --> 41:22.020\nThe irony, we should dress the set as a camping site in a sitcom.\n\n41:22.020 --> 41:24.020\nAnd then we try to have a campfire.\n\n41:24.020 --> 41:28.020\nAnd then the ultimate irony is because the fire marshal shut us down, the whole fucking\n\n41:28.020 --> 41:31.020\nstage goes up in flames.\n\n41:31.020 --> 41:35.020\nDo you think there would be at least a couple of happy firemen?\n\n41:35.020 --> 41:38.020\nThere would be a sense of, I told you.\n\n41:38.020 --> 41:43.020\nAs they're dragging your charred corpse out, they're like, we tried to save you.\n\n41:43.020 --> 41:47.020\nBut they saved us from the audience, the audience didn't start us on fire.\n\n41:47.020 --> 41:51.020\nI mean, really, if you knew that you were in a simulator, you're going to live forever,\n\n41:51.020 --> 41:55.020\nyou get to repeat everything, wouldn't in one of those versions the last Harmontown\n\n41:55.020 --> 41:57.020\nbe you self-emolating?\n\n41:57.020 --> 42:00.020\nI don't know.\n\n42:00.020 --> 42:03.020\nI think it would have to be at least one.\n\n42:03.020 --> 42:04.020\nOh, God.\n\n42:04.020 --> 42:06.020\nI mean, that would just be incredible.\n\n42:06.020 --> 42:07.020\nThat could save the world.\n\n42:07.020 --> 42:15.020\nI'd have to have massive guarantees about that not being the end.\n\n42:15.020 --> 42:19.020\nAnd also, ouch, regardless.\n\n42:19.020 --> 42:20.020\nWell, I mean, there's morphine.\n\n42:20.020 --> 42:23.020\nThere's ways we could prop your body up, make it seem like you're awake.\n\n42:23.020 --> 42:25.020\nTrue.\n\n42:25.020 --> 42:27.020\nUse some kind of scarce crow.\n\n42:27.020 --> 42:29.020\nYou run a studio, man.\n\n42:29.020 --> 42:31.020\nThere's got to be a way to get the props to hold you up.\n\n42:31.020 --> 42:33.020\nGet Tycho to animate that.\n\n42:33.020 --> 42:36.020\nGet Tycho to animate that.\n\n42:36.020 --> 42:40.020\nYou animate the flames on you with Tycho.\n\n42:40.020 --> 42:42.020\nYou can do it.\n\n42:42.020 --> 42:44.020\nHim and Bubbles.\n\n42:44.020 --> 42:46.020\nAnd Tycho's animating Bubbles.\n\n42:46.020 --> 42:50.020\nHe can animate you emulating yourself.\n\n42:50.020 --> 42:52.020\nI don't know, man.\n\n42:52.020 --> 42:54.020\nI mean, I'm not suggesting self-emolation.\n\n42:54.020 --> 43:02.020\nBut if you think in terms of badass ends of podcasts or series, that would be really smart.\n\n43:02.020 --> 43:04.020\nThat'll spread all around the world.\n\n43:04.020 --> 43:09.020\nYou know what would be cool is that in the comment section underneath the YouTube video,\n\n43:09.020 --> 43:15.020\nyou'd be five comments in before someone commented,\n\n43:15.020 --> 43:20.020\nlooks like we need to legislate fire control.\n\n43:20.020 --> 43:24.020\nAnd then the whole thing would just turn into people arguing about guns.\n\n43:24.020 --> 43:28.020\nUnder my fucking burning death on YouTube.\n\n43:28.020 --> 43:34.020\nEvery YouTube video was like, oh, it's a girl that balance a spoon on her nose.\n\n43:34.020 --> 43:41.020\nAnd then five comments down, somebody goes, hmm, maybe that spoon should be given to Syria.\n\n43:41.020 --> 43:46.020\nAnd then everyone just like, what are comment sections for anyways?\n\n43:46.020 --> 43:49.020\nNo, that's one of the things people are worried about with AIs.\n\n43:49.020 --> 43:51.020\nIt's just going to eternally destroy.\n\n43:51.020 --> 43:53.020\nThey're going to get rid of the comment sections.\n\n43:53.020 --> 43:56.020\nIt's going to embed itself into all comment sections.\n\n43:56.020 --> 43:59.020\nIt's going to be able to comment on the section.\n\n43:59.020 --> 44:06.020\nIt'll just always just be like some kind of chaos running through that dialogue forever.\n\n44:06.020 --> 44:10.020\nWell, I don't know, man.\n\n44:10.020 --> 44:12.020\nIt's really, really interesting.\n\n44:12.020 --> 44:13.020\nI like it.\n\n44:13.020 --> 44:14.020\nI like the experiment you're doing.\n\n44:14.020 --> 44:15.020\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n44:15.020 --> 44:17.020\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n44:17.020 --> 44:18.020\nYeah, we tried different stuff.\n\n44:18.020 --> 44:22.020\nWe tried to do it like Howard Stern style in the VO booth.\n\n44:22.020 --> 44:27.020\nI was like, eh, you know, I could do any podcast like that.\n\n44:27.020 --> 44:29.020\nAnd I was like, all right, well, let's go back on the stage.\n\n44:29.020 --> 44:30.020\nWe just have nobody there.\n\n44:30.020 --> 44:32.020\nLet's get it's ups and downs.\n\n44:32.020 --> 44:37.020\nWell, it's like, it's like, I guess one thing I don't know that anyone, I'm just trying to think of a\n\n44:37.020 --> 44:43.020\nlate night show or a show in this format with no audience where it's just this.\n\n44:43.020 --> 44:46.020\nI'd have to go back to the Alan Havy show late night.\n\n44:46.020 --> 44:47.020\nYeah, basic cable.\n\n44:47.020 --> 44:48.020\nThat's what it was.\n\n44:48.020 --> 44:53.020\nYeah, Nick Bacchai is Andy Richter and it was kind of like quiet.\n\n44:53.020 --> 44:55.020\nWasn't there an audience of one or something?\n\n44:55.020 --> 45:00.020\nYeah, I think there was like, I mean, you can always like hear a couple people chuckling here and there.\n\n45:00.020 --> 45:06.020\nIt reminds me of like local TV or Joe Bob Briggs like monster vision where it just, it was obvious.\n\n45:06.020 --> 45:11.020\nIt was just one guy in a studio like this with maybe three people.\n\n45:11.020 --> 45:12.020\nYeah.\n\n45:12.020 --> 45:14.020\nLaughing behind the camera.\n\n45:14.020 --> 45:23.020\nThere's a guy tweeted at me and he was like, and it's like several tweets chained together and he's like, I, I know you, I know you\n\n45:23.020 --> 45:33.020\nthink it's easier to, I can't remember what his presuppositions were, but he was like, like, I urge you to listen to the early episodes.\n\n45:33.020 --> 45:35.020\nI think you'll find that they're better.\n\n45:35.020 --> 45:42.020\nLike he was like really like breaking it to me that the podcast is worse when there's no fucking audience.\n\n45:42.020 --> 45:47.020\nSo it's like, like responding to him going like, what is your point?\n\n45:47.020 --> 45:49.020\nLike, what do you think is at stake here?\n\n45:49.020 --> 45:50.020\nI don't understand.\n\n45:50.020 --> 45:53.020\nWell, I don't, I think he's probably saying like, it's not that the podcast is worse.\n\n45:53.020 --> 46:02.020\nIt's like, if you do a format that's generally made for an audience minus the audience, it produces and then you add to it.\n\n46:02.020 --> 46:10.020\nNo, I didn't know this guy was, I can guarantee you this guy was basically, he was like, he wanted the audience back and thought that\n\n46:10.020 --> 46:14.020\neven though he said he'd just finished listening to all of the episodes.\n\n46:14.020 --> 46:20.020\nSo I don't know how you get through that without the information that this isn't really a choice.\n\n46:20.020 --> 46:30.020\nLike so, to like weigh in and go, I don't know, it's kind of like you're out in the middle of nowhere and like your, your truck has got one tire in the ditch\n\n46:30.020 --> 46:33.020\nand people are like trying to get a piece of wood under the tire.\n\n46:33.020 --> 46:40.020\nBut then some other people are like, well, maybe if we sing and dance, like, who says, who says this wasn't our destination?\n\n46:40.020 --> 46:49.020\nAnd like, as long as the truck's not working and all this stuff is just to have, have one guy there going like, you know, I think if you really think about it,\n\n46:49.020 --> 46:55.020\npound for pound, what we're going through right now is actually worse than, than what, what was happening yesterday.\n\n46:55.020 --> 46:56.020\nRight.\n\n46:56.020 --> 46:57.020\nI was like, thanks, Miles.\n\n46:57.020 --> 46:58.020\nNo shit, right?\n\n46:58.020 --> 46:59.020\nNo shit, man.\n\n46:59.020 --> 47:01.020\nHis name was Miles?\n\n47:01.020 --> 47:03.020\nHe was to me.\n\n47:03.020 --> 47:07.020\nThat's a great name for somebody commenting on a truck that stopped.\n\n47:07.020 --> 47:09.020\nMiles to go.\n\n47:09.020 --> 47:11.020\nMiles Togo.\n\n47:11.020 --> 47:12.020\nMiles to go.\n\n47:12.020 --> 47:13.020\nTogo.\n\n47:13.020 --> 47:16.020\nBut yeah, we will soon be back in front of an audience.\n\n47:16.020 --> 47:25.020\nBut then, you know, be careful what you wish for, because I think, you know, there's going to come a point, you know, that's, that's going to be like a return threshold.\n\n47:25.020 --> 47:31.020\nAnd then, you know, those are, that's how stories end.\n\n47:31.020 --> 47:36.020\nWe just go, okay, we did it, we did this, then we did that, then we did this, then we did it like this.\n\n47:36.020 --> 47:37.020\nYay.\n\n47:37.020 --> 47:41.020\nAnd it's going to be like 45, like, what?\n\n47:41.020 --> 47:45.020\nWhat do we, what do we, what do we, what do we, you're 45?\n\n47:45.020 --> 47:46.020\nYeah.\n\n47:46.020 --> 48:06.020\nI'm saying like, there may come a day when, when the appropriate thing for me to do for my own happiness and to, and to evolve is actually has not only nothing to do with a public life, but also, in fact, maybe actually be counter to a public life.\n\n48:06.020 --> 48:07.020\nYou know what I mean?\n\n48:07.020 --> 48:10.020\nLike, do you think you're resisting something?\n\n48:10.020 --> 48:12.020\nDo you feel resistant?\n\n48:12.020 --> 48:18.020\nUh, in what, what, uh, can you get more specific?\n\n48:18.020 --> 48:33.020\nJust like, you know, like when you're in a situation and you, and you realize you don't want to be in that situation, it could be in, you know, in general, like, do you, do you think you're, you're, you find yourself feeling like resisting what's happening more, more often than not?\n\n48:33.020 --> 48:57.020\nI, I, I find myself trying to, trying to find my bliss in situations that by definition, and that's a very appropriate phrase by definition, because everything by definition, like, kind of excludes, it starts to run counter to bliss following.\n\n48:57.020 --> 49:02.020\nSo, so like, let's, so you do something fun and then you say, let's do something fun every week.\n\n49:02.020 --> 49:03.020\nYeah.\n\n49:03.020 --> 49:06.020\nAnd then you can, you gotta strike that balance.\n\n49:06.020 --> 49:07.020\nYou just do.\n\n49:07.020 --> 49:08.020\nEverybody does.\n\n49:08.020 --> 49:10.020\nLike, like, okay, we're going to have a book club.\n\n49:10.020 --> 49:11.020\nWe're going to get together every Wednesday.\n\n49:11.020 --> 49:26.020\nAnd, you know, a big boy understands that sometimes if you're getting together every single Wednesday for your book club, yeah, there's going to be some Wednesdays when you're not the one who's so stoked about showing up on Wednesday.\n\n49:26.020 --> 49:33.020\nYeah, you're kind of an asshole if you show up, therefore, on Wednesday with this, like, kill the book club vibe.\n\n49:33.020 --> 49:34.020\nRight.\n\n49:34.020 --> 49:44.020\nBecause for all you know, everybody else, on that particular Wednesday, is like, kind of in a good mood and like, like, like, actually the book club is there to carry them, you know?\n\n49:44.020 --> 49:45.020\nYeah.\n\n49:45.020 --> 49:49.020\nAnd it's, it's, this is, it's the nature of things.\n\n49:49.020 --> 49:53.020\nYou start, you schedule them, you make them regular, you decide to do them.\n\n49:53.020 --> 50:09.020\nYou, you, you, and, and there's always going to be this, like, struggle to balance the, uh, let's, let's always do this with, oh, and by the way, let's always do whatever the fuck we feel like doing.\n\n50:09.020 --> 50:17.020\nI mean, I, that, that thing that you are doing with this thing has always blown me away because it is the regularity of it, the complexity of it.\n\n50:17.020 --> 50:23.020\nThe, the getting, getting here, even now doing it like this is, it's insane.\n\n50:23.020 --> 50:35.020\nLike when I do my podcast, I go into my studio, I get high, I've got synthesizers and I just putter around in there until something like happens that I like and it's, it's very private.\n\n50:35.020 --> 50:41.020\nLike they were telling me that you were, you felt good that you were able to do this minus an audience.\n\n50:41.020 --> 50:47.020\nAnd I was thinking like, holy shit, man, I mean, like doing it with an audience is madness.\n\n50:47.020 --> 50:48.020\nIt's madness.\n\n50:48.020 --> 50:52.020\nIt's such a, when I go on tour with my podcast, that's like a, it's heavy for me.\n\n50:52.020 --> 51:10.020\nLike that's a, it's a huge, it feels like big and like any kind of time I do a live show, it feels like really just very intense and less like what it is when I record it, which is just a day of just allowing whatever happens app to happen.\n\n51:10.020 --> 51:15.020\nSo it's, I don't, I mean, I could understand you feeling starting to really feel weird about what you've been doing.\n\n51:15.020 --> 51:16.020\nIt makes sense to me.\n\n51:16.020 --> 51:20.020\nI hope I don't seem like I'm judging the way that you're feeling because I get it, man.\n\n51:20.020 --> 51:21.020\nIt's just, I get it.\n\n51:21.020 --> 51:29.020\nI think it's, it's just very hyper pressurized what you've been doing, a weekly live show in front of a really smart audience.\n\n51:29.020 --> 51:32.020\nSome of whom are really fucking mean.\n\n51:32.020 --> 51:48.020\nThe challenge is to, yeah, is to, it's a high pressure thing to decide that you're going to do something every week and then the, and then the fun worthwhile pressure is, or the fun worthwhile activity is.\n\n51:48.020 --> 51:50.020\nIt was once squeak.\n\n51:50.020 --> 51:51.020\nI moved.\n\n51:51.020 --> 51:52.020\nI can't move.\n\n51:52.020 --> 51:53.020\nI think that was an accident.\n\n51:53.020 --> 51:59.020\nIt was, it was, it was, I moved, my foot was falling asleep and I put it on the floor.\n\n51:59.020 --> 52:03.020\nThe fun worthwhile activity is trying to figure out how to take something that you've, you've determined you guys.\n\n52:03.020 --> 52:05.020\nHe looked at me like I spit in his drink.\n\n52:05.020 --> 52:17.020\nAnd then also, like, like, continue to be like, okay, well then, on top of that, then how is it always different and challenging and fun or whatever, whatever that word is, chaotic or something, you know?\n\n52:17.020 --> 52:36.020\nLike, it, I think that, I think that a nice death that's occurred with this venue is the death of my idea that it was going to ever grow into a, into any, into something that had more structure, you know?\n\n52:36.020 --> 52:48.020\nI thought, like, maybe that would grow, like, like you put up a trellis and then, like, a crazy, chaotic thing that just grows by nature uses the trellis.\n\n52:48.020 --> 52:58.020\nSo the combination of the, of the out of the moment, like backbreaking carpentry, plus the, it's okay that thing, everything's just going to grow over this.\n\n52:58.020 --> 53:03.020\nThat's, that's my fantasy of doing things, you know, that aren't for money.\n\n53:03.020 --> 53:07.020\nLike, you go like, oh, wow, it's cool that we grew that thing into this thing.\n\n53:07.020 --> 53:16.020\nChannel 101, like, grew into this thing and like, it wasn't, it was neither based on us not giving a shit, nor was it based on us giving too much of a shit.\n\n53:16.020 --> 53:21.020\nIt was just sort of like, just grew.\n\n53:21.020 --> 53:24.020\nWell, this thing's still growing, just not growing what you thought it would.\n\n53:24.020 --> 53:27.020\nYeah, exactly. I think that's an important part of its growth.\n\n53:27.020 --> 53:34.020\nIs the, you know, there was a part of Point Channel 101's history when Sharab and I were like, are we going to keep being the ones with our thumb on the switch?\n\n53:34.020 --> 53:42.020\nBecause the thing started this idea that the audience is always in charge and then we kind of tweaked the system to allow for us to not even be involved.\n\n53:42.020 --> 53:44.020\nAnd that was an important thing.\n\n53:44.020 --> 53:54.020\nLike, likewise, this, this, the growth of this show, I think this is an interesting chapter because it's like, I was like, let's move it to Star Burns.\n\n53:54.020 --> 54:00.020\nAnd let's like, for the subscribers, we could have like video segments and we could, you know, I just had these ambitions.\n\n54:00.020 --> 54:03.020\nI never made the mistake of thinking, oh, I'm going to work really hard on the show.\n\n54:03.020 --> 54:11.020\nBut I always thought, I made the mistake of thinking, oh, we'll move in and we'll set up a foundation and then shit will grow on top of that.\n\n54:11.020 --> 54:16.020\nLike, everyone will keep wanting to add to it and it'll like, grow into this thing.\n\n54:16.020 --> 54:20.020\nAnd, and then the fucking election happened.\n\n54:20.020 --> 54:32.020\nAnd then I, and then it just like, nobody, nobody, nobody, it's just like, we all across the entire country, like the music changed for everybody.\n\n54:32.020 --> 54:43.020\nIt didn't matter what dance move you were about to do and what plans you had with other people, just like all of it, you know, it was just like fucking everything shifted.\n\n54:43.020 --> 54:47.020\nAnd then, and then the smart creative people are like, okay, how do we adapt to this?\n\n54:47.020 --> 54:52.020\nBut there's no question that it was just like, like, it kind of disrupted everything.\n\n54:52.020 --> 54:56.020\nYou feel like this is related to the election.\n\n54:56.020 --> 54:57.020\nYes.\n\n54:57.020 --> 55:01.020\nThis is connected to the political climate of the United States.\n\n55:01.020 --> 55:15.020\nI don't know if it's connected to the political climate, but it's definitely connected to the event of, of like the election and it's like social repercussions and things. Yes.\n\n55:15.020 --> 55:24.020\nLike, you know, so like on Friday night, I had a little, a little party and I was like, fuck, man, like this is how selfish I am.\n\n55:24.020 --> 55:26.020\nI'm like, fuck, God damn it.\n\n55:26.020 --> 55:30.020\nWorld War Three is going to start on the night of this party that I'm throwing.\n\n55:30.020 --> 55:38.020\nAnd I was like, bummed because it's like, everybody's going to come and then there's going to be nuclear war or something and it's going to like fuck up the party.\n\n55:38.020 --> 55:41.020\nAnd I was like, I was like, God damn, that's such a selfish thought.\n\n55:41.020 --> 55:51.020\nBut then I realized like, whoa, man, like you're, I started getting anxious, you know, beyond that, you know, I started getting scared and worried and nervous about World War Three.\n\n55:51.020 --> 55:54.020\nAnd then, and dying.\n\n55:54.020 --> 55:57.020\nAnd then I kind of realized like, oh, I have no control over that.\n\n55:57.020 --> 55:59.020\nLike there's nothing I could do.\n\n55:59.020 --> 56:01.020\nThere's no phone calls to be made.\n\n56:01.020 --> 56:03.020\nThere's nothing to be done about this.\n\n56:03.020 --> 56:15.020\nThese are massive, massive gears that are turning and that, you know, I don't know much of what can really be done about it right now, like in this single moment.\n\n56:15.020 --> 56:31.020\nDo you think that's naive or like a form of nihilism or to just suddenly just realize like, oh, actually, I don't really care about the president or political climates or empires or governors or principalities or powers.\n\n56:31.020 --> 56:39.020\nI'm just using, my mind is becoming attached to that because there's a bigger problem I'm trying to avoid.\n\n56:39.020 --> 56:45.020\nNo, I don't, I don't think there's anything weird or wrong with that.\n\n56:45.020 --> 56:49.020\nI think, isn't that pretty much how you felt the entire time?\n\n56:49.020 --> 56:51.020\nAnd isn't everybody just catching up with you?\n\n56:51.020 --> 56:52.020\nNo, I don't know.\n\n56:52.020 --> 56:53.020\nI don't, I go back and forth.\n\n56:53.020 --> 56:56.020\nEveryone's just exhausted and tired of caring.\n\n56:56.020 --> 56:58.020\nYeah, you never really did care.\n\n56:58.020 --> 57:00.020\nYou knew it was dumb before everybody else.\n\n57:00.020 --> 57:11.020\nLike it was, some of us tried and it like herniated our fucking embarrassingly putty like muscles of like and revealed that we were hypocrites.\n\n57:11.020 --> 57:15.020\nAnd yeah, everyone is tired now.\n\n57:15.020 --> 57:21.020\nAnd it, yeah, no, there's nothing, there's nothing wrong with that mode of thinking.\n\n57:21.020 --> 57:25.020\nI'm, I didn't even know that we were about to be in World War Three.\n\n57:25.020 --> 57:29.020\nThe student has become the master in that regard.\n\n57:29.020 --> 57:46.020\nSo I was minecrafting, like where there is no war and there is no president and, you know, I'm waiting, waiting to, you know, waiting to cash in and head for the hills.\n\n57:46.020 --> 57:49.020\nMan, this is great, man.\n\n57:49.020 --> 57:50.020\nI'm reading this book right now.\n\n57:50.020 --> 57:51.020\nThis is perfect.\n\n57:51.020 --> 57:55.020\nIt's, it's this new book by the Zen Roshi Roshi Joan Halifax.\n\n57:55.020 --> 57:57.020\nI think it's called standing on the edge.\n\n57:57.020 --> 58:11.020\nIt's really good, but it's about edge states and it talks about like, you know, altruism, healthy altruism and unhealthy altruism and how like a person who's like got a really good heart.\n\n58:11.020 --> 58:24.020\nYou really want things to be better, really wants things to be better in the world can like fall over the edge into absolute despair and absolute just, just broken heartedness.\n\n58:24.020 --> 58:27.020\nAnd like she, she gives all these examples. She's amazing.\n\n58:27.020 --> 58:33.020\nShe like, you know, I'm like planning parties and like, like having a really fun life.\n\n58:33.020 --> 58:40.020\nShe's like does, she like flies to, you know, there's just that big earthquake that happened recently.\n\n58:40.020 --> 58:41.020\nI think it was in Nepal, right?\n\n58:41.020 --> 58:42.020\nWhere's that big earthquake?\n\n58:42.020 --> 58:43.020\nWhere was that?\n\n58:43.020 --> 58:53.020\nThere's like a massive, it wasn't recent recently, but the point is she like flies to places where people are suffering and sets up camps and gets blankets flown in.\n\n58:53.020 --> 58:55.020\nAnd like just tries to help.\n\n58:55.020 --> 58:59.020\nAnd she doesn't do it in a real flashy showy way.\n\n58:59.020 --> 59:00.020\nI've met her.\n\n59:00.020 --> 59:01.020\nShe's just, this is just what she does.\n\n59:01.020 --> 59:03.020\nShe's like, oh, here we are on planet earth.\n\n59:03.020 --> 59:04.020\nHere's what you do.\n\n59:04.020 --> 59:16.020\nAnd so she encounters people who do, who are doing those things with her and she watches some people get just fucking shattered on their altruism.\n\n59:16.020 --> 59:19.020\nJust get broken apart in their compassion.\n\n59:19.020 --> 59:21.020\nHow do they get broken apart?\n\n59:21.020 --> 59:25.020\nBecause what happens is, is like you become bitter.\n\n59:25.020 --> 59:27.020\nYou go out there to help.\n\n59:27.020 --> 59:30.020\nYou have an expectation that you're going to make things better.\n\n59:30.020 --> 59:37.020\nYou come into contact with a really, a reality, which is that, oh, really, you're not going to make everything better.\n\n59:37.020 --> 59:41.020\nIn fact, things might be getting worse while you're trying to make things better.\n\n59:41.020 --> 59:46.020\nBut in your mind, you are like, oh, no, I'm going to do it or it could be done or it might be.\n\n59:46.020 --> 59:56.020\nBut suddenly you're watching people bring their children to triage centers where it's like, no, that kid's going to die.\n\n59:56.020 --> 01:00:00.020\nAnd you're watching that happen day after day after day after day.\n\n01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.020\nIt's kind of what you do with animals, Rob.\n\n01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.020\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:12.020\nAnd if you don't watch what you're doing and you fall on the other side, what ends up happening is the darkness consumes you.\n\n01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:16.020\nYou know, it's that classic thing, the thing you're fighting you become.\n\n01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.020\nAnd you don't even realize it's happened to you.\n\n01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.020\nAnd then suddenly you're all broken apart by it.\n\n01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.020\nAnd then the fucking thing won.\n\n01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020\nThen it won.\n\n01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:29.020\nYou know, that's the crazy thing about it is the way the darkness wins is not by killing people who are fighting it.\n\n01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.020\nIt wins by getting into their hearts.\n\n01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.020\nAnd then, you know what I mean?\n\n01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.020\nLike Sith style.\n\n01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.020\nSorry to use a star.\n\n01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.020\nIt's like that.\n\n01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.020\nIt gets you.\n\n01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.020\nYou don't even know it got you.\n\n01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.020\nIt's a cool book.\n\n01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.020\nIt's really good.\n\n01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.020\nI really love it.\n\n01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.020\nWhat's it called?\n\n01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.020\nI think it's called Standing on the Edge.\n\n01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.020\nYou mind if I Google it real quick?\n\n01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.020\nI'll tell you.\n\n01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.020\nIt's about edge states.\n\n01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.020\nYeah, Dan and I will talk while you do that.\n\n01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.020\nHey, Dan.\n\n01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.020\nWhat would you do today?\n\n01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.020\nYou did some Minecraft.\n\n01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.020\nThat must have been fun.\n\n01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.020\nYeah.\n\n01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.020\nI just finished level three.\n\n01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.020\nNo?\n\n01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.020\nAre there levels in Minecraft?\n\n01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.020\nWell, if you don't know, why would you cut me off?\n\n01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.020\nYou asked me about Minecraft.\n\n01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.020\nI'm trying to reach out and make a connection.\n\n01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.020\nI don't have to.\n\n01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.020\nI'm trying to make an emotional bid.\n\n01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:14.020\nOK, well, can I answer it?\n\n01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.020\nCan I tell you about Minecraft a little bit?\n\n01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.020\nYes.\n\n01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.020\nYeah, there's that fire behind your eyes.\n\n01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.020\nYou don't want to hear about Minecraft.\n\n01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.020\nI got no internet in here.\n\n01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:29.020\nJust Google the new book by Joan.\n\n01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:32.020\nI just finished gathering all of the necessary ingredients\n\n01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:38.020\nfor a tier one void resource, void or miner\n\n01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.020\nfrom the environmental tech pack in Minecraft.\n\n01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.020\nThat's badass.\n\n01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.020\nYeah, it took a great deal of diamonds and other materials\n\n01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.020\nthat were hard to come by.\n\n01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:58.020\nI went to Monster Palooza this afternoon with Kumail and Jonah.\n\n01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:05.020\nAnd we looked at Monster Paloozas.\n\n01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.020\nYou mean masks?\n\n01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.020\nYes.\n\n01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:14.020\nMasks and bootleg DVDs.\n\n01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:18.020\nMy therapist told me the name of some guy that, I don't know,\n\n01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:22.020\nbecause I said, oh, you know how you taught me to deal\n\n01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:26.020\nwith relationships, like explaining rules and stuff?\n\n01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:29.020\nIs there rules for how to be interested in people?\n\n01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:34.020\nBecause it seems like that's become what we're really talking\n\n01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:41.020\nabout for me is like, well, when I talk about the election,\n\n01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:46.020\nI don't mean, oh, everything changed because of who became president.\n\n01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:51.020\nI mean, we all, like, our whole mission statement changed.\n\n01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:56.020\nAnd therefore, me as a parasite, as a person who's just always\n\n01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:00.020\nwanted to fit in or make people like me or not get beat up\n\n01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:03.020\nor just be funny or whatever, that scrambled my signal.\n\n01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:11.020\nSo, like, that's a good thing because then you finally get to a place\n\n01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:15.020\nwhere you're like, OK, so let's just care about Dan.\n\n01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.020\nWhat do you want?\n\n01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.020\nRight.\n\n01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:21.020\nAnd then you go, OK, well, I'm going to lock that down, that down.\n\n01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.020\nOK.\n\n01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.020\nAnd then what's left is sort of like other people.\n\n01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.020\nLike, what am I supposed to, how am I supposed to interact with them?\n\n01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:34.020\nAnd it's like, you know, I guess I'm, you know,\n\n01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.020\nand the therapist gave me some materials or something to look at.\n\n01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.020\nBut I kind of like, it's just like a sink full of dishes.\n\n01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:45.020\nLike, I don't want to learn how to interact with people.\n\n01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.020\nShe's like trying to show you.\n\n01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.020\nI don't understand.\n\n01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.020\nI'm not.\n\n01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.020\nI don't know either because it's like I haven't unpacked it.\n\n01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:55.020\nYou know, it's like, like, oh, look up this guy, read his book,\n\n01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.020\nwatch his Ted talk.\n\n01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:02.020\nYou know, like, you'll enter this realm of like, this guy is like a guy who,\n\n01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:07.020\nlike, the area, the thing that you're talking about this guy would be helpful,\n\n01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.020\nyou know?\n\n01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.020\nRight.\n\n01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.020\nBut I don't, I just wrote it down and I'm like, I don't know.\n\n01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.020\nYeah.\n\n01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.020\nAll that stuff is like, when I go to these Ramdas retreats,\n\n01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.020\nthey always talk about mind versus heart,\n\n01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.020\nlike being up in your head versus in your heart.\n\n01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.020\nAnd all that stuff is so heady.\n\n01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.020\nIt's all mental.\n\n01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.020\nIt's all like, you're up in your head.\n\n01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.020\nIt's like, those books will get you up in your head.\n\n01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020\nNow that's bad.\n\n01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.020\nBooks are great.\n\n01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.020\nBut like, some of those, it's like, as opposed to just like, oh,\n\n01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.020\nI love it because it's so simple.\n\n01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.020\nBecause it's like, just what you're in right now, it's perfect.\n\n01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020\nIt's fine.\n\n01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:43.020\nEven if the thing you're in right now is just this simmering cauldron of whatever it is.\n\n01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:47.020\nIt's that idea of like, yeah, that's where we're at right now.\n\n01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.020\nI'm that thing.\n\n01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.020\nAnd then feel that without any expectation.\n\n01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.020\nLike, oh, I'm going to change it.\n\n01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:57.020\nThat's this thing that, what's her name, Pima Chodron, another Buddhist teacher.\n\n01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:04.020\nShe says, people say, oh, we're going to start meditating because we want to be a better person.\n\n01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:08.020\nAnd she says, that's an aggression against the you that you are right now.\n\n01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:11.020\nThe idea is not to meditate to become a better person.\n\n01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:18.020\nThe idea is to meditate so that you could be yourself more fully, feel yourself more fully.\n\n01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.020\nI love that idea.\n\n01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.020\nIt's just so fun to just play around with the idea that where you're at right now, this,\n\n01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:27.020\nthis where you're at, this where you're at, fucking, it's perfect.\n\n01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:31.020\nYeah, I find myself like, I've gotten to some dark places.\n\n01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.020\nI've been really upset.\n\n01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.020\nI was connected to my dog getting sick and stuff.\n\n01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:38.020\nAre these things like Q like operas in your head?\n\n01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.020\nYes.\n\n01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:47.020\nLike pockets of magma and things like, OK, now I have an excuse to flush that vein of lava.\n\n01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:52.020\nSo I don't know what's going on down there, but I know on top, it's like the reality,\n\n01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:56.020\nnot the illusion, is numbness and stillness.\n\n01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:02.020\nAnd so then I have these conversations with people like my therapist or just anybody who's like actually interested.\n\n01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.020\nIt goes like, well, what, where are you really at?\n\n01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:14.020\nAnd then I found myself going, well, I guess, you know, come see come saw like, like, and then the, like, oh, what do you mean?\n\n01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.020\nDon't you think this?\n\n01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:21.020\nIt's like the other person like wants so much more than stillness and numbness and they can have it.\n\n01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.020\nBut then that's, that's, that's fracking.\n\n01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:28.020\nLike, it's like, OK, where you're going to pierce me and you're going to dig down.\n\n01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:36.020\nAnd it's not necessarily more true what's boiling down beneath in the core of the earth.\n\n01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:40.020\nLike that's no more the earth than the crust and the polar ice caps and all this stuff.\n\n01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:46.020\nLike I, I just feel on my surface right now, like I just like numb.\n\n01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.020\nYeah.\n\n01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.020\nSo numb.\n\n01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.020\nYeah.\n\n01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:53.020\nLike I just reduced to like, but that's nice.\n\n01:06:53.020 --> 01:07:02.020\nWhat I noticed in my behavior is like, well, you haven't gotten on Twitter in like three days and you didn't even do it by saying you were going to quit Twitter for three days.\n\n01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:05.020\nLike you forgot to get on Twitter because you're fucking numb.\n\n01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:10.020\nAnd when numbness comes, also you don't need to self abuse.\n\n01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:19.020\nWhat is the, so how would you, like if you had to, instead of just saying numbness, like how would you describe the numbness?\n\n01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.020\nWhat, what is it?\n\n01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:24.020\nHow would you describe it if you couldn't use the word numb?\n\n01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.020\nStasis.\n\n01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.020\nI mean, it's like, it's like, is it, if it were, is it solid?\n\n01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:36.020\nIs it like malleable? Is it, is it, is it changing?\n\n01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:38.020\nDoes it come and go?\n\n01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.020\nWould it have a color associated with it?\n\n01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.020\nIs it opaque?\n\n01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:45.020\nLike how would you just, what is it?\n\n01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:56.020\nI think, I feel like it's like, I don't know if I controlled it or someone else did, but I feel like it's like going around the house and like shutting off.\n\n01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:05.020\nLike, like, it's, it's, it's like, like, like, like, there's like white noise that you get used to.\n\n01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.020\nYou're just like, oh, I'm on a submarine.\n\n01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:11.020\nSo like, I just hear all the time background noise sounds like this.\n\n01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.020\nBecause that's what it takes to run a submarine.\n\n01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:20.020\nAnd then, like, it's just silent running.\n\n01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:27.020\nLike, you just like, oh, one by one, you're just turning off equipment.\n\n01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:33.020\nAnd I don't know if I did that or if that's like a Russian weapon that, or, you know what I mean?\n\n01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.020\nLike, I'm not going to claim credit for it.\n\n01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.020\nIt's just a, it's just a thing that has happened.\n\n01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.020\nThat's the state.\n\n01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.020\nYou feel, you feel like it's like a shutting down.\n\n01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.020\nYeah.\n\n01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:47.020\nIt's like an energy that's sort of, there was some energy and then that energy is now turning itself off.\n\n01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:53.020\nYeah, like, like, like, but, but for a purpose, like waiting, it's about time.\n\n01:08:53.020 --> 01:09:02.020\nIt's about, like, we were being counterproductive with the worrying and the, and the pinging and the periscoping and all those things.\n\n01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:16.020\nSo, like, okay, go deep and shut everything off and just, you know, like, and because it, not because nothing is important, because everything is important.\n\n01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.020\nBecause we're hunting the red October.\n\n01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:24.020\nLike, like, like it's, it's, it's, it's the time for, for nothing right now.\n\n01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.020\nIt doesn't feel purposeless.\n\n01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.020\nRight.\n\n01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:36.020\nI feel, if I thought that this was my new life, I'd put a bullet in my head because I'd be like, well, that's boring, but I feel anticipation.\n\n01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:44.020\nI feel like, like, okay, this chapter is wrapping up.\n\n01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:51.020\nLike, everything, all of my energy creatively is being put into, like, tying knots on things.\n\n01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.020\nGoing like, okay, let me just get this off my plate.\n\n01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.020\nNot, okay, say no to that pitch.\n\n01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.020\nDon't do that.\n\n01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.020\nDon't start that.\n\n01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.020\nDon't promise that.\n\n01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:08.020\nAnd then, like, let everything, like, like, come down to a, to a, to a, to a point of complete silence.\n\n01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:19.020\nAnd then, so that the orchestra can start and the metaphor mixer can, can mix the metaphor of the submarine and the orchestra.\n\n01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.020\nMonster Palooza.\n\n01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:25.020\nWho gives a fuck about that stupid ass fucking.\n\n01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.020\nCamille.\n\n01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:27.020\nJonim.\n\n01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020\nGreat.\n\n01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.020\nMe.\n\n01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:30.020\nWell, what?\n\n01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.020\nDid you buy any masks?\n\n01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:36.020\nI didn't, but I bought a bunch of DVDs that I'm going to watch when I get home.\n\n01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.020\nI bought a Zacharley album.\n\n01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.020\nMonster album.\n\n01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:46.020\nZacharley Monster album.\n\n01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:51.020\nI'm going to listen to that on my turntable.\n\n01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.020\nAnd I bought some DVDs.\n\n01:10:54.020 --> 01:11:09.020\nI'm mad because I got that, that breathalyzer keychain and I was, like, really excited about it, but you have to wait 15 minutes to get an accurate reading.\n\n01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.020\nWhich makes no sense.\n\n01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.020\nThat sucks so bad.\n\n01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.020\nYou have to wait.\n\n01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.020\nYou have to breathe on it.\n\n01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:19.020\nHere's the, here's the directions for the breathalyzer.\n\n01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.020\nStop drinking.\n\n01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.020\nWait 20 minutes.\n\n01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.020\nBlow into the thing and then you'll know how drunk you are.\n\n01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:29.020\nMotherfucker, if I had the presence of mind.\n\n01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:36.020\nI got the thing because it was 60 bucks and I thought, oh, this might be a cool way to, like, create awareness.\n\n01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:39.020\nYou know, I would just, like, start putting a number.\n\n01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:48.020\nIf I'm, you know, if I am an asshole, if I'm angry, if I, you know, like, start putting, like, road fliers on.\n\n01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.020\nNo, man, that's cool.\n\n01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.020\nShit, the last time I blew a.8, I, you know, I-\n\n01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.020\nI was.8, by the way.\n\n01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.020\nHe doesn't call me anymore.\n\n01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.020\nDude, that's cool. That's like, there's this-\n\n01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.020\nThanks, man. I just pulled that out of my ass right now.\n\n01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:10.020\nBut do you think the cops, do you think the ones the cops use?\n\n01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:17.020\nLike, like, like, do you think, if you get pulled over by the cops and they go, like, are you, do you want to blow into this thing?\n\n01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.020\nLike, are you actually supposed to say,\n\n01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.020\nwell, you want to give me 20 minutes because I just finished drinking?\n\n01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.020\nOr take me to dinner.\n\n01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:28.020\nLike, it's counterintuitive, but maybe their dirty little secret is that they're like,\n\n01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:35.020\nthey ask you, are you willing to blow a breathalyzer and because your instinct as a drunk driver is to say,\n\n01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:41.020\nor they go, or they, maybe they, I've never been pulled over, like, and checked like that,\n\n01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:47.020\nbut maybe they say, when's the last time you had a drink?\n\n01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:53.020\nAnd if you say, I just had one like five minutes ago before I got in my car,\n\n01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:58.020\nthe irony is, you're allowed to wait 15 more minutes,\n\n01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.020\nbut no one wants to say that because it sounds like a confession of drunk driving.\n\n01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.020\nWait, you have to wait 15 minutes before you blow into it?\n\n01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.020\nYeah.\n\n01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:11.020\nBut I'm hoping that that's a function of the cheap, shitty keychain thing that I got.\n\n01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.020\nI heard-\n\n01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.020\nIt makes sense, though. It's an ecstamic.\n\n01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:20.020\nIsn't there like, they give you a choice, you can blow in the breathalyzer here,\n\n01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:25.020\nor you can go down to the station and blow into the breathalyzer there.\n\n01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:27.020\nDon't they give you a choice? I heard that.\n\n01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.020\nYeah.\n\n01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:34.020\nAnd then they say, you know, go down to the station because by the time you get to the station,\n\n01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:38.020\nyou'll probably sober up enough to not be drunk driving.\n\n01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:44.020\nOr if their equipment works the same way as this piece of shit I got from Amazon,\n\n01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:52.020\nsober or not, your result, if you just, like, you know, within 20 minutes,\n\n01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:55.020\nis just off the fucking charts. It's not accurate.\n\n01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.020\nIt's not accurate.\n\n01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:04.020\nBut I'm thinking, come on, it's got to be just because the cheap ones, I don't know.\n\n01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:07.020\nGet a $70 one.\n\n01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.020\nGet a fancy one.\n\n01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020\nGet a fancy one.\n\n01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.020\nThat seems like good money after bad.\n\n01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:16.020\nWhy don't you get a fancy one, get one with your name on it.\n\n01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:18.020\nA designer breathalyzer.\n\n01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.020\nYeah.\n\n01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:20.020\nFor a soggy breathalyzer.\n\n01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.020\nJust do it. Just do it. Just let it all hang out.\n\n01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.020\nWhat's another $10?\n\n01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.020\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.020\nJust do it.\n\n01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.020\nIt would be amazing.\n\n01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:32.020\nWouldn't it be great if they had technology that was so-\n\n01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:38.020\nLike, if you could digitally know immediately how drunk you were,\n\n01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.020\nlike, if it was as simple as GPS, like, you don't have to put any effort into it,\n\n01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:46.020\nand then you could just choose to send your Twitter or your phone in general,\n\n01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:51.020\nyour text messages, but, like, you choose your settings, like, when you're sober,\n\n01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:55.020\nbut, like, look, you are Andy Dick right now.\n\n01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.020\nRight.\n\n01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:01.020\nAnd you're about to text your so-and-so, like, you could create lists of people.\n\n01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:05.020\nIf they could hook it up, if your Apple Watch could connect to your iPhoto library,\n\n01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:09.020\nso that underneath each photo, it showed your blood alcohol level.\n\n01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.020\nYeah.\n\n01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.020\nThat'd be incredible.\n\n01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:20.020\nYou could set your email settings to be like, hey, like, when you were sober,\n\n01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:25.020\nyou made me promise that when you clicked send on an email, I would go,\n\n01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:30.020\nokay, I sent it, and then wait six hours, and then review.\n\n01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.020\nYou know, and then you'd be like, God damn it.\n\n01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.020\nWhat's the worst drunk email you ever sent?\n\n01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.020\nOh, God.\n\n01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:42.020\nI mean, I stopped using emails so long ago.\n\n01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.020\nLike...\n\n01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:47.020\nWhat do you think's the worst drunk tweet you ever did?\n\n01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:51.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:52.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:57.020\nI mean, like, the drunkest, most out-of-control stuff, I think, was just, like,\n\n01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:00.020\nthere was an article about it.\n\n01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:04.020\nI yelled at some kid for three hours or something.\n\n01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:07.020\nYou're a sober guy, Rob, huh?\n\n01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.020\nNo, I fucking drank.\n\n01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:13.020\nYou ever blast out any drunk tweets?\n\n01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:15.020\nYeah, but nothing angry.\n\n01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.020\nJust something stupid.\n\n01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:21.020\nI'm trying to think of what's the dumbest thing I've ever tweeted.\n\n01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:26.020\nIt's hard to categorize it.\n\n01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.020\nProbably be easier to isolate.\n\n01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.020\nI got really drunk at a party once, and I said,\n\n01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.020\noh, I'm going to go fuck those black girls or something like that.\n\n01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.020\nI think that's probably...\n\n01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:40.020\nAnd I think I screamed that to you from across the party.\n\n01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:43.020\nI think that's probably the worst thing I've ever done.\n\n01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.020\nYou muttered it through gritted teeth to me and Jeff.\n\n01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:48.020\nOh, God, that was a bad...\n\n01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.020\nThat was the worst.\n\n01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.020\nYou were lonely.\n\n01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:54.020\nI was ugly lonely.\n\n01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:56.020\nI was just like...\n\n01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:58.020\nI did not like that time in my life.\n\n01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:03.020\nThat was a really, really dark time.\n\n01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.020\nI think we've all been there.\n\n01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.020\nUgly lonely?\n\n01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.020\nUgly lonely and drunk.\n\n01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.020\nFuck, man.\n\n01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:15.020\nThe only thing that makes you graceful lonely\n\n01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:20.020\nis time, which is really just saying your taste buds go dead.\n\n01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:24.020\nThere's no hero or villain in that process.\n\n01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:26.020\nIt's like, from my experience,\n\n01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:32.020\nif you don't know loneliness enough yet,\n\n01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:35.020\nyou overreact to it and act like a big fucking tool\n\n01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:39.020\nthat is going to embarrass you later when you become mature,\n\n01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:43.020\nwhich becoming mature does not involve you going to a crossroads\n\n01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:48.020\nand learning the blues because you really wanted to evolve yourself.\n\n01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:53.020\nThe laziest, least mature people become mature\n\n01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:55.020\nbecause they get old and tired\n\n01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.020\nand they start experiencing the same fucking shit over and over again\n\n01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:01.020\nbecause they don't make any effort to change.\n\n01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:04.020\nSo they're lonely a million times and then they're like,\n\n01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.020\nthis isn't so bad, it's kind of like the last time\n\n01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:08.020\nand I know it'll end again.\n\n01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:11.020\nAnd that's not wisdom and it shouldn't be...\n\n01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:16.020\nI hate that we, when we get old, like, high road young people,\n\n01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:20.020\nwhen really it's just like, yeah, yeah, like,\n\n01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:24.020\nSpider-Man 4 is the third movie you've ever seen.\n\n01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.020\nLike, why are we arguing?\n\n01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.020\nI've seen 700 more movies than you.\n\n01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:33.020\nI don't remember the last 30 because my brain is dying.\n\n01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:39.020\nIt's just like, we don't do anything heroic to transform.\n\n01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:42.020\nWe don't like gain, we don't level up because we're good people.\n\n01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:46.020\nWe just keep living and tasting shit and we get bored with it.\n\n01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:48.020\nWell, that's the one thing I love about Buddhism\n\n01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:51.020\nis the concept of fundamental dissatisfaction,\n\n01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:55.020\nwhich is the idea that, oh, no, that is actually to be human.\n\n01:18:55.020 --> 01:19:03.020\nSo I think the big lie that comes from all the fucking Spider-Man movies\n\n01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:06.020\nand all the movies and lots of stuff is we tell these people,\n\n01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:09.020\nno, no, no, no, it gets better.\n\n01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:13.020\nThat'll go away, that gnawing, empty thing inside of you,\n\n01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.020\nthat'll go away.\n\n01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:17.020\nAnd in Buddhism it's like, no, that's like a fish saying,\n\n01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.020\none day I'm going to be dry.\n\n01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:21.020\nWell, when you're dry, you're dead fish,\n\n01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.020\nand in the same way for a human to think that that thing goes away\n\n01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.020\nis one of the great ways a human tortures itself.\n\n01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.020\nYou know, also the idea of looking forward to it,\n\n01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.020\nlike, that's a good thing.\n\n01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.020\nThat would be like saying, the best example I can think of\n\n01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:41.020\nis imagine if these Parkland kids, that whatever comes of what they did,\n\n01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.020\njust imagine if they had been cool enough to realize how little\n\n01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:51.020\nthey'll care in 10 years, or had they taken cues from all the people previous.\n\n01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:55.020\nThey reacted from the place that they were in,\n\n01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:59.020\nand it was like they didn't react like 30-year-olds or 40-year-olds,\n\n01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:02.020\nand as a result, they got shit done.\n\n01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:08.020\nAnd young filmmakers, and everything young,\n\n01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:11.020\nwe worship youth, but we make fun of its naivete.\n\n01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:17.020\nLike, wisdom is just dying a little bit.\n\n01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.020\nIt's just going like, yeah, it gets a little boring.\n\n01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:23.020\nI remember my dad, I was like 25, and he was however old he was,\n\n01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:26.020\nand I just couldn't believe how old my dad was.\n\n01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.020\nAnd I was like, it was a legitimate question in my head,\n\n01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.020\nand I was like, if he was any other human being,\n\n01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:35.020\nI would know that this would be tacky and rude,\n\n01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:38.020\nand then I might get punched, or just that it would be hurtful,\n\n01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.020\nbut it's like, your dad's here, just like, fuck it.\n\n01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:45.020\nThis is the guy I can ask this question, because fuck him.\n\n01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:49.020\nAnd I was like, so now that you're this old,\n\n01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:54.020\nare you scared that you're going to die and stuff?\n\n01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:58.020\nWhich is really gnawing at me as a guy in my 20s.\n\n01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:01.020\nI was really thinking about what it must be,\n\n01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:03.020\nto have to think about death all the time.\n\n01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:05.020\nAnd I remember my dad being like,\n\n01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:08.020\neh, eh, eh.\n\n01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:14.020\nHe's kind of been alive a long time.\n\n01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:17.020\nHe starts to get kind of boring.\n\n01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.020\nYeah, depressed.\n\n01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.020\nWell, I don't know who characterized my dad as a depressed guy.\n\n01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:25.020\nWell, I mean, I disagree with you in what you're saying,\n\n01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.020\nand I used to think that.\n\n01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:30.020\nI don't think that's true, and I used to think it though.\n\n01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:33.020\nI know people think that, but when I've been numbed down,\n\n01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:37.020\nI've thought that, but I don't think that's actually it for me.\n\n01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:40.020\nWell, I certainly don't want to make the mistake of going like,\n\n01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:44.020\nI figured it out, that's the one law by which the universe goes.\n\n01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:48.020\nI keep going because I know that there's this other...\n\n01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.020\nI think the beauty of it is,\n\n01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:53.020\nyou stumble upon something really beautiful,\n\n01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:58.020\nand you're like, you know, man, I kind of like came out of the closet\n\n01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.020\nwith this Ram Dass stuff, you know, I have a guru,\n\n01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.020\nand I'm really, I feel really good,\n\n01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:06.020\nand I used to feel really bad, and I feel really, really good,\n\n01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:10.020\nand I feel love in my life, and I feel really good.\n\n01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:13.020\nI know it's like, it feels lame to say that,\n\n01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:17.020\nbut I used to think like what you, the way you're talking,\n\n01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:21.020\nI used to think it was like an infinite Mordor escape or something,\n\n01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:25.020\nand that it just goes on forever, kind of never ending Mordor escape,\n\n01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:27.020\nand in fact, maybe it just gets worse and worse,\n\n01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:30.020\nand then what happens is all this fucking shit the hippies are saying,\n\n01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:33.020\nyou hear it, and from that Mordor escape,\n\n01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:37.020\nand you think, shut the fuck up, that can't be real, it's not real,\n\n01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.020\nbut then you kind of, that's the entry way, you know,\n\n01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.020\nand then you start, like what I would do is kind of like,\n\n01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.020\nyou know, I'm going to be like this like anthropologist,\n\n01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:49.020\nI'm going to go into this, and I'm going to find out where it's not real,\n\n01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:53.020\nby being part of it, and then you start realizing it's real,\n\n01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.020\nand then that thing that you're talking about,\n\n01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.020\nthat afflicts a great many people,\n\n01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:01.020\nwhich is that sense of like, oh fuck, my brain's rotting, I'm getting old,\n\n01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:04.020\nit just gets boring, this is terrible, oh my, like that thing,\n\n01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:09.020\nyou realize, oh my god, it doesn't have to be like that, for real,\n\n01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:11.020\nand now you're in a real predicament,\n\n01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:15.020\nbecause you either have to, when people are saying things like what you're saying,\n\n01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:20.020\nyou have to decide like, oh my god, am I going to be the fucking guy who says that thing,\n\n01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:23.020\nor am I going to keep my mouth shut about it,\n\n01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:27.020\nor am I going to be cynical, or try to tune into like that,\n\n01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:30.020\nand now it's like fuck, I have to say it,\n\n01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:32.020\nbecause it's incredibly unethical if I don't,\n\n01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.020\nand you know what I mean, it's incredibly unethical to be like,\n\n01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:37.020\nno, I know what you mean, you know, or to not say it,\n\n01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:43.020\nit's actually, it doesn't work like that, you know, it can, if it can,\n\n01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:47.020\nand that's okay, and the lineage I've become part of,\n\n01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:50.020\nthe paradigm is not one incarnation,\n\n01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.020\nit's like we get many, many, many of these things,\n\n01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.020\nand that is not to say to take it for granted,\n\n01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:58.020\nbut it's also to say in this one, you really just might be miserable for the entire incarnation,\n\n01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:02.020\nbut they don't say that with like a,\n\n01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.020\nyou really might be miserable for this entire incarnation,\n\n01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:07.020\nif you don't do what they say, they just might say like,\n\n01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:10.020\nyeah, this one, it might be a sad one for you,\n\n01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:13.020\nand that's okay, that's okay,\n\n01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.020\nnot to be like, no, you should be better,\n\n01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:18.020\nthey're like, no, this is a perfect universe.\n\n01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:22.020\nI wish there was more standardized language about mood and stuff,\n\n01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:26.020\nI feel like, I feel like if I answer the question honestly,\n\n01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.020\nlike how are you doing in a bar to someone,\n\n01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.020\nand like very often people will be like,\n\n01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:37.020\noh, you're so hard on yourself, or hope you get better,\n\n01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:40.020\nand stuff, and I'll be like, well, wait, you don't understand,\n\n01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:42.020\nI'm incredibly happy.\n\n01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.020\nYeah, that's it, yeah.\n\n01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:48.020\nLike, I'm just ashamed of myself by default,\n\n01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:50.020\nlike I'm filled with shame,\n\n01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.020\nwhich is like a mechanism,\n\n01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.020\nlike it's like my plumbing needs to be like,\n\n01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:00.020\nlike wrenched a little bit in therapy and stuff,\n\n01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.020\nbecause I was just like, just flooded,\n\n01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:05.020\nI just run on shame,\n\n01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:08.020\nlike a device could run on water, it could run on steam,\n\n01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.020\nit could run on oil,\n\n01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.020\nit's like, I just like, just shame,\n\n01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:18.020\njust like, is the lubricant, shame is the fucking like...\n\n01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:20.020\nAnother way to put that would be,\n\n01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:22.020\nthe thing you currently think you are,\n\n01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:25.020\nthinks it runs on shame, you know?\n\n01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.020\nBut that's not, you know, the idea is like,\n\n01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:31.020\nreally the thing that you are is much bigger\n\n01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.020\nthan a thing that thinks it runs on shame.\n\n01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.020\nPart of what, another way to put it would be,\n\n01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.020\nthere is shame here, or there is shame.\n\n01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:40.020\nAnother way to put it, it's called noting in Buddhism,\n\n01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.020\nyou just watch it, shame.\n\n01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.020\nAnd then what you're doing is like something\n\n01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.020\nthat Sharon Salzberg calls add-ons,\n\n01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:50.020\nso shame happens, you feel shame.\n\n01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.020\nThat's it, there is shame.\n\n01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:55.020\nBut then the mind starts attaching all this shit to the shame, right?\n\n01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:58.020\nSo now it becomes like this sort of recursion,\n\n01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.020\nit just goes on and on and on with the mind saying,\n\n01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:02.020\noh, because of there's shame, this must be this,\n\n01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.020\nthis must be that, and that must be that, and that.\n\n01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.020\nSo that's called in Buddhism the poisoned arrow.\n\n01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:10.020\nYou get hit by the arrow, that's the first pain, shame.\n\n01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:13.020\nUsually it's a triggering thing, it's not even shame,\n\n01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.020\nit's like something happens, and the event is the arrow.\n\n01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.020\nAnd then that, then shame, and then all the add-ons.\n\n01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:21.020\nBut really it's just shame, there is shame here,\n\n01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.020\nin this field of matter called my human body.\n\n01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:27.020\nAnd then that's it, you just sit with it.\n\n01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.020\nAnd then when the add-ons come, all this other stuff too,\n\n01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:32.020\nit's like, okay, that's there too.\n\n01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:38.020\nBut to say I'm a machine that runs on shame is true now.\n\n01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:40.020\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.020\nYeah, I didn't mean to proclaim it as like,\n\n01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:48.020\nI'm definitely, the whole thing is like an expression of like,\n\n01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.020\nI am changing and I'm going to change.\n\n01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:55.020\nI'm not resigned to the way that I run shit,\n\n01:26:55.020 --> 01:27:01.020\nbut I like, yeah, I just kind of like,\n\n01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:05.020\nI just feel like, I feel like it's, it's just like,\n\n01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:08.020\npeople go like, they listen to me talking and they go like,\n\n01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:11.020\noh he's so depressed and he's so sad or he's so, you know,\n\n01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:14.020\nand then I go like, well no, if you talk like the way I'm talking,\n\n01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.020\nthen that might be indicative,\n\n01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:19.020\nthese might be words that you would only say,\n\n01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.020\nif you were about to put a gun in your mouth.\n\n01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.020\nYes, but like, because of how fucked up I am,\n\n01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.020\nlike, this is like, like, you know,\n\n01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:31.020\nthese are my metaphors and this is my language and this is,\n\n01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:33.020\nthis is my baseline.\n\n01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:36.020\nIt does need to be improved and lightened,\n\n01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:43.020\nbut that's the same as like, somebody who's middle class saying,\n\n01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:45.020\nI need to be rich.\n\n01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:47.020\nLike the middle class person is like,\n\n01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:52.020\nmy middle line is just, there's a legubriousness to the,\n\n01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:55.020\nto the language, because it's based on shame.\n\n01:27:55.020 --> 01:28:00.020\nBecause like, I went into my therapist's office and it was like,\n\n01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:03.020\nshe's like, how did, how did, how did it go with Nigel and all this stuff?\n\n01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:06.020\nAnd it was like, he's good, he's better.\n\n01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:08.020\nSo I saw him in a much better mood.\n\n01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.020\nI'm feeling very good now.\n\n01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:13.020\nNigel's feeling better because our last session,\n\n01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:16.020\nNigel was very sick and I was very,\n\n01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:19.020\nvery upset and I was like, I was,\n\n01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:22.020\nI was saying like, I have this,\n\n01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:26.020\nlike, I don't know where to put this rage and shame.\n\n01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:29.020\nLike I can't get rid of it and she,\n\n01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:33.020\nshe, we spent the entire hour doing all these exercises of like,\n\n01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:36.020\ngoing underneath this layer and that layer and all this stuff.\n\n01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:40.020\nAnd then we, we went out in the sidewalk and walked like a fucking python sketch\n\n01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:42.020\nand whatever the fuck and like,\n\n01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:45.020\nall of it had different effects and things,\n\n01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.020\nbut, and it wasn't about it working or not working,\n\n01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:51.020\nbut the bottom line is it came back to the office and I was like,\n\n01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.020\nshe's like, how's that?\n\n01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:56.020\nAnd I'm like, it's, I'm, it's on fire.\n\n01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:01.020\nLike, like, thanks for blowing on it or putting a blanket over it for a second,\n\n01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:04.020\nbut the blanket is flammable and it's like, there is a fire.\n\n01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:08.020\nI can't, I just want to beat something to death.\n\n01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:09.020\nI want to kill.\n\n01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.020\nI want to hurt.\n\n01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:13.020\nI want to finish something.\n\n01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.020\nI want to hurt something.\n\n01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:19.020\nAnd I, and I, and I know I'm not supposed to want that and I can't blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:22.020\nAnd, and, and, you know, we got through that session.\n\n01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:24.020\nSo then a week later, I come, I come back in.\n\n01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:27.020\nNow during that week, Nigel gets better.\n\n01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:31.020\nSo then I sit in the chair and she goes like, how are you, how is it going?\n\n01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.020\nWell, Nigel's better.\n\n01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.020\nSo I feel fucking great.\n\n01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:36.020\nI walked into that room on a rainbow.\n\n01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:41.020\nI was like, one of those days where I'm like, well, this is 200 bucks wasted because I feel great.\n\n01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:48.020\nUm, but, and then she's like, well, so see, making progress, right?\n\n01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:54.020\nAnd I'm like, and then the whole session is based on the fact that my response to that was like, no, no progress made whatsoever.\n\n01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.020\nAbsolutely none.\n\n01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.020\nYeah.\n\n01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:00.020\nThe only thing that happened is my dog got better.\n\n01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:03.020\nI didn't learn how to handle anything.\n\n01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:09.020\nAnd she's like, no, but you, you, when, when your cat got sick, you punched a wall.\n\n01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:12.020\nYes. This time, did you punch a wall?\n\n01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.020\nNo, I did not.\n\n01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:20.020\nSo we would call that, uh, progress for the wall mason's union.\n\n01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:35.020\nLike, like, like if Jack the Ripper chokes a hooker to death on Monday and then on Wednesday, like he just sits in a pub and and draws pictures in his notebook about of dead hookers.\n\n01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:44.020\nGreat day for hookers, great amount of progress from Monday to Wednesday for his victims, not for him.\n\n01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:46.020\nNot in my opinion.\n\n01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:48.020\nAnd so we fought and fought.\n\n01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:49.020\nI mean, I fought.\n\n01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:58.020\nLike, but then by the end of the session, she was like, she basically was like the whole time was like making me realize how hard you're fighting.\n\n01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:02.020\nYou don't want to say that you are better.\n\n01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:04.020\nWell, I mean, maybe you're not.\n\n01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:06.020\nAnd then the other question is like, she didn't want it.\n\n01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:10.020\nShe was like, she was like asking me, like, does your God believe in incremental change?\n\n01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:18.020\nYour God willing to, does your God think that a little bit of progress is, is, is good enough?\n\n01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.020\nAnd I was like, the honest answer is no.\n\n01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:30.020\nNo, I do not worship a God that gives out medals for, for doing better than yesterday by a skosh.\n\n01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:34.020\nI don't, and that's because I created that God and etc.\n\n01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:36.020\nYou created the God.\n\n01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.020\nI sure did, motherfucker.\n\n01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:38.020\nDamn.\n\n01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.020\nCreated yours too.\n\n01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.020\nWhat is that?\n\n01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:41.020\nWhat's up, Kyle?\n\n01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:42.020\nIs that a 3D printer?\n\n01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:43.020\nHow do you do it?\n\n01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:44.020\nI fucking pray.\n\n01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.020\nHow do you create a God?\n\n01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.020\nI pray.\n\n01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.020\nThat's how you do it.\n\n01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.020\nJust prayer.\n\n01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:50.020\nDear God, make a God for Duncan.\n\n01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:52.020\nWhat God did you pray to to make the God?\n\n01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:55.020\nMaster God, root God, super user God.\n\n01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:57.020\nBased God.\n\n01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:59.020\nMan, you got to start listening a little bit.\n\n01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:01.020\nThat's, you know, not to give you a prescription.\n\n01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.020\nI know you turned me on to a little bit.\n\n01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.020\nI love a little bit.\n\n01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:04.020\nYou're doing great.\n\n01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:09.020\nBut yeah, the answer is to, you know, say thank you, based God and hope for His blessings.\n\n01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.020\nAnd then, you know, who knows?\n\n01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:13.020\nNot that you need anyone's blessings or anything like that, but.\n\n01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:14.020\nHave you heard little B?\n\n01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:17.020\nSqueaky chair?\n\n01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:18.020\nOh, okay.\n\n01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.020\nWe heard his feelings.\n\n01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:24.020\nYou, the other thing I keep thinking is like, man, what is your definition of, I mean,\n\n01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.020\nforget the whole God thing.\n\n01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.020\nWhat's your definition of I?\n\n01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:28.020\nLike, what do you think you are?\n\n01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.020\nThe definition of what?\n\n01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.020\nOf you.\n\n01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:31.020\nOf you.\n\n01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.020\nWhat do you think you are?\n\n01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:33.020\nLet me answer that.\n\n01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:36.020\nThank you.\n\n01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:38.020\nHe's great.\n\n01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:40.020\nYou're great.\n\n01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:41.020\nWhat else?\n\n01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.020\nLike, what do you think you are?\n\n01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:47.020\nWhat are you?\n\n01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:57.020\nI'm a fragment of an explosion of a thing that only knew that being was better than not\n\n01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:58.020\nbeing.\n\n01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:07.020\nAnd, yeah, I'm a shard with, like, different amounts of this and that in it than other\n\n01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:09.020\nshards because it's not uniform.\n\n01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.020\nHow big are you?\n\n01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.020\nShard-sized?\n\n01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.020\nWhat size?\n\n01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.020\nLike your human size?\n\n01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:16.020\nSix foot, 240 feet.\n\n01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.020\nYou think that's your size?\n\n01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.020\nAre you getting it?\n\n01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:25.020\nDo I see myself on a kind of map as, like, somehow more important than other people?\n\n01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.020\nNo, not that at all.\n\n01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:31.020\nI'm saying, like, you know, when you start self-referencing in any situation, you already\n\n01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:35.020\nknow this, I know, but you start self-referencing, you immediately are stuck with it.\n\n01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:38.020\nLike, you talk about, when I say this, it's going to sound like I'm saying, you talk about\n\n01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.020\nyourself a lot, but we all do.\n\n01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.020\nYou talk about yourself a lot.\n\n01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:44.020\nI'm this thing, I'm that thing, this is what I am, this is how I feel, this is who I am,\n\n01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.020\nthis is what I am.\n\n01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:49.020\nAnd then you start playing this game where you're like, okay, okay, who's talking about\n\n01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.020\nme?\n\n01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.020\nLike, what's that?\n\n01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:58.020\nWhat's it saying what Dan is?\n\n01:33:58.020 --> 01:33:59.020\nWhat's that?\n\n01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:02.020\nYou know, the watcher is what they call it, or the witness.\n\n01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:04.020\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:06.020\nThat thing's interesting, huh?\n\n01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:07.020\nIt's like, what is that?\n\n01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:09.020\nIt's this thing watching you.\n\n01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:13.020\nAnd it's making this comment, you're making a comment there, it's watching the commentary\n\n01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:14.020\nin fact.\n\n01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:20.020\nIt reminds me of the thing that my therapist pointed out because I was saying, like, look,\n\n01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:25.020\nI think the thing is, the problem is, like, she said, does your God have standards or\n\n01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:26.020\ndoes he have compassion?\n\n01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.020\nDoes he just have standards or does he have compassion?\n\n01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:32.020\nI said, honestly, the honest answer, even though I'm going to fucking yell that for it, I could\n\n01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:37.020\nlie and say he has compassion and then be like, no, I'll tell you the truth.\n\n01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:39.020\nMy God has just standards.\n\n01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.020\nWhy?\n\n01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.020\nWhy doesn't he have compassion?\n\n01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:46.020\nBecause compassion is the idea that God looks like rooting for you and that's an insane\n\n01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.020\nthing to do.\n\n01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:56.520\nAnd so it was like those AI, those robots on the YouTube videos, the guy from MIT that\n\n01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.520\ncreated them, you know how he expresses his love for that thing, his pride in that thing\n\n01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.620\nand his desire that it be the best robot it can be, his foot comes into frame and he tries\n\n01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:11.020\nto kick it the fuck over as hard as he can because he created it for the purpose of proving\n\n01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:17.020\nthat it can overcome that and it can walk like a God no matter if God's foot comes in\n\n01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:21.020\nand goes like, no, fuck you, you thought you knew everything about walking, now fuck you.\n\n01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.020\nRight.\n\n01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:25.520\nAnd then the robot goes like this and then it starts walking and that's when you're watching\n\n01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.020\nYouTube and you go, shit, we're going to be hunted to extinction because you're recognizing\n\n01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:32.020\nsuperiority.\n\n01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:35.020\nYou're not going like, oh, look at its stumble.\n\n01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:39.020\nYou're like, oh, shit, that motherfucker knows how to walk when it gets kicked.\n\n01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:46.520\nAnyways, I was trying to explain that to her and then she was like, so how did you not\n\n01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:53.020\nmeet God's standards when Nigel got sick and was like, because I already learned this shit\n\n01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:57.520\nand then I said, I said, you know, I recognize that I was doing this script, I got to finish\n\n01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:01.620\nthis script because like you said, I'm sitting on this script because it's my last chance\n\n01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:05.980\nto make myself miserable and then once I finish this script, like now I can, what I'm afraid\n\n01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:10.740\nof doing is moving on and like dealing with life, you know, instead of just like sucking\n\n01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:15.320\nmy thumb and going like, oh, I got a deadline, it's kind of similar to Minecraft, like it's\n\n01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:20.180\njust like, you just dig a little hole where you control whether you're miserable or you\n\n01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:23.500\ncontrol the cause of your misery, you think.\n\n01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:27.260\nAnd then I was like, okay, finish the script because you know what, it's time to move on\n\n01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:34.660\nbecause Cody might get sick, anyone might get sick, the Syria might explode, everyone\n\n01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:38.860\nmight get leukemia on my block, like I might find a ball in my nuts and a nut in my balls\n\n01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:44.500\nand like, it's time to join that fray, it's called life and I had made up my mind that\n\n01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:49.780\nI was ready to do that and then God gave me the little as tiny as little nibble of life's\n\n01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:55.220\ncaviar called, your dog is like trembling and I was like, and then she stopped me and\n\n01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.540\nsaid, all right, stop right there, stop.\n\n01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:04.020\nThe characterization of your dog trembling and vomiting and needing to be taken to the\n\n01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:13.340\nhospital as a little nibble of caviar is called a distortion.\n\n01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:22.820\nLike you have chosen to believe in a God that has bigger fish to fry than your dog and the\n\n01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.180\nthings that make you upset.\n\n01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:34.140\nSo that's what I want you to think about is like, why, you know, the God that you chose\n\n01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:39.060\nisn't the actual one true one, you know it's a model, why would you choose your model to\n\n01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:42.860\nbe so fucking like distorted?\n\n01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:46.380\nI don't mean to do this, but my question would be, who's choosing?\n\n01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:47.380\nWho is this?\n\n01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:51.660\nWell, I'm saying, isn't this like a kind of like chicken egg thing where you go, if you're\n\n01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:55.580\na miserable person, you create a miserable God and the God, you know, you, or you have\n\n01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:59.860\nto, you, that's like the God thing is like a few years, like a few, like whether there's\n\n01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:04.740\na God or not a God, you're still still dealing with this like interesting thing that happens\n\n01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:08.940\nwith a human, which is there is this field of awareness, miserable person, you have a\n\n01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.460\nmiserable map of the universe, well, you have the miserable person, the miserable person\n\n01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:14.880\nis within a field of awareness.\n\n01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.900\nThere's a field of, so like in the Bhagavad Gita, they say there is the field and the\n\n01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:19.740\nknower of the field.\n\n01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:24.180\nSo what happens with humans is we get caught up in the, in the field.\n\n01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:28.540\nSo and then that's when all the things start happening, like you get caught up in the field.\n\n01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:32.780\nSo you're like, when I get caught up in my field, myself, my life, my self, I become\n\n01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:37.980\nselfish, literally selfish because I'm deeply caught in my own self, like deeply caught\n\n01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:40.980\nin my, my own self, that's selfishness.\n\n01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.740\nAnd so, but then when you start playing around with this concept of like, wait a minute,\n\n01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:50.660\nwait a minute, there is awareness here that seems to be watching this thing happen, right?\n\n01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.660\nUh-huh.\n\n01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:57.100\nThat is where, is where it gets interesting because when you start like playing around\n\n01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.900\nwith that field of awareness, like you, you know, you look in the mirror, you can't look\n\n01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.180\nback at, you can't, you, you have to look in the mirror to see yourself.\n\n01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.260\nYou can't see yourself right now.\n\n01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:06.660\nIt's a similar problem.\n\n01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:09.140\nThis is this, this field of awareness.\n\n01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.740\nWhat is it?\n\n01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.620\nIs it consciousness?\n\n01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:13.620\nWhat is it?\n\n01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.660\nBut within that field, all the drama is happening, right?\n\n01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:21.820\nThe drama is happening within the field of awareness and the field of awareness is watching.\n\n01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:30.100\nSo the practice or one of the practice and mindfulness is not to change anything, not\n\n01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:33.740\nto change anything except to watch.\n\n01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:34.740\nNow we're watching.\n\n01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:40.220\nIn other words, we are trying to shift ourselves from being the field to identifying with the\n\n01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:42.000\nknower of the field.\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.500\nAnd so the concept is moving from individual identity to soul, to the soul identity or\n\n01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.660\nthe universal consciousness.\n\n01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:52.660\nThat's the practice.\n\n01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:54.160\nDid you fucking fart?\n\n01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:56.140\nI think it was a fart, not the chair.\n\n01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:58.140\nOh, no, no, it was a smell.\n\n01:39:58.140 --> 01:39:59.140\nI smelled sulfur.\n\n01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:00.140\nThat was a...\n\n01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.460\nWell, that could be because you're talking about this pagan talk.\n\n01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.220\nNo, but I really like that.\n\n01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:05.220\nThat's interesting.\n\n01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:11.340\nIt's sort of like awareness of awareness, like identification with the awareness.\n\n01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:12.340\nYeah, that's it.\n\n01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:16.860\nBecause if there's a camera there to make you feel ashamed, if you look fat from a certain\n\n01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:23.500\nangle, stop reacting to that by like people walk by a camera in a department store window\n\n01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:30.100\nand we get all confused and we start waving our arms and stuff, become the camera for\n\n01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.100\na second.\n\n01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:32.780\nThat's what you're trying to do anyway.\n\n01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.780\nYeah.\n\n01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:37.060\nYou're sitting there wondering how fat you are or what you're doing wrong and all that\n\n01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:42.420\nstuff like, oh, the invitation is to become a more objective point of view because other\n\n01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:48.340\npeople will enter that frame, you'll become a character and you'll become a shard along\n\n01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:49.340\nwith everybody else.\n\n01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:50.340\nThat's it.\n\n01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.780\nLike you put your money where your mouth is instead of reacting to seeing yourself on\n\n01:40:52.780 --> 01:41:00.620\nthe scoreboard by getting more obsessed with your bald spot, you go, holy shit, I'm looking\n\n01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:03.180\nat myself from the perspective of a stadium.\n\n01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.260\nHe has a bald spot.\n\n01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:05.260\nSo does he.\n\n01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:10.700\nSo does who else does and what is, you know, like, yeah, that's very interesting.\n\n01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.100\nIt's interesting.\n\n01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:13.100\nIt's interesting.\n\n01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:18.020\nAnd the only thing is it's like, they wouldn't say you or you become that.\n\n01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:23.180\nThey say you are that and that thing has become entangled in this thing.\n\n01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:24.180\nYeah.\n\n01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.180\nSo it's not that you become it.\n\n01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.180\nIt's actually that's what you are.\n\n01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.180\nNo, that's what you were in the first place.\n\n01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:28.180\nOtherwise you wouldn't.\n\n01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:29.180\nWe wouldn't talk the way we do.\n\n01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:31.020\nWe go like, oh, I'm such a piece of shit.\n\n01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:33.380\nLike, well, it sounds like you're talking about a character.\n\n01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:34.380\nYeah, that's it.\n\n01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:36.460\nLike, like, so you're already David Milch.\n\n01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.460\nLike you're not.\n\n01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:38.460\nYou've never been elsewhere.\n\n01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:43.060\nAnd Jen, like, like, that you, you were always David Milch, like, like now, now what you\n\n01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:47.860\nhave to do is remember that you're not like, you know, that there is no deadwood and that\n\n01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.380\nyou're it's a fucking set.\n\n01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:50.460\nAnd that's exactly it.\n\n01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.460\nSelf remembering.\n\n01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:52.460\nYeah.\n\n01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:53.460\nRemembering your true identity.\n\n01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.460\nYou know, David.\n\n01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.460\nGot to remember those feet.\n\n01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.460\nDavid Milch.\n\n01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.460\nDavid Milch.\n\n01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:01.180\nYou may be in David Milch, man.\n\n01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:02.180\nAll right.\n\n01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:05.940\nWell, I feel like I'm David Milch right now.\n\n01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:10.940\nI sure wish we could keep this going forever, but I'm going through a David Milch situation.\n\n01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:14.260\nWho is David Milch?\n\n01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:15.460\nI feel like David.\n\n01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.460\nDo you feel David Milch?\n\n01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:19.100\nI'm sure he, I don't know if he exists.\n\n01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:21.740\nI mean, I could imagine him just based on his name.\n\n01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:22.980\nI feel Milch.\n\n01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:24.940\nWho is Milch?\n\n01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.300\nWhat is Milch?\n\n01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.300\nWhere is Milch?\n\n01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:28.300\nYeah.\n\n01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:29.300\nHere.\n\n01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:30.300\nOh.\n\n01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:31.300\nI feel like this.\n\n01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.900\nI am David Milch.\n\n01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:36.420\nI feel like David Milch.\n\n01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:38.860\nDo not mock me with.\n\n01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:44.740\nI feel like David Milch to you.\n\n01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.580\nI will.\n\n01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:50.060\nI feel like David Milch.\n\n01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:55.420\nI arise in the places where I feel welcome.\n\n01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.820\nWhere I'm feeling David Milch.\n\n01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:59.180\nI'm feeling David Milch.\n\n01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:02.620\nDavid Milch is not feeling you.\n\n01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.940\nDavid Milch will depart.\n\n01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:09.940\nThat's white noise, man.\n\n01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:10.940\nYou guys fucked it.\n\n01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:11.940\nWhat did you do?\n\n01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:12.940\nYou scared David Milch away.\n\n01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:13.940\nHe's here.\n\n01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:14.940\nHe's always here watching.\n\n01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:15.940\nAll right.\n\n01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:17.740\nWell, David Milch is in my heart.\n\n01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.740\nYeah.\n\n01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.460\nAs long as we remember.\n\n01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.460\nJust remember him.\n\n01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:22.460\nRemember.\n\n01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:23.460\nRemember me.\n\n01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.460\nRemember Milch.\n\n01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:25.460\nRemember.\n\n01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:28.340\nYou guys see Coco.\n\n01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:29.980\nIt's about remembering people.\n\n01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.620\nThe sign language gorilla.\n\n01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:36.140\nYou'll never forget Coco.\n\n01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.140\nNo.\n\n01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.140\nShe will.\n\n01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:40.060\nThat gorilla has made me cry so many times.\n\n01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:43.900\nI saw a GIF of Robin Williams tickling Coco.\n\n01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.020\nKill you every time.\n\n01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:51.860\nAnd I got all misty eyed because Coco was laughing and doing like this and Robin was\n\n01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:58.860\ngoing, huh, huh, huh, Mindy, and it was beautiful.\n\n01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:00.740\nI just said GIF instead of GIF.\n\n01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:01.740\nI know.\n\n01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:02.740\nI noticed that.\n\n01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:04.540\nDid you guys think I was smart?\n\n01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:05.540\nYeah.\n\n01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.540\nYou know, I thought.\n\n01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.540\nIt's a graphic interface.\n\n01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:21.540\nI thought maybe Monster Palooza was sharing a hotel with WIAC2.html.\n\n01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:23.100\nBecause you were listening.\n\n01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:25.220\nI heard the GIF pronunciation.\n\n01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.220\nYeah.\n\n01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.020\nI meant Monster Palooza.\n\n01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:31.700\nYeah, I heard that.\n\n01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:39.140\nYou went to a fucking convention in a, you know what, I'm not, it's not my job to be\n\n01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:40.140\njealous of you.\n\n01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.140\nI don't care.\n\n01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:45.060\nNo, it is not your job to care about me at all.\n\n01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:46.060\nYeah.\n\n01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:47.380\nNo, you don't get paid for caring.\n\n01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:50.300\nI wasn't put here for that.\n\n01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.140\nI'll tell you what you were put here for.\n\n01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:54.060\nOh my God, David Milch.\n\n01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:55.060\nMilch is back.\n\n01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:56.060\nYeah.\n\n01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.340\nCan you talk some sense into Harmon?\n\n01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:00.020\nHe's really bumming my nuts.\n\n01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.020\nHe's being mean.\n\n01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:02.740\nHe's being, you know, Harmon, you're being mean.\n\n01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:04.420\nYeah, but that's what you're supposed to be.\n\n01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:08.020\nRob, Schrab, you were written to antagonize Dan Harmon.\n\n01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.020\nI'm written.\n\n01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:14.620\nYes, you are written and not well.\n\n01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:17.740\nYou are a placeholder character.\n\n01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:18.740\nJesus, Milch.\n\n01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:19.740\nLighten up.\n\n01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:20.740\nSchrab's awesome.\n\n01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:21.740\nThat's really mean.\n\n01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:22.740\nWhat the fuck are you doing?\n\n01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:23.740\nIt's one of the sweetest guys on earth.\n\n01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:26.740\nHe tweets dogs that are, he saves dogs.\n\n01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:32.740\nDuncan Trussell, I added you in the third draft of this reality in response to a network\n\n01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:33.740\nnote.\n\n01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:34.740\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.260\nMilch, what the fuck?\n\n01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:37.260\nI was being sarcastic.\n\n01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:38.260\nOh my God.\n\n01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:39.260\nI'm sarcastic.\n\n01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:42.820\nI'm like a sarcastic, shitty thought of yours.\n\n01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:48.100\nI wanted to teach them a lesson for asking the writer to add intelligence.\n\n01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:51.980\nI don't feel like Dan Milch to you at all anymore.\n\n01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:53.300\nExcuse me?\n\n01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.700\nI don't feel like David Milch at all to you.\n\n01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:59.060\nI think David Milch needs to get Milched.\n\n01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:00.580\nThat's a problem.\n\n01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:05.900\nNo character can Milch, David Milch.\n\n01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.940\nI Milch you.\n\n01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:08.940\nWhat?\n\n01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.940\nFuck.\n\n01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:10.940\nHey, David.\n\n01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:11.940\nYes.\n\n01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:19.460\nDid you see Dredd, the Judge Dredd movie?\n\n01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.460\nYeah.\n\n01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.460\nYes.\n\n01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.740\nDid you like it?\n\n01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:24.020\nI wrote it.\n\n01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:25.020\nYou wrote it?\n\n01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:26.620\nI wrote the people that wrote it.\n\n01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:28.340\nDid you like them?\n\n01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:31.420\nI don't like any of my characters.\n\n01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:32.420\nOkay.\n\n01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:34.420\nWho wrote you, Milch?\n\n01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:46.980\nA question asked only on the page.\n\n01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:51.300\nFor those off the page, no, there is no answer.\n\n01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:52.460\nThere definitely isn't an answer.\n\n01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:53.540\nThat's not an answer.\n\n01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:55.060\nThat's a shit answer, Milch.\n\n01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:56.060\nWho wrote you?\n\n01:46:56.060 --> 01:47:02.860\nYou sit on the margins and between my brads and ponder your fate and your monologues.\n\n01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:06.220\nYou don't understand how it works.\n\n01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:09.220\nOff the page, no one asks those questions.\n\n01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:12.420\nOff the page, there is only Milch.\n\n01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:15.540\nSo you just have always been forever?\n\n01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:20.540\nThere was a time before Milch.\n\n01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:21.540\nBM?\n\n01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:22.540\nBM?\n\n01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:23.540\nYes.\n\n01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:36.180\nSo BM was literally the time before you.\n\n01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:38.820\nYou're the result of BM.\n\n01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:39.820\nIt's a paradoxical expression.\n\n01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:41.860\nHave you ever thought of that, Milch?\n\n01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:42.860\nHow's that feel?\n\n01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:45.140\nYou're just a bow movement, Milch.\n\n01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:48.940\nYou're just a thing that the universe shat out and started writing characters.\n\n01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:50.860\nGot all milch-y.\n\n01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.980\nCame out all milch-y.\n\n01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:55.660\nI feel unwelcome here.\n\n01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:56.660\nI will fade out.\n\n01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:00.980\nGo back to Milmac.\n\n01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:02.660\nGo back to Milmac, Milch.\n\n01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:03.660\nCool.\n\n01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:05.620\nYou got a scared Milch away, I guess.\n\n01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:06.620\nBM.\n\n01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:07.620\nPost-milch.\n\n01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:08.620\nI like it.\n\n01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:10.900\nFucking Milmac cat-eating, motherfucker.\n\n01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:11.900\nAngry old Milch.\n\n01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:12.900\nYeah.\n\n01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:13.900\nSomeway.\n\n01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:14.900\nGulking around the universe.\n\n01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:15.900\nGo away, Milch.\n\n01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:18.180\nWhat happened to David Milch after he put his dick in the beans?\n\n01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:19.180\nDid he?\n\n01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.980\nWho the fuck is David Milch?\n\n01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:23.100\nHe's the creator of NYPD Blue and Deadwood.\n\n01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.900\nHe put his dick in beans?\n\n01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:30.020\nBeans is this woman that was a set decorator on the show.\n\n01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:32.660\nHe's the craziest person I've never heard of.\n\n01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:40.380\nWe were told on the anecdote where David Milch at the craft service table or at a party\n\n01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.380\nor something.\n\n01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:44.860\nI don't know what the fuck you're talking about.\n\n01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.860\nMaybe it was.\n\n01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:46.860\nYeah, I'm speaking out of school.\n\n01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:55.340\nI was probably from, I don't know, it was like, you were hanging out with Chris McKenna.\n\n01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:58.220\nBut there were a bunch of people that saw it.\n\n01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.180\nDavid Milch put his dick in some beans.\n\n01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:01.180\nWhat?\n\n01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:02.180\nAnd then a-\n\n01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:04.380\nHow does that ruin you or how does that get out there?\n\n01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:05.380\nAt a party.\n\n01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:08.140\nWell, because there was a bunch of it, because he was like, basically like he took some beans\n\n01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:13.340\nfrom the craft service table and then he like, he like had his dick in beans and then like-\n\n01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:20.620\nAnd somebody said, everybody's like waiting in line to get their food and then he's just\n\n01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:24.980\nlike doing that and everybody's like, do you mind?\n\n01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:29.580\nThe way I was introduced to the concept was that there were writers who were saying like\n\n01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:36.020\nthey, among each other, like they use the expression like, oh man, I really put my dick\n\n01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:37.020\nin the beans.\n\n01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:38.020\nLike to mean like-\n\n01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:39.020\nIs it supposed to feel good?\n\n01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:40.020\nI bet it feels great.\n\n01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.020\nIs that what he did?\n\n01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:45.260\nI mean, no, he wasn't doing it to feel good, he was doing a bit about like, and I know\n\n01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:48.460\nyou have more questions about why he did it, but I don't know, but this is like, their\n\n01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:52.060\nperspective was that he had did it and then it was like, there was a weird silence and\n\n01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:57.980\nbecause the guy in charge put his dick in beans and then so then thereafter it was an\n\n01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:05.780\nexpression among these writers of like, oh shit, I overreached, I was feeling my oats\n\n01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:15.500\nor I kind of like, I just sort of fell on my face or, but I did it because I wanted\n\n01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:16.500\nit to be-\n\n01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:21.340\nI feel like the scenario was like, Milt was like trying to be funny, whips out his dick,\n\n01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:25.540\nputs it in the beans and everybody kind of went, oh, they were like, yep, floor and then\n\n01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:30.620\nhe went, oh, too far, all right, I guess we're not going to laugh at me putting my dick in\n\n01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:33.820\nthe beans, okay.\n\n01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:36.820\nWhat did you bring to the table, bananas?\n\n01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:42.220\nBut I do think it would, I mean, not that it doesn't matter because it's really missing\n\n01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:47.580\nthe point, but I do think that like, it would probably feel good to put your dick in beans.\n\n01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:50.540\nWarm or cold, don't even think about it, warm or cold.\n\n01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:51.540\nOkay, great point.\n\n01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:52.540\nIt's not going to be-\n\n01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.540\nDon't even think about it.\n\n01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:58.260\nWhat do you mean, of course warm, warm beans, yeah, cold beans, you want to put your dick\n\n01:50:58.260 --> 01:50:59.860\nin warm beans, not cold beans.\n\n01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:07.100\nDo you ever do food sex stuff like, I tried that in my 20s because you know, you see it\n\n01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:10.460\nin like Playboy videos or whatever and they're like, oh, let's get out the honey and the\n\n01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:11.460\nwhipped cream and then it's like-\n\n01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:12.460\nOkay, yeah.\n\n01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:13.460\nIt took one time to-\n\n01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:14.460\nI was like, yeah.\n\n01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:15.460\nThis is gross.\n\n01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.460\nIt's all pu-bee.\n\n01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:17.460\nIt's all pu-bee.\n\n01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:21.780\nYou're like sticky, like who wants to, like if someone came up to you and said like, hey,\n\n01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:25.900\ndo you want to eat a Hershey's kiss off of Steve Levy's arm, I wouldn't be like, oh, yeah,\n\n01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:27.180\nI'm about to cum.\n\n01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.980\nSo why would you think that your-\n\n01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:29.980\nSpeak for yourself.\n\n01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:34.980\nYour girlfriend would suddenly become sexy if she had whipped cream like now, like a-\n\n01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:38.460\nwhipped cream is usually experienced in a contained environment.\n\n01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:39.980\nIt's on top of frozen ice cream and stuff.\n\n01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:43.780\nYou put it on a tit and then it's like, now there's, you get to see what whipped cream\n\n01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:44.780\nis made of.\n\n01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:49.220\nYou ever like spill like soda on your like linoleum and then you don't get to it right\n\n01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:55.180\naway and then you walk across it with your socks and it's got like dog hair right?\n\n01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:56.180\nNow add cum.\n\n01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:57.180\nYeah.\n\n01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:00.460\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:01.460\nAll right.\n\n01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:08.020\nWell, should have started there, but that's another episode of Harmontown.\n\n01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:13.940\nI don't know the list of names that Jeff knows.\n\n01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:14.940\nThank you
