31:21.120\nI don't know if you know...\n\n31:21.120 --> 31:25.120\nThere's a little crest of energy that usually attends a Robin Williams appearance,\n\n31:25.120 --> 31:28.120\nwhether you're watching Comic Relief 7 or...\n\n31:28.120 --> 31:29.120\nAfterglow.\n\n31:29.120 --> 31:30.120\nWe afterglow right now.\n\n31:30.120 --> 31:31.120\nWe coast on that energy.\n\n31:31.120 --> 31:33.120\nWe ride that shockwave.\n\n31:33.120 --> 31:37.120\nLet's smoke a cigarette and go like, what the fuck was that?\n\n31:37.120 --> 31:40.120\nThat was a huge interstellar explosion.\n\n31:40.120 --> 31:44.120\nWe're going to ride that shockwave along the cosmos for quite a long time right now.\n\n31:44.120 --> 31:45.120\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n31:45.120 --> 31:46.120\nRemember all those sperm jokes?\n\n31:46.120 --> 31:47.120\nYeah, we did.\n\n31:47.120 --> 31:49.120\nRemember that little sperm movie?\n\n31:49.120 --> 31:51.120\nWhoa, like jelly.\n\n31:51.120 --> 31:54.120\nEric Idle and Robin Williams now have done...\n\n31:54.120 --> 31:56.120\nOh, Eric says hi, by the way.\n\n31:56.120 --> 31:58.120\nI was on the phone with the fuck that guy.\n\n31:58.120 --> 32:01.120\nHe calls the song that we sang, his song, by the way.\n\n32:01.120 --> 32:03.120\nHe's trying to steal that song.\n\n32:03.120 --> 32:05.120\nOur fuck your mama song.\n\n32:05.120 --> 32:10.120\nYeah, because we wrote that song and then we brought it over to his house,\n\n32:10.120 --> 32:12.120\nthat song that Eric Idle sang.\n\n32:12.120 --> 32:14.120\nAnd he picked up a guitar and instantly played it first time,\n\n32:14.120 --> 32:17.120\nalmost exactly as you guys heard it, if you've heard that episode of it,\n\n32:17.120 --> 32:18.120\nor you were here that night.\n\n32:18.120 --> 32:21.120\nAnd I was talking on the phone just now, and he's like,\n\n32:21.120 --> 32:24.120\nhe played my song recently, and I was like,\n\n32:24.120 --> 32:26.120\nI was like, no, no, we only did that one time.\n\n32:26.120 --> 32:28.120\nHe's like, you notice I call it my song.\n\n32:28.120 --> 32:30.120\nI sneaked that in there, you didn't even notice.\n\n32:30.120 --> 32:32.120\nAnd I was like, look, man, you can have it.\n\n32:32.120 --> 32:34.120\nWe're not making any money out of this.\n\n32:34.120 --> 32:36.120\nAnd he's like, you know, people think that that.\n\n32:36.120 --> 32:37.120\nYeah.\n\n32:37.120 --> 32:38.120\nAnd he was proud.\n\n32:38.120 --> 32:39.120\nI said, people think you wrote that.\n\n32:39.120 --> 32:41.120\nHe goes, of course they did.\n\n32:41.120 --> 32:42.120\nYeah.\n\n32:42.120 --> 32:43.120\nHe liked the quality.\n\n32:43.120 --> 32:44.120\nBecause it was good.\n\n32:44.120 --> 32:47.120\nBecause an Emmy-winning lyricist co-pended.\n\n32:47.120 --> 32:48.120\nYeah.\n\n32:48.120 --> 32:49.120\nAll right.\n\n32:49.120 --> 32:50.120\nAnyways.\n\n32:50.120 --> 32:54.120\nKobe Bryant is here, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n32:54.120 --> 32:56.120\nApril Fools.\n\n32:56.120 --> 32:57.120\nSpencer, how are you?\n\n32:57.120 --> 32:59.120\nYou were at Easter with Thesedans as well.\n\n32:59.120 --> 33:00.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n33:00.120 --> 33:05.120\nYeah, I came late because I had a breakdown at Vons.\n\n33:05.120 --> 33:06.120\nYeah.\n\n33:06.120 --> 33:07.120\nOh, yeah, you mentioned that.\n\n33:07.120 --> 33:10.120\nI knew I was going to bring it down after that.\n\n33:10.120 --> 33:11.120\nI'm sorry, guys.\n\n33:11.120 --> 33:12.120\nIt's cool.\n\n33:12.120 --> 33:13.120\nAnyway, yeah.\n\n33:13.120 --> 33:15.120\nYou had an emotional breakdown?\n\n33:15.120 --> 33:16.120\nYeah.\n\n33:16.120 --> 33:18.120\nI didn't know what food to bring.\n\n33:18.120 --> 33:19.120\nAll right.\n\n33:19.120 --> 33:20.120\nWell, go into detail here.\n\n33:20.120 --> 33:21.120\nYou walk in the front door.\n\n33:21.120 --> 33:23.120\nBecause first of all, you had to know.\n\n33:23.120 --> 33:26.120\nWell, before that, I was just wrestling with it.\n\n33:26.120 --> 33:29.120\nBecause I make a good cheese dip.\n\n33:29.120 --> 33:30.120\nI make a good cheese dip.\n\n33:30.120 --> 33:32.120\nYou keep talking about this cheese dip that we've never seen.\n\n33:32.120 --> 33:33.120\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n33:33.120 --> 33:34.120\nYou're not.\n\n33:34.120 --> 33:35.120\nIt's not vegetarian, Jeff.\n\n33:35.120 --> 33:36.120\nI am.\n\n33:36.120 --> 33:37.120\nSo fuck off.\n\n33:37.120 --> 33:38.120\nWell, you give us the recipe?\n\n33:38.120 --> 33:42.120\nBecause, I mean, one-third of a good Harmontown show is a Robin Williams appearance.\n\n33:42.120 --> 33:45.120\nAnd another third of a classic Harmontown is a good recipe.\n\n33:45.120 --> 33:46.120\nDo you honestly want the recipe?\n\n33:46.120 --> 33:47.120\nYes, yes.\n\n33:47.120 --> 33:48.120\nWhat is it?\n\n33:48.120 --> 33:49.120\nOkay.\n\n33:49.120 --> 33:50.120\nOkay.\n\n33:50.120 --> 33:51.120\nWell, first, you take approximately.\n\n33:51.120 --> 33:52.120\nHe's talking.\n\n33:52.120 --> 33:53.120\nWhat was this?\n\n33:53.120 --> 33:54.120\nHe was talking.\n\n33:54.120 --> 33:55.120\nOh, he makes good tiny sandwiches.\n\n33:55.120 --> 33:59.120\nOh, yeah, I made some cucumber sandwiches for a tea party.\n\n33:59.120 --> 34:01.120\nIt was pretty, pretty.\n\n34:01.120 --> 34:02.120\nYou have little tea parties?\n\n34:02.120 --> 34:03.120\nNo, I don't.\n\n34:03.120 --> 34:04.120\nThat was a one-time thing.\n\n34:04.120 --> 34:06.120\nAnd it wasn't.\n\n34:06.120 --> 34:07.120\nSymphony wasn't.\n\n34:07.120 --> 34:09.120\nReaching for the tea.\n\n34:09.120 --> 34:12.120\nYou realize it's 11.\n\n34:12.120 --> 34:15.120\nYeah, that's not the first thought that interests people's heads when they look at you.\n\n34:15.120 --> 34:17.120\nLike, I bet he makes a good tiny sandwich.\n\n34:17.120 --> 34:18.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n34:18.120 --> 34:22.120\nCucumber sandwiches, I don't, I mean, she thought they're, I don't think they're that good.\n\n34:22.120 --> 34:23.120\nThey don't taste like much.\n\n34:23.120 --> 34:27.120\nSo you're, so you're thinking in your head, I'm going to go over to Harmon's for Easter.\n\n34:27.120 --> 34:31.120\nIf I'm going to go to Harmon's for Easter, I will have brought something.\n\n34:31.120 --> 34:32.120\nI will have brought value.\n\n34:32.120 --> 34:36.120\nBecause of something that you imposed on yourself, not because you thought that anyone...\n\n34:36.120 --> 34:38.120\nBecause my presence is an imposition.\n\n34:38.120 --> 34:39.120\nAh.\n\n34:39.120 --> 34:42.120\nSo I come bearing gifts, you know, to cover it up.\n\n34:42.120 --> 34:43.120\nInteresting.\n\n34:43.120 --> 34:44.120\nSo, yeah.\n\n34:44.120 --> 34:49.120\nBut yeah, so, I mean, that was, I was thinking the cheese dip, and I was on my couch for a while.\n\n34:49.120 --> 34:52.120\nAnd then I got, I was like, I'll figure it out when I get the vans.\n\n34:52.120 --> 34:56.120\nStared at the bacon, stared at the cream cheese, stared at the cakes, you know.\n\n34:56.120 --> 34:58.120\nWhen you're staring at bacon, what are you thinking?\n\n34:58.120 --> 35:02.120\nI'm thinking the bacon cheese dip is going to cost about $13.40 or so.\n\n35:02.120 --> 35:03.120\nAh.\n\n35:03.120 --> 35:05.120\nSo you're juggling finances.\n\n35:05.120 --> 35:07.120\nNo, it's just, that's just what I was thinking about.\n\n35:07.120 --> 35:12.120\nAnd I mean, I think it was just me being anxious using any excuse, and price was the excuse.\n\n35:12.120 --> 35:13.120\nRight.\n\n35:13.120 --> 35:14.120\nBut I mean, I don't know.\n\n35:14.120 --> 35:17.120\nWas it, was it performance anxiety that you would wonder if people would like the dip?\n\n35:17.120 --> 35:18.120\nIt was going to be bomb.\n\n35:18.120 --> 35:19.120\nDon't, don't worry.\n\n35:19.120 --> 35:25.120\nYou know what I think is really ironic about this, is that Dino, who cooked for, uh, Easter,\n\n35:25.120 --> 35:31.120\nwho loves to cook, and who's a great comedy writer, the reason he loves to cook, we were talking about it,\n\n35:31.120 --> 35:38.120\nis that, uh, when you cook, it excuses you from all of these things that normally hang up a writer,\n\n35:38.120 --> 35:40.120\nbecause you get some broccoli.\n\n35:40.120 --> 35:44.120\nThe broccoli is either going to be used or not used, and in either case it's going to rot.\n\n35:44.120 --> 35:48.120\nAnd the best case scenario is it goes in someone's stomach and comes out a turd and goes down a toilet.\n\n35:48.120 --> 35:53.120\nLike, there is no good reason to get hung up on, on, on, on making a meal.\n\n35:53.120 --> 35:57.120\nLike, like, he uses it to release himself from the things that normally hang us up.\n\n35:57.120 --> 36:02.120\nAnd here you are, a creator of worlds, of realms, a master of realms.\n\n36:02.120 --> 36:07.120\nEntire dungeons, and biographies, and lifetimes, holding fate in your very hands,\n\n36:07.120 --> 36:09.120\nand, and you're staring at the bacon.\n\n36:09.120 --> 36:11.120\nAnd you can't, yeah, it hung you up.\n\n36:11.120 --> 36:12.120\nAnd the cakes.\n\n36:12.120 --> 36:13.120\nYeah.\n\n36:13.120 --> 36:15.120\nIt hung you up the way that I'm hung up on my Fox script.\n\n36:15.120 --> 36:16.120\nYeah.\n\n36:16.120 --> 36:19.120\nAnd you're sitting there going, this has to be the new community.\n\n36:19.120 --> 36:22.120\nI feel like this audience deserves, like, while they're waiting in line,\n\n36:22.120 --> 36:24.120\nthe little cheese dip while they're waiting out there.\n\n36:24.120 --> 36:29.120\nI can bring something, I mean, I've thought, I've honestly thought about it.\n\n36:29.120 --> 36:31.120\nI'd rather get out the recipe.\n\n36:31.120 --> 36:37.120\nWe should, we should rent a station wagon, and like, and, and, and, and have it,\n\n36:37.120 --> 36:40.120\nlike, you know, pull it up to the curb when they're waiting outside the comic book store,\n\n36:40.120 --> 36:44.120\nand then we'll put out like a little sterno cans and like, give them like hot snacks.\n\n36:44.120 --> 36:46.120\nI think it's illegal.\n\n36:46.120 --> 36:48.120\nWell, they have like taco trucks.\n\n36:48.120 --> 36:50.120\nYeah, well those guys have licenses and stuff.\n\n36:50.120 --> 36:51.120\nNo, they shouldn't.\n\n36:51.120 --> 36:52.120\nThey shouldn't.\n\n36:52.120 --> 36:53.120\nThey just get shut down.\n\n36:53.120 --> 36:55.120\nLike, there was an awesome taco truck.\n\n36:55.120 --> 36:56.120\nWe used to go to that.\n\n36:56.120 --> 36:58.120\nThe taco truck owner in the back just loses shit.\n\n36:58.120 --> 37:00.120\nThey just get shut down though.\n\n37:00.120 --> 37:01.120\nLike, they do.\n\n37:01.120 --> 37:02.120\nIt sucks.\n\n37:02.120 --> 37:03.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n37:03.120 --> 37:08.120\nSpeaking of things that we should do, I flirted with this thing a couple weeks ago,\n\n37:08.120 --> 37:11.120\nwhere we said like, oh, you know, because we keep talking about movies,\n\n37:11.120 --> 37:15.120\nand we watch shitty movies, and then we talk about the movies, and then I threw out the idea of,\n\n37:15.120 --> 37:19.120\noh, like Oprah's book club, let's assign a movie, and then we can talk about it next week.\n\n37:19.120 --> 37:20.120\nAh.\n\n37:20.120 --> 37:21.120\nAnd I've gotten a couple tweets.\n\n37:21.120 --> 37:25.120\nMore importantly, I do think it's kind of a good idea, because it takes no effort at all.\n\n37:25.120 --> 37:31.120\nLike, if we could just make up our mind to, as a group, it's not compulsive, compulsory,\n\n37:31.120 --> 37:33.120\nbut we could just assign a movie.\n\n37:33.120 --> 37:36.120\nLet's just make up our mind to watch one thing before next recording.\n\n37:36.120 --> 37:37.120\nWhat are you thinking?\n\n37:37.120 --> 37:38.120\nI don't know.\n\n37:38.120 --> 37:39.120\nNine to five.\n\n37:39.120 --> 37:40.120\nI don't know.\n\n37:40.120 --> 37:41.120\nI don't know.\n\n37:41.120 --> 37:42.120\nI don't know.\n\n37:42.120 --> 37:43.120\nI take back nine to five.\n\n37:43.120 --> 37:45.120\nAny suggestions out there?\n\n37:45.120 --> 37:46.120\nWicker Man.\n\n37:46.120 --> 37:47.120\nWicker Man.\n\n37:47.120 --> 37:51.120\nRoboCop 2 Classic, Wicker Man, almost two...\n\n37:51.120 --> 37:52.120\nI haven't seen it.\n\n37:52.120 --> 37:55.120\nWell, I mean, it's so, it's such a fucking like, it's like...\n\n37:55.120 --> 37:58.120\nLet's all watch the six hour version of Fanny and Alexander.\n\n37:58.120 --> 38:01.120\nMaybe something will come up organically.\n\n38:01.120 --> 38:04.120\nRemind me at the end of the show, when I'm standing here like a dumbass going,\n\n38:04.120 --> 38:08.120\nhow do we end the show if we haven't come up with something organically?\n\n38:08.120 --> 38:11.120\nRemind me that we haven't yet thought of something,\n\n38:11.120 --> 38:14.120\nand then I'll at least have something to do before we leave,\n\n38:14.120 --> 38:16.120\ninstead of rapping about fucking your mom.\n\n38:16.120 --> 38:18.120\nLet's get McGathey up here.\n\n38:18.120 --> 38:19.120\nMcGathey!\n\n38:19.120 --> 38:30.120\nI love in a dark, dark, cynical way,\n\n38:30.120 --> 38:34.120\nI love that Kumeil, who's been here for like five weeks in a row,\n\n38:34.120 --> 38:38.120\nhe's got an early call tomorrow and he always emails me and goes like,\n\n38:38.120 --> 38:40.120\nI'm not going to be able to make it.\n\n38:40.120 --> 38:42.120\nWhat did I miss?\n\n38:42.120 --> 38:43.120\nThis is kind of fine.\n\n38:43.120 --> 38:44.120\nI think he would have enjoyed probably.\n\n38:44.120 --> 38:48.120\nI wonder if people that are listening to this know that this is the April Fool's Day episode,\n\n38:48.120 --> 38:51.120\nthey're going to think that these are really good impressions of those two guys.\n\n38:51.120 --> 38:55.120\nAnd it was all Kobe Bryant doing all the voices.\n\n38:55.120 --> 38:57.120\nIt was Andy Dick.\n\n38:57.120 --> 38:59.120\nHello, Erin, how are you?\n\n38:59.120 --> 39:00.120\nI'm doing good.\n\n39:00.120 --> 39:01.120\nAre they really gone?\n\n39:01.120 --> 39:02.120\nYeah.\n\n39:02.120 --> 39:03.120\nOkay.\n\n39:03.120 --> 39:05.120\nYeah, I'm glad that they had the balls to go.\n\n39:05.120 --> 39:06.120\nLet's get out of here.\n\n39:06.120 --> 39:07.120\nI suppose.\n\n39:07.120 --> 39:08.120\nWe would have, yeah.\n\n39:08.120 --> 39:11.120\nLet's play hard to get.\n\n39:11.120 --> 39:13.120\nWell, I'm not going to play hard to get.\n\n39:13.120 --> 39:15.120\nRobin had a good time, maybe he'll come back again.\n\n39:15.120 --> 39:17.120\nIf we milk him dry, he'll be exhausted.\n\n39:17.120 --> 39:18.120\nI love that guy.\n\n39:18.120 --> 39:22.120\nI just couldn't get past the idea of him playing Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n39:22.120 --> 39:24.120\nIt was a little intriguing.\n\n39:24.120 --> 39:29.120\nI really wanted to ask him to play Lorraine and just let me stand behind him\n\n39:29.120 --> 39:31.120\nand just like, smell him.\n\n39:31.120 --> 39:33.120\nAll right.\n\n39:33.120 --> 39:35.120\nI just met him a couple of nights ago for the first time.\n\n39:35.120 --> 39:37.120\nThat's why he's coming up and messing up my hair.\n\n39:37.120 --> 39:39.120\nWe're like, he was being palsy-walsy.\n\n39:39.120 --> 39:40.120\nThat's so horrible.\n\n39:40.120 --> 39:44.120\nI was doing an improv show at UCB and I ran backstage really quick\n\n39:44.120 --> 39:46.120\nbecause I was doing some sort of dumb bit and he was standing there\n\n39:46.120 --> 39:48.120\nand I was like, ah!\n\n39:48.120 --> 39:50.120\nAnd he's like, ah, is it okay if I go on stage?\n\n39:50.120 --> 39:52.120\nI was like, ah!\n\n39:52.120 --> 39:55.120\nAnd he came out on stage and then afterwards, it was right after his divorce\n\n39:55.120 --> 39:59.120\nand him and I talked about his divorce for a couple of hours.\n\n39:59.120 --> 40:01.120\nI wonder why.\n\n40:01.120 --> 40:02.120\nWhat?\n\n40:02.120 --> 40:04.120\nNothing. I'm just being jealous.\n\n40:04.120 --> 40:06.120\nDon't worry.\n\n40:06.120 --> 40:08.120\nHis dick tastes like garbage.\n\n40:12.120 --> 40:13.120\nNo, it didn't.\n\n40:13.120 --> 40:14.120\nNo, I don't know.\n\n40:14.120 --> 40:17.120\nIt's just honey-soaked garbage.\n\n40:17.120 --> 40:19.120\nAlways went in so many directions.\n\n40:19.120 --> 40:20.120\nSo much energy.\n\n40:20.120 --> 40:24.120\nPart of his dick to the great Mr. Chee impression.\n\n40:24.120 --> 40:28.120\nHis balls had some insights about gay guys.\n\n40:28.120 --> 40:29.120\nIt was great.\n\n40:29.120 --> 40:33.120\nAnd he kept on, in our conversation about his ex-wife,\n\n40:33.120 --> 40:38.120\nhe kept on referencing Hook, which was thrilling.\n\n40:38.120 --> 40:41.120\nI love Hook, but kept on saying like, well, Dustin and Hook,\n\n40:41.120 --> 40:44.120\nbut over and over again, well, when I was doing Hook,\n\n40:44.120 --> 40:46.120\nI was like, this is the best, no one's around.\n\n40:46.120 --> 40:48.120\nI totally love it.\n\n40:48.120 --> 40:50.120\nAll right, one more bit of business before we start to end this.\n\n40:50.120 --> 40:53.120\nIs he really not here?\n\n40:53.120 --> 40:55.120\nAll right, I'm just making sure.\n\n40:55.120 --> 40:57.120\nYeah, I don't know what that O was for.\n\n40:57.120 --> 41:00.120\nI hope it was either going, oh, don't be a star fucker.\n\n41:00.120 --> 41:02.120\nStop that star-fucking.\n\n41:02.120 --> 41:05.120\nSomeone here, you talk about divorce with a guy.\n\n41:05.120 --> 41:06.120\nI know.\n\n41:06.120 --> 41:09.120\nI really love Robin Williams a whole lot.\n\n41:09.120 --> 41:11.120\nI feel like he's my father.\n\n41:15.120 --> 41:16.120\nHe's probably still out in the store.\n\n41:16.120 --> 41:17.120\nGo look.\n\n41:17.120 --> 41:19.120\nNo, I think maybe he's...\n\n41:19.120 --> 41:20.120\nRobin!\n\n41:20.120 --> 41:21.120\nYeah, get out of here.\n\n41:21.120 --> 41:22.120\nGo marry him.\n\n41:22.120 --> 41:23.120\nJesus.\n\n41:23.120 --> 41:25.120\nGo read Mobius together.\n\n41:25.120 --> 41:27.120\nI'm sure when Billy Crystal comes by next week,\n\n41:27.120 --> 41:28.120\nit won't change, right?\n\n41:28.120 --> 41:29.120\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n41:29.120 --> 41:31.120\nIt will change, it will change.\n\n41:31.120 --> 41:32.120\nIs he still booked?\n\n41:32.120 --> 41:33.120\nHe's coming?\n\n41:33.120 --> 41:34.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n41:34.120 --> 41:35.120\nOkay, great.\n\n41:37.120 --> 41:40.120\nOne more bit of business that's not going to impress anyone,\n\n41:40.120 --> 41:42.120\nbut it's just too weird to pass up.\n\n41:42.120 --> 41:44.120\nI feel like God speaks through kind of weird coincidences,\n\n41:44.120 --> 41:46.120\nand that's why I have to address it.\n\n41:46.120 --> 41:52.120\nLast week in my insane, crazy two five-hour energy wrap\n\n41:52.120 --> 41:54.120\nat the end of the show,\n\n41:54.120 --> 41:56.120\nI had to rhyme something like do it or through it\n\n41:56.120 --> 41:58.120\nor go to it or something,\n\n41:58.120 --> 42:00.120\nand I rhymed it with the name Ray Pruitt,\n\n42:00.120 --> 42:01.120\nand immediately said,\n\n42:01.120 --> 42:03.120\nhe's a friend of ours.\n\n42:03.120 --> 42:04.120\nHe is a friend of ours.\n\n42:04.120 --> 42:05.120\nThat's right.\n\n42:05.120 --> 42:06.120\nHe's from Austin, Texas,\n\n42:06.120 --> 42:07.120\nand he's here tonight by coincidence.\n\n42:07.120 --> 42:08.120\nRay Pruitt, we stand up.\n\n42:08.120 --> 42:10.120\nRay Pruitt, come up here.\n\n42:10.120 --> 42:11.120\nGet on stage, Ray.\n\n42:11.120 --> 42:12.120\nJust...\n\n42:16.120 --> 42:19.120\nJust tell people your name's Ray Pruitt first of all.\n\n42:19.120 --> 42:20.120\nI got ID.\n\n42:20.120 --> 42:22.120\nYeah, well, they won't be able to see that.\n\n42:22.120 --> 42:25.120\nYeah, he was behind the eight ball on a Ryan,\n\n42:25.120 --> 42:26.120\nwhere I rhymed through it,\n\n42:26.120 --> 42:28.120\nand he said like I was Ray Pruitt.\n\n42:28.120 --> 42:29.120\nHe goes, he's a real person.\n\n42:29.120 --> 42:30.120\nHe's a friend of mine.\n\n42:30.120 --> 42:31.120\nYeah.\n\n42:31.120 --> 42:32.120\nI knew it.\n\n42:32.120 --> 42:33.120\nLike I said, the audience doesn't care.\n\n42:33.120 --> 42:34.120\nSo Ray Pruitt, you're in town.\n\n42:34.120 --> 42:35.120\nYou're building something for Coachella,\n\n42:35.120 --> 42:39.120\nand Ray is a big aficionado of the weird,\n\n42:39.120 --> 42:41.120\nI would say, right?\n\n42:41.120 --> 42:43.120\nLet's go with that.\n\n42:43.120 --> 42:45.120\nRay was in the news once.\n\n42:45.120 --> 42:48.120\nTell them about the parade that you invaded.\n\n42:48.120 --> 42:50.120\nOh, that poor town of Leaky, Texas.\n\n42:50.120 --> 42:53.120\nLeaky, Texas.\n\n42:53.120 --> 42:59.120\nWe did Harlem Globe Trotters versus the fake\n\n42:59.120 --> 43:01.120\nMiss America pageant,\n\n43:01.120 --> 43:06.120\nand this town is maybe 500 people.\n\n43:06.120 --> 43:08.120\nIt made their newspaper twice.\n\n43:08.120 --> 43:10.120\nBut it was a bunch of guys in drag.\n\n43:10.120 --> 43:14.120\nIt was a bunch of city fruity fruits coming in.\n\n43:14.120 --> 43:15.120\nYeah, but it was 30 people,\n\n43:15.120 --> 43:17.120\nbut only two of us were gay.\n\n43:17.120 --> 43:18.120\nOh, really?\n\n43:18.120 --> 43:20.120\nThat's all the photo.\n\n43:20.120 --> 43:22.120\nIt looks like a gay pride parade broke out in it.\n\n43:22.120 --> 43:23.120\nThe children flashing people,\n\n43:23.120 --> 43:25.120\nit made papers in Dallas.\n\n43:25.120 --> 43:29.120\nI promise I did not take off a single bit of anything.\n\n43:29.120 --> 43:31.120\nPruitt, Pruitt, stay here,\n\n43:31.120 --> 43:32.120\nbecause Camille's not here,\n\n43:32.120 --> 43:33.120\nand we got a character.\n\n43:33.120 --> 43:35.120\nCan you play Dungeons & Dragons with us?\n\n43:35.120 --> 43:36.120\nYeah.\n\n43:36.120 --> 43:37.120\nAll right.\n\n43:37.120 --> 43:38.120\nYou don't have to know anything about it.\n\n43:38.120 --> 43:39.120\nHave you ever played before?\n\n43:39.120 --> 43:40.120\nWhen I was nine.\n\n43:40.120 --> 43:41.120\nAll right.\n\n43:41.120 --> 43:42.120\nYeah, cool.\n\n43:42.120 --> 43:43.120\nThis is Spencer.\n\n43:43.120 --> 43:44.120\nSpencer Ray.\n\n43:44.120 --> 43:45.120\nSpencer is our Dungeon Master.\n\n43:45.120 --> 43:46.120\nI looked at you in the dream room,\n\n43:46.120 --> 43:49.120\nand I didn't say anything because I'm awkward.\n\n43:49.120 --> 43:50.120\nDitto.\n\n43:50.120 --> 43:51.120\nYeah, sorry.\n\n43:51.120 --> 43:52.120\nAll right.\n\n43:52.120 --> 43:53.120\nShould we let this rip?\n\n43:53.120 --> 43:54.120\nLet's do it.\n\n43:54.120 --> 43:55.120\nAll right.\n\n43:55.120 --> 43:56.120\nLet's get those character sheets out,\n\n43:56.120 --> 43:57.120\nand Spencer, if you would,\n\n43:57.120 --> 44:02.120\nwould you catch us up to speed?\n\n44:02.120 --> 44:06.120\nLast time our heroes,\n\n44:06.120 --> 44:08.120\nafter having slain a dragon,\n\n44:08.120 --> 44:10.120\npicked over the treasure and remains\n\n44:10.120 --> 44:12.120\nin the room that they were last in.\n\n44:12.120 --> 44:14.120\nSensing a break in the action,\n\n44:14.120 --> 44:16.120\nSharpie and Christopher are set to work\n\n44:16.120 --> 44:18.120\nstudying the bloody tome once more,\n\n44:18.120 --> 44:20.120\ntrying to uncover its secrets.\n\n44:20.120 --> 44:22.120\nMulraine, in a bid to claim the dragon's\n\n44:22.120 --> 44:24.120\nmystical and magical horns,\n\n44:24.120 --> 44:26.120\ntied various swords to her limbs.\n\n44:26.120 --> 44:28.120\nQuickly disrobing and playing a tune\n\n44:28.120 --> 44:30.120\non his loot of charming,\n\n44:30.120 --> 44:32.120\nthe barbarian transfixed the party for a time,\n\n44:32.120 --> 44:34.120\nwhich led to a short spat.\n\n44:34.120 --> 44:36.120\nThe tension was only broken\n\n44:36.120 --> 44:39.120\nby Mulraine's successful horn harvest.\n\n44:39.120 --> 44:41.120\nThe Ranger presented her prize\n\n44:41.120 --> 44:42.120\nto the wise wizard,\n\n44:42.120 --> 44:44.120\nbut Sharpie rebuffed her with a reference\n\n44:44.120 --> 44:46.120\nto bags before climbing a pile of treasure\n\n44:46.120 --> 44:49.120\nto have a semi-public breakdown.\n\n44:49.120 --> 44:51.120\nThe realization had set in.\n\n44:51.120 --> 44:53.120\nThey were far, far from home,\n\n44:53.120 --> 44:57.120\nand had no way to return to the material plane.\n\n44:57.120 --> 45:00.120\nVery little happened last episode.\n\n45:00.120 --> 45:03.120\nIt actually turned into kind of\n\n45:03.120 --> 45:06.120\nan unwitting tribute to reality television.\n\n45:06.120 --> 45:08.120\nOur guest was Genevieve Pearson\n\n45:08.120 --> 45:10.120\nfrom a reality show,\n\n45:10.120 --> 45:12.120\nand what we failed to point out,\n\n45:12.120 --> 45:14.120\nwhich would have turned the whole thing in our favor,\n\n45:14.120 --> 45:16.120\nwas that the Dungeons & Dragons session\n\n45:16.120 --> 45:18.120\nwas very much like a shitty B.H.1 show.\n\n45:18.120 --> 45:21.120\nSo, do we need to take inventory\n\n45:21.120 --> 45:24.120\nof all of our treasure and move on, right?\n\n45:24.120 --> 45:26.120\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Let me get these...\n\n45:26.120 --> 45:28.120\nI should have done that.\n\n45:28.120 --> 45:30.120\nOh, Blueprotter's sensor, that's cool.\n\n45:30.120 --> 45:32.120\nRay, to catch you up, you're playing Kumail Nanjiani's part.\n\n45:32.120 --> 45:34.120\nHis character is a thief, right?\n\n45:34.120 --> 45:35.120\nYeah, a rogue.\n\n45:35.120 --> 45:36.120\nA rogue named...\n\n45:36.120 --> 45:37.120\nChris de Burghh.\n\n45:37.120 --> 45:39.120\nChris de Burghh, the guy who wrote The Lady in Red.\n\n45:39.120 --> 45:40.120\nYou're familiar with him?\n\n45:40.120 --> 45:41.120\nPerfect.\n\n45:41.120 --> 45:42.120\nYeah, okay.\n\n45:42.120 --> 45:44.120\nHe's a one-hit wonder, kind of down on his luck at that.\n\n45:44.120 --> 45:46.120\nHe's obsessed with dicks.\n\n45:49.120 --> 45:52.120\nHere's some things to talk about while Spencer gets situated.\n\n45:52.120 --> 45:55.120\nAaron and I went to SeaWorld in San Diego.\n\n45:55.120 --> 45:58.120\nMore like SeaWorld.\n\n46:00.120 --> 46:01.120\nWe would...\n\n46:01.120 --> 46:02.120\nWe'd see children cry.\n\n46:02.120 --> 46:04.120\nWe were there to pick up our puppy,\n\n46:04.120 --> 46:07.120\nor not pick up, pick out our puppy.\n\n46:07.120 --> 46:10.120\nNot at SeaWorld, no.\n\n46:10.120 --> 46:13.120\nWe were 20 miles outside San Diego.\n\n46:13.120 --> 46:15.120\nAlpine.\n\n46:15.120 --> 46:18.120\nPeople would go to that lady's place.\n\n46:21.120 --> 46:23.120\nWe went to this lady's place,\n\n46:23.120 --> 46:26.120\nand she's got the laundry basket full of puppies.\n\n46:26.120 --> 46:28.120\nThen we met the parents of the puppies,\n\n46:28.120 --> 46:32.120\nand we picked out the puppy, our golden doodle.\n\n46:32.120 --> 46:33.120\nYeah, we picked him out.\n\n46:33.120 --> 46:35.120\nI saw the photo, pretty adorable.\n\n46:35.120 --> 46:37.120\nWe still haven't chosen a name for him yet.\n\n46:37.120 --> 46:38.120\nYeah.\n\n46:38.120 --> 46:40.120\nWe were talking about naming him.\n\n46:40.120 --> 46:44.120\nHe reminded us of an older Jewish comedian.\n\n46:44.120 --> 46:48.120\nHe kind of has a weird, kind of like a Sid look to him,\n\n46:48.120 --> 46:49.120\nor a George.\n\n46:49.120 --> 46:52.120\nYeah, so it's plenty, or Saul.\n\n46:52.120 --> 46:53.120\nYeah.\n\n46:53.120 --> 46:54.120\nI like Harvey.\n\n46:54.120 --> 46:55.120\nHarvey's good.\n\n46:55.120 --> 46:56.120\nHarvey, yeah.\n\n46:56.120 --> 46:58.120\nHarvey, I like, because unlike the other ones,\n\n46:58.120 --> 47:00.120\nit won't be like a hipster, like Silver Lake.\n\n47:00.120 --> 47:03.120\nOh, you named your dog, like an old man's name.\n\n47:03.120 --> 47:04.120\nHarvey's like...\n\n47:04.120 --> 47:06.120\nOh, Harvey, Harvey, Harvey.\n\n47:06.120 --> 47:08.120\nCan we talk about Leonard?\n\n47:08.120 --> 47:09.120\nLeonard, oh, Leonard, I didn't...\n\n47:09.120 --> 47:11.120\nLenny, I liked, but then I thought Leonard...\n\n47:11.120 --> 47:13.120\nDan didn't want to name the dog Leonard,\n\n47:13.120 --> 47:14.120\nbecause of the character and community.\n\n47:14.120 --> 47:16.120\nHe thought it would be too...\n\n47:16.120 --> 47:18.120\nHe thought people would think that he was...\n\n47:18.120 --> 47:22.120\nBecause every wall of my house, when you come into my home,\n\n47:22.120 --> 47:24.120\nhas community art all over it.\n\n47:24.120 --> 47:25.120\nAnd I'm fine with that.\n\n47:25.120 --> 47:28.120\nBut the dog is then named like,\n\n47:28.120 --> 47:30.120\nHey, Starburns, come here, Starburns.\n\n47:30.120 --> 47:33.120\nI feel like people might leave sad.\n\n47:33.120 --> 47:34.120\nYeah.\n\n47:34.120 --> 47:35.120\nI just...\n\n47:35.120 --> 47:38.120\nIt has nothing to do with me wanting to create it.\n\n47:38.120 --> 47:41.120\nI just don't want people to be sad when they come to my house.\n\n47:41.120 --> 47:43.120\nWe also got really excited at the idea\n\n47:43.120 --> 47:45.120\nof calling the dog Steve A.G.\n\n47:45.120 --> 47:48.120\nBecause you kind of...\n\n47:48.120 --> 47:49.120\nHe kind of looks like Steve A.G.\n\n47:49.120 --> 47:50.120\nI don't think Steve...\n\n47:50.120 --> 47:52.120\nNo, Steve A.G. has a real thought.\n\n47:52.120 --> 47:53.120\nHe doesn't...\n\n47:53.120 --> 47:56.120\nHe does not like when people compare him to other people.\n\n47:56.120 --> 47:58.120\nYeah, I mean, I see somebody out in public,\n\n47:58.120 --> 47:59.120\nand he looks like Steve A.G.,\n\n47:59.120 --> 48:00.120\nand then on Instagram, I'm like,\n\n48:00.120 --> 48:01.120\nHey, it looks like Steve A.G.\n\n48:01.120 --> 48:03.120\nDid you see my Mexican Doug Benson at the Sushi Place?\n\n48:03.120 --> 48:04.120\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n48:04.120 --> 48:06.120\nYeah, there's a guy I'm telling you.\n\n48:06.120 --> 48:07.120\nMexican Doug Benson.\n\n48:07.120 --> 48:08.120\nMexican Doug Benson.\n\n48:08.120 --> 48:11.120\nI like to think Doug Benson would be on board that one.\n\n48:11.120 --> 48:12.120\nYeah.\n\n48:12.120 --> 48:14.120\nBut maybe the dog's name is Harvey.\n\n48:14.120 --> 48:15.120\nMexican people maybe not so much.\n\n48:15.120 --> 48:16.120\nRight.\n\n48:16.120 --> 48:17.120\nWhy not?\n\n48:17.120 --> 48:21.120\nMaybe all are so much easier to watch from down there.\n\n48:21.120 --> 48:23.120\nYeah.\n\n48:23.120 --> 48:25.120\nIt's a tough company up here, man.\n\n48:25.120 --> 48:26.120\nYeah.\n\n48:26.120 --> 48:27.120\nAll right, let's do this thing.\n\n48:27.120 --> 48:29.120\nSo let's inventory what we got here.\n\n48:29.120 --> 48:32.120\nSo the last thing you got was the soul of growth.\n\n48:32.120 --> 48:33.120\nRight.\n\n48:33.120 --> 48:34.120\nSo that was the important thing.\n\n48:34.120 --> 48:36.120\nI mean, but you got other stuff too.\n\n48:36.120 --> 48:37.120\nWhat is the soul of growth exactly?\n\n48:37.120 --> 48:39.120\nYou don't know what it is exactly.\n\n48:39.120 --> 48:42.120\nHowever, you know, you do...\n\n48:42.120 --> 48:45.120\nMulrainee, do you have Knowledge Nature?\n\n48:45.120 --> 48:47.120\nYeah, so much.\n\n48:47.120 --> 48:51.120\nSo the thing is, some of you guys have skills called knowledge,\n\n48:51.120 --> 48:54.120\nwhich lets you think about the world that your character inhabits\n\n48:54.120 --> 48:56.120\nand glean some useful information.\n\n48:56.120 --> 48:58.120\nSo Sharpie has some knowledge skills,\n\n48:58.120 --> 49:00.120\nand I think you have knowledge and nature.\n\n49:00.120 --> 49:02.120\nSo what's your skill rank and knowledge and nature?\n\n49:02.120 --> 49:03.120\nSeven.\n\n49:03.120 --> 49:04.120\nAwesome.\n\n49:04.120 --> 49:06.120\nSo you're going to get a plus seven.\n\n49:06.120 --> 49:07.120\nThanks.\n\n49:07.120 --> 49:08.120\nAll right.\n\n49:08.120 --> 49:10.120\nSo you discover, I mean, you don't discover,\n\n49:10.120 --> 49:14.120\nyou rack your mind, and you know that the soul of growth\n\n49:14.120 --> 49:16.120\nis a great artifact of power,\n\n49:16.120 --> 49:22.120\nand it's supposed to embody, like, the vital force that makes plants grow.\n\n49:22.120 --> 49:24.120\nIt's like the reason why plants grow.\n\n49:24.120 --> 49:27.120\nIt has strong associations with druids, and druids love it,\n\n49:27.120 --> 49:32.120\nand you know, natural creatures and various things like that, you know, elves.\n\n49:32.120 --> 49:34.120\nSo we now control...\n\n49:34.120 --> 49:37.120\nWe now have the thing that controls whether or not plants grow?\n\n49:37.120 --> 49:40.120\nAccording to the legends and superstitions, of course.\n\n49:40.120 --> 49:42.120\nBut yeah, yeah, definitely.\n\n49:42.120 --> 49:45.120\nLittle do we know, in a few thousand years this will be available\n\n49:45.120 --> 49:47.120\nat every home improvement store.\n\n49:47.120 --> 49:52.120\nIt's magic, baby.\n\n49:52.120 --> 49:54.120\nYou talking about Chiapet?\n\n49:54.120 --> 49:55.120\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n49:55.120 --> 49:56.120\nJust fertilizer.\n\n49:56.120 --> 49:58.120\nOh, okay.\n\n49:58.120 --> 50:01.120\nAll right, so let's get the hell out of here.\n\n50:01.120 --> 50:03.120\nWell, that's the thing.\n\n50:03.120 --> 50:04.120\nHuh?\n\n50:04.120 --> 50:05.120\nThat's the thing.\n\n50:05.120 --> 50:06.120\nOkay, I look around for a way to get out.\n\n50:06.120 --> 50:12.120\nThe door that you came in, the massive metal door, has closed itself,\n\n50:12.120 --> 50:15.120\nand you're entrapped within it.\n\n50:15.120 --> 50:17.120\nWhose turn is that?\n\n50:17.120 --> 50:18.120\nYour turn.\n\n50:18.120 --> 50:22.120\nCan I summon my beloved horse Coco?\n\n50:22.120 --> 50:25.120\nCould she maybe nestle the door open?\n\n50:25.120 --> 50:30.120\nYou can definitely summon her, whether or not she shows up.\n\n50:30.120 --> 50:33.120\nYou don't have to be a jerk about it.\n\n50:33.120 --> 50:35.120\nYeah, that's brilliant, because when the horse walks in,\n\n50:35.120 --> 50:37.120\nwe'll go, let's go out that way.\n\n50:37.120 --> 50:38.120\nIf a horse could find a way.\n\n50:38.120 --> 50:42.120\nI'm thinking that the horse could...\n\n50:42.120 --> 50:43.120\nIt's like a sim.\n\n50:43.120 --> 50:45.120\nIf it's out there, it'll try to...\n\n50:45.120 --> 50:49.120\nWell, she'll use her hooves, and she'll go,\n\n50:49.120 --> 50:52.120\nthere's a specific word for this that I'm not remembering.\n\n50:52.120 --> 50:53.120\nAdam.\n\n50:53.120 --> 50:54.120\nI love you.\n\n50:54.120 --> 51:02.120\nAdam Goldberg called me at 8am the other morning.\n\n51:02.120 --> 51:04.120\nHow come Adam...\n\n51:04.120 --> 51:05.120\nSince you stopped...\n\n51:05.120 --> 51:06.120\nSorry.\n\n51:06.120 --> 51:08.120\nNo, it's his fault.\n\n51:08.120 --> 51:12.120\nHow come every week Adam Goldberg comes to the show,\n\n51:12.120 --> 51:15.120\nand it seems like after every show,\n\n51:15.120 --> 51:18.120\nhe tells us that he's not going to be around anymore?\n\n51:18.120 --> 51:21.120\nYeah, so Adam told me last week that he was now a Night Watchman,\n\n51:21.120 --> 51:24.120\nand so he wasn't... Okay, but then you said that you weren't...\n\n51:24.120 --> 51:26.120\nyou weren't able to come to shows anymore\n\n51:26.120 --> 51:27.120\nbecause you were a Night Watchman.\n\n51:27.120 --> 51:30.120\nThey gave me different days off than I wanted, so...\n\n51:30.120 --> 51:31.120\nOkay.\n\n51:31.120 --> 51:32.120\nPrevious to that...\n\n51:32.120 --> 51:34.120\nHe doesn't murder me.\n\n51:34.120 --> 51:35.120\nIt's all fine.\n\n51:35.120 --> 51:36.120\nNope, dad.\n\n51:36.120 --> 51:37.120\nWell, it's okay.\n\n51:37.120 --> 51:39.120\nIt's nice to see you.\n\n51:39.120 --> 51:40.120\nI know, I know you're not going to murder me.\n\n51:40.120 --> 51:42.120\nPrevious to that, it was that you were going to go work\n\n51:42.120 --> 51:43.120\non the Shark Movie, right?\n\n51:43.120 --> 51:45.120\nI got fired from that, but I didn't get fired from this yet.\n\n51:45.120 --> 51:50.120\nBut basically, if you look at behavior instead of language,\n\n51:50.120 --> 51:53.120\nwhich I prefer to do, you're here every week,\n\n51:53.120 --> 51:55.120\nand you say every week,\n\n51:55.120 --> 51:56.120\nI'm not going to be here anymore.\n\n51:56.120 --> 51:58.120\nIt's a durable urgency.\n\n51:58.120 --> 52:00.120\nYou're not an optimist, you're a pessimist,\n\n52:00.120 --> 52:01.120\nbecause you call and you say,\n\n52:01.120 --> 52:04.120\nlook, I'm not going to be able to hang out,\n\n52:04.120 --> 52:06.120\nso we better get it in,\n\n52:06.120 --> 52:08.120\nbecause I'm not going to be here.\n\n52:08.120 --> 52:09.120\nBetter get it in.\n\n52:09.120 --> 52:10.120\nYeah, better get it in.\n\n52:10.120 --> 52:12.120\nBetter get his dick in.\n\n52:12.120 --> 52:14.120\nI better get it in.\n\n52:14.120 --> 52:15.120\nAnyway.\n\n52:15.120 --> 52:18.120\nAll right, so you summon your horse.\n\n52:18.120 --> 52:21.120\nNothing happens.\n\n52:21.120 --> 52:23.120\nThe horse doesn't even come?\n\n52:23.120 --> 52:26.120\nWell, you're like several layers underground in a dungeon,\n\n52:26.120 --> 52:27.120\nin the way you can.\n\n52:27.120 --> 52:28.120\nYou're like several layers.\n\n52:28.120 --> 52:29.120\nThat's true.\n\n52:29.120 --> 52:30.120\nI'm a dungeon master.\n\n52:30.120 --> 52:31.120\nAnd there's no...\n\n52:31.120 --> 52:32.120\nDungeon Snap.\n\n52:32.120 --> 52:33.120\nDungeon Snap.\n\n52:33.120 --> 52:36.120\nSo there's no other visible...\n\n52:36.120 --> 52:41.120\nI look around the walls to try to detect any sort of other egress.\n\n52:41.120 --> 52:43.120\nThe ceilings go up really high,\n\n52:43.120 --> 52:45.120\npast the lighting of the chamber.\n\n52:45.120 --> 52:47.120\nYou can't see how far they go up,\n\n52:47.120 --> 52:48.120\nbut they definitely go up.\n\n52:48.120 --> 52:50.120\nWhat about that crack where the dragon came through?\n\n52:50.120 --> 52:51.120\nI mean, you could go in there.\n\n52:51.120 --> 52:52.120\nAll right.\n\n52:52.120 --> 52:54.120\nI poked my head down in the crack.\n\n52:54.120 --> 52:57.120\nYou see...\n\n52:57.120 --> 52:58.120\nIt's sliding.\n\n52:58.120 --> 53:00.120\nYou're not deaf.\n\n53:00.120 --> 53:02.120\nIt's fine, yeah.\n\n53:02.120 --> 53:05.120\nSliding your head into the crack.\n\n53:05.120 --> 53:11.120\nYou see the faint demarcations of what appears to be a smallish dragon.\n\n53:11.120 --> 53:13.120\nA smallish dragon's down there?\n\n53:13.120 --> 53:15.120\nIt appears to be.\n\n53:15.120 --> 53:18.120\nMaybe I can make it believe it's my child,\n\n53:18.120 --> 53:21.120\nand I'll be like Khaleesi, and I'll have dragons.\n\n53:21.120 --> 53:24.120\nThese are the demarcations of...\n\n53:24.120 --> 53:25.120\nMisspoke.\n\n53:25.120 --> 53:28.120\nOh.\n\n53:28.120 --> 53:31.120\nYou see the faint outline of a dimly,\n\n53:31.120 --> 53:33.120\nunlit, dragon-esque shape.\n\n53:33.120 --> 53:36.120\nThis is through a crack on the floor?\n\n53:36.120 --> 53:39.120\nThere's a crack where the big dragon came out.\n\n53:39.120 --> 53:41.120\nSo there's a dragon baby in there?\n\n53:41.120 --> 53:43.120\nI don't know.\n\n53:43.120 --> 53:45.120\nHow so coy?\n\n53:45.120 --> 53:47.120\nHow big is it?\n\n53:47.120 --> 53:50.120\nI mean, from what you can see, it looks maybe about three feet tall.\n\n53:50.120 --> 53:51.120\nAll right.\n\n53:51.120 --> 53:53.120\nHow far a drop is it down to the cave?\n\n53:53.120 --> 53:54.120\nIt's not a drop.\n\n53:54.120 --> 53:56.120\nIt's about 12 feet in.\n\n53:56.120 --> 53:57.120\nOh, okay.\n\n53:57.120 --> 53:58.120\nSo I can just walk into the crack?\n\n53:58.120 --> 53:59.120\nYeah.\n\n53:59.120 --> 54:00.120\nOkay.\n\n54:00.120 --> 54:01.120\nIs there anything else in the cave?\n\n54:01.120 --> 54:02.120\nYeah, totally.\n\n54:02.120 --> 54:03.120\nLet's check it out.\n\n54:03.120 --> 54:04.120\nAll right.\n\n54:04.120 --> 54:05.120\nWell, you check it out.\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:08.120\nYou see a couple, you know, staff-like implements.\n\n54:08.120 --> 54:12.120\nThey look like maybe rods or sticks.\n\n54:12.120 --> 54:13.120\nSeveral of them.\n\n54:13.120 --> 54:15.120\nLike five.\n\n54:15.120 --> 54:16.120\nYeah, five.\n\n54:16.120 --> 54:17.120\nJust sticking out of the ground?\n\n54:17.120 --> 54:18.120\nYeah.\n\n54:18.120 --> 54:20.120\nYou can't see too well unless you have low light vision.\n\n54:20.120 --> 54:21.120\nI think I do, don't I?\n\n54:21.120 --> 54:22.120\nOh, you can see them just fine.\n\n54:22.120 --> 54:25.120\nYeah, I didn't know them.\n\n54:25.120 --> 54:26.120\nMy mistake.\n\n54:26.120 --> 54:27.120\nYeah, yeah, I've got low light vision.\n\n54:27.120 --> 54:29.120\nTypically, I play with a lot of humans.\n\n54:29.120 --> 54:31.120\nYeah, anyway.\n\n54:31.120 --> 54:35.120\nThe thing that I was coyly phrasing as a dragon\n\n54:35.120 --> 54:38.120\nis instead a dragon-shaped statue made out of jade.\n\n54:38.120 --> 54:41.120\nIt's massive, and you can tell it's worth a shit ton of money.\n\n54:41.120 --> 54:42.120\nOoh.\n\n54:42.120 --> 54:47.120\nI detect traps.\n\n54:47.120 --> 54:50.120\nI think I also do that.\n\n54:50.120 --> 54:51.120\nYou all got Christian Brooks coming in.\n\n54:51.120 --> 54:52.120\nChris, get in here.\n\n54:52.120 --> 54:53.120\nCheck this out.\n\n54:53.120 --> 54:57.120\nI detect traps at a plus two.\n\n54:57.120 --> 54:59.120\nDetecting traps as a team.\n\n54:59.120 --> 55:01.120\nYou scarcely, you don't scarcely,\n\n55:01.120 --> 55:06.120\nyou just determine that there don't seem to be any traps.\n\n55:06.120 --> 55:07.120\nAll right.\n\n55:07.120 --> 55:11.120\nI'm going to take the statue and try to lift it off.\n\n55:11.120 --> 55:12.120\nIt's on the pedestals, sir?\n\n55:12.120 --> 55:13.120\nIt's not.\n\n55:13.120 --> 55:16.120\nIt's just kind of like, it's kind of like it's knocked over.\n\n55:16.120 --> 55:17.120\nReally?\n\n55:17.120 --> 55:19.120\nIs it light enough for me to carry?\n\n55:19.120 --> 55:20.120\nIt's very heavy.\n\n55:20.120 --> 55:21.120\nI mean, you could drag it.\n\n55:21.120 --> 55:23.120\nYeah, yeah, you could drag it, but you can't really lift it.\n\n55:23.120 --> 55:25.120\nIs it worth dragging a giant statue around?\n\n55:25.120 --> 55:28.120\nI mean, you have a bag of holding, which can like,\n\n55:28.120 --> 55:30.120\nwhen you put it in the bag of holding, it stops being heavy.\n\n55:30.120 --> 55:31.120\nOh, okay.\n\n55:31.120 --> 55:32.120\nI toss the statue in my bag of holding.\n\n55:32.120 --> 55:34.120\nYeah, okay, cool.\n\n55:34.120 --> 55:35.120\nThen there was the sticks, right?\n\n55:35.120 --> 55:36.120\nThe sticks.\n\n55:36.120 --> 55:37.120\nRight, yeah.\n\n55:37.120 --> 55:40.120\nSo you see, two of them are actually javelins,\n\n55:40.120 --> 55:42.120\nand two of them appear to be bows,\n\n55:42.120 --> 55:45.120\nand one of them appears to be like a quarter staff.\n\n55:45.120 --> 55:46.120\nOh, these are weapons that we can take.\n\n55:46.120 --> 55:47.120\nYeah.\n\n55:47.120 --> 55:49.120\nI mentioned Malrin's going to want that bow.\n\n55:49.120 --> 55:50.120\nCan we all fit through this crack?\n\n55:50.120 --> 55:51.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n55:51.120 --> 55:52.120\nCome on in.\n\n55:52.120 --> 55:53.120\nAll right.\n\n55:53.120 --> 55:54.120\nThe cave is great.\n\n55:54.120 --> 55:55.120\nYou guys get in here.\n\n55:55.120 --> 55:56.120\nHey, what's going on?\n\n55:56.120 --> 55:58.120\nI just stole the statue.\n\n55:58.120 --> 56:00.120\nYou guys can't see as well.\n\n56:00.120 --> 56:01.120\nAaron can see good.\n\n56:01.120 --> 56:03.120\nJeff can see good.\n\n56:03.120 --> 56:05.120\nAll right, well, I'm sure I got to cast a light.\n\n56:05.120 --> 56:06.120\nOkay.\n\n56:06.120 --> 56:11.120\nI cast it on the end of my thumb.\n\n56:11.120 --> 56:12.120\nOkay.\n\n56:12.120 --> 56:17.120\nAnd I hold my thumb up around like a zippo.\n\n56:17.120 --> 56:21.120\nThat's Dungeons and Dragons funny.\n\n56:21.120 --> 56:22.120\nIt's just natural.\n\n56:22.120 --> 56:24.120\nActually, let me do it at the end of one of these staffs\n\n56:24.120 --> 56:25.120\nthat we're stealing.\n\n56:25.120 --> 56:26.120\nOkay.\n\n56:26.120 --> 56:27.120\nYeah, that's easier.\n\n56:27.120 --> 56:29.120\nThe staff you grab that begins glowing\n\n56:29.120 --> 56:32.120\nappears to be in the shape of a serpent.\n\n56:32.120 --> 56:37.120\nIt feels like snake skin under your grasp, but firm.\n\n56:37.120 --> 56:38.120\nSneaky staff, guys.\n\n56:38.120 --> 56:40.120\nThat's a magic staff probably, right?\n\n56:40.120 --> 56:41.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n56:41.120 --> 56:42.120\nMost of them are.\n\n56:42.120 --> 56:43.120\nMost of them are.\n\n56:43.120 --> 56:44.120\nYou barely ever find a staff in this game\n\n56:44.120 --> 56:45.120\nthat was just like,\n\n56:45.120 --> 56:49.120\nan old man needed help walking.\n\n56:49.120 --> 56:52.120\nI check out the javelin.\n\n56:52.120 --> 56:54.120\nThere's two javelins.\n\n56:54.120 --> 56:56.120\nThey're inscribed with lightning bolts,\n\n56:56.120 --> 56:59.120\nand they're covered in silver.\n\n56:59.120 --> 57:02.120\nAll right.\n\n57:02.120 --> 57:03.120\nI take one of them,\n\n57:03.120 --> 57:05.120\nand Chris, do you want the other javelin?\n\n57:05.120 --> 57:06.120\nYes.\n\n57:06.120 --> 57:08.120\nI would like a javelin, please.\n\n57:08.120 --> 57:14.120\nI would like a silver lightning bolt javelin.\n\n57:14.120 --> 57:16.120\nThen there was the two bows.\n\n57:16.120 --> 57:17.120\nOne of them is a long bow,\n\n57:17.120 --> 57:19.120\nand one of them is a short bow.\n\n57:19.120 --> 57:21.120\nI would like a bow.\n\n57:21.120 --> 57:23.120\nYou're proficient with the long bow as it happens.\n\n57:23.120 --> 57:24.120\nWell, I'm a little gal.\n\n57:24.120 --> 57:25.120\nI'll take the short bow.\n\n57:25.120 --> 57:26.120\nHow about that?\n\n57:26.120 --> 57:27.120\nWhatever.\n\n57:27.120 --> 57:28.120\nWhat's your dexterity?\n\n57:28.120 --> 57:30.120\nI don't know.\n\n57:30.120 --> 57:34.120\nWhere does it say dexterity?\n\n57:34.120 --> 57:35.120\nIt's up at the top left.\n\n57:35.120 --> 57:38.120\nIt's under 14 plus 2 ability modifier.\n\n57:38.120 --> 57:40.120\nSo you're going to be able to shoot it,\n\n57:40.120 --> 57:42.120\nbut not amazingly, but yeah.\n\n57:42.120 --> 57:43.120\nAll right.\n\n57:43.120 --> 57:44.120\nI take it anyway.\n\n57:44.120 --> 57:45.120\nAll right.\n\n57:45.120 --> 57:46.120\nSo I take the long bow.\n\n57:46.120 --> 57:47.120\nThere you go.\n\n57:47.120 --> 57:49.120\nAll right.\n\n57:49.120 --> 57:52.120\nYou also see two smallish chests,\n\n57:52.120 --> 57:54.120\none of which is very ornate,\n\n57:54.120 --> 57:57.120\nand it appears to be leafed in gold.\n\n57:57.120 --> 58:01.120\nThe other is a simple wooden box.\n\n58:01.120 --> 58:05.120\nI'll detect trap on that.\n\n58:05.120 --> 58:08.120\nVery good, buddy.\n\n58:08.120 --> 58:10.120\nWith your accent, it sounds so much like\n\n58:10.120 --> 58:14.120\njust like a TBS game show.\n\n58:14.120 --> 58:16.120\nI'll detect trap on that.\n\n58:16.120 --> 58:17.120\nHowie Mandel goes,\n\n58:17.120 --> 58:19.120\nall right, let's detect trap on it.\n\n58:19.120 --> 58:23.120\nIt's a boat.\n\n58:23.120 --> 58:25.120\nYou detect no traps.\n\n58:25.120 --> 58:26.120\nThere should be more traps.\n\n58:26.120 --> 58:29.120\nWell, let's open that second one.\n\n58:29.120 --> 58:30.120\nAll right.\n\n58:30.120 --> 58:31.120\nWhich one?\n\n58:31.120 --> 58:32.120\nThe wooden one.\n\n58:32.120 --> 58:33.120\nOpening the wooden chest,\n\n58:33.120 --> 58:38.120\nyou see a pair of dark gobbles.\n\n58:38.120 --> 58:41.120\nSteampunk.\n\n58:41.120 --> 58:44.120\nI'll put them on.\n\n58:44.120 --> 58:45.120\nAs you put them on,\n\n58:45.120 --> 58:48.120\nyou recognize that you can see perfectly in the dark.\n\n58:48.120 --> 58:56.120\nOh.\n\n58:56.120 --> 58:57.120\nWhere's my pen?\n\n58:57.120 --> 58:58.120\nI'm going to write that shit down.\n\n58:58.120 --> 59:01.120\nI now see in the dark.\n\n59:01.120 --> 59:02.120\nHe'll add it to you.\n\n59:02.120 --> 59:03.120\nHe'll do it later.\n\n59:03.120 --> 59:04.120\nHe's a dungeon master.\n\n59:04.120 --> 59:06.120\nThat's good for a rogue, though.\n\n59:06.120 --> 59:07.120\nYou're a thief.\n\n59:07.120 --> 59:08.120\nThat's good for you.\n\n59:08.120 --> 59:10.120\nWith your new dark vision,\n\n59:10.120 --> 59:12.120\nwith which you can see in the night,\n\n59:12.120 --> 59:14.120\nyou see at the end of the crack,\n\n59:14.120 --> 59:16.120\nthere seems to be a slight tear\n\n59:16.120 --> 59:18.120\nthat's even darker than black\n\n59:18.120 --> 59:20.120\nin the back of the cave.\n\n59:20.120 --> 59:21.120\nIs there a figurative tear,\n\n59:21.120 --> 59:27.120\nlike the tear between justice and vengeance?\n\n59:27.120 --> 59:29.120\nMore literal.\n\n59:29.120 --> 59:32.120\nLike the tear between a wall and another wall.\n\n59:32.120 --> 59:34.120\nYeah, okay.\n\n59:34.120 --> 59:37.120\nChris, can you see with those goggles?\n\n59:37.120 --> 59:39.120\nCan you see through that darker than black crack?\n\n59:39.120 --> 59:40.120\nYou can't.\n\n59:40.120 --> 59:41.120\nIt's the darkest of darks.\n\n59:41.120 --> 59:43.120\nCan I borrow your thumb there, E.T.?\n\n59:43.120 --> 59:44.120\nOh, yeah.\n\n59:44.120 --> 59:46.120\nYeah, my serpent staff.\n\n59:46.120 --> 59:48.120\nI mean, I hold the tear.\n\n59:48.120 --> 59:50.120\nCareful, shield your goggle eyes.\n\n59:50.120 --> 59:53.120\nI don't want to, you know, zero dark 30.\n\n59:53.120 --> 59:55.120\nYeah, that's Osama.\n\n59:55.120 --> 59:57.120\nThat's a good point.\n\n59:57.120 --> 59:59.120\nDoes that shed the light?\n\n59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.120\nOsama bin Laden.\n\n01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.120\nSorry, sorry.\n\n01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.120\nAnyway.\n\n01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.120\nThat's my favorite part of the trailer of that movie,\n\n01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.120\nwhich is the only part of the movie I saw.\n\n01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.120\nThere's the part of the movie,\n\n01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.120\nI was assuming it's impossible to do spoilers for zero dark 30s.\n\n01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.120\nI mean, kind of, we know how it ends,\n\n01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.120\nbut there's a point where they're like,\n\n01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120\nOsama.\n\n01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120\nOsama.\n\n01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120\nKind of lure them out.\n\n01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.120\nI like to think that's Chris Pratt, right?\n\n01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.120\nGuy from Parks and Rec.\n\n01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.120\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120\nContinue.\n\n01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.120\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.120\nSo as the staff nears the tear,\n\n01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.120\nyou notice that no light coming into it is exiting.\n\n01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.120\nIt seems very mysterious.\n\n01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.120\nWait, I'm sorry.\n\n01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.120\nI was thinking about vodka and what I just said.\n\n01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.120\nAnd so is your character.\n\n01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.120\nYou weren't paying attention.\n\n01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.120\nOkay.\n\n01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.120\nFill them in.\n\n01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.120\nTell them what happened.\n\n01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.120\nThe light doesn't shine far into this new part of the crack.\n\n01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120\nIs it big enough for people to go through?\n\n01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.120\nSo are we trying to get out?\n\n01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.120\nYou can't see it, I guess.\n\n01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.120\nWe're trying to get out through this crack,\n\n01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.120\nas opposed to the door.\n\n01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120\nThe door we can't get out.\n\n01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120\nRight.\n\n01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.120\nWe didn't try.\n\n01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.120\nTruth.\n\n01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.120\nBut it sounded pretty ominous that the door was shut behind us\n\n01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.120\nand for good.\n\n01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120\nI mean, maybe.\n\n01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120\nWe wouldn't have found the statue in the trunk.\n\n01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.120\nI mean, we would have sat there.\n\n01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.120\nI mean, these people, you could hear them wanting to kill themselves.\n\n01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120\nLike, you just feel it in the air.\n\n01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120\nRobin Williams came out.\n\n01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.120\nHe did sperm jokes.\n\n01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.120\nIt's just, I'm not saying, I'm not being self-defeating.\n\n01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.120\nI'm just saying, like, it was good that we didn't spend 48 minutes\n\n01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.120\nat a steel door.\n\n01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.120\nI think it's good to go through cracks.\n\n01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.120\nHim and Bob are dressed the same.\n\n01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120\nYeah.\n\n01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.120\nYeah, they're very cute.\n\n01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120\nYeah, they're so cute.\n\n01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.120\nThey were like you and Jeff.\n\n01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.120\nYeah.\n\n01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.120\nYeah.\n\n01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.120\nGood suits.\n\n01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120\nI opened up the ornate trunk.\n\n01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.120\nThe ornate trunk.\n\n01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.120\nYeah, the golden leafed one, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.120\nCorrect.\n\n01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.120\nOf course.\n\n01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.120\nOf course.\n\n01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.120\nWhat you see inside dazzles with a gleaning blue light.\n\n01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.120\nIt's curious service betrays its true nature.\n\n01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.120\nIt's one of the fragments of power.\n\n01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.120\nBut what it's doing on this plane, you have no idea.\n\n01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.120\nWhat it's doing is what?\n\n01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.120\nOn this plane, you have no idea.\n\n01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.120\nSo how many fragments do we have now?\n\n01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.120\nYou don't know.\n\n01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120\nOh, no.\n\n01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120\nOkay.\n\n01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.120\nSo you had the one initially, the one from Dark Star in this one.\n\n01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.120\nAnd your dad's last time we met, it was still in his colon.\n\n01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.120\nCorrect.\n\n01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.120\nSo you know of four, and you have three of them.\n\n01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.120\nAnd there might be more.\n\n01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120\nOkay.\n\n01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120\nThere's more, you guys.\n\n01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.120\nAll right.\n\n01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.120\nSharpie, you take that.\n\n01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.120\nYou're the magic man.\n\n01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.120\nI'll take the fragment.\n\n01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:38.120\nYou feel it pulse and shiver in your grasp.\n\n01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.120\nAnd then it stops.\n\n01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.120\nAll right.\n\n01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120\nOkay.\n\n01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.120\nCan that fragment glowing blue light?\n\n01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.120\nWill that shed any more light

trip leader I if I pull them all in like we're going through like a like\n\n01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:01.780\nwe're all at Disneyland or something like that show with the magic school bus\n\n01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:06.380\njust like that magic school bus yeah that was a great show and show with the\n\n01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:09.820\nmagic school bus so we all walk into the into the nude dimension slipping\n\n01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:13.780\nthrough the dark portal you find yourself in a bank of dark misty haze the\n\n01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.620\ninky black fog obscures your vision and you can't make out your surroundings\n\n01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:23.540\nyou can't even see the rift you came through then an indistinct hazy gray\n\n01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:29.300\ndisc floats lazily upwards and past the horizon and for a time you're bathed in\n\n01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:35.380\na slightly less form of dire darkness the closest you could consider light this\n\n01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:39.740\ngrayish light casts a pitch black shadow onto the floor and you can see your\n\n01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:44.660\nshadow dancing and twitching madly as the grayish light flickers suddenly the\n\n01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:47.900\nshadows on the floor peel off their points of connection with your feet and\n\n01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:52.980\nbegin to come away from your body oh shadows as your shadows detach you feel\n\n01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:59.540\nviolently ill for an intense few seconds before you even out you feel like\n\n01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.380\nyou've been seriously assaulted and weakened from losing your shadow jody\n\n01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:10.100\nfostered to mention you can just make out your shadows slip away into the dark\n\n01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:15.140\nlandscape before the hazy disc falls into the horizon it's like diminishing to\n\n01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.620\nnothing they stole our shadows their shadows maybe our shadows just left\n\n01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:23.620\npeter pants fell well when do we when do I mourn cocoa you in the front row on\n\n01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:31.700\nthe boat that you said something you knew what this was thank you that's what\n\n01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:35.780\nI was thinking about he said cocoa is in the other dimension my horse my beloved\n\n01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:42.500\nhorse and just lover is in the other side you should care too I do I do care\n\n01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.980\nI just said we had a really special time together I mean what the last time\n\n01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:51.220\nthat I fucked your horse a couple times I think right and it yes and it was\n\n01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.860\nconsensual it's consensual yeah that's okay yeah and all he got all the time\n\n01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:01.940\nI was a t-shirt so yeah okay can we summon the horse through this different\n\n01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:07.780\ndimension Spencer as it happens you can't at the moment hold on so so shadows\n\n01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:13.140\nleaving your bodies has actually caused some ability damage towards you so I\n\n01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:18.540\ncan update your sheet later but basically your bigger fish you guys yeah\n\n01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:24.780\nthe horse horse loss sure this is shadow loss Sharpey loses force strength and to\n\n01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:29.340\nconstitution quark loses

Burghh loses one strength and four constitutions she's a vastly weakened\n\n01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:44.020\nit's just about pooping what is constitutional constitution is your\n\n01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:49.860\nability to shrug off physical damage or resist your shape being shifted for\n\n01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:53.540\ninstance or you know if you've been poisoned that's constitution

copy plane of the material plane and\n\n01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:20.380\nas such things have shadow versions of themselves shadow shadow cocoa yeah but\n\n01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:25.700\nbut does it correspond to the real cocoa yeah so so this is like we can't hold\n\n01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:30.820\nher no you can shadows are I mean we'll try to let's just try to hold her how\n\n01:15:30.820 -->

01:23:41.980\nthe odds so like there would be a more connection we would be able to discuss\n\n01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:45.420\nsomething I don't know it's just a thought well there's a thought it's not a\n\n01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:50.260\ngood thought it's not you know God when God was creating the universe he he he\n\n01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:55.900\njust made it up he didn't he didn't like he just he just thought stuff like he\n\n01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:01.460\ndidn't he didn't think of stuff that he knew would work is that right yeah how\n\n01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.580\ndo you know that well because obviously it was the first time he did it otherwise\n\n01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:08.820\nit wasn't there was no how do you know that well because he did it the other\n\n01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:12.540\nwise it's dumb like why would we even write a Bible about it if he didn't\n\n01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:16.100\nlook it's got to be special right he made he there was nothing there was\n\n01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:20.700\nnothing it says it specifically says there was nothing and then it says that\n\n01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:25.580\nhe started making shit up yes kind of like your pee

in God Jeff do you think that there's an\n\n01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:40.860\nintelligence to the to the cosmos I think there is but in a way that we aren't\n\n01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:43.940\nweird that we'd be totally incapable of totally understanding yeah I think\n\n01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:47.420\nthere's a system of some kind if those field line if we if God were simple\n\n01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:50.220\nenough to understand we'd be too simple to understand even if that system is\n\n01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:55.860\nsimply just like I kind of like it's just kind of a throbbing like like jellyfish\n\n01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:58.660\nyeah but it is the cool thing it scientists are out there working and\n\n01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.740\nyou know looking smaller and smaller and smaller and

01:38:37.340\nso everything I do is subconscious yes so there's there's a fun note for you to\n\n01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:40.940\nend on I feel like you you crossed a threshold there and I'm proud of you oh\n\n01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:44.780\nyeah well I mean what about what Aaron's always up here is always up here and\n\n01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.100\nshe's really cool I love you you're my favorite part of the show do you feel\n\n01:38:48.100 --> 01:39:02.660\nlike like women women women on stage women women performing what's up with\n\n01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:09.900\nthat no where's that going do you do you think that I'm trying to figure out how\n\n01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:13.900\nto wait a way to phrase this without without loading it because it's easy to\n\n01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:18.700\nbe like like like politically correct and we can talk about how unfair the\n\n01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:22.780\nperformance world is to women but but and I'm not saying that it's not but I\n\n01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:26.460\nwant to figure out a way to actually intelligently like vivisect that and\n\n01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:30.340\nlook at the beating heart of whatever is happening it we Aaron and I were\n\n01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:36.220\ntalking about this women like without even knowing that we're doing it like\n\n01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:43.860\nwomen unlike men who just I think at the root of it I'm gonna talk try to talk\n\n01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:50.580\nthis through and I'm gonna sound like a fucking crazy person men are just like\n\n01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:54.260\nthese like doesn't matter if we're handsome doesn't matter if we're if we're\n\n01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:57.860\nugly doesn't matter what we are doesn't matter what role we occupy doesn't\n\n01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.460\nmatter if we have a bad back doesn't matter if one of our legs doesn't work\n\n01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:06.100\ndoesn't matter what like we like our role in the world is to kind of want and\n\n01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:11.700\nunlike shoot out torpedoes and kind of like try and either fail or succeed and\n\n01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:17.260\nI think that like women on stage like when women when women are performing in\n\n01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:21.700\nanything no matter how enlightened the venue no matter what the case like we\n\n01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:24.380\nAaron and I were trying to get to the bottom of this it's like there's a\n\n01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:30.020\nfucking tightrope you have to walk as a woman because the most progressive PC\n\n01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:37.100\nlike super modern metrosexual futuristic Blade Runner thinker is still\n\n01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:41.140\nbefore he's even thinking of it he's he's thinking of a woman as a woman and\n\n01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:45.620\nand kind of like there's it's like like the way Aaron put it was something like\n\n01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:50.660\nif you're if you're this they're disappointed in you if you're that\n\n01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:54.980\nthey're disappointed in you it's like like you it's the only way to describe\n\n01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:58.580\nit as a tightrope it's just I don't know what it's a tightrope between really but\n\n01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:01.700\nit's like you're doing some kind of balancing act all the time I feel like\n\n01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:05.380\nyou you addressed that with with Genevieve last week when you were talking\n\n01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:09.260\nabout her reception on the reality show she was on about something Kevin Smith\n\n01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.980\nsaid to her about oh you're a girl and you like comic books I mean that was\n\n01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:16.860\ninsane to me that was that was I mean like I'm really like I don't want to\n\n01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:22.220\nlike like give myself something to Alan Aldo like metal like I my thing is\n\n01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:27.380\nalways like I I just the same way with alcoholism or racism I want to cut\n\n01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:31.100\neveryone off at the pass I go fuck no I'm a misogynist I'm a sexist here's why\n\n01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:34.220\nbecause I don't want to have that conversation where it's like are you or\n\n01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:37.540\naren't you all this bullshit and I think the thing that gets me in the most\n\n01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:41.820\ntrouble is that I fit like like why am I talking about myself with this because I\n\n01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:44.380\ndon't want to sound like I'm on a soapbox I don't want to like like like rush\n\n01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:48.300\nto judge but I thought in that moment that was a very odd thing that happened\n\n01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:52.780\nwhere she actually got the better of this guy in this debate and that and that\n\n01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:57.220\nin the edited context of this thing the first thing he said was gotta give\n\n01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:02.180\nprops to a chick who who who can correct a dude on Frank Miller it's like holy\n\n01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:06.660\nshit where nerds were down at the bottom of this valley and there's still\n\n01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:13.140\ndown here where golem lives there's male golems are still going like props to\n\n01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:16.980\nthat pussy man that pussy was good you know like no one would which fish to eat\n\n01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:23.500\nraw like it was like like what we're all golem down here it the whole point was\n\n01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:28.500\nthat that was really really weird to me I'm gonna edit this all out because I\n\n01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:32.620\nsound like a fucking douchebag and some weird I wasn't fishing for that either\n\n01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:40.100\neveryone shut up yeah I I I patificate all the time about race and it's much\n\n01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:44.940\neasier to obsess about race than it is about gender for me anyway I think\n\n01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:48.580\nbecause of the relationship with I have with my mom which I like like because\n\n01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:53.940\nwomen are like like like sometimes you want to have sex with them sometimes\n\n01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:59.620\nyou don't in between there's eight million fifty things that there are women\n\n01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:03.460\nthat you like like like it you can objectify them without knowing that\n\n01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:08.500\nyou're objectifying them and then even if you get through that hurdle then\n\n01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:13.180\neveryone else is weird objectifications of women come into play so if you were a\n\n01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:16.180\nguy and you respected a woman that you worked with and you're like oh she's\n\n01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.580\nreally funny I really like her I wanted her to be my friend it's like then on\n\n01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:23.680\nthe other side of that there's all this like it's crazy is there is that a\n\n01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.300\nproblem that we solve or do we accept that that's the case I think it's\n\n01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:31.300\nsomething that we always keep in mind and strive to understand and hopefully\n\n01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:37.860\nchange sometime well I think you're on your period otherwise you wouldn't say\n\n01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:43.020\nthat am I right fellas get her out of here let's open the dick shoot\n\n01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:52.060\nit's not gonna watch Roadhouse there's a dick shoot yeah I don't know yeah I\n\n01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:57.380\ndon't know where I got it's a weird epiphany to have at 40 where it's\n\n01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.300\nlike I'm not gonna be able to do anything about it anyway that's not true\n\n01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:03.780\nbecause you had a lady on the show and you talked about how as a lady nerd she\n\n01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:07.300\ngot talked down to you by Kevin Smith who I would love to be able to like\n\n01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:11.820\nadmire and respect as an artist but then he says shit like that I mean off the\n\n01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:15.620\ncuff don't he doesn't know he's saying I mean that's the that's the that's the\n\n01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:20.140\nthat's the yeah I don't know it's I'm just offended by that shirt he always\n\n01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:25.260\nwears I'm sure he sells those like those are custom-designed\n\n01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:35.140\nhe that's tearing down the wall let's bring him out\n\n01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:40.660\nI mean he should come up like like if he did come out we'd be like hey well bro\n\n01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:44.060\ndown with the showdown like whatever like like we're not gonna be like oh we\n\n01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:48.540\nbrought you out here to take you to task let's not bring him out how about that\n\n01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:52.340\nlet's not I even feel like that would be a conversation he'd be willing to have\n\n01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:57.660\nabout about like oh yeah so I didn't really that the he'd like he'd continue\n\n01:44:57.660 --> 01:45:01.740\nthis conversation with us rather than just try to defend himself I don't even\n\n01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:05.140\nknow speaking as someone who's been on Twitter and had people like tweeted me\n\n01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:11.860\ngoing like no point of honor episode 3 season 2 and so and so made this joke\n\n01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:16.980\nit's like you can't help but like like the definition of your humanity like\n\n01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:21.460\nlike you have a certain amount of like servo mounted guns out there otherwise\n\n01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:26.020\nwho are you right if everything that comes your way is like oh yeah let's see\n\n01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:30.140\nyour side of it immediately like you can't help but go like okay first of all\n\n01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:35.060\nwhy is this person full of shit I just I mean I'm just speaking to that\n\n01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:38.140\nhypothetically like let's have Kevin Smith on and talk about gender and about\n\n01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:41.540\nthat one comment he made on that reality show not suggesting that like that's\n\n01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:44.580\nsomething you should actually do and what I was saying was that I know he's not\n\n01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:48.540\nthat guy all the time and like at his core I know he's not a misogynist I would\n\n01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:51.620\nI would go so far as to say I don't think anyone is that guy I think that we\n\n01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:55.460\nget I think that any of us it from any perspective at any given time we get\n\n01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:00.140\naccidentally like if you could actually sit anybody down and like walk through\n\n01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:04.940\neverything if we had that chance to do that with Hitler before he got turned\n\n01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:12.140\nloose like okay where are you going dressed like that I'm gonna go do
