01:39.000 --> 01:48.000

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
and then I don't go get home until midnight and our shows aren't getting any shorter either now I mean I'll be I'll be just starting to rap at midnight

01:57.000 --> 02:08.000
and I won't even get around to the good stuff let's do it by applause would nine o'clock be a bummer for be honest that would be a drag for anybody beside Adam Goldberg

02:08.000 --> 02:18.000
couple people you're applauding for it being a bummer man yeah you say you think that's getting on the late side right you live in you know

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
what position are you going to play then I really don't picture you out there tossing the old softball I kind of want to just commit to the fucking like

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
nightmare of being in sixth grade again and just go center field straight up just like and just stand there and get lulled into a false sense of security

03:08.000 --> 03:18.000
until that crucial ball comes right at me and just have it be like you can be like lupus in the final scene of bad news bears and catch the ball everybody will hug you

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
I definitely will always be like lupus and whatever sport I'm playing I will have the lupus effect on any any team that I'm on

03:26.000 --> 03:41.000
and you mean the disease yes I'm referring to the fatal illness so that's it I mean how was your Easter buddy it was great was at your house I was there

03:41.000 --> 03:50.000
we watched Dan I've never seen Game of Thrones at Dan's place Dan gets up and does a little dance and when I say a little dance it's not little it's enormous

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
and I'm not I'm not joking that was pretty pretty cool he got up and did this thing and he looked like I don't know you look like a little ballerina

03:59.000 --> 04:15.000
but kind of like kind of in a Shaolin soccer kind of like I can't sit upon a game I can't even play a throne

04:15.000 --> 04:32.000
but I can sit upon this game but I can't even play a throne

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
David Milch

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
but you didn't do the dance you just stood there he got up and it was really

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
a podcast Jeff huh I didn't yeah but don't don't don't these short shift these people this is a this is a this is a laugh patch

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
that's what this is we take the hoe and we just just aggregate just capture their just like their imitation of humanity

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
just making a jar of preserves out of their little their little fruit heads I was like like who cares I could point a gun at it

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
make them laugh you wouldn't you'd be able to tell at home this is this is for the people in Poughkeepsie Jeff that's how we make the bucks selling

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Snickers to these fuckers on the you know in the Midwest

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Time for Hometone

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm kidding of course there's no money changing hands in any of this

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
and yet you just taken a giant shit and everybody's head to who who paid ten dollars to get it that's that's the joke

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
it was inappropriate of me to do it

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
my applause how many people thought that was a bummer

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
you really have them terrified no they don't care they're like I just I record them and then they go harm it down

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
Toby Bryant Toby Bryant

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
we're gonna have any idea what's going on

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
I think they can tell the difference between the real the real reaction

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
yeah let's do it let's do a fake one Barack Obama's here

06:59.000 --> 07:13.000

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
wow

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
how are you

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
I think the Lakers gonna play well this year

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
I'm trying to do Kobe Bryant but I'll be racist how about that

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
yeah good luck with that motherfucker

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
I say I'll say the Lakers

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I know you guys are just here to get comic books so I don't want to take up too much of your time

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
damn you're your bastard

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
is that true you guys just popped in to get some books

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
yeah just to get some books that's all

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
he had no idea there was a comedy show going on here

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
no I just go what's going on in the back

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
he can stop anytime he wants he's still having fun with his books

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
that's what I call them my books

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
and my videos are just that's my porn

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
but Robin you really are a comic book aficionado right you were here the last time Bob was here

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
you were just like cruising around in the back there

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
all right do you have any old issues of transmetropolitan

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
what do you what do you divulge what comic books you still collect read

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I started off collecting Mobius and

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
for Mobius alone

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
metalo long black and in col noir

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
it was great when you're reading him in French and only getting half of it

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
but I started that was years ago buying heavy metal and then starting off with that

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
and then working to transmetropolitan big time planetoid

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
and now multiple warheads have you

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I hate comic books

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
after all that's what I was going

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
okay this really doesn't work

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
a little help here

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
I used to write comic books in the 90s during the big black and white comic book explosion

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
and we found out you can just barely make enough money to keep printing them

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
and that's a big time

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
it was rough it was a labor of love

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
so when they went color you got out

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
when they went back to color yeah black and white things are doing so good

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
all the good black and white ones are now

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
let's do color and we were like we're still black and white and they're like we smell a rat

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
so you were asking what you guys did for Easter

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Robin what did you do for Easter

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I went to Bob's house and Bob was on the lawn and it was kind of fun

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
what is that

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
it's like morphing

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
yeah like morphing

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
was this just recreational or did you have a thing

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
without the needles and the spoons

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I have a back injury

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
but I got really

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
yeah and I had after my open arms surgery

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
that's what he had

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
chibi chases back injury

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
that's why I need propofol to sleep

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
as the day went on it was clear that I was stoned out of my mind

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
and I'm just sitting there wearing hats

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
and they didn't fit which was fucked up too

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
more than one at a time

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
no just like suddenly I was in an army hat

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
and I'm walking around the house with one of my cat's toys

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
even the cat's looking you're like

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
he's fucked up

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
nooo

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Detective Karlie Whiskey saying I don't need that from you

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Robin Williams this is actually the second time I've been this close to you

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
the other time I didn't know

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I was gonna be doing nothing

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
hey man

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
you're in bed at a Ritz Carlton

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
the first time was when you were this close to all of America

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Patch Adams I was touched by that

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
oh no

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
so you were affected too

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
yes I was

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I too got a prescription

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
of laughter

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
then you got the movie to depress hyperactive children now

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
I was this close to you because you were dropping Andy Dick

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
outside my apartment like so much human garbage

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
in like a minivan

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
that's what he told me he said hey this is my coke dealer do you want to come in

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I was like going no I'm okay I've got six years I'm good

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
I'm honored that he said I was his dealer

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I was just waiting for him

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
was that what he was going to your house?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
yeah he was coming to my place but the reason he was allowed to is because he said you were coming

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
so I was like well this is a thing

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
cause if Robin Williams comes inside my room

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Andy Dick says come inside a room with him I'm going no no I'm okay

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
I tried to get him into a meeting

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Andy you want to go to a meeting?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
no no this is this let's come inside here

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
no I'm okay I'm fine

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
who lives up there it's Margaret just come upstairs

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
no I'm good I'm good

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
so he said you said where's Robin Williams and he goes there he is

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
he's speeding up

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
there he goes

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Andy get out of my house

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
because you're above a certain strata of celebrity

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
where no matter what would happen and this must be a curse

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
for people above this strata

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
to live in a planet full of people to feel this way

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
like you or not

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
no matter what happens if you come into my place

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
there's a story

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
that's not fair to a human being

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
he was in the room

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
if you came in and you were like the air conditioning is too high

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
could you turn it down

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
for the rest of my life in that apartment

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
hey should I turn down the air conditioning

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
like fucking Robin Williams wanted

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
when he was here

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
do you want to remove the coffee tail

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
you didn't want to sweat like Lindsay Lohan in a witness protection program

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
everything would be like

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
do you need an astray? Robin Williams attached it

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
like whatever ranging from it

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
it wouldn't matter it would be weird

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
that you're above that level

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
does that affect you?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I'm not above that level

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
not to you

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
that was like what someone once said

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
this is I was once working with a director

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
whose name she'll never use because he's so high

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
he once said

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
wouldn't Robin's nose be in his point of view?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Terrence Malick

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
at that point

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
even the guys went oh no nice

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
and he used to brag about having all this head trauma

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
that he'd had seven major head traumas

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
before the age of sixteen

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
but back to the

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
did he want you to supply the nose

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
for the POV shot

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
were you supposed to sit there?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
was he talking to the prop master?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
it'd be like having your own balls in a porn shop

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
it was just

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
he was so fucking out there

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I mean I don't want to

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
it would be good if I just have a POV shot with his nose out in front of me

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
or are we talking about Patch Adam

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
because you had a clown nose on

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
that would be easy

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
that would be just a hint of red in the bottom of the frame

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
there's this really weird

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Kubrickian segment of Patch Adam

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
where it just goes

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
wake up Timmy wake up

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
there's a child's face

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
with a little bit of red in it

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
that's where the criterion cut

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
there's like this nightmare sequence that's like

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
wake up Timmy

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
you have the greatest line about the world when you had that time

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
when you went on the show

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
when the Shakespeare clown came out

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
a clown did

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
thank you

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
and a clown debated me on the today's show

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
and

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I didn't know this was going to happen

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
just the idea of clown debate would be a great category

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
was it about catch reform or what?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
it was, oddly enough they didn't bring up shakes once

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
no

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
it was a clown

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
and they stopped me in the hallway and the producer goes

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
a clown is going to debate you on the program

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
and that was the first I heard of it

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
and I go yeah I know

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I'm familiar with your show

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I got my apologies to Katie

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
so then the clown is in a bad mood

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
and he wouldn't tell me his real name

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
we're going on the show today

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
what's your name

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
bamboozle

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I go what's your real name

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
just call me my clown name

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I go I'm going to rip you a new one

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
when we get out there but it's not personal

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
it's just good TV

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
so we get out there

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
you also had a comic name?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I asked him to call me shitstain

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I said that was

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
cause he said I'm in my clown attire

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
only called me by my clown name

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
and I go oh I'm in my comedian attire

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
call me shitstain that's what be

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
so we get out there

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
and the clown now

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
it was funny because that was when I was doing my character

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
you know

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
but he switches into a character too

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
he's like clown threw a lot of good for a lot of good content

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
if Bobcat's film portrays him as a negative

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
like good

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
and I go nobody thinks you're funny

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
the only reason you perform in hospitals

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
cause that's one place a kid can't get up

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
and run away from you

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
and

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
but you have taken clowns

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
to the old man you played

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
recently you did

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
which clown?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
oh yeah I did the gathering of the jugglers

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
what do you mean you did the gathering

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I performed there

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I did stand up

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
he did stand up which is pretty much

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
opening for them

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
they have a three day festival

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
it's actually a week long

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
the fact that there's a comedy tent at the gathering

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
that's like

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
and there's also a vegetarian booth

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
well I will say this

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
when I was there like

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
just put the soybeans up my ass just do it

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
and then at nine o'clock two melon

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I was going there and I was like

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I thought

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
explain how magnets work

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
and that's how magnets work

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
you would have gotten a government grant

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
for that

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
but

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
as I got to the venue

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
there was no police

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
and a lot of bath salts

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
and

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
and

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
it was weird I figured this out

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
they're really just a group of people

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
that just don't want to be messed with

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
you know what I mean

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
they're probably pretty defensive

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I imagine like

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
bikers going

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I grew up around bikers

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
it's really like

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
it's like bikers without bikes

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
yeah exactly

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
if I had

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
$2,000 that would be a biker

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
but bikers without bikes

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
is a good charity

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
please help

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
this is Carl he's only got one wheel

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
please help

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000

careful

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
you'll make his name irrelevant

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
but what happens

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
it really is like a group

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
of incest survivors

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
getting together

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
a decent fella

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
and was trying to explain to me that

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
it's not that bad

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
you know how they throw fago cola

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
he's giving you the juggaloo venue

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
pep talk

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
it's not that bad

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
there's an SNL scout out there

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
you know

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
he gave you the whole Chinese character for crisis

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
it's the same as opportunity speech

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
yeah well look

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
if you're having fun they're having fun

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
as long as the audience

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
he's driving around

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
and there's fires going on

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
this is a show where teal tequila got

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
they ran out of fago cola to hit her with

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
so they threw poo at her

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
they knocked over an outhouse

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
not teela

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
teela didn't knock over the outhouse

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
who am I rooting for

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
who am I rooting for in that story

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
it's like these stories about leno

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
going toe to toe with bob greenblatt

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
who's side am I on

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
the other day they knocked it over

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
like you knock over a bank or

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
put the shit in the bag

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
put the shit in the bag

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
put the shit in the bag it's my friend

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
who's only got one wheel

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
put the shit in the bag

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
hey man

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
there's a lot of shit in there man

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
she's a chug showed up

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I said buy some shit not real shit

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
don't fuck

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
teal tequila did not knock over the outhouse

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
she's really tiny

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
a little help here

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
so after they ran out of

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
poo to throw at her

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
where do you go? organs? human organs?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I don't know

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
so I'm trying to

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
this is a decent group of people

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I'm here every year

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
and then this clown this huge guy

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
just burst out through the crowd

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
there's some tears and fights going on

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
but this guy is all sweaty and crazy looking

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
and he goes fuck you up Chuck

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
fuck you

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
and he just pounds the shit out of it

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
no he's on the golf cart so he hits gas

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and we scoot out

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
oh he's driving he's chasing us

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
he's giving you a ride on a golf cart

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
it's a drive by ass kicking

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
this will be the youtube footage

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
you want to find

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
so we gun the car

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
and then he goes

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
they know me

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
it's like family

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
he's trying to laugh that off

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
and then a can of fago hits the golf cart

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
and it's all over us

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
fago

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
apparently if it's diet it doesn't stick

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
or stain because that's an object

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
it's diet don't worry like he's a connoisseur

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
he's really splitting hairs

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
he's supposed to suicide

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
and he's like

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
he's gonna hit with enough fago

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm not sponsored by fago in any way

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
no I'm mentioning it a lot

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
or up Chuck the clown

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
whose autobiography hits shelves never

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
he's hanging from the rafters upstairs

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
it's titled it doesn't stain

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
up Chuck's got a podcast it doesn't stain

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
up Chuck's untold story

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
so

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
so

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
and it's also books on tape told very slowly

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
only love stains

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
no

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
when he was

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
saw just memories

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
so he

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
at that moment

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
he hits the gas

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
again

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
after the fago cola and we're driving

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
and as he's trying to tell me that this show

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
is the biggest

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
it's not any more rowdy than a Dave Matthews

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
concert

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
at that point

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
a can of unopened fago

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
comes whizzing in

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
and cracks him in the head like a baseball pitch

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
and he just slumps over

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
and he goes I'm hurt

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I'm hurt really bad

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Bob take the wheel

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
he called me Bob

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
and he hits the gas

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
help me buddy

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
be my wingman help take the wheel Bobby

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I got a book coming out

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
take the wheel

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and I'm steering whizzing

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
through the clowns like Mr. Toad's

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
wild rides

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
and people are diving out of the way

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
they should fucking have that at the gathering

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
time to go through the gathering of the clowns

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
makes pirates of the Caribbean

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
look like shit

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
it was so

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
oh and then

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
his head swelled up and he

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
not figuratively

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
no it looked like

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
the side of his head looked like a stink bug

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
and he's asking me

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
if I can tell

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
he's bleeding and I'm like I don't know

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
what's blood and what's you

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
because he had all the clown makeup

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
and he's all the same

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
where does a chunk begin

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
if only he knew

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
yeah and then

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
do you want to know what he put on his head

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
for the swelling

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
ice cold faggot

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
brought to you by

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Ironic

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
how fucking ironic he really did

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
that is the definition of irony

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I've got a good photo of him holding this

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
ice cold faggot to his head and his eyeballs

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
are like little tiny pinpoints

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I have a question

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
what's a juggalo and what the hell was this event

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I have no idea what you're talking about

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
it's the gathering of the juggalos and St. Claude Posse's fans

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
ah okay I didn't know

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
and they have this convention

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
or you know a ton of acts go on

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
and there's like I said a lot of fights

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
there's only been I think four deaths

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
in ten years

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
only four

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
and Bob was on

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I'll hear from them but I don't

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I have to say they were very receptive

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
crowd I went on at 1 a.m.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
oh really and they and much of the

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
following week I played Arkansas and had

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
a way worse time

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
which is really after all that

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
you can't drive a golf cart through them

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
without getting hit with it

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
with a can of faggot

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
am I pronouncing that right? oh no

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
no that sounds like

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
don't do that especially at the incline

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
zinc composite

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I hear me faggot

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I can't pronounce baggle either

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
oh okay

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
what you have is faggot faggot

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
it's a redneck

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
homosexual repellent

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
like off

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
no fags on me

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I use faggot

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
but then you

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
we can say that because I'm

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
pro gay marriage

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
big time

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I'm 1 8th Cherokee so

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
the

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
the

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
then you went out though and the gig went

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
fun what was Tina's act

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
and what was her crime up there

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
she did not show her breasts

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
and she was a woman

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
that didn't show her

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
rookie mistakes

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
but I gotta say

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
like I said I did worse gigs last

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
summer

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I can't believe Jagaloo's their sexist

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
well that's a weird thing

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
if they're mesmerized by magnets

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
why can't they respect women

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
but here's the thing

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
family and being all inclusive

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
is really important to them

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
but then they write songs about

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
chopping women up in the vagina with an axe

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
which would be the end of men

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
duh

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
women have

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
that's what I don't understand about misogyny

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
women have little

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
they can make little men out of them themselves

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
that's where

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
misogyny comes from

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
our lines are still open ladies and gentlemen

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
remember

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
women can make little men

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
and little women how to make other little women

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
make other little men

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
it's like a Russian nesting doll really

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
you open a woman

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
there's another woman and there's another woman

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
and there's another woman and there's another woman

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and eventually one sperm falls out

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
hence memories

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
let's look at the board

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
how do we do it Robin

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
let's look at the board how much more did we erase

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
so far for Harmontown

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
we've got a handle bar

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
and a gas tank

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
one sperm cell

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
one tiny sperm

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
that's the misogyny issue of mobius

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
that would be the loneliest mother fucker in the world

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
just swimming up a uterus going

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
this is

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
this is fucked there used to be more

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
where are we going

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
where is that sperm

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
you know who would play that sperm is Tom Cruise

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
he's always in these movies where he's the last man on earth

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
and he's the sperm that's going to get done

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Tom Cruise is

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Milton Seaman in

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Up My Lazy River

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Little Men Make Little Women

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Little Women Make Little Men

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
fuck that little women

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
in a world made of a giant woman

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
a planet man

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
We're going in.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Where is everyone?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
The fools!

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
They did it!

27:48.000 --> 27:59.000
Just one shot of like a Morgan Freeman in shadow, I was going, you're only by the cervix,

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
boy.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.200
As a uterus up ahead, I hope you know where you're going.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.800
There's 800 penguins waiting by that over.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.640
I'm honored that I share this with Robin Williams.

28:10.640 --> 28:15.400
Both of our Morgan Freemans impressions sound like Foghorn Leghorn.

28:15.400 --> 28:22.440
Another thing to please tell Father's number now, by the end of the show, we'll do a decent

28:22.440 --> 28:23.440
Morgan Freeman.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.440
I'll say son, your body sharp as a bowling ball.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.520
I say he got a slag rule to find that ovary.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
A slag rule.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.520
You're not a real thing.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.520
You're not a real thing.

28:32.520 --> 28:33.520
You're not a real thing.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.520
You're not a real thing.

28:34.520 --> 28:35.520
You're not a real thing.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.520
You're not a real thing.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.520
You're not a real thing.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.960
That's your reference to the little chicken hawk.

28:40.960 --> 28:41.960
Chicken hawk.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.600
This is a much larger uterus than I imagined.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
Imagine!

28:45.600 --> 28:46.600
Imagine!

28:46.600 --> 28:47.600
Imagine!

28:47.600 --> 28:48.600
Imagine!

28:48.600 --> 28:49.600
The Carlsberg vagina!

28:49.600 --> 28:50.600
Vagina!

28:50.600 --> 28:51.600
Welcome!

28:51.600 --> 28:52.600
Welcome!

28:52.600 --> 28:53.600
Welcome!

28:53.600 --> 28:54.600
No, don't do it!

28:54.600 --> 28:55.600
That's a calcium deposit!

28:55.600 --> 28:56.600
Hello, Joe.

28:56.600 --> 29:03.800
I thought I was the only sperm left.

29:03.800 --> 29:08.320
This cartoon was passed on by every network.

29:08.320 --> 29:12.320
That's the one with the one sperm that's like, that's a turd!

29:12.320 --> 29:15.320
We're in the wrong place!

29:15.320 --> 29:16.320
Go back!

29:16.320 --> 29:17.320
That's the big reveal.

29:17.320 --> 29:21.320
That's the last time you get to drive.

29:21.320 --> 29:25.320
And Troopy Dog has the testicle.

29:25.320 --> 29:28.320
Oh, fuck!

29:28.320 --> 29:29.320
Woo!

29:29.320 --> 29:31.320
Before these guys figure out they can leave the station.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.320
We're going to wrap this up.

29:33.320 --> 29:37.000
I think I've insulted every group that is organized.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.120
Well, I was going to sabotage you guys and bring up our Dungeon Master and suck you into

29:40.120 --> 29:41.120
a game of Dungeons & Dragons.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.120
Oh, no, no, no.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.120
No.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.120
Are we?

29:44.120 --> 29:45.120
No.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.120
No, no, no.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.120
No.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.120
Listen to them!

29:48.120 --> 29:49.120
Oh, no.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.120
Listen to the people for once, Robin Williams!

29:50.120 --> 29:51.120
Don't stop me on this again!

29:51.120 --> 29:52.120
I can't go back!

29:52.120 --> 29:53.120
For once in your entire career, Robin Williams, pander to these people!

29:53.120 --> 29:54.120
Give them what they want!

29:54.120 --> 29:55.120
I don't want!

29:55.120 --> 30:05.120
I don't have a 20-sided dice to fuck her!

30:05.120 --> 30:07.120
Oh, they have them.

30:07.120 --> 30:10.120
This whole crowd is sitting on them.

30:10.120 --> 30:13.120
Spencer and Spencer Crittenden come to the stage.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.120
Oh, fuck.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.120
Oh, Dungeon Master!

30:17.120 --> 30:19.120
Oh, yay.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.120
Oh, okay.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.120
All right, we better go now.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.120
We can get out of here.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.120
Do you want to leave?

30:27.120 --> 30:28.120
You can leave.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.120
I think...

30:29.120 --> 30:30.120
I got it.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.120
Yeah, we're going to leave.

30:31.120 --> 30:37.120
I think the last time I did this, I think I broke it for everybody.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.120
No, no, no, no.

30:38.120 --> 30:43.120
If you leave it up to me, you're going to be up here forever, so you get to gracefully leave.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.120
Thank you so much, Alondra Robins!

30:45.120 --> 30:47.120
Thank you so much.

30:47.120 --> 30:57.120
Robin Williams and Bob Goldsway!

30:57.120 --> 31:13.120
Here's why I would have kept them up forever, because not just to milk it, because God knows

31:13.120 --> 31:19.120
I would have killed it to keep them up here forever, but now I got to follow.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.120
I don't know if you know...

31:21.120 --> 31:25.120
There's a little crest of energy that usually attends a Robin Williams appearance,

31:25.120 --> 31:28.120
whether you're watching Comic Relief 7 or...

31:28.120 --> 31:29.120
Afterglow.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.120
We afterglow right now.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.120
We coast on that energy.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.120
We ride that shockwave.

31:33.120 --> 31:37.120
Let's smoke a cigarette and go like, what the fuck was that?

31:37.120 --> 31:40.120
That was a huge interstellar explosion.

31:40.120 --> 31:44.120
We're going to ride that shockwave along the cosmos for quite a long time right now.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.120
Remember all those sperm jokes?

31:46.120 --> 31:47.120
Yeah, we did.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.120
Remember that little sperm movie?

31:49.120 --> 31:51.120
Whoa, like jelly.

31:51.120 --> 31:54.120
Eric Idle and Robin Williams now have done...

31:54.120 --> 31:56.120
Oh, Eric says hi, by the way.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.120
I was on the phone with the fuck that guy.

31:58.120 --> 32:01.120
He calls the song that we sang, his song, by the way.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.120
He's trying to steal that song.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.120
Our fuck your mama song.

32:05.120 --> 32:10.120
Yeah, because we wrote that song and then we brought it over to his house,

32:10.120 --> 32:12.120
that song that Eric Idle sang.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.120
And he picked up a guitar and instantly played it first time,

32:14.120 --> 32:17.120
almost exactly as you guys heard it, if you've heard that episode of it,

32:17.120 --> 32:18.120
or you were here that night.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.120
And I was talking on the phone just now, and he's like,

32:21.120 --> 32:24.120
he played my song recently, and I was like,

32:24.120 --> 32:26.120
I was like, no, no, we only did that one time.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.120
He's like, you notice I call it my song.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.120
I sneaked that in there, you didn't even notice.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.120
And I was like, look, man, you can have it.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.120
We're not making any money out of this.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.120
And he's like, you know, people think that that.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.120
Yeah.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.120
And he was proud.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.120
I said, people think you wrote that.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.120
He goes, of course they did.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.120
Yeah.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
He liked the quality.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
Because it was good.

32:44.120 --> 32:47.120
Because an Emmy-winning lyricist co-pended.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.120
Yeah.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.120
All right.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.120
Anyways.

32:50.120 --> 32:54.120
Kobe Bryant is here, ladies and gentlemen.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.120
April Fools.

32:56.120 --> 32:57.120
Spencer, how are you?

32:57.120 --> 32:59.120
You were at Easter with Thesedans as well.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.120
Yeah, yeah.

33:00.120 --> 33:05.120
Yeah, I came late because I had a breakdown at Vons.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.120
Yeah.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.120
Oh, yeah, you mentioned that.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.120
I knew I was going to bring it down after that.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.120
I'm sorry, guys.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.120
It's cool.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.120
Anyway, yeah.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.120
You had an emotional breakdown?

33:15.120 --> 33:16.120
Yeah.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.120
I didn't know what food to bring.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.120
All right.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.120
Well, go into detail here.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.120
You walk in the front door.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.120
Because first of all, you had to know.

33:23.120 --> 33:26.120
Well, before that, I was just wrestling with it.

33:26.120 --> 33:29.120
Because I make a good cheese dip.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.120
I make a good cheese dip.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.120
You keep talking about this cheese dip that we've never seen.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.120
You're not.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.120
It's not vegetarian, Jeff.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.120
I am.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.120
So fuck off.

33:37.120 --> 33:38.120
Well, you give us the recipe?

33:38.120 --> 33:42.120
Because, I mean, one-third of a good Harmontown show is a Robin Williams appearance.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.120
And another third of a classic Harmontown is a good recipe.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.120
Do you honestly want the recipe?

33:46.120 --> 33:47.120
Yes, yes.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.120
What is it?

33:48.120 --> 33:49.120
Okay.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.120
Okay.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.120
Well, first, you take approximately.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.120
He's talking.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.120
What was this?

33:53.120 --> 33:54.120
He was talking.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.120
Oh, he makes good tiny sandwiches.

33:55.120 --> 33:59.120
Oh, yeah, I made some cucumber sandwiches for a tea party.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.120
It was pretty, pretty.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.120
You have little tea parties?

34:02.120 --> 34:03.120
No, I don't.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.120
That was a one-time thing.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.120
And it wasn't.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.120
Symphony wasn't.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.120
Reaching for the tea.

34:09.120 --> 34:12.120
You realize it's 11.

34:12.120 --> 34:15.120
Yeah, that's not the first thought that interests people's heads when they look at you.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.120
Like, I bet he makes a good tiny sandwich.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.120
Yeah, yeah.

34:18.120 --> 34:22.120
Cucumber sandwiches, I don't, I mean, she thought they're, I don't think they're that good.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.120
They don't taste like much.

34:23.120 --> 34:27.120
So you're, so you're thinking in your head, I'm going to go over to Harmon's for Easter.

34:27.120 --> 34:31.120
If I'm going to go to Harmon's for Easter, I will have brought something.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.120
I will have brought value.

34:32.120 --> 34:36.120
Because of something that you imposed on yourself, not because you thought that anyone...

34:36.120 --> 34:38.120
Because my presence is an imposition.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.120
Ah.

34:39.120 --> 34:42.120
So I come bearing gifts, you know, to cover it up.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
Interesting.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.120
So, yeah.

34:44.120 --> 34:49.120
But yeah, so, I mean, that was, I was thinking the cheese dip, and I was on my couch for a while.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.120
And then I got, I was like, I'll figure it out when I get the vans.

34:52.120 --> 34:56.120
Stared at the bacon, stared at the cream cheese, stared at the cakes, you know.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.120
When you're staring at bacon, what are you thinking?

34:58.120 --> 35:02.120
I'm thinking the bacon cheese dip is going to cost about $13.40 or so.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.120
Ah.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.120
So you're juggling finances.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.120
No, it's just, that's just what I was thinking about.

35:07.120 --> 35:12.120
And I mean, I think it was just me being anxious using any excuse, and price was the excuse.

35:12.120 --> 35:13.120
Right.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.120
But I mean, I don't know.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.120
Was it, was it performance anxiety that you would wonder if people would like the dip?

35:17.120 --> 35:18.120
It was going to be bomb.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.120
Don't, don't worry.

35:19.120 --> 35:25.120
You know what I think is really ironic about this, is that Dino, who cooked for, uh, Easter,

35:25.120 --> 35:31.120
who loves to cook, and who's a great comedy writer, the reason he loves to cook, we were talking about it,

35:31.120 --> 35:38.120
is that, uh, when you cook, it excuses you from all of these things that normally hang up a writer,

35:38.120 --> 35:40.120
because you get some broccoli.

35:40.120 --> 35:44.120
The broccoli is either going to be used or not used, and in either case it's going to rot.

35:44.120 --> 35:48.120
And the best case scenario is it goes in someone's stomach and comes out a turd and goes down a toilet.

35:48.120 --> 35:53.120
Like, there is no good reason to get hung up on, on, on, on making a meal.

35:53.120 --> 35:57.120
Like, like, he uses it to release himself from the things that normally hang us up.

35:57.120 --> 36:02.120
And here you are, a creator of worlds, of realms, a master of realms.

36:02.120 --> 36:07.120
Entire dungeons, and biographies, and lifetimes, holding fate in your very hands,

36:07.120 --> 36:09.120
and, and you're staring at the bacon.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.120
And you can't, yeah, it hung you up.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.120
And the cakes.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.120
Yeah.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.120
It hung you up the way that I'm hung up on my Fox script.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.120
Yeah.

36:16.120 --> 36:19.120
And you're sitting there going, this has to be the new community.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.120
I feel like this audience deserves, like, while they're waiting in line,

36:22.120 --> 36:24.120
the little cheese dip while they're waiting out there.

36:24.120 --> 36:29.120
I can bring something, I mean, I've thought, I've honestly thought about it.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.120
I'd rather get out the recipe.

36:31.120 --> 36:37.120
We should, we should rent a station wagon, and like, and, and, and, and have it,

36:37.120 --> 36:40.120
like, you know, pull it up to the curb when they're waiting outside the comic book store,

36:40.120 --> 36:44.120
and then we'll put out like a little sterno cans and like, give them like hot snacks.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.120
I think it's illegal.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.120
Well, they have like taco trucks.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.120
Yeah, well those guys have licenses and stuff.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.120
No, they shouldn't.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.120
They shouldn't.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.120
They just get shut down.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.120
Like, there was an awesome taco truck.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.120
We used to go to that.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.120
The taco truck owner in the back just loses shit.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.120
They just get shut down though.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.120
Like, they do.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.120
It sucks.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.120
Yeah, yeah.

37:03.120 --> 37:08.120
Speaking of things that we should do, I flirted with this thing a couple weeks ago,

37:08.120 --> 37:11.120
where we said like, oh, you know, because we keep talking about movies,

37:11.120 --> 37:15.120
and we watch shitty movies, and then we talk about the movies, and then I threw out the idea of,

37:15.120 --> 37:19.120
oh, like Oprah's book club, let's assign a movie, and then we can talk about it next week.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.120
Ah.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.120
And I've gotten a couple tweets.

37:21.120 --> 37:25.120
More importantly, I do think it's kind of a good idea, because it takes no effort at all.

37:25.120 --> 37:31.120
Like, if we could just make up our mind to, as a group, it's not compulsive, compulsory,

37:31.120 --> 37:33.120
but we could just assign a movie.

37:33.120 --> 37:36.120
Let's just make up our mind to watch one thing before next recording.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.120
What are you thinking?

37:37.120 --> 37:38.120
I don't know.

37:38.120 --> 37:39.120
Nine to five.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.120
I don't know.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.120
I don't know.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.120
I don't know.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
I take back nine to five.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.120
Any suggestions out there?

37:45.120 --> 37:46.120
Wicker Man.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.120
Wicker Man.

37:47.120 --> 37:51.120
RoboCop 2 Classic, Wicker Man, almost two...

37:51.120 --> 37:52.120
I haven't seen it.

37:52.120 --> 37:55.120
Well, I mean, it's so, it's such a fucking like, it's like...

37:55.120 --> 37:58.120
Let's all watch the six hour version of Fanny and Alexander.

37:58.120 --> 38:01.120
Maybe something will come up organically.

38:01.120 --> 38:04.120
Remind me at the end of the show, when I'm standing here like a dumbass going,

38:04.120 --> 38:08.120
how do we end the show if we haven't come up with something organically?

38:08.120 --> 38:11.120
Remind me that we haven't yet thought of something,

38:11.120 --> 38:14.120
and then I'll at least have something to do before we leave,

38:14.120 --> 38:16.120
instead of rapping about fucking your mom.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.120
Let's get McGathey up here.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.120
McGathey!

38:19.120 --> 38:30.120
I love in a dark, dark, cynical way,

38:30.120 --> 38:34.120
I love that Kumeil, who's been here for like five weeks in a row,

38:34.120 --> 38:38.120
he's got an early call tomorrow and he always emails me and goes like,

38:38.120 --> 38:40.120
I'm not going to be able to make it.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.120
What did I miss?

38:42.120 --> 38:43.120
This is kind of fine.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.120
I think he would have enjoyed probably.

38:44.120 --> 38:48.120
I wonder if people that are listening to this know that this is the April Fool's Day episode,

38:48.120 --> 38:51.120
they're going to think that these are really good impressions of those two guys.

38:51.120 --> 38:55.120
And it was all Kobe Bryant doing all the voices.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.120
It was Andy Dick.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.120
Hello, Erin, how are you?

38:59.120 --> 39:00.120
I'm doing good.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.120
Are they really gone?

39:01.120 --> 39:02.120
Yeah.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.120
Okay.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.120
Yeah, I'm glad that they had the balls to go.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.120
Let's get out of here.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.120
I suppose.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.120
We would have, yeah.

39:08.120 --> 39:11.120
Let's play hard to get.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.120
Well, I'm not going to play hard to get.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.120
Robin had a good time, maybe he'll come back again.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.120
If we milk him dry, he'll be exhausted.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.120
I love that guy.

39:18.120 --> 39:22.120
I just couldn't get past the idea of him playing Dungeons & Dragons.

39:22.120 --> 39:24.120
It was a little intriguing.

39:24.120 --> 39:29.120
I really wanted to ask him to play Lorraine and just let me stand behind him

39:29.120 --> 39:31.120
and just like, smell him.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.120
All right.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.120
I just met him a couple of nights ago for the first time.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.120
That's why he's coming up and messing up my hair.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.120
We're like, he was being palsy-walsy.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.120
That's so horrible.

39:40.120 --> 39:44.120
I was doing an improv show at UCB and I ran backstage really quick

39:44.120 --> 39:46.120
because I was doing some sort of dumb bit and he was standing there

39:46.120 --> 39:48.120
and I was like, ah!

39:48.120 --> 39:50.120
And he's like, ah, is it okay if I go on stage?

39:50.120 --> 39:52.120
I was like, ah!

39:52.120 --> 39:55.120
And he came out on stage and then afterwards, it was right after his divorce

39:55.120 --> 39:59.120
and him and I talked about his divorce for a couple of hours.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.120
I wonder why.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.120
What?

40:02.120 --> 40:04.120
Nothing. I'm just being jealous.

40:04.120 --> 40:06.120
Don't worry.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.120
His dick tastes like garbage.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.120
No, it didn't.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.120
No, I don't know.

40:14.120 --> 40:17.120
It's just honey-soaked garbage.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.120
Always went in so many directions.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.120
So much energy.

40:20.120 --> 40:24.120
Part of his dick to the great Mr. Chee impression.

40:24.120 --> 40:28.120
His balls had some insights about gay guys.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.120
It was great.

40:29.120 --> 40:33.120
And he kept on, in our conversation about his ex-wife,

40:33.120 --> 40:38.120
he kept on referencing Hook, which was thrilling.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.120
I love Hook, but kept on saying like, well, Dustin and Hook,

40:41.120 --> 40:44.120
but over and over again, well, when I was doing Hook,

40:44.120 --> 40:46.120
I was like, this is the best, no one's around.

40:46.120 --> 40:48.120
I totally love it.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.120
All right, one more bit of business before we start to end this.

40:50.120 --> 40:53.120
Is he really not here?

40:53.120 --> 40:55.120
All right, I'm just making sure.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.120
Yeah, I don't know what that O was for.

40:57.120 --> 41:00.120
I hope it was either going, oh, don't be a star fucker.

41:00.120 --> 41:02.120
Stop that star-fucking.

41:02.120 --> 41:05.120
Someone here, you talk about divorce with a guy.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.120
I know.

41:06.120 --> 41:09.120
I really love Robin Williams a whole lot.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.120
I feel like he's my father.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.120
He's probably still out in the store.

41:16.120 --> 41:17.120
Go look.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.120
No, I think maybe he's...

41:19.120 --> 41:20.120
Robin!

41:20.120 --> 41:21.120
Yeah, get out of here.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.120
Go marry him.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.120
Jesus.

41:23.120 --> 41:25.120
Go read Mobius together.

41:25.120 --> 41:27.120
I'm sure when Billy Crystal comes by next week,

41:27.120 --> 41:28.120
it won't change, right?

41:28.120 --> 41:29.120
No, no, no, no.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.120
It will change, it will change.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.120
Is he still booked?

41:32.120 --> 41:33.120
He's coming?

41:33.120 --> 41:34.120
Yeah, yeah.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.120
Okay, great.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.120
One more bit of business that's not going to impress anyone,

41:40.120 --> 41:42.120
but it's just too weird to pass up.

41:42.120 --> 41:44.120
I feel like God speaks through kind of weird coincidences,

41:44.120 --> 41:46.120
and that's why I have to address it.

41:46.120 --> 41:52.120
Last week in my insane, crazy two five-hour energy wrap

41:52.120 --> 41:54.120
at the end of the show,

41:54.120 --> 41:56.120
I had to rhyme something like do it or through it

41:56.120 --> 41:58.120
or go to it or something,

41:58.120 --> 42:00.120
and I rhymed it with the name Ray Pruitt,

42:00.120 --> 42:01.120
and immediately said,

42:01.120 --> 42:03.120
he's a friend of ours.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.120
He is a friend of ours.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.120
That's right.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.120
He's from Austin, Texas,

42:06.120 --> 42:07.120
and he's here tonight by coincidence.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.120
Ray Pruitt, we stand up.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.120
Ray Pruitt, come up here.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.120
Get on stage, Ray.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.120
Just...

42:16.120 --> 42:19.120
Just tell people your name's Ray Pruitt first of all.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.120
I got ID.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.120
Yeah, well, they won't be able to see that.

42:22.120 --> 42:25.120
Yeah, he was behind the eight ball on a Ryan,

42:25.120 --> 42:26.120
where I rhymed through it,

42:26.120 --> 42:28.120
and he said like I was Ray Pruitt.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.120
He goes, he's a real person.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.120
He's a friend of mine.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.120
Yeah.

42:31.120 --> 42:32.120
I knew it.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.120
Like I said, the audience doesn't care.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.120
So Ray Pruitt, you're in town.

42:34.120 --> 42:35.120
You're building something for Coachella,

42:35.120 --> 42:39.120
and Ray is a big aficionado of the weird,

42:39.120 --> 42:41.120
I would say, right?

42:41.120 --> 42:43.120
Let's go with that.

42:43.120 --> 42:45.120
Ray was in the news once.

42:45.120 --> 42:48.120
Tell them about the parade that you invaded.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.120
Oh, that poor town of Leaky, Texas.

42:50.120 --> 42:53.120
Leaky, Texas.

42:53.120 --> 42:59.120
We did Harlem Globe Trotters versus the fake

42:59.120 --> 43:01.120
Miss America pageant,

43:01.120 --> 43:06.120
and this town is maybe 500 people.

43:06.120 --> 43:08.120
It made their newspaper twice.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.120
But it was a bunch of guys in drag.

43:10.120 --> 43:14.120
It was a bunch of city fruity fruits coming in.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.120
Yeah, but it was 30 people,

43:15.120 --> 43:17.120
but only two of us were gay.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.120
Oh, really?

43:18.120 --> 43:20.120
That's all the photo.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.120
It looks like a gay pride parade broke out in it.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.120
The children flashing people,

43:23.120 --> 43:25.120
it made papers in Dallas.

43:25.120 --> 43:29.120
I promise I did not take off a single bit of anything.

43:29.120 --> 43:31.120
Pruitt, Pruitt, stay here,

43:31.120 --> 43:32.120
because Camille's not here,

43:32.120 --> 43:33.120
and we got a character.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.120
Can you play Dungeons & Dragons with us?

43:35.120 --> 43:36.120
Yeah.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.120
All right.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.120
You don't have to know anything about it.

43:38.120 --> 43:39.120
Have you ever played before?

43:39.120 --> 43:40.120
When I was nine.

43:40.120 --> 43:41.120
All right.

43:41.120 --> 43:42.120
Yeah, cool.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.120
This is Spencer.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.120
Spencer Ray.

43:44.120 --> 43:45.120
Spencer is our Dungeon Master.

43:45.120 --> 43:46.120
I looked at you in the dream room,

43:46.120 --> 43:49.120
and I didn't say anything because I'm awkward.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.120
Ditto.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.120
Yeah, sorry.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.120
All right.

43:52.120 --> 43:53.120
Should we let this rip?

43:53.120 --> 43:54.120
Let's do it.

43:54.120 --> 43:55.120
All right.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.120
Let's get those character sheets out,

43:56.120 --> 43:57.120
and Spencer, if you would,

43:57.120 --> 44:02.120
would you catch us up to speed?

44:02.120 --> 44:06.120
Last time our heroes,

44:06.120 --> 44:08.120
after having slain a dragon,

44:08.120 --> 44:10.120
picked over the treasure and remains

44:10.120 --> 44:12.120
in the room that they were last in.

44:12.120 --> 44:14.120
Sensing a break in the action,

44:14.120 --> 44:16.120
Sharpie and Christopher are set to work

44:16.120 --> 44:18.120
studying the bloody tome once more,

44:18.120 --> 44:20.120
trying to uncover its secrets.

44:20.120 --> 44:22.120
Mulraine, in a bid to claim the dragon's

44:22.120 --> 44:24.120
mystical and magical horns,

44:24.120 --> 44:26.120
tied various swords to her limbs.

44:26.120 --> 44:28.120
Quickly disrobing and playing a tune

44:28.120 --> 44:30.120
on his loot of charming,

44:30.120 --> 44:32.120
the barbarian transfixed the party for a time,

44:32.120 --> 44:34.120
which led to a short spat.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.120
The tension was only broken

44:36.120 --> 44:39.120
by Mulraine's successful horn harvest.

44:39.120 --> 44:41.120
The Ranger presented her prize

44:41.120 --> 44:42.120
to the wise wizard,

44:42.120 --> 44:44.120
but Sharpie rebuffed her with a reference

44:44.120 --> 44:46.120
to bags before climbing a pile of treasure

44:46.120 --> 44:49.120
to have a semi-public breakdown.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.120
The realization had set in.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.120
They were far, far from home,

44:53.120 --> 44:57.120
and had no way to return to the material plane.

44:57.120 --> 45:00.120
Very little happened last episode.

45:00.120 --> 45:03.120
It actually turned into kind of

45:03.120 --> 45:06.120
an unwitting tribute to reality television.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.120
Our guest was Genevieve Pearson

45:08.120 --> 45:10.120
from a reality show,

45:10.120 --> 45:12.120
and what we failed to point out,

45:12.120 --> 45:14.120
which would have turned the whole thing in our favor,

45:14.120 --> 45:16.120
was that the Dungeons & Dragons session

45:16.120 --> 45:18.120
was very much like a shitty B.H.1 show.

45:18.120 --> 45:21.120
So, do we need to take inventory

45:21.120 --> 45:24.120
of all of our treasure and move on, right?

45:24.120 --> 45:26.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me get these...

45:26.120 --> 45:28.120
I should have done that.

45:28.120 --> 45:30.120
Oh, Blueprotter's sensor, that's cool.

45:30.120 --> 45:32.120
Ray, to catch you up, you're playing Kumail Nanjiani's part.

45:32.120 --> 45:34.120
His character is a thief, right?

45:34.120 --> 45:35.120
Yeah, a rogue.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.120
A rogue named...

45:36.120 --> 45:37.120
Chris de Burghh.

45:37.120 --> 45:39.120
Chris de Burghh, the guy who wrote The Lady in Red.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.120
You're familiar with him?

45:40.120 --> 45:41.120
Perfect.

45:41.120 --> 45:42.120
Yeah, okay.

45:42.120 --> 45:44.120
He's a one-hit wonder, kind of down on his luck at that.

45:44.120 --> 45:46.120
He's obsessed with dicks.

45:49.120 --> 45:52.120
Here's some things to talk about while Spencer gets situated.

45:52.120 --> 45:55.120
Aaron and I went to SeaWorld in San Diego.

45:55.120 --> 45:58.120
More like SeaWorld.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.120
We would...

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
We'd see children cry.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.120
We were there to pick up our puppy,

46:04.120 --> 46:07.120
or not pick up, pick out our puppy.

46:07.120 --> 46:10.120
Not at SeaWorld, no.

46:10.120 --> 46:13.120
We were 20 miles outside San Diego.

46:13.120 --> 46:15.120
Alpine.

46:15.120 --> 46:18.120
People would go to that lady's place.

46:21.120 --> 46:23.120
We went to this lady's place,

46:23.120 --> 46:26.120
and she's got the laundry basket full of puppies.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.120
Then we met the parents of the puppies,

46:28.120 --> 46:32.120
and we picked out the puppy, our golden doodle.

46:32.120 --> 46:33.120
Yeah, we picked him out.

46:33.120 --> 46:35.120
I saw the photo, pretty adorable.

46:35.120 --> 46:37.120
We still haven't chosen a name for him yet.

46:37.120 --> 46:38.120
Yeah.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.120
We were talking about naming him.

46:40.120 --> 46:44.120
He reminded us of an older Jewish comedian.

46:44.120 --> 46:48.120
He kind of has a weird, kind of like a Sid look to him,

46:48.120 --> 46:49.120
or a George.

46:49.120 --> 46:52.120
Yeah, so it's plenty, or Saul.

46:52.120 --> 46:53.120
Yeah.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.120
I like Harvey.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.120
Harvey's good.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.120
Harvey, yeah.

46:56.120 --> 46:58.120
Harvey, I like, because unlike the other ones,

46:58.120 --> 47:00.120
it won't be like a hipster, like Silver Lake.

47:00.120 --> 47:03.120
Oh, you named your dog, like an old man's name.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.120
Harvey's like...

47:04.120 --> 47:06.120
Oh, Harvey, Harvey, Harvey.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.120
Can we talk about Leonard?

47:08.120 --> 47:09.120
Leonard, oh, Leonard, I didn't...

47:09.120 --> 47:11.120
Lenny, I liked, but then I thought Leonard...

47:11.120 --> 47:13.120
Dan didn't want to name the dog Leonard,

47:13.120 --> 47:14.120
because of the character and community.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.120
He thought it would be too...

47:16.120 --> 47:18.120
He thought people would think that he was...

47:18.120 --> 47:22.120
Because every wall of my house, when you come into my home,

47:22.120 --> 47:24.120
has community art all over it.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
And I'm fine with that.

47:25.120 --> 47:28.120
But the dog is then named like,

47:28.120 --> 47:30.120
Hey, Starburns, come here, Starburns.

47:30.120 --> 47:33.120
I feel like people might leave sad.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.120
Yeah.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.120
I just...

47:35.120 --> 47:38.120
It has nothing to do with me wanting to create it.

47:38.120 --> 47:41.120
I just don't want people to be sad when they come to my house.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.120
We also got really excited at the idea

47:43.120 --> 47:45.120
of calling the dog Steve A.G.

47:45.120 --> 47:48.120
Because you kind of...

47:48.120 --> 47:49.120
He kind of looks like Steve A.G.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.120
I don't think Steve...

47:50.120 --> 47:52.120
No, Steve A.G. has a real thought.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.120
He doesn't...

47:53.120 --> 47:56.120
He does not like when people compare him to other people.

47:56.120 --> 47:58.120
Yeah, I mean, I see somebody out in public,

47:58.120 --> 47:59.120
and he looks like Steve A.G.,

47:59.120 --> 48:00.120
and then on Instagram, I'm like,

48:00.120 --> 48:01.120
Hey, it looks like Steve A.G.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.120
Did you see my Mexican Doug Benson at the Sushi Place?

48:03.120 --> 48:04.120
Yes, yes, yes.

48:04.120 --> 48:06.120
Yeah, there's a guy I'm telling you.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.120
Mexican Doug Benson.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.120
Mexican Doug Benson.

48:08.120 --> 48:11.120
I like to think Doug Benson would be on board that one.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.120
Yeah.

48:12.120 --> 48:14.120
But maybe the dog's name is Harvey.

48:14.120 --> 48:15.120
Mexican people maybe not so much.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.120
Right.

48:16.120 --> 48:17.120
Why not?

48:17.120 --> 48:21.120
Maybe all are so much easier to watch from down there.

48:21.120 --> 48:23.120
Yeah.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.120
It's a tough company up here, man.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.120
Yeah.

48:26.120 --> 48:27.120
All right, let's do this thing.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.120
So let's inventory what we got here.

48:29.120 --> 48:32.120
So the last thing you got was the soul of growth.

48:32.120 --> 48:33.120
Right.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.120
So that was the important thing.

48:34.120 --> 48:36.120
I mean, but you got other stuff too.

48:36.120 --> 48:37.120
What is the soul of growth exactly?

48:37.120 --> 48:39.120
You don't know what it is exactly.

48:39.120 --> 48:42.120
However, you know, you do...

48:42.120 --> 48:45.120
Mulrainee, do you have Knowledge Nature?

48:45.120 --> 48:47.120
Yeah, so much.

48:47.120 --> 48:51.120
So the thing is, some of you guys have skills called knowledge,

48:51.120 --> 48:54.120
which lets you think about the world that your character inhabits

48:54.120 --> 48:56.120
and glean some useful information.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.120
So Sharpie has some knowledge skills,

48:58.120 --> 49:00.120
and I think you have knowledge and nature.

49:00.120 --> 49:02.120
So what's your skill rank and knowledge and nature?

49:02.120 --> 49:03.120
Seven.

49:03.120 --> 49:04.120
Awesome.

49:04.120 --> 49:06.120
So you're going to get a plus seven.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.120
Thanks.

49:07.120 --> 49:08.120
All right.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.120
So you discover, I mean, you don't discover,

49:10.120 --> 49:14.120
you rack your mind, and you know that the soul of growth

49:14.120 --> 49:16.120
is a great artifact of power,

49:16.120 --> 49:22.120
and it's supposed to embody, like, the vital force that makes plants grow.

49:22.120 --> 49:24.120
It's like the reason why plants grow.

49:24.120 --> 49:27.120
It has strong associations with druids, and druids love it,

49:27.120 --> 49:32.120
and you know, natural creatures and various things like that, you know, elves.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.120
So we now control...

49:34.120 --> 49:37.120
We now have the thing that controls whether or not plants grow?

49:37.120 --> 49:40.120
According to the legends and superstitions, of course.

49:40.120 --> 49:42.120
But yeah, yeah, definitely.

49:42.120 --> 49:45.120
Little do we know, in a few thousand years this will be available

49:45.120 --> 49:47.120
at every home improvement store.

49:47.120 --> 49:52.120
It's magic, baby.

49:52.120 --> 49:54.120
You talking about Chiapet?

49:54.120 --> 49:55.120
What are you talking about?

49:55.120 --> 49:56.120
Just fertilizer.

49:56.120 --> 49:58.120
Oh, okay.

49:58.120 --> 50:01.120
All right, so let's get the hell out of here.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.120
Well, that's the thing.

50:03.120 --> 50:04.120
Huh?

50:04.120 --> 50:05.120
That's the thing.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.120
Okay, I look around for a way to get out.

50:06.120 --> 50:12.120
The door that you came in, the massive metal door, has closed itself,

50:12.120 --> 50:15.120
and you're entrapped within it.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.120
Whose turn is that?

50:17.120 --> 50:18.120
Your turn.

50:18.120 --> 50:22.120
Can I summon my beloved horse Coco?

50:22.120 --> 50:25.120
Could she maybe nestle the door open?

50:25.120 --> 50:30.120
You can definitely summon her, whether or not she shows up.

50:30.120 --> 50:33.120
You don't have to be a jerk about it.

50:33.120 --> 50:35.120
Yeah, that's brilliant, because when the horse walks in,

50:35.120 --> 50:37.120
we'll go, let's go out that way.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.120
If a horse could find a way.

50:38.120 --> 50:42.120
I'm thinking that the horse could...

50:42.120 --> 50:43.120
It's like a sim.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.120
If it's out there, it'll try to...

50:45.120 --> 50:49.120
Well, she'll use her hooves, and she'll go,

50:49.120 --> 50:52.120
there's a specific word for this that I'm not remembering.

50:52.120 --> 50:53.120
Adam.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.120
I love you.

50:54.120 --> 51:02.120
Adam Goldberg called me at 8am the other morning.

51:02.120 --> 51:04.120
How come Adam...

51:04.120 --> 51:05.120
Since you stopped...

51:05.120 --> 51:06.120
Sorry.

51:06.120 --> 51:08.120
No, it's his fault.

51:08.120 --> 51:12.120
How come every week Adam Goldberg comes to the show,

51:12.120 --> 51:15.120
and it seems like after every show,

51:15.120 --> 51:18.120
he tells us that he's not going to be around anymore?

51:18.120 --> 51:21.120
Yeah, so Adam told me last week that he was now a Night Watchman,

51:21.120 --> 51:24.120
and so he wasn't... Okay, but then you said that you weren't...

51:24.120 --> 51:26.120
you weren't able to come to shows anymore

51:26.120 --> 51:27.120
because you were a Night Watchman.

51:27.120 --> 51:30.120
They gave me different days off than I wanted, so...

51:30.120 --> 51:31.120
Okay.

51:31.120 --> 51:32.120
Previous to that...

51:32.120 --> 51:34.120
He doesn't murder me.

51:34.120 --> 51:35.120
It's all fine.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.120
Nope, dad.

51:36.120 --> 51:37.120
Well, it's okay.

51:37.120 --> 51:39.120
It's nice to see you.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.120
I know, I know you're not going to murder me.

51:40.120 --> 51:42.120
Previous to that, it was that you were going to go work

51:42.120 --> 51:43.120
on the Shark Movie, right?

51:43.120 --> 51:45.120
I got fired from that, but I didn't get fired from this yet.

51:45.120 --> 51:50.120
But basically, if you look at behavior instead of language,

51:50.120 --> 51:53.120
which I prefer to do, you're here every week,

51:53.120 --> 51:55.120
and you say every week,

51:55.120 --> 51:56.120
I'm not going to be here anymore.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.120
It's a durable urgency.

51:58.120 --> 52:00.120
You're not an optimist, you're a pessimist,

52:00.120 --> 52:01.120
because you call and you say,

52:01.120 --> 52:04.120
look, I'm not going to be able to hang out,

52:04.120 --> 52:06.120
so we better get it in,

52:06.120 --> 52:08.120
because I'm not going to be here.

52:08.120 --> 52:09.120
Better get it in.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.120
Yeah, better get it in.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.120
Better get his dick in.

52:12.120 --> 52:14.120
I better get it in.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.120
Anyway.

52:15.120 --> 52:18.120
All right, so you summon your horse.

52:18.120 --> 52:21.120
Nothing happens.

52:21.120 --> 52:23.120
The horse doesn't even come?

52:23.120 --> 52:26.120
Well, you're like several layers underground in a dungeon,

52:26.120 --> 52:27.120
in the way you can.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.120
You're like several layers.

52:28.120 --> 52:29.120
That's true.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.120
I'm a dungeon master.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.120
And there's no...

52:31.120 --> 52:32.120
Dungeon Snap.

52:32.120 --> 52:33.120
Dungeon Snap.

52:33.120 --> 52:36.120
So there's no other visible...

52:36.120 --> 52:41.120
I look around the walls to try to detect any sort of other egress.

52:41.120 --> 52:43.120
The ceilings go up really high,

52:43.120 --> 52:45.120
past the lighting of the chamber.

52:45.120 --> 52:47.120
You can't see how far they go up,

52:47.120 --> 52:48.120
but they definitely go up.

52:48.120 --> 52:50.120
What about that crack where the dragon came through?

52:50.120 --> 52:51.120
I mean, you could go in there.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.120
All right.

52:52.120 --> 52:54.120
I poked my head down in the crack.

52:54.120 --> 52:57.120
You see...

52:57.120 --> 52:58.120
It's sliding.

52:58.120 --> 53:00.120
You're not deaf.

53:00.120 --> 53:02.120
It's fine, yeah.

53:02.120 --> 53:05.120
Sliding your head into the crack.

53:05.120 --> 53:11.120
You see the faint demarcations of what appears to be a smallish dragon.

53:11.120 --> 53:13.120
A smallish dragon's down there?

53:13.120 --> 53:15.120
It appears to be.

53:15.120 --> 53:18.120
Maybe I can make it believe it's my child,

53:18.120 --> 53:21.120
and I'll be like Khaleesi, and I'll have dragons.

53:21.120 --> 53:24.120
These are the demarcations of...

53:24.120 --> 53:25.120
Misspoke.

53:25.120 --> 53:28.120
Oh.

53:28.120 --> 53:31.120
You see the faint outline of a dimly,

53:31.120 --> 53:33.120
unlit, dragon-esque shape.

53:33.120 --> 53:36.120
This is through a crack on the floor?

53:36.120 --> 53:39.120
There's a crack where the big dragon came out.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.120
So there's a dragon baby in there?

53:41.120 --> 53:43.120
I don't know.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.120
How so coy?

53:45.120 --> 53:47.120
How big is it?

53:47.120 --> 53:50.120
I mean, from what you can see, it looks maybe about three feet tall.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.120
All right.

53:51.120 --> 53:53.120
How far a drop is it down to the cave?

53:53.120 --> 53:54.120
It's not a drop.

53:54.120 --> 53:56.120
It's about 12 feet in.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.120
Oh, okay.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.120
So I can just walk into the crack?

53:58.120 --> 53:59.120
Yeah.

53:59.120 --> 54:00.120
Okay.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.120
Is there anything else in the cave?

54:01.120 --> 54:02.120
Yeah, totally.

54:02.120 --> 54:03.120
Let's check it out.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.120
All right.

54:04.120 --> 54:05.120
Well, you check it out.

54:05.120 --> 54:08.120
You see a couple, you know, staff-like implements.

54:08.120 --> 54:12.120
They look like maybe rods or sticks.

54:12.120 --> 54:13.120
Several of them.

54:13.120 --> 54:15.120
Like five.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.120
Yeah, five.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.120
Just sticking out of the ground?

54:17.120 --> 54:18.120
Yeah.

54:18.120 --> 54:20.120
You can't see too well unless you have low light vision.

54:20.120 --> 54:21.120
I think I do, don't I?

54:21.120 --> 54:22.120
Oh, you can see them just fine.

54:22.120 --> 54:25.120
Yeah, I didn't know them.

54:25.120 --> 54:26.120
My mistake.

54:26.120 --> 54:27.120
Yeah, yeah, I've got low light vision.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.120
Typically, I play with a lot of humans.

54:29.120 --> 54:31.120
Yeah, anyway.

54:31.120 --> 54:35.120
The thing that I was coyly phrasing as a dragon

54:35.120 --> 54:38.120
is instead a dragon-shaped statue made out of jade.

54:38.120 --> 54:41.120
It's massive, and you can tell it's worth a shit ton of money.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.120
Ooh.

54:42.120 --> 54:47.120
I detect traps.

54:47.120 --> 54:50.120
I think I also do that.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.120
You all got Christian Brooks coming in.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.120
Chris, get in here.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.120
Check this out.

54:53.120 --> 54:57.120
I detect traps at a plus two.

54:57.120 --> 54:59.120
Detecting traps as a team.

54:59.120 --> 55:01.120
You scarcely, you don't scarcely,

55:01.120 --> 55:06.120
you just determine that there don't seem to be any traps.

55:06.120 --> 55:07.120
All right.

55:07.120 --> 55:11.120
I'm going to take the statue and try to lift it off.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.120
It's on the pedestals, sir?

55:12.120 --> 55:13.120
It's not.

55:13.120 --> 55:16.120
It's just kind of like, it's kind of like it's knocked over.

55:16.120 --> 55:17.120
Really?

55:17.120 --> 55:19.120
Is it light enough for me to carry?

55:19.120 --> 55:20.120
It's very heavy.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.120
I mean, you could drag it.

55:21.120 --> 55:23.120
Yeah, yeah, you could drag it, but you can't really lift it.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.120
Is it worth dragging a giant statue around?

55:25.120 --> 55:28.120
I mean, you have a bag of holding, which can like,

55:28.120 --> 55:30.120
when you put it in the bag of holding, it stops being heavy.

55:30.120 --> 55:31.120
Oh, okay.

55:31.120 --> 55:32.120
I toss the statue in my bag of holding.

55:32.120 --> 55:34.120
Yeah, okay, cool.

55:34.120 --> 55:35.120
Then there was the sticks, right?

55:35.120 --> 55:36.120
The sticks.

55:36.120 --> 55:37.120
Right, yeah.

55:37.120 --> 55:40.120
So you see, two of them are actually javelins,

55:40.120 --> 55:42.120
and two of them appear to be bows,

55:42.120 --> 55:45.120
and one of them appears to be like a quarter staff.

55:45.120 --> 55:46.120
Oh, these are weapons that we can take.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.120
Yeah.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.120
I mentioned Malrin's going to want that bow.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.120
Can we all fit through this crack?

55:50.120 --> 55:51.120
Yeah, yeah.

55:51.120 --> 55:52.120
Come on in.

55:52.120 --> 55:53.120
All right.

55:53.120 --> 55:54.120
The cave is great.

55:54.120 --> 55:55.120
You guys get in here.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.120
Hey, what's going on?

55:56.120 --> 55:58.120
I just stole the statue.

55:58.120 --> 56:00.120
You guys can't see as well.

56:00.120 --> 56:01.120
Aaron can see good.

56:01.120 --> 56:03.120
Jeff can see good.

56:03.120 --> 56:05.120
All right, well, I'm sure I got to cast a light.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.120
Okay.

56:06.120 --> 56:11.120
I cast it on the end of my thumb.

56:11.120 --> 56:12.120
Okay.

56:12.120 --> 56:17.120
And I hold my thumb up around like a zippo.

56:17.120 --> 56:21.120
That's Dungeons and Dragons funny.

56:21.120 --> 56:22.120
It's just natural.

56:22.120 --> 56:24.120
Actually, let me do it at the end of one of these staffs

56:24.120 --> 56:25.120
that we're stealing.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.120
Okay.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.120
Yeah, that's easier.

56:27.120 --> 56:29.120
The staff you grab that begins glowing

56:29.120 --> 56:32.120
appears to be in the shape of a serpent.

56:32.120 --> 56:37.120
It feels like snake skin under your grasp, but firm.

56:37.120 --> 56:38.120
Sneaky staff, guys.

56:38.120 --> 56:40.120
That's a magic staff probably, right?

56:40.120 --> 56:41.120
Yeah, yeah.

56:41.120 --> 56:42.120
Most of them are.

56:42.120 --> 56:43.120
Most of them are.

56:43.120 --> 56:44.120
You barely ever find a staff in this game

56:44.120 --> 56:45.120
that was just like,

56:45.120 --> 56:49.120
an old man needed help walking.

56:49.120 --> 56:52.120
I check out the javelin.

56:52.120 --> 56:54.120
There's two javelins.

56:54.120 --> 56:56.120
They're inscribed with lightning bolts,

56:56.120 --> 56:59.120
and they're covered in silver.

56:59.120 --> 57:02.120
All right.

57:02.120 --> 57:03.120
I take one of them,

57:03.120 --> 57:05.120
and Chris, do you want the other javelin?

57:05.120 --> 57:06.120
Yes.

57:06.120 --> 57:08.120
I would like a javelin, please.

57:08.120 --> 57:14.120
I would like a silver lightning bolt javelin.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.120
Then there was the two bows.

57:16.120 --> 57:17.120
One of them is a long bow,

57:17.120 --> 57:19.120
and one of them is a short bow.

57:19.120 --> 57:21.120
I would like a bow.

57:21.120 --> 57:23.120
You're proficient with the long bow as it happens.

57:23.120 --> 57:24.120
Well, I'm a little gal.

57:24.120 --> 57:25.120
I'll take the short bow.

57:25.120 --> 57:26.120
How about that?

57:26.120 --> 57:27.120
Whatever.

57:27.120 --> 57:28.120
What's your dexterity?

57:28.120 --> 57:30.120
I don't know.

57:30.120 --> 57:34.120
Where does it say dexterity?

57:34.120 --> 57:35.120
It's up at the top left.

57:35.120 --> 57:38.120
It's under 14 plus 2 ability modifier.

57:38.120 --> 57:40.120
So you're going to be able to shoot it,

57:40.120 --> 57:42.120
but not amazingly, but yeah.

57:42.120 --> 57:43.120
All right.

57:43.120 --> 57:44.120
I take it anyway.

57:44.120 --> 57:45.120
All right.

57:45.120 --> 57:46.120
So I take the long bow.

57:46.120 --> 57:47.120
There you go.

57:47.120 --> 57:49.120
All right.

57:49.120 --> 57:52.120
You also see two smallish chests,

57:52.120 --> 57:54.120
one of which is very ornate,

57:54.120 --> 57:57.120
and it appears to be leafed in gold.

57:57.120 --> 58:01.120
The other is a simple wooden box.

58:01.120 --> 58:05.120
I'll detect trap on that.

58:05.120 --> 58:08.120
Very good, buddy.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.120
With your accent, it sounds so much like

58:10.120 --> 58:14.120
just like a TBS game show.

58:14.120 --> 58:16.120
I'll detect trap on that.

58:16.120 --> 58:17.120
Howie Mandel goes,

58:17.120 --> 58:19.120
all right, let's detect trap on it.

58:19.120 --> 58:23.120
It's a boat.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.120
You detect no traps.

58:25.120 --> 58:26.120
There should be more traps.

58:26.120 --> 58:29.120
Well, let's open that second one.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.120
All right.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.120
Which one?

58:31.120 --> 58:32.120
The wooden one.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.120
Opening the wooden chest,

58:33.120 --> 58:38.120
you see a pair of dark gobbles.

58:38.120 --> 58:41.120
Steampunk.

58:41.120 --> 58:44.120
I'll put them on.

58:44.120 --> 58:45.120
As you put them on,

58:45.120 --> 58:48.120
you recognize that you can see perfectly in the dark.

58:48.120 --> 58:56.120
Oh.

58:56.120 --> 58:57.120
Where's my pen?

58:57.120 --> 58:58.120
I'm going to write that shit down.

58:58.120 --> 59:01.120
I now see in the dark.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.120
He'll add it to you.

59:02.120 --> 59:03.120
He'll do it later.

59:03.120 --> 59:04.120
He's a dungeon master.

59:04.120 --> 59:06.120
That's good for a rogue, though.

59:06.120 --> 59:07.120
You're a thief.

59:07.120 --> 59:08.120
That's good for you.

59:08.120 --> 59:10.120
With your new dark vision,

59:10.120 --> 59:12.120
with which you can see in the night,

59:12.120 --> 59:14.120
you see at the end of the crack,

59:14.120 --> 59:16.120
there seems to be a slight tear

59:16.120 --> 59:18.120
that's even darker than black

59:18.120 --> 59:20.120
in the back of the cave.

59:20.120 --> 59:21.120
Is there a figurative tear,

59:21.120 --> 59:27.120
like the tear between justice and vengeance?

59:27.120 --> 59:29.120
More literal.

59:29.120 --> 59:32.120
Like the tear between a wall and another wall.

59:32.120 --> 59:34.120
Yeah, okay.

59:34.120 --> 59:37.120
Chris, can you see with those goggles?

59:37.120 --> 59:39.120
Can you see through that darker than black crack?

59:39.120 --> 59:40.120
You can't.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.120
It's the darkest of darks.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.120
Can I borrow your thumb there, E.T.?

59:43.120 --> 59:44.120
Oh, yeah.

59:44.120 --> 59:46.120
Yeah, my serpent staff.

59:46.120 --> 59:48.120
I mean, I hold the tear.

59:48.120 --> 59:50.120
Careful, shield your goggle eyes.

59:50.120 --> 59:53.120
I don't want to, you know, zero dark 30.

59:53.120 --> 59:55.120
Yeah, that's Osama.

59:55.120 --> 59:57.120
That's a good point.

59:57.120 --> 59:59.120
Does that shed the light?

59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.120
Osama bin Laden.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.120
Sorry, sorry.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.120
Anyway.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.120
That's my favorite part of the trailer of that movie,

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.120
which is the only part of the movie I saw.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.120
There's the part of the movie,

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.120
I was assuming it's impossible to do spoilers for zero dark 30s.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.120
I mean, kind of, we know how it ends,

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.120
but there's a point where they're like,

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120
Osama.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120
Osama.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120
Kind of lure them out.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.120
I like to think that's Chris Pratt, right?

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.120
Guy from Parks and Rec.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.120
Okay, all right.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120
Continue.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.120
Yeah, okay.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.120
So as the staff nears the tear,

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.120
you notice that no light coming into it is exiting.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.120
It seems very mysterious.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.120
Wait, I'm sorry.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.120
I was thinking about vodka and what I just said.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.120
And so is your character.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.120
You weren't paying attention.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.120
Okay.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.120
Fill them in.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.120
Tell them what happened.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.120
The light doesn't shine far into this new part of the crack.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120
Is it big enough for people to go through?

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.120
So are we trying to get out?

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.120
You can't see it, I guess.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.120
We're trying to get out through this crack,

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.120
as opposed to the door.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120
The door we can't get out.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120
Right.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.120
We didn't try.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.120
Truth.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.120
But it sounded pretty ominous that the door was shut behind us

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.120
and for good.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120
I mean, maybe.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120
We wouldn't have found the statue in the trunk.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.120
I mean, we would have sat there.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.120
I mean, these people, you could hear them wanting to kill themselves.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120
Like, you just feel it in the air.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120
Robin Williams came out.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.120
He did sperm jokes.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.120
It's just, I'm not saying, I'm not being self-defeating.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.120
I'm just saying, like, it was good that we didn't spend 48 minutes

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.120
at a steel door.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.120
I think it's good to go through cracks.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.120
Him and Bob are dressed the same.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120
Yeah.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.120
Yeah, they're very cute.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120
Yeah, they're so cute.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.120
They were like you and Jeff.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.120
Yeah.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.120
Yeah.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.120
Good suits.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120
I opened up the ornate trunk.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.120
The ornate trunk.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.120
Yeah, the golden leafed one, if I'm not mistaken.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.120
Correct.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.120
Of course.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.120
Of course.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.120
What you see inside dazzles with a gleaning blue light.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.120
It's curious service betrays its true nature.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.120
It's one of the fragments of power.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.120
But what it's doing on this plane, you have no idea.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.120
What it's doing is what?

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.120
On this plane, you have no idea.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.120
So how many fragments do we have now?

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.120
You don't know.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120
Oh, no.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120
Okay.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.120
So you had the one initially, the one from Dark Star in this one.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.120
And your dad's last time we met, it was still in his colon.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.120
Correct.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.120
So you know of four, and you have three of them.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.120
And there might be more.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120
Okay.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120
There's more, you guys.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.120
All right.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.120
Sharpie, you take that.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.120
You're the magic man.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.120
I'll take the fragment.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:38.120
You feel it pulse and shiver in your grasp.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.120
And then it stops.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.120
All right.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120
Okay.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.120
Can that fragment glowing blue light?

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.120
Will that shed any more light for us in this new chamber?

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120
Try it.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120
It stopped.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120
Oh, yeah.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120
Yeah.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120
It did stop.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.120
All right.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.120
Shit.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.120
Okay.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.120
I have serpent light.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120
What the...

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.120
Yeah.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.120
So the serpent light, you put it up like, here's the hole, right?

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120
You put it.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120
This is great for the podcast.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.120
And the light doesn't shine through it.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.120
Right.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.120
Like it's like a magical darkness.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120
Yeah.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.120
So it can't be penetrated.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.120
But it's big enough for people to go through?

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120
I mean, I know.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.120
You have to like, you can hoist yourself through it.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120
All right.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.120
I say Sharpie, hold my hand and I'm going to poke through it.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.120
If I yell anything, you pull me back out.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120
All right.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120
I'll hold his little hand.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120
Okay.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120
While he pokes through.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120
Yeah.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.120
And I, as I leave, I go, wish me luck, buddy.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120
I know.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:41.120
I'm pretending you said I love you.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.120
Yeah.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.120
Are you doing Empire Strikes?

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120
Or return of the Jedi?

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120
Empire Strikes.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120
Empire Strikes.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.120
Community too.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.120
All right.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.120
All right.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.120
So then I call him a Scruffy looking nerf herder and then I go into the thing.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:58.120
Going into the thing, you feel a dark chill come over your body.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:04.120
As your torso goes through the portal, you can tell that you're in another dimension.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.120
Oh.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.120
Oh.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.120
Oh.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.120
Oh.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.120
Oh.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.120
Oh.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.120
Oh.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120
Oh.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120
Oh.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120
Oh.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.120
Oh.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120
Oh.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.120
Oh.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.120
Oh.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.120
Oh.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120
Oh.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.120
Oh.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.120
Oh.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.120
Oh.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.120
Oh.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.120
Oh.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.120
Oh.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.120
Oh.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.120
Oh.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.120
Oh.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.120
Oh.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.120
Oh.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.120
Okay.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.120
Oh.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.120
Oh.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.120
Oh.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.120
Oh.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:36.940
Oh.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.940
Hey.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.940
Oh.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:39.940
Oh.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.940
Oh.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:41.940
Oh.

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:42.940

hand is in the the way I yeah yeah the way I figured it you're more like halfway

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:04.060
throughout at this point I guess you could be all the way throughout okay I

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:09.580
step tentatively all the way through out into the the gray floor the ground is

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:14.180
firm beneath your feet all right I keep moving as long as I feel his hand I

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:30.460
reach out for Chris de Burgh's hand and I hand him my goggles I offer the goggles

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:35.300
back give me your hand okay I take his hand no one's reaching for my hands so

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:42.140
I stick them out out of an insecurity neediness I pretend that I'm sick and

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:51.460
weak so people grab my hands Krista Burke grab thank you all right so like a

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:56.460
field trip leader I if I pull them all in like we're going through like a like

01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:01.780
we're all at Disneyland or something like that show with the magic school bus

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:06.380
just like that magic school bus yeah that was a great show and show with the

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:09.820
magic school bus so we all walk into the into the nude dimension slipping

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:13.780
through the dark portal you find yourself in a bank of dark misty haze the

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.620
inky black fog obscures your vision and you can't make out your surroundings

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:23.540
you can't even see the rift you came through then an indistinct hazy gray

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:29.300
disc floats lazily upwards and past the horizon and for a time you're bathed in

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:35.380
a slightly less form of dire darkness the closest you could consider light this

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:39.740
grayish light casts a pitch black shadow onto the floor and you can see your

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:44.660
shadow dancing and twitching madly as the grayish light flickers suddenly the

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:47.900
shadows on the floor peel off their points of connection with your feet and

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:52.980
begin to come away from your body oh shadows as your shadows detach you feel

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:59.540
violently ill for an intense few seconds before you even out you feel like

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.380
you've been seriously assaulted and weakened from losing your shadow jody

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:10.100
fostered to mention you can just make out your shadows slip away into the dark

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:15.140
landscape before the hazy disc falls into the horizon it's like diminishing to

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.620
nothing they stole our shadows their shadows maybe our shadows just left

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:23.620
peter pants fell well when do we when do I mourn cocoa you in the front row on

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:31.700
the boat that you said something you knew what this was thank you that's what

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:35.780
I was thinking about he said cocoa is in the other dimension my horse my beloved

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:42.500
horse and just lover is in the other side you should care too I do I do care

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.980
I just said we had a really special time together I mean what the last time

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:51.220
that I fucked your horse a couple times I think right and it yes and it was

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.860
consensual it's consensual yeah that's okay yeah and all he got all the time

01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:01.940
I was a t-shirt so yeah okay can we summon the horse through this different

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:07.780
dimension Spencer as it happens you can't at the moment hold on so so shadows

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:13.140
leaving your bodies has actually caused some ability damage towards you so I

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:18.540
can update your sheet later but basically your bigger fish you guys yeah

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:24.780
the horse horse loss sure this is shadow loss Sharpey loses force strength and to

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:29.340
constitution quark loses to constitution and for strength no no to

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:34.380
strengthen for constitution Mulraine loses to strengthen three constitution and

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:38.980
Chris de Burghh loses one strength and four constitutions she's a vastly weakened

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:44.020
it's just about pooping what is constitutional constitution is your

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:49.860
ability to shrug off physical damage or resist your shape being shifted for

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:53.540
instance or you know if you've been poisoned that's constitution based

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:57.860
health yeah health like you're you're healthiness now what is dancing lights

01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:06.020
do dancing lights conjures a small illusion so like yeah well like you

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:09.940
know like those I don't know like it's like to dazzle enemies till I kind of

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:15.500
like it's more like you can play it'd be weird it's like I you know the

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:20.420
tinkerbell like being a floaty light yeah shows up it looks kind of like that

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:24.500
except there's more of them and it's a bullshit it's bullshit it's it's it's

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:28.420
minor illusory magic it can make like little things it would dazzle like kind

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:32.380
of dumb people or like people that weren't aware of magic and stuff but like

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:36.460
people who are like up in magic they're like hey I can I have a silent image so

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:42.220
fuck off it's horse shit alright bullshit is there still that that's that

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:46.940
pitch black shadow in the middle of the room or was there some big thing that

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:50.740
was a disc in the middle of the room shadows have detached and we have

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:55.900
stomach eggs yeah so and in yeah now you're outside you can tell like you're

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.620
outside we're out should I mention that I'm sorry so that that disc that rose is

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:03.020
that kind of like a nighttime suns like like bizarre oh I was what I was going

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:07.140
for yeah yeah what do you mean what the disc that rose it's casting some tiny

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:11.180
bit of light is like a weird dark Sun oh it's not in the middle it's not it's not

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:16.660
it's actually like a giant dinner plate my narration was it rose up off of the

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:23.140
horizon in the sky okay so it was a light and then it left I put on my fancy

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:31.420
goggles and then tell everybody in a narration voice what I see you see the

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:35.820
ground around you is rather unadorned but to the what I'm gonna call north for

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:41.100
sake of maps you see a stand of black columns they poke stiffly out of the

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:48.700
ground you also hear a far-off sound I can't make the sound of my mouth can you

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.660
can we send off your bird can you send up a venture

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:58.580
Avenger is Avenger there yeah he's here Avenger how did you handle having your

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:03.780
shadow detached Avenger's shadow wasn't attached oh he's immune to shadow

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:15.060
detachment humblebrag Avenger fly up and give me a hawks eye view it's not

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:19.540
long before he returns he gives you a look that says the higher up I get the

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:23.020
less I can see the ground below but there's definitely a black shape

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:29.980
approaching us swiftly oh spaghetti oh a black shape approaching us soon it's

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:37.420
upon you now it's upon you all right what is my does my javelin have any

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:40.900
magic powers or anything was it just a straight-up javelin the javelin you

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:45.220
found yeah I mean yeah it has magic you don't know much about the magic it has

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:48.700
I said let's see what this baby can do and I take my javelin out and I toss it

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:53.260
toward in the direction of the dark figure all right man is that too prept

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:59.140
preptive but I don't know man well you miss okay girls I mean I'll tell you

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:04.420
one thing I think we attacked that dragon too soon a couple weeks ago

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:08.260
game comment yeah I don't know Monday morning quarterback but a dragon came

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:12.900
on said what muscles do I smell and then and then in his prison like he said it

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.820
was his prison we just wailed on it we never we never tried to talk to you were

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:20.460
locked in his prison if a dragon speaks English like just a conversation most

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:24.500
dragon speaking he's been acid at us instead no after that was after I don't

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.780
want a Monday morning quarterback but then can I use wild empathy on the

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:34.700
shadow yeah I do that it seems to have a very familiar soul oh sorry my bad

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:39.220
sorry everybody cool it everyone familiar soul it's a good thing you

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:46.020
rolled a three chair I try to take it doesn't even know you were just looks like

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:50.660
here tonight can I go run over and grab my javelin kind of because it's

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:57.540
surreptitiously and stick it back in my bag of holding everyone notices and

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:04.220
it's pretty embarrassing but yeah the shape approaches and stands next to

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:11.780
Mulrainee stays there hey guys why don't we show them what we're made of and do a

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:26.820
little do a little talent show what who's them who is that the dark shadow

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:31.620
came up to show him the shadow show the shadow who are made of interact with the

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:38.140
shadow talk to it or something hey you little shadow you oh I should have

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:46.980
mentioned it's cuz it showed up so fastly it's in the shape of a horse oh

01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:55.380
hello I was killed I was killed your horse your horse that's the second time

01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:02.860
her it does appear to be made of shadow the substance I a deer shadow I love

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:10.500
anything that's shaped like you were shaped so hey also I am with a party of

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:16.340
very good souls we have a gentleman who is searching for his father we have a

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:24.300
one-hit wonder who is looking to numb some dragon dicks and a we have a little

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:34.420
gentleman who loves some things is this cocoa or not do we know that I mean is

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:40.740
it cocoa it might be cocoa holy shit cocoa cocoa if it's you flare your tail

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:50.380
flare your tail if it's you cocoa but but I think about my dad I think a lot

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:54.220
about my dad like oh I'm looking for my dad I wish my dad was around

01:14:54.220 --> 01:15:07.420
instead you fall back on your arcane training and recognize that you're on

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:14.340
the shadow plane the shadow plane is a copy plane of the material plane and

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:20.380
as such things have shadow versions of themselves shadow shadow cocoa yeah but

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:25.700
but does it correspond to the real cocoa yeah so so this is like we can't hold

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:30.820
her no you can shadows are I mean we'll try to let's just try to hold her how

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:36.380
about I try to hold her I could just explain what happens but that'd be just

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:44.580
me telling a shitty story I reach I reach up and I I look I look at quirk I

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:48.460
hold his hand because I know that he's also emotionally invested in cocoa and

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:53.420
I I throw my arm around Coco's neck we both look at each other because you know

01:15:53.420 --> 01:16:01.060
she's my friend and he she's your lover and and we look at Coco's face it it

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:06.100
doesn't look back I mean but yeah so this is the shadow version of cocoa so

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:10.140
our shadows ran off so our shadow versions of ourselves have left us yeah

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:13.500
to go do who knows what we do we need to reunite with her with our shadows well

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:18.820
I mean if you don't mind minus two to strengthen minus four to constitution

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:25.660
you're probably fine but yeah I mean it was whatever okay to try to get try to

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:34.260
get on your horse see what happens I try to jump on my shadow horse leaping

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:39.580
astride your shadow horse it feels comfortable underneath you oh it doesn't

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:43.700
try to buck you off and instead regards you as a trusted friend or ally have

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:49.780
Coco lead us to the pillars Coco can you lead us to the pillars it doesn't make

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:54.620
any response but slowly it begins to trot forward well but is that their

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:59.460
response that her husband she trots forward I'm just spoilers shadow cocoa

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:05.780
can't communicate there I shouldn't have said it I said it I'm sorry D&D

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:12.340
aficionados we're gonna get through this the question no not this like the

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:16.380
question of whether or not she's communicable with because she's silent

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:20.340
right shadows are so you're only giving us the I mean this but you know you're

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:23.380
giving us the information that that it would have taken us 10 minutes to figure

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:26.300
out their trial and error yeah just whether or not the horse can understand

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:31.220
us I didn't want you to feel like like you were being like you know cold

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:36.180
treatment and by your horse it just doesn't talk and Robin Robin and Bob

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:41.580
can't really dodge the bullet tonight isn't it I was like what characters are

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:46.860
they gonna be oh man Robin Williams is the shadow horse are you kidding me

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:59.460

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:03.380
gonna follow that horse all right so we we took me follow Coco often in the

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:06.780
direction of the five dark pillars there's more than five but yeah oh okay

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:10.260
well we just we go that way how far off are they there I'd say to take you a

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:15.300
good 30 minutes should we come brought in should we call that an act break yeah

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:20.540

uh I uh we were there whoo I plant a giant blue flag that I sew out of my

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:37.260
own sadness and I draw a picture of myself and I look at it and that's like a

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:43.580
bookmark for where we were before you leave right oh yeah yeah yeah okay I

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.820

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:40.220
or not okay I pretty certain that I've been I'm falling for something on an

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:46.020
April Fool's Day D&D I start digging through the pee-pee soil and and then I

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:53.380
unearth the wine skin your hands are filthy the wine skin comes out it looks

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:59.100
noticeably aged but otherwise unharmed aged from when it we buried it yeah like

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:07.500
we get aged extra see if you take a lot of things and put them in dirt and

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:13.260
pee to look older it's called distressing like a cabinet I don't know

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:24.300
I was gonna do April Fool's and then you ruined it I wanted to end the game and

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:29.700
a laugh just say April Fool's and then you go I got a feeling this is April

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:32.980

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:11.660

through it everybody good luck a Coachella buddy good luck a Coachella

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.860
the hell is Coachella Jeff I don't know it's a thing where people it's like it's

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:48.460
like a Lollapalooza but for not for 40 year olds you dress up weird and you

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:53.740
and you drive around in a big thing that you made and that's everything name one

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:59.620
thing where it's not a you know you drive around in a weird thing all right how

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:04.340
do we end the show oh yeah oh the movie okay thank you sir thank you

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:07.860
what are the parameters now for you want the audience here to all we're all

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.580
gonna watch it they're all gonna come back and then we're all gonna just it's

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:13.300
just something to discuss it I think it's just interesting it's like the Oprah's

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.300
book club it's like it's interesting if you know it's like usually go like I was

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.780
watching you know what I watched the other day is Robocop 3 and then there's

01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:24.540
like 20 people like oh I saw that last week or and then two more people saw it

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:29.020
six months ago and then some people have never seen it right like for aficionados

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:32.740
I mean these guys show up on Monday nights pretty regularly I think if we

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:38.660
said hey let's all make time this week to watch blah blah blah we would increase

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:41.980
the odds so like there would be a more connection we would be able to discuss

01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:45.420
something I don't know it's just a thought well there's a thought it's not a

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:50.260
good thought it's not you know God when God was creating the universe he he he

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:55.900
just made it up he didn't he didn't like he just he just thought stuff like he

01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:01.460
didn't he didn't think of stuff that he knew would work is that right yeah how

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.580
do you know that well because obviously it was the first time he did it otherwise

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:08.820
it wasn't there was no how do you know that well because he did it the other

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:12.540
wise it's dumb like why would we even write a Bible about it if he didn't

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:16.100
look it's got to be special right he made he there was nothing there was

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:20.700
nothing it says it specifically says there was nothing and then it says that

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:25.580
he started making shit up yes kind of like your pee on the wine skin thing

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:29.900
you know it's like it wasn't Eve just like mud and and and spit and ribs and

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:35.940
stuff like that do you believe in God Jeff do you think that there's an

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:40.860
intelligence to the to the cosmos I think there is but in a way that we aren't

01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:43.940
weird that we'd be totally incapable of totally understanding yeah I think

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:47.420
there's a system of some kind if those field line if we if God were simple

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:50.220
enough to understand we'd be too simple to understand even if that system is

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:55.860
simply just like I kind of like it's just kind of a throbbing like like jellyfish

01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:58.660
yeah but it is the cool thing it scientists are out there working and

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.740
you know looking smaller and smaller and smaller and building these giant things

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:06.060
in Vienna or wherever the fucking smashing particles together to figure out

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.980
what the fucking point of it all is like why why is there mass why is there

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:15.060
matter that is nice of them to do that yeah well I played BioShock Infinite

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:23.060
I did buy I bought that today I had had my assistant go out and get it I'm

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:28.380
distressed about one thing our web guy shrews I think I heard third hand that

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:33.900
he finished it in 25 hours but I think I also Adam why do you applaud things at

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:39.860
random you're not even supposed to be here by your own report yeah you're like

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:45.740
like every every week Adam's like oh I'm sorry I'm going off to Afghanistan guess

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.580
you'll have to be my friend tonight he never know and then next week there he

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:54.780
is biostat guy yay shrews what the fuck are you all right all right I like them

01:25:54.780 --> 01:26:03.700
to shut up but anyways whatever who cares I just you know skyrim it's like

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:07.260
hundreds and hundreds of hours if you want but I think maybe shrews is like a

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:13.380
crazy computer head and he I bet I bet you can barrel through the age story of

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:19.860
a good game in 25 hours I don't know I'm playing a little game on my iPhone

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:31.180
pocket planes I'm playing Candy Crush pretty good how many hours a lot but

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:36.580
they make you do this thing you're a little girl and you're going around

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:40.140
Candy Land and you're and you're blowing up little jelly isn't making little

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.820
little candies explode and then there's chocolate tries to eat your candies and

01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.900
there's little mr. like woolly wonka kind of character leading you through it

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:50.900
and then if you get past a certain level you either have to pay money to go

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:55.300
forward or invite friends on Facebook which I don't use so I went on Facebook

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:59.860
and tried drunk at Easter yesterday to get free lives out of people that don't

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:06.900
go on Facebook I'll ask Tammy two-tone that I've never fucking met and turns

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:11.380
out not only did I ask everybody I know to fucking give that I tell them that

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:16.540
Jeff Davis now plays Candy Crush but every time I pass a level it's just

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:23.740
flooding people's impartial just level 40 candy can just slid down the candy

01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:30.180
shoot Jeff beat the peppermint puppy and now people like hey Jeff I sounds like

01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:36.220
you're really kicking ass on Candy Crush so that I got up I saw that text and

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:42.340
ran into my computer just like undo remove remove that's amazing so not

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:45.500
paying these fuckers that's what they want they're playing on my ego it's like

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.340
are you are you a total douchebag and you're willing to tell everybody that

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:53.700
you you play Candy Crush are you gonna pay 99 cents I've said before all my

01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:57.180
favorite games on the iPad and iPhone they're always so-called time management

01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:01.860
games which are all like very specifically like clearly like driven

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:07.060
what do you call it targeting a female audience and I am not sexist by saying

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:12.120
that because the names of the games that I love are like Susie's sauna Fiona's

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:17.940
flowers and Maggie's magic shop but it's like always like like this cute

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.980
little girl with like a different kind of hat on and it's like she got a new

01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:24.740
job at a pizza place and like help her help her make her pizza place and you

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:29.620
you point and she goes over there and it's like gobble gobble gobble this

01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:32.220
guy needs a pizza and it's like oh you make the pepperoni over here and they

01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:35.620
slowly it's like you gotta you gotta figure out you know how to help her

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:39.780
she's gonna bust the tables and if she if you know if you just if you just have

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:43.420
her be disorganized it's weird because what do you think they're playing to

01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.860
in the female mind there well I don't know about the female mind because

01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:50.740
obviously I'm I'm I'm there they've got me hooked I don't I don't I don't know

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:56.460
why if they don't neutralize the gender thing I think that's really weird

01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:01.380
because I'm I'm this big fat hairy Ron Jeremy looking guy sitting in bed playing

01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:08.580
this thing I don't know the fact that they call it Susie's you know sunflower

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:12.860
patch like like like I feel like they're cutting themselves off at the or I

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:15.780
don't know I don't know why they think that that's a woman thing I think I've

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:19.500
made a mistake by removing Facebook I forgot that I have this podcast as a

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:23.020
platform I could just say to people give me lives on Facebook you can send me

01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:28.940
you can send me candy lines everybody everybody said Jeff even even even if

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:34.700
just spiritually just send Jeff a candy life tonight just just just close your

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:38.220

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:53.220
of weird maybe maybe they know exactly what they're doing maybe maybe 60% of

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:57.820
their customers are men probably I who know we're like we feel actually more

01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:03.300

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:32.420
through the crack is there another crack the show started off on such a summit I

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:35.980

going like hey sparky and then you just laugh because you feel like you you know

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:53.080
it's like holy shit Jesus Christ where could we go but they can do a deep dark

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:58.020
chasm what could be more valuable like they should we should actually go deeper

01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:04.300
and darker than we've ever gone we know we've wrapped lots what we haven't we

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:09.100
well how how where is the level no wrap what's the core of the earth what's

01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:15.380
below the the magma what's the what's the sub-aluminum what's what is what is

01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:19.860
what is what's the wine scan when the pee shitting on yourself in the fetal

there holding your your balls and your dick in one hand and smearing blood all

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:24.540
over your hairy chest and and the audience was like fucking like I want my

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:31.980

shut up do you want to come up okay all right a hand shot up you can just say

01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:51.860
that someone's handle shoot up and we haven't been punished for it yet what's

01:37:51.860 --> 01:38:00.420
your name I just wanted to come up cuz I wanted it I wasn't here last week I

01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:04.980
was at my friend Luciana show it was really great but last week you had a

01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:10.060
lady guest and Genevieve Pearson yeah and a couple weeks ago remember I came up

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.700
to you and I said it'd be really cool if you could have some female guests

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:16.300
sometime soon right and and I don't I don't know if you remember that happening

01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:25.660
but I okay I don't do you came up to go did I do that no I'm sorry no but

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:28.780
that's great anyway yeah I was really I was really glad that you did that I was

01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:31.900
very proud of you even if you maybe subconsciously you took yeah I'm sure

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:37.340
so everything I do is subconscious yes so there's there's a fun note for you to

01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:40.940
end on I feel like you you crossed a threshold there and I'm proud of you oh

01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:44.780
yeah well I mean what about what Aaron's always up here is always up here and

01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.100
she's really cool I love you you're my favorite part of the show do you feel

01:38:48.100 --> 01:39:02.660
like like women women women on stage women women performing what's up with

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:09.900
that no where's that going do you do you think that I'm trying to figure out how

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:13.900
to wait a way to phrase this without without loading it because it's easy to

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:18.700
be like like like politically correct and we can talk about how unfair the

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:22.780
performance world is to women but but and I'm not saying that it's not but I

01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:26.460
want to figure out a way to actually intelligently like vivisect that and

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:30.340
look at the beating heart of whatever is happening it we Aaron and I were

01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:36.220
talking about this women like without even knowing that we're doing it like

01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:43.860
women unlike men who just I think at the root of it I'm gonna talk try to talk

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:50.580
this through and I'm gonna sound like a fucking crazy person men are just like

01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:54.260
these like doesn't matter if we're handsome doesn't matter if we're if we're

01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:57.860
ugly doesn't matter what we are doesn't matter what role we occupy doesn't

01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.460
matter if we have a bad back doesn't matter if one of our legs doesn't work

01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:06.100
doesn't matter what like we like our role in the world is to kind of want and

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:11.700
unlike shoot out torpedoes and kind of like try and either fail or succeed and

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:17.260
I think that like women on stage like when women when women are performing in

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:21.700
anything no matter how enlightened the venue no matter what the case like we

01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:24.380
Aaron and I were trying to get to the bottom of this it's like there's a

01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:30.020
fucking tightrope you have to walk as a woman because the most progressive PC

01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:37.100
like super modern metrosexual futuristic Blade Runner thinker is still

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:41.140
before he's even thinking of it he's he's thinking of a woman as a woman and

01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:45.620
and kind of like there's it's like like the way Aaron put it was something like

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:50.660
if you're if you're this they're disappointed in you if you're that

01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:54.980
they're disappointed in you it's like like you it's the only way to describe

01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:58.580
it as a tightrope it's just I don't know what it's a tightrope between really but

01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:01.700
it's like you're doing some kind of balancing act all the time I feel like

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:05.380
you you addressed that with with Genevieve last week when you were talking

01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:09.260
about her reception on the reality show she was on about something Kevin Smith

01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.980
said to her about oh you're a girl and you like comic books I mean that was

01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:16.860
insane to me that was that was I mean like I'm really like I don't want to

01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:22.220
like like give myself something to Alan Aldo like metal like I my thing is

01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:27.380
always like I I just the same way with alcoholism or racism I want to cut

01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:31.100
everyone off at the pass I go fuck no I'm a misogynist I'm a sexist here's why

01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:34.220
because I don't want to have that conversation where it's like are you or

01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:37.540
aren't you all this bullshit and I think the thing that gets me in the most

01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:41.820
trouble is that I fit like like why am I talking about myself with this because I

01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:44.380
don't want to sound like I'm on a soapbox I don't want to like like like rush

01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:48.300
to judge but I thought in that moment that was a very odd thing that happened

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:52.780
where she actually got the better of this guy in this debate and that and that

01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:57.220
in the edited context of this thing the first thing he said was gotta give

01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:02.180
props to a chick who who who can correct a dude on Frank Miller it's like holy

01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:06.660
shit where nerds were down at the bottom of this valley and there's still

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:13.140
down here where golem lives there's male golems are still going like props to

01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:16.980
that pussy man that pussy was good you know like no one would which fish to eat

01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:23.500
raw like it was like like what we're all golem down here it the whole point was

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:28.500
that that was really really weird to me I'm gonna edit this all out because I

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:32.620
sound like a fucking douchebag and some weird I wasn't fishing for that either

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:40.100
everyone shut up yeah I I I patificate all the time about race and it's much

01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:44.940
easier to obsess about race than it is about gender for me anyway I think

01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:48.580
because of the relationship with I have with my mom which I like like because

01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:53.940
women are like like like sometimes you want to have sex with them sometimes

01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:59.620
you don't in between there's eight million fifty things that there are women

01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:03.460
that you like like like it you can objectify them without knowing that

01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:08.500
you're objectifying them and then even if you get through that hurdle then

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:13.180
everyone else is weird objectifications of women come into play so if you were a

01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:16.180
guy and you respected a woman that you worked with and you're like oh she's

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.580
really funny I really like her I wanted her to be my friend it's like then on

01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:23.680
the other side of that there's all this like it's crazy is there is that a

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.300
problem that we solve or do we accept that that's the case I think it's

01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:31.300
something that we always keep in mind and strive to understand and hopefully

01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:37.860
change sometime well I think you're on your period otherwise you wouldn't say

01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:43.020
that am I right fellas get her out of here let's open the dick shoot

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:52.060
it's not gonna watch Roadhouse there's a dick shoot yeah I don't know yeah I

01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:57.380
don't know where I got it's a weird epiphany to have at 40 where it's

01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.300
like I'm not gonna be able to do anything about it anyway that's not true

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:03.780
because you had a lady on the show and you talked about how as a lady nerd she

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:07.300
got talked down to you by Kevin Smith who I would love to be able to like

01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:11.820
admire and respect as an artist but then he says shit like that I mean off the

01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:15.620
cuff don't he doesn't know he's saying I mean that's the that's the that's the

01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:20.140
that's the yeah I don't know it's I'm just offended by that shirt he always

01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:25.260
wears I'm sure he sells those like those are custom-designed

01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:35.140
he that's tearing down the wall let's bring him out

01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:40.660
I mean he should come up like like if he did come out we'd be like hey well bro

01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:44.060
down with the showdown like whatever like like we're not gonna be like oh we

01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:48.540
brought you out here to take you to task let's not bring him out how about that

01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:52.340
let's not I even feel like that would be a conversation he'd be willing to have

01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:57.660
about about like oh yeah so I didn't really that the he'd like he'd continue

01:44:57.660 --> 01:45:01.740
this conversation with us rather than just try to defend himself I don't even

01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:05.140
know speaking as someone who's been on Twitter and had people like tweeted me

01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:11.860
going like no point of honor episode 3 season 2 and so and so made this joke

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:16.980
it's like you can't help but like like the definition of your humanity like

01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:21.460
like you have a certain amount of like servo mounted guns out there otherwise

01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:26.020
who are you right if everything that comes your way is like oh yeah let's see

01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:30.140
your side of it immediately like you can't help but go like okay first of all

01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:35.060
why is this person full of shit I just I mean I'm just speaking to that

01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:38.140
hypothetically like let's have Kevin Smith on and talk about gender and about

01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:41.540
that one comment he made on that reality show not suggesting that like that's

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:44.580
something you should actually do and what I was saying was that I know he's not

01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:48.540
that guy all the time and like at his core I know he's not a misogynist I would

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:51.620
I would go so far as to say I don't think anyone is that guy I think that we

01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:55.460
get I think that any of us it from any perspective at any given time we get

01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:00.140
accidentally like if you could actually sit anybody down and like walk through

01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:04.940
everything if we had that chance to do that with Hitler before he got turned

01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:12.140
loose like okay where are you going dressed like that I'm gonna go do some

01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:17.300
stuff okay what what do you mean I'm gonna kill six million Jews are right

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:23.780
because you don't want to give a throne so what the fuck Hitler get over here

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:28.580
sit down why are you gonna kill six million Jews you know why no I don't

01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:36.860
like talk for 45 minutes and not from a balcony talk to me I'm your dad this is

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:42.140
fucking you don't care about my art you don't care fucking like I said like

one of my mustache was just in the middle and you're like fuck you like so

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:54.500
maybe fuck you fuck everybody okay you can have a little mustache slightly

01:46:54.500 --> 01:47:03.620
lost the thread of this yeah you may be right I don't know that's all I had to

01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:07.460
say I wanted to say I'm glad that you had a lady on the show and that made me

01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:10.820
happy oh she was swell you know and it was that was Aaron Aaron found that

01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:15.100
