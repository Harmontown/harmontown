09:55.000 --> 10:10.560
now do the pose well did the photo like the still photo like the three like the pose of

10:10.560 --> 10:15.280
it's a work in progress we're still working on some of the kinks to our new format but

10:15.280 --> 10:21.880
our new format is mostly based in copyright infringement yeah I mean well look we're gonna

10:21.880 --> 10:27.160
we're not gonna emulate the losers in the institutionalized comedy game we could try

10:27.160 --> 10:36.520
that I have a killer miss swan I mean does anybody well can we hear it no I mean I was

10:36.520 --> 10:45.360
there was there a iconic opening to mad TV I think they'd go like why are you mad like

10:45.360 --> 10:50.600
they worked their way around to like every sketch it's just not that people were impressed

10:50.600 --> 10:54.120
by that because they did that for 15 seasons like oh the sketches always end with somebody

10:54.120 --> 11:00.080
getting mad but that's that's a pretty amateur thing I trained high school kids and improv

11:00.080 --> 11:05.400
like they tend to want to fight or dance and wear props you gotta you gotta encourage them

11:05.400 --> 11:09.320
to come out of their shell so the idea the fact that every mad TV sketch ends with someone

11:09.320 --> 11:15.400
getting mad good idea for a theme but but not not a feat wasn't a sacrifice they were

11:15.400 --> 11:22.920
making comedically what did I miss over the last two days I was up in the the northwest

11:22.920 --> 11:28.520
I just been sitting not sitting sitting how's night your head side with with the little

11:28.520 --> 11:34.960
one is he alive is he good is recovering is he alright yeah he's doing good I mean it's

11:34.960 --> 11:44.360
like I gotta like I gotta like I gotta deal with all this like shame you know like I it's

11:44.360 --> 11:49.520
like when you own a dog which I don't have kids so a lot of people have kids last night

11:49.520 --> 11:56.000
checked like at least four billion of them had them and like like like I'm sorry it's

11:56.000 --> 12:02.720
got to be worse when it's a kid but it just sucks because like your dog starts acting

12:02.720 --> 12:09.560
weird and then you got to choose whether to take them to the vet and then once you take

12:09.560 --> 12:14.120
them to the vet you just know I say it's like I know it's not their fault like I'm sure

12:14.120 --> 12:20.640
the veterinarial industry is not the fucking is not flush with cash and I'm sure the doctors

12:20.640 --> 12:26.960
that are funneled into it are wonderful people and I'm sure the technicians that couldn't

12:26.960 --> 12:33.640
you know be doctors at a veterinarian hospital yet are also great people and I'm sure the

12:33.640 --> 12:39.520
people that work at the front desk that can't even be technicians that can't even be doctors

12:39.520 --> 12:45.320
that can't even have human patients I'm sure they're not five levels beneath normal humanity

12:45.320 --> 12:49.880
they're just five levels beneath a regular doctor and what is a doctor as we've discussed

12:49.880 --> 12:56.000
on the show a serial killer with a support system it's a doctor is a person who's comfortable

12:56.000 --> 13:01.920
cutting things open the people that cut humans open and go like oh look it's a sort of bladder

13:01.920 --> 13:09.800
looks like yeah why do they call it Kaiser that's pretty you know Kaiser German yeah

13:09.800 --> 13:15.760
it's also permanent a it's like a eternal Kaiser it's it's Kaiser's from Caesar yeah

13:15.760 --> 13:21.320
why are these people the ones that are trying to save our lives they want eternal and empirical

13:21.320 --> 13:27.240
rule yeah they want they want a permanent Caesar they want to rule over your health yeah I mean

13:27.240 --> 13:34.240
look there's no question that doctors know how to help you when you're sick but you know

13:34.240 --> 13:39.480
there's also no question that doctors are scientists they have to be so they don't they're

13:39.480 --> 13:43.440
and they're not you know what kind of person is drawn to an occupation where you might

13:43.440 --> 13:50.240
have to like be next to someone who's dying all the time or you might just sick just just

13:50.240 --> 13:54.920
just you know where you were every day you get up and go to work and you're just gonna

13:54.920 --> 14:00.320
be nonstop problems and sick desperate people like looking for answers that you may or may

14:00.320 --> 14:05.600
not have with you always like rolling the dice with with advice and diagnoses and things

14:05.600 --> 14:10.400
that could either make or break your the rest of your life and pay off your student loans

14:10.400 --> 14:14.360
like the kind of person that looks at that minefield and goes like I think I'll go hang

14:14.360 --> 14:18.000
out in there I'm not gonna call them a sociopath but I'm also not gonna call them probably

14:18.000 --> 14:23.120
also coincidentally like the the warmest person in the world like they probably have

14:23.120 --> 14:30.880
some pretty heavy fucking emotional armor on them or as I suspect they enjoy suffering

14:30.880 --> 14:36.880
love cutting open dogs because the answer is I think that I think that most people follow

14:36.880 --> 14:41.400
their I mean like would you go into that field because it didn't hurt you or would you go

14:41.400 --> 14:45.840
to that field because you liked it I just think I feel like they like a little bit I'm

14:45.840 --> 14:50.240
talking about regular doctors here I'm talking about people who are like yes I see you have

14:50.240 --> 14:54.560
a tumor I'm gonna cut you open pull it out oh look there's your lungs there's your heart

14:54.560 --> 14:58.240
I hope I don't make it stop beating okay so I'm back up okay by the way my name was Tony

14:58.240 --> 15:03.560
see you later I'm going golfing come on serial killer we had those people on the show that

15:03.560 --> 15:08.000
talked like they were EMTs that talked about they have we should have them back like they

15:08.000 --> 15:12.360
have injury porn that they send to each other like who can outgrow us well now you human

15:12.360 --> 15:16.400
I don't like that yeah there's an EMT like they don't they don't get paid very much

15:16.400 --> 15:21.160
I think you know we heard like those people are undoubtedly heroics and now you evened

15:21.160 --> 15:25.680
it up I mean there's only a fact that there are people that are willing to show up to

15:25.680 --> 15:29.800
be where people have like fucking like just fallen down on the sidewalk and no one knows

15:29.800 --> 15:33.840
what's wrong with them or hit themselves in the hand with a hammer they just find a dick

15:33.840 --> 15:39.520
and balls laying in the side of the road or whatever like God knows like your idea or

15:39.520 --> 15:47.600
Justin's to have Beth be a veterinarian in Rick and Morty I can't remember I think that

15:47.600 --> 15:56.440
was a decision that was made during the writing of the pilot and it wasn't based on your current

15:56.440 --> 16:04.960
beef with the veterinarians no and I don't really have a beef with I only have a beef

16:04.960 --> 16:12.920
with the species in general if that which how can you like I just it's not a really

16:12.920 --> 16:18.080
a beef I'm just like come on it's as plain as the nose on our face like if you're poor

16:18.080 --> 16:25.000
and you are comfortable looking at guts you end up in prison if you're rich you end up

16:25.000 --> 16:31.400
a doctor I don't know how anyone can argue with that like people go to medical school

16:31.400 --> 16:36.840
and then the people that aren't as comfortable looking at guts as murderers fall down in

16:36.840 --> 16:40.720
faint and then they go into research friend of mine when I was going to college maybe

16:40.720 --> 16:47.480
I've told the story before they went do you have to go through like an actual autopsy

16:47.480 --> 16:53.480
and watch it could ever be like you know totally taken apart and then it for the first time

16:53.480 --> 16:59.680
these these young students all walked in there and there was two doctors over it and they

16:59.680 --> 17:05.120
with the students didn't know because here's a dead human being and they had lined it with

17:05.120 --> 17:10.080
tinfoil and filled it with spaghettios and when students walked in they were just eating

17:10.080 --> 17:16.040
out of the chest cavity and eating spaghettios out of it and half the students ran out and

17:16.040 --> 17:23.840
barfed or fainted or whatever and that's that's a little joke get get used to not caring about

17:23.840 --> 17:30.080
the insides of people yeah you know that's great that that them noticing that they're

17:30.080 --> 17:36.160
sociopaths plus them having free time makes them want to have fun that way but so another

17:36.160 --> 17:40.560
thing you could do with your free time if your sociopath is learn empathy like you're

17:40.560 --> 17:46.080
smart you learned all of the anatomy like you learned how to how to turn your stethoscope

17:46.080 --> 17:54.200
into a bong like maybe to give them some give them some seminars about humanity and stuff

17:54.200 --> 17:58.560
how people that don't become doctors think and feel I told you about like Alice flat

17:58.560 --> 18:04.320
heard that the neurologist she's like we don't we're not good with people we we we look at

18:04.320 --> 18:07.480
you in the way that you sit and the things that you say or the things that are wrong

18:07.480 --> 18:11.640
with you you touch something that's cold you think it's hot like we're looking at your

18:11.640 --> 18:16.080
brain all we want to do is that we're zombies we just want to take the top of your head

18:16.080 --> 18:21.880
off and poke around in the big bowl of toothpaste which is your brain like we're not good with

18:21.880 --> 18:27.320
people we just like solving the brain puzzle like if you were good with people you probably

18:27.320 --> 18:32.240
wouldn't be good at sawing off a head and poking around in there yeah that's what I'm

18:32.240 --> 18:36.720
saying yeah kind of yeah so these are the people that were you know that you have to

18:36.720 --> 18:41.440
take your dog to your dog can't talk you take your dog to him and then you know it's probably

18:41.440 --> 18:44.440
a technician it's probably not even a doctor I don't know if a doctor is the one that has

18:44.440 --> 18:48.520
it you know it's like I talked to three different doctors on the phone over the three days that

18:48.520 --> 18:53.480
Nigel was at the hospital it's like the bottom line is filled with a lot of toxic shame like

18:53.480 --> 19:02.840
I took my dog to the hospital because he wouldn't stop trembling and vomiting he was vomiting

19:02.840 --> 19:10.400
like so much that the equivalent for his size would be like you know like the middle you

19:10.400 --> 19:15.720
know like like all across the stage except for the your area and Spencer's area like

19:15.720 --> 19:21.200
that much which is you know like I was like geez I mean what what you know it's time to

19:21.200 --> 19:27.040
go to the hospital like he's never puked that much and and and he already had his issue

19:27.040 --> 19:30.640
with where he had you know they had to pull out a clump of grass out of his intestines

19:30.640 --> 19:35.920
or did they have to we'll never know you know like fans of the podcast will recall that

19:35.920 --> 19:41.080
story the punchline of it is we're left to wonder for the rest of our lives should we

19:41.080 --> 19:46.520
have let the dog pass this giant clump of grass or would that have perforated his intestines

19:46.520 --> 19:50.720
on the way out because it was moving so slowly it was almost not moving at all do you wait

19:50.720 --> 19:55.480
for your dog to try to fit that out his asshole and possibly cause permanent damage to him

19:55.480 --> 20:00.200
or do you cause permanent damage to him by cutting him open and pulling it out that's

20:00.200 --> 20:04.800
what we opted to so this is Nigel's second surgery second time he's been cut open by

20:04.800 --> 20:11.960
humans that he trusts and and and I just and and this time there was nothing in there

20:11.960 --> 20:16.440
there was that he was he was it was you know he was inflamed his stomach they x-ray his

20:16.440 --> 20:19.960
stomach and they go it's really big do you think there's something in there did he eat

20:19.960 --> 20:24.480
anything that might be trapped in there because his stomach is gigantic and you said he's

20:24.480 --> 20:29.480
been puking a lot so like we think there's something in there and I said well he eats

20:29.480 --> 20:34.080
a lot of stuff so x-ray show a thing or not a thing no it doesn't show a lot of things

20:34.080 --> 20:40.880
as they condescendingly told me like I I even literally said I said are you sure it could

20:40.880 --> 20:44.520
is it possible it could be just inflammation that is make his you're saying his stomach

20:44.520 --> 20:48.840
is big I don't even know why I said that I didn't go to fucking medical school I was

20:48.840 --> 20:53.360
just it's just like I because I don't want to cut my dog open twice in a year and so

20:53.360 --> 20:57.680
I just it was just almost like it was just it was just like you think it you think it

20:57.680 --> 21:01.920
could another reason his stuff because because what they said they were using logic at midnight

21:01.920 --> 21:06.200
in an animal hospital so I'm thinking I probably don't have the fucking Sherlock Holmes of

21:06.200 --> 21:10.680
animal doctors right or maybe it's the Fox Mulder maybe they're so fucking smart about

21:10.680 --> 21:15.040
diagnosing animals that they that people call them spooky Dr. McGillicuddy and like make

21:15.040 --> 21:18.560
them work at midnight because they're so fucking good at figuring out what's going on but they

21:18.560 --> 21:22.840
were scratching their heads your dog your dog's stomach is huge and you said he just puked

21:22.840 --> 21:28.000
like the size of a pool table and and so his stomach should be small right because he puked

21:28.000 --> 21:34.120
all that and I'm like this is can I be a doctor and and I was like well is it possible that

21:34.120 --> 21:40.520
the reason the stomach is large is because it's irritated is that a thing and the the

21:40.520 --> 21:45.040
technician I think there was a technician I don't think it was a doctor I don't know

21:45.040 --> 21:50.200
the difference like like like like I honestly I perceived them looking at me like I was

21:50.200 --> 21:57.160
an idiot and I'm like yeah well x-rays don't pick up inflammation so and I was like that

21:57.160 --> 22:04.800
wasn't an answer the answer that could have saved my dog a lot of pain was it's possible

22:04.800 --> 22:09.360
I didn't ask if x-rays picked up inflammation it's like when you when you go to the bank

22:09.360 --> 22:13.320
when you used to go to the bank and the people would say yeah the computer says no and you

22:13.320 --> 22:16.640
just look you can fill with this rage and go like this isn't a computer interaction

22:16.640 --> 22:20.680
this is a human interaction I'm asking a human being a question stop pointing at your computer

22:20.680 --> 22:24.760
which you know goddamn well if your computer told you to jump out the fucking window you

22:24.760 --> 22:29.840
would you would you would pat it on the side you would go like what's wrong with it if it

22:29.840 --> 22:35.240
if this if the screen flickered which it might and sometimes does you wouldn't go oh time

22:35.240 --> 22:42.600
to kill myself like you're being lazy and you're being condescending it was like yeah

22:42.600 --> 22:47.040
x-rays don't pick up inflammation I didn't I didn't ask if they did I asked if his stomach

22:47.040 --> 22:52.240
could be enlarged because of inflammation as opposed to a foreign object like do we

22:52.240 --> 22:59.160
think he ate a bowling ball I just I just and I just think just save my dog save my

22:59.160 --> 23:05.760
dog so that at the earliest absolute possibility like I'm like the doctor called me on the

23:05.760 --> 23:09.720
phone then after he stays there all night and she goes yeah it's like the x-ray is stomach

23:09.720 --> 23:15.080
is he's getting a little worse stomach's getting I don't know it's it's it's it's if there's

23:15.080 --> 23:21.840
something in there it's not moving so like maybe there's nothing in there maybe it's

23:21.840 --> 23:28.600
inflammation and I and I'm like but I'm talking to doctors now and I'm like okay so if there's

23:28.600 --> 23:31.680
something in there it's like like last time it was a clump of grass it was moving real

23:31.680 --> 23:36.040
slow I just like yeah if this is if this is a foreign object and you said he eats a lot

23:36.040 --> 23:40.480
of foreign objects it's now you ate a clump of grass at one point like but but it's not

23:40.480 --> 23:44.960
moving I would show of he ate a baseball here's the it wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't it

23:44.960 --> 23:53.320
wouldn't I like so they give me three choices endoscopy and then another there's another

23:53.320 --> 23:56.480
choice that was like an endoscopy but it's like they put something down his nose or something

23:56.480 --> 24:02.680
and like like both of those choices involved keeping him the way he was and getting more

24:02.680 --> 24:09.360
information which now that I know I made the horribleest most fucking awful choice like

24:09.360 --> 24:16.040
I just I want to cry like but but they don't they don't recommend anything you ask them

24:16.040 --> 24:19.120
do what do you recommend well as you know and they might as well say out loud like well

24:19.120 --> 24:25.000
I don't want to get sued it's your dog you know yeah it's so this whole system is based

24:25.000 --> 24:30.040
on two things total disrespect for the layman and total burden on the layman with any kind

24:30.040 --> 24:36.440
of fucking risk like like like like we think you're an idiot and because we went to two

24:36.440 --> 24:44.240
years of dog school or something and but but so there's that which is true I'm two years

24:44.240 --> 24:48.960
dumber than you or whatever the fucking associates degree you have that meet has you working at

24:48.960 --> 24:54.880
midnight at a veterinary hospital and anybody who's watching who's going like my cousin works

24:54.880 --> 24:59.760
at a veterinary hospital I'm a veterinarian I'm at school take your personal story and

24:59.760 --> 25:04.440
just shove it all the way up your fucking dumb ass because like the fact that something

25:04.440 --> 25:08.280
is connected to your life doesn't mean that you're outraged and it doesn't mean that you

25:08.280 --> 25:13.600
have anything to contribute to the conversation otherwise every time people were stupid or

25:13.600 --> 25:18.200
had to deal with stupid people I'd go I'd lose my fucking mind because I'm a fucking expert

25:18.200 --> 25:22.240
in that okay so shut the fuck up I don't care if you're a veterinarian and you're a fan

25:22.240 --> 25:26.080
of the show and you're disappointed in my fucking closed minded shit it's closed minded

25:26.080 --> 25:32.040
because I'm fucking upset and shut the fuck up stick your whole life up your ass like

25:32.040 --> 25:36.560
stick it all the way up and I hope it hurts going in and then and then don't like thread

25:36.560 --> 25:41.520
it through your mouth so that you have a cosmic experience like don't just then I want you

25:41.520 --> 25:48.160
to stumble around your front yard with bandages on your arms where their IVs were staring

25:48.160 --> 25:54.040
drug addled into the fucking cosmos wondering if the sound of the lawnmower is a threat or

25:54.040 --> 25:58.160
not because you're on so many painkillers and you can't speak English I want you to

25:58.160 --> 26:04.040
just like walk around for two weeks like like like wanting to lick a bandage on your stomach

26:04.040 --> 26:08.640
that you that everyone keeps telling you not to and then finally just like like like finally

26:08.640 --> 26:15.040
have to take a big diamond plated fucking serrated shit out of your of your own head

26:15.040 --> 26:20.080

26:27.360 --> 26:35.600
I went to my therapist and I'm like I'm filled with hate okay I'm filled with rage and shame

26:35.600 --> 26:44.440
and she's like well do this and I'm like okay and I cried a little like she's like well

26:44.440 --> 26:49.160

26:49.160 --> 26:53.800
next to you like she's like okay the veterinarians in the chair and go ahead and yell and I go

26:53.800 --> 27:00.080

like it is the psychiatrist upstairs like oh the guy that used to be in your bigger

27:57.560 --> 28:01.720
office there is now in your bigger office I like like so so she doesn't mind me yelling

28:01.720 --> 28:06.000
so I just I talked to the chair and I go like you know I vent a lot of the stuff that I just

28:06.000 --> 28:13.400
vented and at a certain point yeah I guess if I want to I can go and I do that and she's

28:13.400 --> 28:19.480
like okay now now like talk about what's right underneath that as she said how do you feel

28:19.480 --> 28:26.040
as I said I said 130 second better like like what like like like 132th you know like not

28:26.040 --> 28:29.600
even and it and it's already filled back up but she's like she's like well wait what's

28:29.600 --> 28:33.680
underneath that is there's something else because it's if it's not all range if doing

28:33.680 --> 28:38.520
that doesn't help that means that you got rid of the rage layer what's underneath there

28:38.520 --> 28:44.080
she was right about that I don't think my therapist is a bad therapist I like like there was shame

28:44.080 --> 28:51.080
underneath there is like I feel shame because I like I have to take care of this animal like

28:51.080 --> 28:56.960
that's my job the animal can't express itself I have one fucking job and it's you know and

28:56.960 --> 29:02.680
I started explaining why I was ashamed of myself and and I started weeping and and then she's

29:02.680 --> 29:09.120
like now how do you feel and I'm like 230 so you know now a total of 1 16th better all

29:09.120 --> 29:15.720
right and now it's filled back up and she's like okay let's let's go outside she kicks

29:15.720 --> 29:21.800
her ass she's fucking beat the shit out of me she she hit me with it was it was a and

29:21.800 --> 29:27.840
it was a it was a it was a they live John Carpenter style fight so it ended up I had to pay extra

29:27.840 --> 29:33.560
because it was long yeah I actually paid her extra to do that put the put the sunglasses

29:33.560 --> 29:38.880
on no she makes me I don't say it makes me I did it partly because I was like you really

29:38.880 --> 29:45.480
think I bet you think I felt like I was like game theory she thinks this is like goodwill

29:45.480 --> 29:50.320
hunting like oh Dan Harmon's afraid to walk up and down his the sidewalk in his neighborhood

29:50.320 --> 29:56.440
in front of Matt Bronger and Amy Mann and Pat Oswalt and Edgar Wright like getting their

29:56.440 --> 30:03.160
coffee and and yeah he's he's not John Hamm is getting his he's not gonna do this in front

30:03.160 --> 30:08.120
of John Hamm and and I'm like fuck I did whatever she did twice as much as like like wiggling

30:08.120 --> 30:14.240
her arms like noodle man and like like walking like the keep on truck and drawing by a crumb

30:14.240 --> 30:19.040
and I was like yeah it's like silly walks like I just like like okay so you walk silly

30:19.040 --> 30:24.040
she's like you feel you feel that you feel that I'm like yeah I I don't know man well

30:24.040 --> 30:27.560
what she's trying to get a feeling I don't know like it was like the energy there's energy

30:27.560 --> 30:31.360
in your body and there's like the idea was like because I kept saying I don't know where

30:31.360 --> 30:36.040
to put this rage like because I have I have a couple holes in my wall at home from when

30:36.040 --> 30:41.640
Fiv was sick the cat and because it's like there comes a point where you don't know how

30:41.640 --> 30:47.320
to express like you have rage and shame that you don't know where to put it it seems like

30:47.320 --> 30:51.960
there is no like I'm a very sheltered person like I don't have a lot of feelings that I

30:51.960 --> 30:58.160
don't know how to get rid of in a proper way but like like intense levels of rage and shame

30:58.160 --> 31:05.280
above a certain voltage there's no that it's just like and I just like yeah I still don't

31:05.280 --> 31:10.400
you can feel it you feel it in your heart behind your eyeballs in your fists like you

31:10.400 --> 31:18.320
feel like you want to beat something you want to kill what is your shame about that you

31:18.320 --> 31:27.840
let Nigel down yeah by by hiring people to stab him or or or before that are you you

31:27.840 --> 31:32.840
do you feel responsible for why he got whatever he got no because you found out it was what

31:32.840 --> 31:38.320
it wasn't he didn't eat something it was like he has he has a condition called IBD but you

31:38.320 --> 31:45.720
know at this point whatever like I he's the thing that that he is sick at home with right

31:45.720 --> 31:50.760
now is a fucking stab wound in his stomach it's not what he went in with what he what

31:50.760 --> 31:58.040
he went in with is apparently a condition called IBD I get I don't know what bowel disorder

31:58.040 --> 32:02.920
I don't I don't know if that's what it stands for it's basically like allergies food allergies

32:02.920 --> 32:08.400
like they say he ate something and it can I think it could build up for a year like so

32:08.400 --> 32:12.720
it just kind of fuck around with his diet and stuff like it's now it's doubtful that

32:12.720 --> 32:18.720
he ate it's no that's not true it's possible that he ate some grass that he ate last time

32:18.720 --> 32:25.280
or that that there is also milk thistle or some species of fucking California cumquat

32:25.280 --> 32:30.760
that he fucking like found in a backyard and like like it's possible that he ate one thing

32:30.760 --> 32:35.840
that like shocked his system immediately it's also possible that over a year of having a

32:35.840 --> 32:43.640
little bit of chicken or or snail corpse or whatever they you know it's like oh this this

32:43.640 --> 32:51.720
food's got TBD's and this food's got IB gays and like IB gays TBD's is good it's like like

32:51.720 --> 32:56.720
what should we call this disease of course by the way everyone's so full of advice to

32:56.720 --> 33:00.560
like like like and it's just like I don't I don't I don't want to say take your advice

33:00.560 --> 33:04.960
and shove it up your ass like but I just I just want you to observe things from my perspective

33:04.960 --> 33:09.320
when your dog eats a bunch of grass and has to have it surgically removed from his from

33:09.320 --> 33:16.720
his intestines I I think I've already heard by now that dogs eat grass when they're sick

33:16.720 --> 33:23.800
to induce vomiting I've also heard that that's fucking a horse shit and that dogs that eat

33:23.800 --> 33:30.320
grass end up sick from it please shut up now it doesn't change anything being told this

33:30.320 --> 33:37.120
stuff you're not really helping anybody because you had a sick dog once I don't mean you should

33:37.120 --> 33:44.880
be ashamed of yourself I just I just just shut up like like like I it's a it's a fucking

33:44.880 --> 33:49.480
dog that starts shaking and vomiting you take them into idiots who are smarter than you

33:49.480 --> 33:53.600
and and you you you're given a choice between three doors and one has a scalpel on it you

33:53.600 --> 33:58.160
choose the scalpel and they cut them open and they go up nothing sorry yeah he's got

33:58.160 --> 34:04.520
food allergies zip zip so so so and now and now the dogs on you know on on doggy painkillers

34:04.520 --> 34:10.280
and like you can't touch him without him like crying and like you just you just have to

34:10.280 --> 34:16.440
spoon feed him like little you know pieces of dog food that'll barely eat there's like

34:16.440 --> 34:21.520
like you know you give him little little spoonfuls of grass and you have nothing to think about

34:21.520 --> 34:26.280
that entire time except what you did wrong you can you can run from your mistakes everything

34:26.280 --> 34:30.920
else you can you can fix by playing Minecraft you know I had a dog that kept eating grass

34:30.920 --> 34:34.400
and would not stop eating grass loved grass favorite favorite thing in the world eight

34:34.400 --> 34:39.200
grass all day all night and was constantly bummed out and constantly puking it's like

34:39.200 --> 34:44.080
hey like like we'll let you sort this out like like you're you're an idiot also when

34:44.080 --> 34:50.600
that dog was little because we got this dog in New York we would be in Central Park and

34:50.600 --> 34:56.400
favorite food horseshit the fucking handsome cabs that would go to take married couples

34:56.400 --> 35:02.800
down the lane yeah Nigel and giant horse apples and this dog just loved eating just just couldn't

35:02.800 --> 35:08.960
get enough horseshit Nigel and Harvey dogs even so happy and we didn't like want to stop

35:08.960 --> 35:13.360
the dog from being happy but it was really embarrassing because like what is what's what's

35:13.360 --> 35:21.360
your dog problem Nigel and Harvey every morning they they bark at the the neighbor's cat dash

35:21.360 --> 35:30.080
the cute little cute little black and white cat that I never told my neighbors I accidentally

35:30.080 --> 35:33.360
caught in a humane trap when I was trying to catch a raccoon that was eating all my dog

35:33.360 --> 35:40.240
food right you go back I went over to my neighbor's house once and I was like oh that's your cat

35:40.240 --> 35:44.320
that was like the thought below and I was like I caught your cat in a trap once and let it

35:44.320 --> 35:48.760
go like there's a raccoon once yeah I was there was a raccoon coming in the doggy dog

35:48.760 --> 35:54.040
you almost you almost murdered their cat and almost murdered it I definitely I certainly

35:54.040 --> 36:00.840
made it it gave it the most miserable night of its life depending on when it took the

36:00.840 --> 36:06.480
bait that was a raccoon which is a bunch of you got caught in a cage and it was a humane

36:06.480 --> 36:11.640
trap it wasn't it just came out of the backyard like I gotta I got my prey and it was that

36:11.640 --> 36:18.240
yeah anyways very very very adorable outdoor cat named also bad name for a cat dash if

36:18.240 --> 36:23.320
you can't get out of a fucking trap now come on you think trap sense will be a part of anyways

36:23.320 --> 36:28.880
the dogs the dogs when I'm working out in the morning they bark at dash dash comes out

36:28.880 --> 36:32.080
there and I'm always like making fun of it because I'm like you at this point like what

36:32.080 --> 36:35.320
do you think remember we were talking about like what are the dogs what are the dogs saying

36:35.320 --> 36:39.440
to the cat well I just realized what they say to the cat because I'm talking to Alice

36:39.440 --> 36:45.040
in the dog sitter about like what she's like she's like you know they they fucking they

36:45.040 --> 36:48.840
love going out in the front yard because they know the cat shits out there and like they

36:48.840 --> 36:52.480
race each other to the cat shit like they as I was like it turns out when the dogs are

36:52.480 --> 36:55.800
barking at the cat through the front window they're like poop they're like yelling at

36:55.800 --> 37:10.120
the Wells Fargo wagon is my how to drop look here yet make it make a nice juicy one for

37:10.120 --> 37:15.520
me Cynthia they're all up in that cat shit yeah they run out to the spot where he shits

37:15.520 --> 37:20.240
and they fight over it like raptors what's what's in that cat poo that's so delicious

37:20.240 --> 37:25.200
I think the dogs because they smell so intensely you have to think you do the backwards math

37:25.200 --> 37:31.040
and go that means that if they could smell shit which they surely can because we can

37:31.040 --> 37:36.720
but they smell the ingredients in there they they have to taste God gave them noses that

37:36.720 --> 37:47.880
could smell the concern of a of a poodle an hour away and that can smell their way home

37:47.880 --> 37:52.800
to to to if they if they're if they're if they get trapped in a u-haul or whatever the

37:52.800 --> 38:00.880
stories are they can smell a forest fire in in in Utah and so we can smell a turd so so

38:00.880 --> 38:04.880
then God's like well they're gonna go nuts about the turds they're gonna just kill themselves

38:04.880 --> 38:08.520
like their nose will explode so then he's like well I can't make their nose less sensitive

38:08.520 --> 38:12.580
I mean I really want these things to live by their nose all right well I'll just make

38:12.580 --> 38:18.680
them love it and then so that's why when they meet each other they're like let me check

38:18.680 --> 38:24.040
out that asshole wow wow you got one coming don't you okay it's cresting I can see it

38:24.040 --> 38:29.000
like Barbara Cody's dog came over by the way Nigel's dogs got he's got he's he's you

38:29.000 --> 38:34.320
know dogs come home from surgery they're constipated it constipated in air quotes because he just

38:34.320 --> 38:37.440
doesn't want to squat to take the shit he's got it he's got a fucking knife wound in his

38:37.440 --> 38:44.600
stomach but long story short he's got a fucking little diamond tip you know turd like like

38:44.600 --> 38:50.200
you can see it if you look like it's like and then Barbara Cody's dog comes over and

38:50.200 --> 38:55.080
she's just like right up in that ass I'm like well there's a turd coming out like other

38:55.080 --> 38:59.480
dogs shit I mean yes they do they like shit I don't think I've ever seen a dog eat another

38:59.480 --> 39:04.600
dog shit oh yeah no I don't know I don't know dogs eat the dogs don't eat their own shit

39:04.600 --> 39:10.480
I did dog dogs that were raised in puppy mills dogs eat their own shit if they were that's

39:10.480 --> 39:16.960
a heavy sign of abuse because they know because they dogs don't like to shit where they eat

39:16.960 --> 39:21.120
so dogs that are forced to shit where they eat eat their shit to keep especially mother

39:21.120 --> 39:27.760
dogs to keep the puppy mill cage sanitary it's really sad if you if you get a dog that's

39:27.760 --> 39:34.200
eating its own shit when you when you you know that's a red flag that's like it's learned

39:34.200 --> 39:37.840
to that behavior or personal experience trauma let's get away from this animal shit and bring

39:37.840 --> 39:45.760
up Rob Schrab Rob Schrab everybody you know what dogs like eating shit the most German

39:45.760 --> 40:02.560

you go do you see the difference yeah that's pretty good yeah but somebody might extrapolate

44:00.120 --> 44:06.520
from that and go oh I get it so you need to blah blah blah it's I think what you're all

44:06.520 --> 44:13.280
you're saying is is people try to people try to be they try to they try to reduce nuance

44:13.280 --> 44:17.240
to formula and it doesn't work they else they else I don't know they just don't know how

44:17.240 --> 44:24.200
to do it right it's about timing and it's about it's picking the right tweet I'm a watch

44:24.200 --> 44:32.320
and wait predator yes you're like a jaguar on a limb correct yeah you pounce can we get

44:32.320 --> 44:38.560

44:38.560 --> 44:43.840
right well I can't control my fans Schrab however but you I do you control myself yes so I will

44:43.840 --> 44:50.640
say to you thank you for bringing the iPad back I wouldn't I I you you you would establish

44:50.640 --> 44:57.600
that you weren't using it anyway so it is kind of cheap I appreciate you you bringing

44:57.600 --> 45:02.760
it back otherwise I would feel a little back because I just want you be happy and I would

45:02.760 --> 45:07.600
do anything to ensure that you keep coming back to the show because it's been very helpful

45:07.600 --> 45:13.120
to me going through a transitional phase of my own I like having you here been a good

45:13.120 --> 45:20.520
friend of mine for a very long time and if anything were to happen to either of us without

45:20.520 --> 45:24.880
me having expressed that it would be I don't know why I have to do this cadence where I'm

45:24.880 --> 45:32.960
like Richard Lewis when I'm expressing affection ira glass but you know he does that so that

45:32.960 --> 45:44.200
so for me I like I I rift the phrase cheapy peepy it was insensitive it and it it's it's

45:44.200 --> 45:53.160
reduct reductivist and sexist and it's been it's been now co-opted by some of the worst

45:53.160 --> 45:59.840
kinds of people people who like to see others others feel pain a basket of deplorables I

45:59.840 --> 46:08.320
can't think of a worse word to apply to another human being period because it's so false I

46:08.320 --> 46:15.680
think of you as a very magnanimous sharanomus so you like that you like that you like that

46:15.680 --> 46:20.360
thank you David yeah let's make let's make that the new meme remember when Harris Wittels

46:20.360 --> 46:25.560
Harris Wittels did the there was like it was a row it wasn't really a row you had a

46:25.560 --> 46:30.720
birthday and you had people that you like perform on your birthday and you showed some

46:30.720 --> 46:34.920
stuff that you're proud of like old shit yep and you had it's kind of like the beginning

46:34.920 --> 46:40.160
of Harmontown because you did you went up and you did I go up even I don't think I did

46:40.160 --> 46:46.760
yeah you did did I yeah what did I do well you commented that Sarah still woman was there

46:46.760 --> 46:55.360
back it was it was Camille Harris Sarah and you you closed it was a dick to Sarah no no

46:55.360 --> 47:00.080
no we hung up backstage right yeah but but you just said oh I didn't know it Sarah was

47:00.080 --> 47:04.040
gonna I didn't know I would be following Sarah still woman here like okay it's like that

47:04.040 --> 47:07.520
you know I don't know anyways well here at Harris did the Harris Harris the set was really

47:07.520 --> 47:13.440
funny because he he he went up and said like oh I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna roast

47:13.440 --> 47:17.680
Rob because Rob's very sensitive you know joke writers go to a negative place so like

47:17.680 --> 47:22.920
like roast jokes are the funniest jokes but Rob's very sensitive person so I'm just gonna

47:22.920 --> 47:28.560
do I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna try to roast Rob but in a positive way and then he did

47:28.560 --> 47:34.440
a whole set of like just jokes about Rob is so such a good person and blah blah blah

47:34.440 --> 47:38.800
and I was like it was really it was really really funny because it was it was actually

47:38.800 --> 47:46.360
even to me even more abusive because he was calling you a pussy in a gigantic general

47:46.360 --> 47:53.400
sense and making a big show of a kid loving you which is actually a great way to hurt

47:53.400 --> 48:03.400
someone very deeply he wasn't he wasn't he didn't say anything untrue does anybody own

48:03.400 --> 48:07.480
the tape of the roast for your birthday Dan that we did I don't know at that Armenian

48:07.480 --> 48:11.840
restaurant in the Valley because I mean my memory of that was that it was the funniest

48:11.840 --> 48:16.880
thing that's ever happened but I'm sure it's not yeah I'm sure it's not comedy doesn't

48:16.880 --> 48:20.560
age well but what was funny about it which is the thing that we do remember is that I

48:20.560 --> 48:25.800
turned 30 we had a roast and we specifically were like well what if we what if no one shows

48:25.800 --> 48:31.160
up we're like well why do we want anyone to show up all we want to do is is have a dais

48:31.160 --> 48:38.480
like like we don't care so it was like three like plus ones like like like like like wives

48:38.480 --> 48:43.320
husbands girlfriends like who were like had to sit there next to a salad bar in the back

48:43.320 --> 48:50.720
of the Serbian restaurant and watch ten guys like just piss themselves laughing while they

48:50.720 --> 48:55.080
while they for no reason at all into a microphone because there was no one to address except

48:55.080 --> 49:03.640
each other just and facing an empty room like like just did did did roast jokes about about

49:03.640 --> 49:08.360
Dan it was a roast of Dan Harmon but as is the tradition it was everyone just like did

49:08.360 --> 49:13.480
what Dan Harmon joke and then hammers on everybody ripped everybody else yeah it's really fun

49:13.480 --> 49:20.280
but does that tape exist do we know if anybody has that I don't know I mean I have to imagine

49:20.280 --> 49:25.440
that if it exists it's filled with homophobia and racism and say you know things that don't

49:25.440 --> 49:31.520
age well because not only is it a roast but it's a roast from 15 years ago and it's and

49:31.520 --> 49:36.400
it wasn't made for television so I'm sure if we found it for our own purposes sorry I'm

49:36.400 --> 49:41.080
not saying yeah exactly at least this to the general public I'm saying do we have to yeah

49:41.080 --> 49:45.480
yeah you know that was a symptom of my disease that you're like I wonder if that tape exists

49:45.480 --> 49:49.400
and I'm immediately leaping to the world would hate it and like well that's not about the

49:49.400 --> 49:53.240
world it's about our friendship you can watch it and then burn it in a trash can afterward

49:53.240 --> 49:58.320
yeah I just keep it and wait till it's funny again in 50 years when when when people are

49:58.320 --> 50:03.480
so equal and free that everyone's like that is so that's what you call you called a gay

50:03.480 --> 50:09.800
joke so the joke was just that everyone was gay and then it turned out to be true I get

50:09.800 --> 50:15.120
it you joke about Chris Tom and he's like Chris Tom and Dan had a joke Chris Tom is

50:15.120 --> 50:20.800
bad with the ladies Chris we were all of our friends we have a betting pool going on what's

50:20.800 --> 50:32.320
going to last longer your virginity or Saturn I saw a quiet place you hear about this quiet

50:32.320 --> 50:37.000
place movie I heard about it but then I forgot about what it's about what is it about a quiet

50:37.000 --> 50:42.920
place it thank you Spencer there's like I'm right there it's in like like I don't know

50:42.920 --> 50:48.560
I think it's like 20 it's like it's like in five years the world oh this is this is this

50:48.560 --> 50:53.120
is Dunder Mifflin guy if you if you make a sound you get eaten by the yeah yeah yeah

50:53.120 --> 50:58.920
so the first like half hour of it is sign language sign language and whispering it's really effective

50:58.920 --> 51:05.040
it's really I I really enjoyed it quite so I want to ask a question about it as a sci-fi

51:05.040 --> 51:10.480
horror fan yeah like and as a big rules guy you know we talked a lot about zombie movies

51:10.480 --> 51:19.040
with Kirkman and like so I'm I and I'm not I'm not gonna say if the answer is yes oh

51:19.040 --> 51:22.960
the movie sucks or whatever but but I just like what I will do is throw a parade if the

51:22.960 --> 51:30.000
answer is no are there inconsistencies in the rules of these things ie like a lot of times

51:30.000 --> 51:34.200
in movies like that where there's rules that are so clear-cut it's like is there a scene

51:34.200 --> 51:41.600
where the person is like in the corner and it's like you know the Foley person is like

51:41.600 --> 51:45.680
making their breath dramatic but it's like well come on you did a whole scene earlier

51:45.680 --> 51:51.760
about how it literally a pin dropping could have brought them I I thought it would then

51:51.760 --> 51:58.240
you might watch it and go hey Schrab I can hear breathing you know I thought it was very

51:58.240 --> 52:05.720
consistent I thought it was a very simple rule to this creature that that you make any

52:05.720 --> 52:11.280
no I mean they spend a long time setting up the world before they ever introduced the

52:11.280 --> 52:16.800
other thing it's like they're walking around barefoot there's they have like these pre-made

52:16.800 --> 52:25.040
sand pads so they're not like stepping on twigs right going through the forest and stuff and

52:25.040 --> 52:31.240
it's just it is a great it's a great monster that's new which I really like you get to

52:31.240 --> 52:40.040
see him before the spoiler probably a decent look at him you know is it true Rob that you've

52:40.040 --> 52:49.080
been asked to make a sequel to it called don't make a pee pee is there crying right now would

52:49.080 --> 52:54.520
you feel bad that would be awesome would you laugh I'd laugh curious it's more it's more

52:54.520 --> 52:58.040
it says more about well I can't wait to see it I mean I love I love it's really good I

52:58.040 --> 53:07.240
wish I saw Isle of Dogs stop oh that's Wes Anderson yeah I kind of agree with I can't

53:07.240 --> 53:13.240
remember was Lauren Duker like tweeted like well I want to see a Wes Anderson movie about

53:13.240 --> 53:18.840
animals but and then a list of like are you like is there gonna be I mean it just seems

53:18.840 --> 53:26.680
like a setup for a fucking heartbreak like no it there's it's it's a really good I really

53:26.680 --> 53:33.800
liked it a lot I think you as a starburn co-owner might want to check it out because it's I thought

53:33.800 --> 53:40.120
it was just beautifully designed and it there's some off-putting stuff you know with with dog

53:41.160 --> 53:46.760
I just am very sensitive to that so but I think it's sorry is it animation yeah stop motion

53:46.760 --> 53:54.920
animation yeah and they do they do a bunch of stuff up front that that I kind of was like

53:54.920 --> 53:59.720
like oh god and I think they're saying like this if you brought kids to this you should

53:59.720 --> 54:05.880
probably take them out you know because it's but the voice talent is great I just think it's

54:05.880 --> 54:10.840
it's a beautiful well-designed film I love the Wes Anderson's loves stop motion is it literally

54:10.840 --> 54:17.960
stop motion or yeah that's great it I mean like the first all moving it looks clunky I mean like

54:17.960 --> 54:24.840
it's like I don't know if you saw the Mr. Fox movie that he did I can now admit that I haven't seen

54:24.840 --> 54:30.440
it yet because the guy I would have offended that I would have been working with I think is

54:30.440 --> 54:35.400
is that now has to take the movie take is doing for us the bubbles movie

54:39.080 --> 54:44.920
it's co-director was the co-director of Mr. Fox I haven't seen Mr. Fox fantastic Fox man

54:45.720 --> 54:51.640
I've never seen it it's that one's fun too I mean I just I I love I love stop motion

54:51.640 --> 54:57.480
animation I just love the model building I think it's just really great it's amazing speaking of

54:57.480 --> 55:06.360
segues the reason why you know take a YTT world's most sought after director you know of course

55:06.360 --> 55:13.640
his next movie is for me and well after a quick hop over to Prague where he's gonna make his amazing

55:13.640 --> 55:20.200
like Hitler movie but the but he's gonna call the amazing Hitler movie it's good I mean I think

55:20.200 --> 55:27.320
I think it's gonna be truly like like he's gonna it's it's gonna be pretty his description of the

55:27.320 --> 55:33.960
movie like to me like maybe it made me really jealous for the first time in a long time of a

55:34.520 --> 55:40.760
of another guy my age it's like like I was just like God you're just fucking doing what you want

55:40.760 --> 55:47.560
like I really like made me spiritually jealous as opposed to like oh he has a Tesla you know

55:47.560 --> 55:51.960
it was like like oh fuck I'm creatively jealous of someone like like you just finished your

55:51.960 --> 55:56.040
Thor movie and now you're gonna go make this fucking thing but and so I think people are gonna

55:56.040 --> 56:01.960
be blown away by it but then he's gonna do our Michael Jackson monkey movie over here I know

56:01.960 --> 56:07.640
I know that chimpanzees are apes not monkeys put your fucking life up your ass oh man

56:08.920 --> 56:14.440
write us in until a shitty veterinarian has to cut it out and see how you feel write us in if

56:14.440 --> 56:21.160
chimpanzees aren't monkeys um write us in and the election of problem is that they look like they

56:21.160 --> 56:25.560
look exactly like I mean yeah let's just call all monkeys for Christ's sake like you didn't know

56:25.560 --> 56:32.760
what I meant yeah like you didn't know what I meant why is language so living um exactly we but but

56:32.760 --> 56:40.600
the uh we we're getting evicted by this piece of shit studio star burns I don't know who's running

56:40.600 --> 56:47.880
this fucking place but we're leaving star burns castle and we mentioned it last week yeah and if

56:47.880 --> 56:54.280
you can't hear the silent cries of the audience we're not allowed to have in here um believe me

56:54.280 --> 56:58.280
they're they're happening in the ether with that ghost bee from our second sketch what's what's the

56:58.280 --> 57:02.360
next step for us what's well I'm kind of excited about it we toured a place I don't know I don't

57:02.360 --> 57:07.960
want to speak out of school so I'll you know well we went over there and looked at it is the one

57:07.960 --> 57:12.920
kind of downtown ish yeah it's kind of downtown ish I met with an agent and he's like if you guys

57:12.920 --> 57:17.320
need a new space there's this place and it's the same place okay yeah I mean oh it's popping I don't

57:17.320 --> 57:22.440
I don't know why it would be secret but just in case I don't want to cold it rhymes with no it doesn't

57:22.440 --> 57:26.360
it rhymes with it doesn't he's lying it's the staple center we're going to the state he's lying

57:26.360 --> 57:32.520
it's not that we haven't locked it down yet and don't say staple center I think that our LA fans

57:32.520 --> 57:38.280
will be excited what would be excited to be able to come see us even if it was in a shithole this

57:38.280 --> 57:44.040
place is not a shithole um it's it's really nice and it's uh it seems like it's for it's you know

57:44.040 --> 57:50.920
it's it's run by good people and as I said I think our next home very likely will be like like um

57:50.920 --> 57:59.000
you know a rebirth of this show as a as a as not what it was at meltdown like a new it's like we

57:59.000 --> 58:04.440
were something at meltdown then we came here and we're like kind of building to god knows what and

58:04.440 --> 58:09.720
then collapsed into this cocoon phase where we found out we don't care if anyone is in the audience

58:09.720 --> 58:15.320
which is a cool thing to find out but the reason it's cool is because it allows you to miss the

58:15.320 --> 58:22.120
audience and then maybe we can now go in front of an audience again and like not be I won't be as

58:22.120 --> 58:31.000
fucking maybe I can be a little more spalding gray a little less uh speaking of audiences Dan

58:31.000 --> 58:37.320

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:08.440
11 everybody you know what that means it's time to drink coors light and pop some hymns crack open a

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:15.800
nice cool tall glass of me andies i was talking to a Broadway composer uh Lin-Manuel bow annihilation

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:26.120
manuel lin i won't say yes i won't say no his his wario lin manwell's wario manwell lin was out

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:33.960
there i'm man i don't like the constitution my music is bad it doesn't rhyme it's gonna be all

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:42.360
country western about how the constitution is bad manwell lin uh no i was his cat azrael

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:49.400
and i and it's talking about man 11 he was telling a story about uh uh whatever it doesn't matter

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.080
now go on tell it i was telling a story about the timing of a thing and he said and then it's

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:58.600
like oh it's like a broad broadway people refer to 9 11 like a lot because the history of broadway

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.720
was heavily in fact so it's like don't don't break a leg i did the joke or that's what they

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:10.280
say before you go on stage instead of saying good luck they gotta say hit hit a tower 9 11 no that's

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:16.120
not 11 it's in the timeline of broadway broadways ups and downs obviously 9 11 is a marker in that

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:23.400
timeline so i've already done there were nine ups and 11 downs on broadway and coincidentally

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:33.080
broadway stopped on 9 11 there's no broadway anymore what all right it doesn't i mean sometimes i

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.160
i'm from the future sometimes i bring something up and i'm like god i wish they'd just let me

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.040
finish and then sometimes i bring something up and i'm like well it's gonna be conspicuous

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:44.520
that i don't finish but i'm glad they didn't let me finish which one was that you should

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.960
going to be here for a couple more weeks like we're not going to be up and running at the in

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.720
front of the audience but this is a rare opportunity we're doing is we're doing a single camera podcast

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:03.800
and we could we could uh we could have some fun with this and wear it the fuck out before

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.680
we could do video bits well wait not video bits but like like just i'm just saying like

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:14.920
audio bits like with that we're doing like fake sketches like our b sketch like we could have

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:22.360
somebody doing like a little soundboard yeah that with the laughter i like that idea that's fun

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:29.080
that's an atom bomb of an idea then all right well come back

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:35.080
you guys were talking about like cutting open people and cadavers and stuff like that earlier

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:42.600
before i remember that reminded me of like in the return of the living dead like special features

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:49.480
the production designer goes goes like oh i wonder if i can tell this so we went you know uh

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:56.040
daniel bannon and i we went to several funeral homes in southern california where we were shooting

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.680
and we for research to see what they look like on the inside the morgues and the and uh in the

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:07.720
funeral homes and every single time as we were leaving somebody would run out to the parking lot

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:14.040
and go they're fucking they're fucking them they're fucking the bodies every night every night they're

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:26.200
fucking them so when you die you go to the funeral home and somebody's probably fucking you

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:37.320
i have i have necrophilia questions okay shoot and they're not based on shaming anyone

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.760
because although hold your head up high if you fuck dead people necrophilia is a tricky area

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:49.720
because the rule the safe easy rule is don't fuck don't kink shame people but if your kink has no

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:56.600
victim it's a tough area necrophilia a dead person has not consented they have loved ones i don't

01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:02.680
know vandalism like it's well also like though you're also trusting the person if you're do if

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:07.720
you're if you're if you're fucking a corpse in a funeral home i would you know that's unprofessional

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.200
if nothing else we don't have to go into unethical we could just call it unprofessional it's like if

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:17.720
i fucked uh uh the director's cut of community in the edit bay it's like well i don't know if

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.840
he's doing anything bad i just know that he should be working on the show yeah all right that's that's

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:29.400
a good so but but but but but but so apart from that so i'm not judging if you if you're listening

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:36.280
and you have necrophilia necrophilia ask uh stop it look i got i got mannequin legs in my in my home

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:42.680
i go etc if you listen to the podcast i'm of i i got i'm up i i could i have perisexual tendencies

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:48.520
so uh what is perisexual me paraphilic other than you know what it sounds like like like like like

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:54.120
like it's like uh you you do it jumping out of an airplane behind enemy lines it's not like a pussy

01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:00.280
but it's sexual to you like it's like like a manic paraphilic is that what is it i don't know

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:05.560
is it it's just like a paranormal paranormal anything para para mannequin leg isn't a pussy

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:10.440
or a boob exactly like a foot isn't if you have a foot fetish right you're under under the umbrella

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:15.720
of para para philic which when you start to it's like the end of revenge of the nerds everyone

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.320
who's a nerd come down here if you're a nerd for any tiny reason and you're all under one tenth

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:25.560
than everyone is we all like what is normal sexuality that's what the kinsey uh studies

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.960
words you know the most useful that isn't coming like look we're all we're all kinked like hair

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:38.360
you know what follicles perfectly circular uh uh so anyways the my question to people who are

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:44.920
necrophiles or rather not my question to them my question about necrophilia is how does that work

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:54.680
is it because i aren't they like what they're cold and they're like like we we tend to leap to

01:19:54.680 --> 01:20:03.320
oh they're putting their penis in a dead vagina oh yeah which then we go all logistically that

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:08.840
doesn't make any sense to me right that doesn't make any sense but you masturbate with a mannequin

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.680
leg isn't right well that's what i'm saying like is necrophilia is it necrophilia if you're like

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:20.440
working at a mortuary and you're like well this person died very attractive uh now they're uh

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:29.400
their blood is pooling on the underside but uh and their joints are kind of stiff but uh

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:33.800
you know a foot's a foot and i'm going to rub my dick on the sole of the foot yeah until i count

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:39.640
is that necrophilia here's a question that counts can i uh ask a question to you all right so

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:46.600
so i'm i'm a mortician and i like to fuck dead people okay so win win right there right

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.520
everybody's a winner just just just like just like just like dead master priest all these

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:58.680
i can pay yeah just go follow the heat right exactly so follow the money somebody somebody

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:03.960
brings in you when they bring in a dead a dead body and i've decided i'm gonna fuck this one

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:08.280
today okay i'm gonna fuck you're seeing it when they bring it in you're like you're like yeah i think

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:17.080
from across the room okay yeah perfect boing ding it's great do uh and but my job is really

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.280
not to fuck the dead people the job is too can you make this

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:27.080
presentable for us the customer is saying that the customer is like can you please take this

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:33.160
and make this look more sleeping than dead right like alive but we know you make our loved one

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:43.880
look beautiful yeah can you do that so my question is do they fuck it before or after do they like uh

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.400
you have a better necrophilia questions than i do because i'd like if it's all

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:54.360
the blood pooling is what made me go uh i say i say you do both and that way true like you

01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:00.440
like you go like oh wow you look at how you grandma you clean up nice and then you start

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:06.040
you know like you know well here's an important question are these necrophilia questions when

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:11.960
we're talking about mortuaries where there's like an influx of corpses uh and but but exactly at the

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:20.840
same time the whole point of that point of sale is to cheat death in a way to restore levity to

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:27.480
all these things like if if you're if if it's if there's a problem as there is in forgive me

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:35.240
catholics uh you know like where there be uh priests there be um problems we've found if there's

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:42.120
like nexus points of uh is is that properly be necrophilia do do necrophiliacs i want to

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.640
because because because like how many necrophiliacs do you think there are like do you think that's

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.920
a common well he's just telling an anecdote about how they went to a bunch of funeral homes they went

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:55.640
to like three or four funeral homes in southern california and every and he would made it a

01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:02.520
point that it was like every single one some intern some person a whistleblower somebody you go these

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.920
guys are fucking the corpses for sure they're fucking them so it's like that westworld dude that

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:13.720
fucking is like fucking all the robots but here's the thing how like like i i'm not i'm not forgiving

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:19.960
that behavior i'm calling it unprofessional like like like but i'm not but i'm wondering though

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:25.080
that's what i would say if i caught him in the act i want to understand what genuine necrophilia

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:32.200
is and if there's a distinction between that and someone who for instance if i walk by jeffrey

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:41.160
dommer like he like he was he was he was drilling holes in guys heads and and like experimenting

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:48.600
with like pouring water and acid and stuff into the holes because he said to the police that his

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:53.480
dream was to create what he called a zombie and what i think he really meant by that i'm not a

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:58.680
psychologist but it's like everybody gets to pile in on this but i think the the popular theory

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:06.680
is that what he really means by that is a man that won't judge him for being gay which he was

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:12.680
but he didn't have a healthy relationship with his gayness and he he didn't he didn't you know

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.560
he didn't realize that it's okay to go out and get a drink and tell another dude that what you

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:21.480
really want to do is this or that like he had a lot of shame and all this stuff and like he was

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:28.040
it's like did he really want to fuck corpses is that what a necrophiliac really is or is a

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:34.040
it like because i always wonder like if there's an actual genuine necrophiliac if someone's like

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:43.160
like i love rotting flesh i love dead people i i'm turned on by the idea of a dead person

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:49.160
is that person offended by all these other yahoos who are basically just like

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:57.160
like yeah i'm insecure i just don't want people judging me so i'm gonna because uh yeah like

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:07.240
dommer uh hid out in a mannequin in a store so he could abscond with a mannequin once like he

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:13.080
he was he was taking these steps he Schrab came over to my apartment in hollywood once it was like

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:17.400
when i was like starting to become aware of my like fetishes and stuff and he's like

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:23.000
what the fuck is going on like are you a serial killer because i had fucking man i wasn't allowed

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.360
in your bedroom because you said like there's stuff in there that i don't want you to see

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:33.400
the menagerie yeah the menagerie and it's you know and it's like i it i was exploring stuff

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:39.160
that had a lot to do with the intersections between my self-awareness my shame and all the stuff like

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.920
i came out on the other side a guy who could say in a podcast you know what i really want

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:47.640
is for a woman wearing pantyhose to rubber toe on my nipple and i got i like like and

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.200
cody can be like yeah i like doing that too it it it strengthens my core and then we do other

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:58.520
stuff and it's like it's a it it really had nothing to do with so much like like it's

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:05.720
the all of this that's my necrophilia question it's like people is there such a thing as a

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:11.160
person who's like i want the corpse to be like stinky and bruised i'm sure there is there's

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:16.680
somebody who's into anything you know they'd be into like there's people who want to like roll

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:22.920
around in blood and guts i mean they i mean it's like it's like you know like you can find anything

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:28.440
on the internet to jerk off to because of that people some people want to whatever some people

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:32.840
want to eat people some people want some people want to eat poop so i listen to a lot of true

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:38.360
crime podcasts with cody we go to sleep on them and there's this uh the the sunset strip killers uh

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.320
uh i think that's what they're called like there's this couple that were it was the guy indulging

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:48.120
himself and the woman was like kind of raised you know there's a lot of questions about it but

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.200
but she according to her testimony like he would he loved to like pay people for sex and then

01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:03.400
kill them while they were performing sex on him because he would he's like sex workers were a

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:09.800
big target for him but then he would according to her he would do shit like he would he would

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:15.240
like he he took he took a person's head into the shower with him and he fucked the head and

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:21.880
the cops said that they found semen in the the decapitated head's throat and um but then the guy

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:29.160
who like they have him recorded in like giving his like deposition and stuff and he's like

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:35.800
he's going like what so what what do you think i did i put a head in a freezer and i and i took a

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:41.400
frozen head have you ever heard of rigor mortis like what do i like wow and i'm gonna i'm gonna take

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:47.400
that in the shower and i'm gonna put my dick in and he's like he sounds like a completely rational

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:53.480
person going like yeah what what do you mean i fucked a decapitated head that doesn't make

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:59.960
any sense but he probably did but he has another lobe of his brain going like that's crazy why would

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.600
that give you a hard-on why would you be able to it's another thing to be able to achieve orgasm

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:11.960
too like that's how imagine how being turned on that much by the idea that the head is dead

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.280
not the idea that the head's gonna do whatever you want because it's no longer judging you

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:21.320
i feel like that's a different it's a power thing so no i'm talking like like well yeah i think

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.760
i think for a large amount of people under a larger umbrella we like it's a a more quote

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:32.200
unquote mainstream thing to have fantasies about loss of control and about controlling others

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:40.040
because we carry a lot of shame into sex and so we naturally grow our sexual fantasies over

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:46.920
across lines where for outside circumstances in our taboo imagination i have permission to do

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:52.360
this or i have to do that and that's where you know btsm kind of like it's almost at this point

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:58.200
post-internet like we can acknowledge that like you know there's a like there's mainstream which

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.680
is almost a theoretical construct which is a man and woman getting into their pajamas at night

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.920
and laying next to each other and then a baby being brought by a stork and then there's everything

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:11.480
kinky which which which involves people thinking about things that they know they're not supposed

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:16.520
to think about so that they can you know they're not supposed to think about so that they can

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:23.800
reach and scratch itches um that they they they grow up thinking or denied them when the truth

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:29.640
is with a consenting adult you could actually just say let's pretend this or let's have you do that

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:39.080
my safe word is apples but so i guess my my fascination and my question is but then that

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:45.400
means i think that people who feel free to like meet someone and say let's kill a hooker together

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.640
like these people aren't ashamed they're not later they're not living with like all this shame

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:56.680
so then when it's reported that they fucked the head or they they really they they always killed

01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:03.080
the person and then sodomized the corpse these are people who actually can't wait for the dead part

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:09.160
to happen right so the answer would be to go back to my original question is that person would

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:15.880
do those people fuck the the gunshot wound person without sewing up the holes right then they would

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:20.200
get done and they go well i'm gonna clean it off anyway right i mean that's the thing it's like

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:24.520
you're cleaning it off twice if you're but then there's a and then there's a different kind of

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:28.520
person and i'm sorry if this i don't know who i'm apologizing to that'd be like i didn't subscribe

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:33.000
to this podcast to here's i don't i don't know who that person is but my family listens to this

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.040
podcast but but but i do it is kind of fascinating then to think about the two there's like like

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:44.120
like you could do a sitcom in a mortuary and like like there's the guy who's like well man i

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:49.320
i could barely contain myself uh before we make him look alive again and then the other person is

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:57.960
like oh now that we added all that rouge i'm like i know now yeah okay you watch the door i don't

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:02.600
think these guys i think you guys both i watched the door last time you watched i don't know if

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:06.280
those guys cooperate it's like a fucking most dangerous thing in the world like i think they

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.400
both like go home to their wives and go like i think ted's a pervert i think i think this is

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.960
how it is okay so there's what a fucking the old guy in the new guy the new guy comes in and the

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:24.040
old guy teaches them hey you know hey yeah you know go for it no cop no stop man go for it you

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:30.200
know what are you talking about i see you i see you look checking them out if we lived in the

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:35.400
idealized society there would be like a good classic like like karate kid kind of movie where

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.080
it's like is that like but it would i think it would be like a student becomes a teacher thing

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:44.360
where the uh or no okay or is it like the classic version would be like the new guy comes in and

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:49.720
he's like yeah come on let's put some let's put some embalming fluid in these things and like

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:56.760
let's get them dressed up and and and and looking alive uh so because i you know the truth is i got

01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:01.080
to tell you now that we're having a drink in the back room i want to i want to fuck a corpse and

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:07.640
the and the mentor goes like you want to fuck a corpse no you don't listen to yourself you can't

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:13.000
wait until it's pretty you can't wait until its eyes are closed instead of popped open staring

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.960
into the dead air you can't you you hate the bruising if you were a real necrophile brother

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:26.840
you'd be at the indoor with your hard-on out it's in the way that you use it and it's like he

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:42.440
learns to be a purist okay write it yeah the necrophilia acts it's just brought to you by

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:50.200
Reebok it soon will be well i guess i will okay so i'm the only one that has these necrophilia

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:55.480
questions i'd never really given any thought i mean i i think there's probably people that

01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:01.880
that death is a turn on because of their shame and because of the feeling of

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:06.440
like lack of judgment and then there's also people i think that are just so fucked up like

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:13.480
there's something about it's so naughty it's it's so fucking crazy that like i'm i'm the

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:21.800
johnny rotten of sex like i'm right yeah it's right it's like like like like like misanthropic

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:27.640
like because it's like when you get to the point where it's no longer a person like that that's

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:37.800
why it turns you on is that it's rotting flesh that person is so fucked up not to i mean whatever

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:44.360
but like like that person has gone past so far past a threshold they're like they hate

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:51.240
humanity itself and they're to the point where they love death they're a necrophile i want to

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:56.040
fuck a corpse because it's dead so if you were from like i say a small town

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:04.680
and you were a mortician it would be a good chance that you would know a lot of the people

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:11.960
that would come through right that's that's the ticket that's the ticket why is that the ticket

01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:19.160
because if you can go eat us wait but you don't want to put you what he said well yeah because

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:25.320
the johnny rotten thing that it's vandalistic you're like well i remember gladis from the diner

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:29.640
and now she's dead and that makes my yeah i mean like if you were into that all right maybe there's

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.840
a different thrill and maybe there's a motivation to work in a small town i don't know

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:42.520
dommer went to uh was at the milwaukee institute of art and design

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:50.840
did he wait no he didn't he didn't go to it but i had when i went back for my um talk that i did

01:34:50.840 --> 01:35:00.680
there one of my old sculptor teacher bruce says like a week before he was busted he was at the

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:09.000
myad like not gift shop but like supply store looking at the there was i don't know if you remember

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.640
this but back in the early 90s there was this thing called spray fix or whatever or stone fleck and

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:23.560
it was like a a can of spray paint but it wasn't painted would just like make it look like uh your

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:28.440
block of wood was made out of marble or or stone or concrete or whatever and he was looking for

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:36.120
flesh well no here's the thing is that you know like the joke was in sculpture class that there

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:43.480
would be like like out of 10 people there would be nine stone fleck like shoes like that it was

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:49.320
just like instant art whatever right but dommer was checking out that's where he bought the stone

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:55.160
fleck if you look into it i think he sprayed like some skull some skulls with this stuff

01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:00.600
but my teacher like talked to him for a second yeah you're kind of a weird oh why is this guy here

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:08.760
and then like a week later yeah dommer got busted wow and i was like oh i like the true crime my true

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.720
crime podcast addiction is like obviously every every every podcast is going to eventually

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.040
touch on dommer and i thought i was a bit of a dommer expert compared to the rest of the country

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:24.840
because we're from milwaukee when he was doing it and uh boy oh boy it's just you missed out well

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:32.200
it's it's paying attention the the police scandal thing is just fucking like what do you mean well

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:40.040
the you know how you know most people that have heard of dommer know the fact that that the cops

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:48.680
brought victim number i'm going to make up a number like 14 of 17 or something like that like

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:56.840
was brought back to his apartment because he escaped and it was just like this like dommer

01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:03.800
showed up he would with his bag of liquor that he went to go buy while he chained this guy to a

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:08.680
bed who escaped that it's like the cops brought him back to dommer's apartment and because dommer

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:16.040
said oh we're just look we're lovers and yeah i know he looks underage and he's bleeding and he's

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:21.640
delirious and he has handcuffs on his wrist but we're we're just gay like that and the cops like

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:26.600
handed him over and and he killed him immediately well of course he did but then also he killed

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:34.280
more people after right right uh and and and the like i knew about all that and i was like okay shame

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:42.600
of a city and blah blah blah but what i didn't know is that those cops were uh something like even

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:48.360
lighter than suspended without pay it was like they still got paid they and they and and one of

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:55.640
them ended up like captain of like it was like it's like you hear this shit and then you go like

01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:00.200
well i'm sure you know it's important to be shameful and all this stuff but that it's like

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:07.560
it's like for real like it just like it just they like there was no punishment there was no

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.200
no nothing happened to those two cops and it's like like because it doesn't your instinct your human

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:17.000
path against it go like well i'd hate to be those two cops because they didn't know they were thrust

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.200
into the midst of this thing and who knows what it's like to be a cop and all this stuff and you

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.000
extend all this empathy and then you and then you realize that there's you're dealing with a system

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.400
that does not extend even the slightest bit of that empathy by saying like well maybe you should

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:36.520
fucking even if for symbolic purposes never be a fucking cop again ever like ever right within the

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:42.200
all right within the hundred mile radius of the people whose families were eaten by this guy yeah

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:47.480
i'd like like like like go to detroit i don't know what let's figure something out of the vatican

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:53.960
can come up with a system we can but no they they're just like it was like i i can't believe can you

01:38:53.960 --> 01:39:00.760
imagine being like like living in that neighborhood which was you know on marquette's campus where i

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:09.480
went to school anyways it's just it's fucking insane whatever what were you talking about

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:14.280
annihilation corpses annihilation yeah what were your questions oh what's annihilation about is it

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:18.680
oh what my not i think i answered all but i didn't know he had annihilation questions oh you didn't

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:24.760
answer most of your necrophilia questions right i thought we did at least um it's a pretty heady

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:33.800
movie so heady yeah i mean like it was it just i mean like looking i watched the movie and it's

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:39.560
very like i kind of i could it would have been a better movie if it was made like say in the 70s

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:47.480
or maybe even the 90s but it's like it because it was like about like this meteor that crashed

01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:54.520
on earth or something like that is a zone a weird zone a zone crashed on earth or something appeared

01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:00.680
on earth a what a zone appeared on earth a zone appeared on earth and where it is things where

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:09.080
it is different and then and then like the prism effect not only reflected reflected

01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:17.560
lighter refracted light but it also refracted uh feelings feelings and dna and stuff like that

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:25.080
and it got kind of weird and it's a weird pacing thing but um yeah i don't know if you haven't

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.560
seen it i can't we can't really talk about it i can't wait to check it out are there corpses in it

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:35.880
oh there's a corpse but there's a bit of surprise with it let's just leave it are they hot corpses

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:42.840
oh one of them is but that you know a bit more than that spoilers i think one of it's really rot

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.680
and a bit more than should we do some d's and shambles some mounts or is it enough time it's

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:55.800
quarter we don't do that is that is that enough time i mean i'm so high still well could i get

01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:02.520
high and then we'll do it no can you that's a sarcastic yes are you allowed to get high like on

01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:09.240
camera no we can't we'll get arrested that's not true at all it's true no i can say it's tobacco

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:15.800
what if it's what if we say it's fake pot that we bought what if can rob get arrested for saying

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:19.720
that he's high i told him it's not can he get arrested yeah and he is i can take me man

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.080
sure you're under arrest i gotta say with a beard from this angle like from a certain angle

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:29.720
there's a little brody steven's going on here oh a lot of brody steven's going on i would say

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:33.400
don't think it high and you don't even know i can't tell when you're not allowed and what your

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:37.720
point ever is like you just dry and dry and dry and dry sometimes you're saying the opposite of

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.040
what's true and sometimes you're saying exactly what's true what can you like like what do you

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:52.360
know about getting high on camera on podcast etc to say the truth it's um i don't i don't know

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:57.320
yeah because like like getting dug with high that everybody gets high at the show but they

01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.880
don't live stream it right i don't know if it was i feel i feel like i did two versions of getting

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:08.920
dug with high one where we were on like we there wasn't an audience yeah and i we smoked pot on

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:16.040
camera i get high just making eye contact with Doug Benson and that's illegal it's hard to make

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:22.760
eye contact with one of his eyes are just looking at weed do you think like dan spencer and i look

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:29.240
like spencer is slowly turning into me if like an evolutionary chart if i took off my hat no

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:36.200
because the glasses are getting i went to the uh adderall doctor and i and i was like looking

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:42.280
forward to it for two months because i've been fucking heavily working out yeah and uh seven

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:48.680
pounds that's when i was like i had a number in my head that was a little higher than that

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.480
yeah i was a little disappointed i never thought i'd hear you lost seven pounds and be like bummed out

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:58.360
that's that's what i don't know when i started weighing myself that was the thing i had to

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:02.840
break the most is just because it's like every time you get on you have something in your head

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.000
and you're gonna be disappointed every time that's why i don't wait don't weigh myself but i did

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.320
think it was safe to fucking two months right exactly and that's what will always happen it'll

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:15.800
always be the worst so i'm never getting on a scale again no that's you gotta do the opposite

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:22.520
you gotta only get on the scale until your nerves go dumb i mean numb you said you said

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.840
yeah you can you you only take the lowest and highest or whatever and i do different i mean

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:30.840
when i think of my weight i think of the last time i weighed myself but when i think about how

01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:35.640
far i've come from the fact that i used to be 270 pounds i go with the lowest because it's like

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:43.400
holy shit i lost 57 pounds how do you get rid of the fat in your tits wait why does it sit there

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:49.800
forever what if you come over to my place tonight i'll show you show me how to get rid of it or

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:57.880
why it sits there both because i'll show you why you to suck on i know i i i i i i titty fuck you

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.560
important thing to look at is right here this is the thing that bums me out i would be fine with

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.360
my body the way that's the hardest part just don't like this if you because if you were to draw me

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:17.080
like i don't mind if i have like a belly as long as there's a smooth curve i don't like these like

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:22.360
you know i don't like like you know a lump that you would have to like to an extra pen stroke

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:26.520
you get that sucked out that's what makes me really sympathize with people get light because

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:30.440
you're just like well just get it out of there that's what that's what we call lateral flange

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:34.520
that that's done at night lateral flange lateral flange that's done on night that's night two

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:41.160
night two you're like you're gonna find your lateral flange gone by two nights and then the third

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:46.920
night is just simply toning toning yes it's all about shape tone we're gonna get it

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:50.280
we're gonna get it just like you want most the results come from the third night

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:56.200
do you push him to push him together around you're fucking man well i know what do you do

01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.680
well he's a lot of the things that he's describing are different together are you

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:06.440
tiddy what planet do you i've never tiddy i think i maybe tried tiddy fucking in my 20s like you

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:10.280
know you try everything because you see it in the movies and i'm like okay and that's after a while

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:15.560
you're like okay i think i think in the movies yeah i'm gonna fucking do it wrong man how can

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.640
you fucking do it wrong but how do you fucking do it how do you do it there's a lot of different

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:27.400
approaches i take it on a tiddy by tiddy basis but first night do you change your technique on the

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:31.480
second night well i mean look i mean just go away i don't understand your dick is rubbing

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:36.920
human physiognomy is always very different from person to person i love human physiognomy

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:42.760
the first night i fuck one tiddy individually i alternate i fuck just individual tiddies i don't

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:48.120
do just oh you don't put it in between like a hot dog puts it into it night to night to lateral

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:55.400
flanger how do you titty fuck man you got pushing together these are closely guarded trade secrets

01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:01.880
okay okay all right i understand hey man how you titty fuck man you got pushing together

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:10.040

together i don't even like that i have to call it titty fucking i like to call it uh titty flange

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:42.920
remove rest but but i think the way that the the world's eyes into my special technique is that

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:48.600
people are gonna associate me putting my dick on your tits it's just the simplest way to the haters

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:51.640
yeah the haters are gonna call it that anyway so why don't i get out in front of that

01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:01.880
do i do i do thank church church just see that's a great question if you go to if you go to titty

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:12.600
flange removal dot org dot med dot med uh the uh on my faq first question do i finish right no oh

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:20.760
i unless the finishing is do i finish getting you the results that you want out of your man titties

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:26.040
sometimes i do come all over your neck but that's okay okay but that's yeah only when that's what

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:34.600
the customer wants this is about it's it's it's it's a two-way street yeah commitment uh am i

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:41.960
jealous yes is there uh is there you know it's it's a vigorous three-day process

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:50.920

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:12.840
uh huh right again second question on on the on the jeff b davis uh titty flange removal technique

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:20.600
system is how many people chicken out it's like it's they say when you go skydiving the scariest

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:25.640
part of skydiving is making the reservation to go skydiving no jumping out of the plane is the

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:32.760
easiest part it's can i Dan Harmon commit to a three-day system to get the results that you want

01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:36.840
i paid 500 bucks for this you want to jump out of this plane or let my friend come on my chest

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:42.280
yeah uh Harmontown listeners especially first subscribers if you subscribe this month to Harmon

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.360

code titty fuck right right and that's brave again bring it taking it back is it childish of

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:38.920
course it is but like that's what people are gonna say it's like the soylent guy it's like

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:43.640
that's what people are gonna say yeah just call it that just like the soylent get out in front of

01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:50.040
the critics also my dick is made of micro modell fiber it's three times softer than cotton do you

think that's what nigel eight or do you think i just cut him open every six weeks yeah well yeah

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:58.920

i have the capability of saying cody can you get me a lecroy nigel can't be he's like he's like

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:44.200
he can't he doesn't he doesn't know why we do anything we do he's scoop him up like because

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:48.200
you love him and he's shivering and he's like why am i hurting and then you take him to a place it's

01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:58.280
like then you leave him the worst and their brain is the size of a fucking like four-sided die

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:05.080

01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:17.400
stuff we did interesting to play this one back and understand like what what what line did i cross

01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:22.120
in asking my necrophilia questions it made everybody you cross the line where you chose to

01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:28.440
not offend necrophiles oh well yeah because i don't i thought but look i've gone to bat for pedophiles

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:35.240
on this show i fucking hate like i i like i hate victimization so people that victimize other people

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:40.680
for their own pleasure like okay they're doing something that is criminally wrong they're and

01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:46.920
they're going like like like so isn't that enough are we gonna solve the problem by just being so

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:53.800
happy that we found monsters i find it really fucking weird but not weird it totally understandable

01:55:53.800 --> 01:56:00.920
that what we we go like oh what gives you a hard-on what ladybugs you're fucking crazy and it's like

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:07.560
we've we're all that person like in some specific way ladybugs we're all that person and and then

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:11.640
and then we just like are we really like that's exactly what they do in prison is they're all in

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.960
there for fucked up shit and then they get so fucking excited when they hear a fucking pedophiles

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:21.320
in prison that they run down to fuck the person to death or whatever like it's like it's bullshit

01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:27.720
come on like like like criminality is criminality like some people are sick some people are experiencing

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:32.440
cycles of abuse like people that are abused in their childhood they grow up to abuse people

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:37.880
guess how you solve this problem you know it's not it's not through being so excited to find

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.040
someone alien and monster that you like point your finger at them and throw mud at them it's
