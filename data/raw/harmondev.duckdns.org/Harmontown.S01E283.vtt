still working on some of the kinks to our new format but\n\n10:15.280 --> 10:21.880\nour new format is mostly based in copyright infringement yeah I mean well look we're gonna\n\n10:21.880 --> 10:27.160\nwe're not gonna emulate the losers in the institutionalized comedy game we could try\n\n10:27.160 --> 10:36.520\nthat I have a killer miss swan I mean does anybody well can we hear it no I mean I was\n\n10:36.520 --> 10:45.360\nthere was there a iconic opening to mad TV I think they'd go like why are you mad like\n\n10:45.360 --> 10:50.600\nthey worked their way around to like every sketch it's just not that people were impressed\n\n10:50.600 --> 10:54.120\nby that because they did that for 15 seasons like oh the sketches always end with somebody\n\n10:54.120 --> 11:00.080\ngetting mad but that's that's a pretty amateur thing I trained high school kids and improv\n\n11:00.080 --> 11:05.400\nlike they tend to want to fight or dance and wear props you gotta you gotta encourage them\n\n11:05.400 --> 11:09.320\nto come out of their shell so the idea the fact that every mad TV sketch ends with someone\n\n11:09.320 --> 11:15.400\ngetting mad good idea for a theme but but not not a feat wasn't a sacrifice they were\n\n11:15.400 --> 11:22.920\nmaking comedically what did I miss over the last two days I was up in the the northwest\n\n11:22.920 --> 11:28.520\nI just been sitting not sitting sitting how's night your head side with with the little\n\n11:28.520 --> 11:34.960\none is he alive is he good is recovering is he alright yeah he's doing good I mean it's\n\n11:34.960 --> 11:44.360\nlike I gotta like I gotta like I gotta deal with all this like shame you know like I it's\n\n11:44.360 --> 11:49.520\nlike when you own a dog which I don't have kids so a lot of people have kids last night\n\n11:49.520 --> 11:56.000\nchecked like at least four billion of them had them and like like like I'm sorry it's\n\n11:56.000 --> 12:02.720\ngot to be worse when it's a kid but it just sucks because like your dog starts acting\n\n12:02.720 --> 12:09.560\nweird and then you got to choose whether to take them to the vet and then once you take\n\n12:09.560 --> 12:14.120\nthem to the vet you just know I say it's like I know it's not their fault like I'm sure\n\n12:14.120 --> 12:20.640\nthe veterinarial industry is not the fucking is not flush with cash and I'm sure the doctors\n\n12:20.640 --> 12:26.960\nthat are funneled into it are wonderful people and I'm sure the technicians that couldn't\n\n12:26.960 --> 12:33.640\nyou know be doctors at a veterinarian hospital yet are also great people and I'm sure the\n\n12:33.640 --> 12:39.520\npeople that work at the front desk that can't even be technicians that can't even be doctors\n\n12:39.520 --> 12:45.320\nthat can't even have human patients I'm sure they're not five levels beneath normal humanity\n\n12:45.320 --> 12:49.880\nthey're just five levels beneath a regular doctor and what is a doctor as we've discussed\n\n12:49.880 --> 12:56.000\non the show a serial killer with a support system it's a doctor is a person who's comfortable\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:01.920\ncutting things open the people that cut humans open and go like oh look it's a sort of bladder\n\n13:01.920 --> 13:09.800\nlooks like yeah why do they call it Kaiser that's pretty you know Kaiser German yeah\n\n13:09.800 --> 13:15.760\nit's also permanent a it's like a eternal Kaiser it's it's Kaiser's from Caesar yeah\n\n13:15.760 --> 13:21.320\nwhy are these people the ones that are trying to save our lives they want eternal and empirical\n\n13:21.320 --> 13:27.240\nrule yeah they want they want a permanent Caesar they want to rule over your health yeah I mean\n\n13:27.240 --> 13:34.240\nlook there's no question that doctors know how to help you when you're sick but you know\n\n13:34.240 --> 13:39.480\nthere's also no question that doctors are scientists they have to be so they don't they're\n\n13:39.480 --> 13:43.440\nand they're not you know what kind of person is drawn to an occupation where you might\n\n13:43.440 --> 13:50.240\nhave to like be next to someone who's dying all the time or you might just sick just just\n\n13:50.240 --> 13:54.920\njust you know where you were every day you get up and go to work and you're just gonna\n\n13:54.920 --> 14:00.320\nbe nonstop problems and sick desperate people like looking for answers that you may or may\n\n14:00.320 --> 14:05.600\nnot have with you always like rolling the dice with with advice and diagnoses and things\n\n14:05.600 --> 14:10.400\nthat could either make or break your the rest of your life and pay off your student loans\n\n14:10.400 --> 14:14.360\nlike the kind of person that looks at that minefield and goes like I think I'll go hang\n\n14:14.360 --> 14:18.000\nout in there I'm not gonna call them a sociopath but I'm also not gonna call them probably\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:23.120\nalso coincidentally like the the warmest person in the world like they probably have\n\n14:23.120 --> 14:30.880\nsome pretty heavy fucking emotional armor on them or as I suspect they enjoy suffering\n\n14:30.880 --> 14:36.880\nlove cutting open dogs because the answer is I think that I think that most people follow\n\n14:36.880 --> 14:41.400\ntheir I mean like would you go into that field because it didn't hurt you or would you go\n\n14:41.400 --> 14:45.840\nto that field because you liked it I just think I feel like they like a little bit I'm\n\n14:45.840 --> 14:50.240\ntalking about regular doctors here I'm talking about people who are like yes I see you have\n\n14:50.240 --> 14:54.560\na tumor I'm gonna cut you open pull it out oh look there's your lungs there's your heart\n\n14:54.560 --> 14:58.240\nI hope I don't make it stop beating okay so I'm back up okay by the way my name was Tony\n\n14:58.240 --> 15:03.560\nsee you later I'm going golfing come on serial killer we had those people on the show that\n\n15:03.560 --> 15:08.000\ntalked like they were EMTs that talked about they have we should have them back like they\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:12.360\nhave injury porn that they send to each other like who can outgrow us well now you human\n\n15:12.360 --> 15:16.400\nI don't like that yeah there's an EMT like they don't they don't get paid very much\n\n15:16.400 --> 15:21.160\nI think you know we heard like those people are undoubtedly heroics and now you evened\n\n15:21.160 --> 15:25.680\nit up I mean there's only a fact that there are people that are willing to show up to\n\n15:25.680 --> 15:29.800\nbe where people have like fucking like just fallen down on the sidewalk and no one knows\n\n15:29.800 --> 15:33.840\nwhat's wrong with them or hit themselves in the hand with a hammer they just find a dick\n\n15:33.840 --> 15:39.520\nand balls laying in the side of the road or whatever like God knows like your idea or\n\n15:39.520 --> 15:47.600\nJustin's to have Beth be a veterinarian in Rick and Morty I can't remember I think that\n\n15:47.600 --> 15:56.440\nwas a decision that was made during the writing of the pilot and it wasn't based on your current\n\n15:56.440 --> 16:04.960\nbeef with the veterinarians no and I don't really have a beef with I only have a beef\n\n16:04.960 --> 16:12.920\nwith the species in general if that which how can you like I just it's not a really\n\n16:12.920 --> 16:18.080\na beef I'm just like come on it's as plain as the nose on our face like if you're poor\n\n16:18.080 --> 16:25.000\nand you are comfortable looking at guts you end up in prison if you're rich you end up\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:31.400\na doctor I don't know how anyone can argue with that like people go to medical school\n\n16:31.400 --> 16:36.840\nand then the people that aren't as comfortable looking at guts as murderers fall down in\n\n16:36.840 --> 16:40.720\nfaint and then they go into research friend of mine when I was going to college maybe\n\n16:40.720 --> 16:47.480\nI've told the story before they went do you have to go through like an actual autopsy\n\n16:47.480 --> 16:53.480\nand watch it could ever be like you know totally taken apart and then it for the first time\n\n16:53.480 --> 16:59.680\nthese these young students all walked in there and there was two doctors over it and they\n\n16:59.680 --> 17:05.120\nwith the students didn't know because here's a dead human being and they had lined it with\n\n17:05.120 --> 17:10.080\ntinfoil and filled it with spaghettios and when students walked in they were just eating\n\n17:10.080 --> 17:16.040\nout of the chest cavity and eating spaghettios out of it and half the students ran out and\n\n17:16.040 --> 17:23.840\nbarfed or fainted or whatever and that's that's a little joke get get used to not caring about\n\n17:23.840 --> 17:30.080\nthe insides of people yeah you know that's great that that them noticing that they're\n\n17:30.080 --> 17:36.160\nsociopaths plus them having free time makes them want to have fun that way but so another\n\n17:36.160 --> 17:40.560\nthing you could do with your free time if your sociopath is learn empathy like you're\n\n17:40.560 --> 17:46.080\nsmart you learned all of the anatomy like you learned how to how to turn your stethoscope\n\n17:46.080 --> 17:54.200\ninto a bong like maybe to give them some give them some seminars about humanity and stuff\n\n17:54.200 --> 17:58.560\nhow people that don't become doctors think and feel I told you about like Alice flat\n\n17:58.560 --> 18:04.320\nheard that the neurologist she's like we don't we're not good with people we we we look at\n\n18:04.320 --> 18:07.480\nyou in the way that you sit and the things that you say or the things that are wrong\n\n18:07.480 --> 18:11.640\nwith you you touch something that's cold you think it's hot like we're looking at your\n\n18:11.640 --> 18:16.080\nbrain all we want to do is that we're zombies we just want to take the top of your head\n\n18:16.080 --> 18:21.880\noff and poke around in the big bowl of toothpaste which is your brain like we're not good with\n\n18:21.880 --> 18:27.320\npeople we just like solving the brain puzzle like if you were good with people you probably\n\n18:27.320 --> 18:32.240\nwouldn't be good at sawing off a head and poking around in there yeah that's what I'm\n\n18:32.240 --> 18:36.720\nsaying yeah kind of yeah so these are the people that were you know that you have to\n\n18:36.720 --> 18:41.440\ntake your dog to your dog can't talk you take your dog to him and then you know it's probably\n\n18:41.440 --> 18:44.440\na technician it's probably not even a doctor I don't know if a doctor is the one that has\n\n18:44.440 --> 18:48.520\nit you know it's like I talked to three different doctors on the phone over the three days that\n\n18:48.520 --> 18:53.480\nNigel was at the hospital it's like the bottom line is filled with a lot of toxic shame like\n\n18:53.480 --> 19:02.840\nI took my dog to the hospital because he wouldn't stop trembling and vomiting he was vomiting\n\n19:02.840 --> 19:10.400\nlike so much that the equivalent for his size would be like you know like the middle you\n\n19:10.400 --> 19:15.720\nknow like like all across the stage except for the your area and Spencer's area like\n\n19:15.720 --> 19:21.200\nthat much which is you know like I was like geez I mean what what you know it's time to\n\n19:21.200 --> 19:27.040\ngo to the hospital like he's never puked that much and and and he already had his issue\n\n19:27.040 --> 19:30.640\nwith where he had you know they had to pull out a clump of grass out of his intestines\n\n19:30.640 --> 19:35.920\nor did they have to we'll never know you know like fans of the podcast will recall that\n\n19:35.920 --> 19:41.080\nstory the punchline of it is we're left to wonder for the rest of our lives should we\n\n19:41.080 --> 19:46.520\nhave let the dog pass this giant clump of grass or would that have perforated his intestines\n\n19:46.520 --> 19:50.720\non the way out because it was moving so slowly it was almost not moving at all do you wait\n\n19:50.720 --> 19:55.480\nfor your dog to try to fit that out his asshole and possibly cause permanent damage to him\n\n19:55.480 --> 20:00.200\nor do you cause permanent damage to him by cutting him open and pulling it out that's\n\n20:00.200 --> 20:04.800\nwhat we opted to so this is Nigel's second surgery second time he's been cut open by\n\n20:04.800 --> 20:11.960\nhumans that he trusts and and and I just and and this time there was nothing in there\n\n20:11.960 --> 20:16.440\nthere was that he was he was it was you know he was inflamed his stomach they x-ray his\n\n20:16.440 --> 20:19.960\nstomach and they go it's really big do you think there's something in there did he eat\n\n20:19.960 --> 20:24.480\nanything that might be trapped in there because his stomach is gigantic and you said he's\n\n20:24.480 --> 20:29.480\nbeen puking a lot so like we think there's something in there and I said well he eats\n\n20:29.480 --> 20:34.080\na lot of stuff so x-ray show a thing or not a thing no it doesn't show a lot of things\n\n20:34.080 --> 20:40.880\nas they condescendingly told me like I I even literally said I said are you sure it could\n\n20:40.880 --> 20:44.520\nis it possible it could be just inflammation that is make his you're saying his stomach\n\n20:44.520 --> 20:48.840\nis big I don't even know why I said that I didn't go to fucking medical school I was\n\n20:48.840 --> 20:53.360\njust it's just like I because I don't want to cut my dog open twice in a year and so\n\n20:53.360 --> 20:57.680\nI just it was just almost like it was just it was just like you think it you think it\n\n20:57.680 --> 21:01.920\ncould another reason his stuff because because what they said they were using logic at midnight\n\n21:01.920 --> 21:06.200\nin an animal hospital so I'm thinking I probably don't have the fucking Sherlock Holmes of\n\n21:06.200 --> 21:10.680\nanimal doctors right or maybe it's the Fox Mulder maybe they're so fucking smart about\n\n21:10.680 --> 21:15.040\ndiagnosing animals that they that people call them spooky Dr. McGillicuddy and like make\n\n21:15.040 --> 21:18.560\nthem work at midnight because they're so fucking good at figuring out what's going on but they\n\n21:18.560 --> 21:22.840\nwere scratching their heads your dog your dog's stomach is huge and you said he just puked\n\n21:22.840 --> 21:28.000\nlike the size of a pool table and and so his stomach should be small right because he puked\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:34.120\nall that and I'm like this is can I be a doctor and and I was like well is it possible that\n\n21:34.120 --> 21:40.520\nthe reason the stomach is large is because it's irritated is that a thing and the the\n\n21:40.520 --> 21:45.040\ntechnician I think there was a technician I don't think it was a doctor I don't know\n\n21:45.040 --> 21:50.200\nthe difference like like like like I honestly I perceived them looking at me like I was\n\n21:50.200 --> 21:57.160\nan idiot and I'm like yeah well x-rays don't pick up inflammation so and I was like that\n\n21:57.160 --> 22:04.800\nwasn't an answer the answer that could have saved my dog a lot of pain was it's possible\n\n22:04.800 --> 22:09.360\nI didn't ask if x-rays picked up inflammation it's like when you when you go to the bank\n\n22:09.360 --> 22:13.320\nwhen you used to go to the bank and the people would say yeah the computer says no and you\n\n22:13.320 --> 22:16.640\njust look you can fill with this rage and go like this isn't a computer interaction\n\n22:16.640 --> 22:20.680\nthis is a human interaction I'm asking a human being a question stop pointing at your computer\n\n22:20.680 --> 22:24.760\nwhich you know goddamn well if your computer told you to jump out the fucking window you\n\n22:24.760 --> 22:29.840\nwould you would you would pat it on the side you would go like what's wrong with it if it\n\n22:29.840 --> 22:35.240\nif this if the screen flickered which it might and sometimes does you wouldn't go oh time\n\n22:35.240 --> 22:42.600\nto kill myself like you're being lazy and you're being condescending it was like yeah\n\n22:42.600 --> 22:47.040\nx-rays don't pick up inflammation I didn't I didn't ask if they did I asked if his stomach\n\n22:47.040 --> 22:52.240\ncould be enlarged because of inflammation as opposed to a foreign object like do we\n\n22:52.240 --> 22:59.160\nthink he ate a bowling ball I just I just and I just think just save my dog save my\n\n22:59.160 --> 23:05.760\ndog so that at the earliest absolute possibility like I'm like the doctor called me on the\n\n23:05.760 --> 23:09.720\nphone then after he stays there all night and she goes yeah it's like the x-ray is stomach\n\n23:09.720 --> 23:15.080\nis he's getting a little worse stomach's getting I don't know it's it's it's it's if there's\n\n23:15.080 --> 23:21.840\nsomething in there it's not moving so like maybe there's nothing in there maybe it's\n\n23:21.840 --> 23:28.600\ninflammation and I and I'm like but I'm talking to doctors now and I'm like okay so if there's\n\n23:28.600 --> 23:31.680\nsomething in there it's like like last time it was a clump of grass it was moving real\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:36.040\nslow I just like yeah if this is if this is a foreign object and you said he eats a lot\n\n23:36.040 --> 23:40.480\nof foreign objects it's now you ate a clump of grass at one point like but but it's not\n\n23:40.480 --> 23:44.960\nmoving I would show of he ate a baseball here's the it wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't it\n\n23:44.960 --> 23:53.320\nwouldn't I like so they give me three choices endoscopy and then another there's another\n\n23:53.320 --> 23:56.480\nchoice that was like an endoscopy but it's like they put something down his nose or something\n\n23:56.480 --> 24:02.680\nand like like both of those choices involved keeping him the way he was and getting more\n\n24:02.680 --> 24:09.360\ninformation which now that I know I made the horribleest most fucking awful choice like\n\n24:09.360 --> 24:16.040\nI just I want to cry like but but they don't they don't recommend anything you ask them\n\n24:16.040 --> 24:19.120\ndo what do you recommend well as you know and they might as well say out loud like well\n\n24:19.120 --> 24:25.000\nI don't want to get sued it's your dog you know yeah it's so this whole system is based\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:30.040\non two things total disrespect for the layman and total burden on the layman with any kind\n\n24:30.040 --> 24:36.440\nof fucking risk like like like like we think you're an idiot and because we went to two\n\n24:36.440 --> 24:44.240\nyears of dog school or something and but but so

30:36.040\nto put this rage like because I have I have a couple holes in my wall at home from when\n\n30:36.040 --> 30:41.640\nFiv was sick the cat and because it's like there comes a point where you don't know how\n\n30:41.640 --> 30:47.320\nto express like you have rage and shame that you don't know where to put it it seems like\n\n30:47.320 --> 30:51.960\nthere is no like I'm a very sheltered person like I don't have a lot of feelings that I\n\n30:51.960 --> 30:58.160\ndon't know how to get rid of in a proper way but like like intense levels of rage and shame\n\n30:58.160 -->

fists like you\n\n31:10.400 --> 31:18.320\nfeel like you want to beat something you want to kill what is your shame about that you\n\n31:18.320 --> 31:27.840\nlet Nigel down yeah by by hiring people to stab him or or or before that are you you\n\n31:27.840 --> 31:32.840\ndo you feel responsible for why he got whatever he got no because you found out it was what\n\n31:32.840 --> 31:38.320\nit wasn't he didn't eat something it was like he has he has a condition called IBD but you\n\n31:38.320 --> 31:45.720\nknow at this point whatever like I he's the thing that that he is sick at home with right\n\n31:45.720 --> 31:50.760\nnow is a fucking stab wound in his stomach it's not what he went in with what he what\n\n31:50.760 --> 31:58.040\nhe went in with is apparently a condition called IBD I get I don't know what bowel disorder\n\n31:58.040 --> 32:02.920\nI don't I don't know if that's what it stands for it's basically like allergies food allergies\n\n32:02.920 --> 32:08.400\nlike they say he ate something and it can I think it could build up for a year like so\n\n32:08.400 --> 32:12.720\nit just kind of fuck around with his diet and stuff like it's now it's doubtful that\n\n32:12.720 --> 32:18.720\nhe ate it's no that's not true it's possible that he ate some grass that he ate last time\n\n32:18.720 --> 32:25.280\nor that that there is also milk thistle or some species of fucking California cumquat\n\n32:25.280 --> 32:30.760\nthat he fucking like found in a backyard and like like it's possible that he ate one thing\n\n32:30.760 --> 32:35.840\nthat like shocked his system immediately it's also possible that over a year of having a\n\n32:35.840 --> 32:43.640\nlittle bit of chicken or or snail corpse or whatever they you know it's like oh this this\n\n32:43.640 --> 32:51.720\nfood's got TBD's and this food's got IB gays and like IB gays TBD's is good it's like like\n\n32:51.720 --> 32:56.720\nwhat should we call this disease of course by

from\n\n33:09.320 --> 33:16.720\nhis intestines I I think I've already heard by now that dogs eat grass when they're sick\n\n33:16.720 --> 33:23.800\nto induce vomiting I've also heard that that's fucking a horse shit and that dogs that eat\n\n33:23.800 --> 33:30.320\ngrass end up sick from it please shut up now it doesn't change anything being told this\n\n33:30.320 --> 33:37.120\nstuff you're not really helping anybody because you had a sick dog once I don't mean you should\n\n33:37.120 --> 33:44.880\nbe ashamed of yourself I just I just just shut up like like like I it's a it's a fucking\n\n33:44.880 --> 33:49.480\ndog that starts shaking and vomiting you take them into idiots who are smarter than you\n\n33:49.480 --> 33:53.600\nand and you you you're given a choice between

grass and you have nothing to think about\n\n34:21.520 --> 34:26.280\nthat entire time except what you did wrong you can you can run from your mistakes everything\n\n34:26.280 --> 34:30.920\nelse you can you can fix by playing Minecraft you know I had a dog that kept eating grass\n\n34:30.920 --> 34:34.400\nand would not stop eating grass loved grass favorite favorite thing in the world eight\n\n34:34.400 --> 34:39.200\ngrass all day all night and was constantly bummed out and constantly puking it's like\n\n34:39.200 --> 34:44.080\nhey like like we'll let you sort this out like like you're you're an idiot also when\n\n34:44.080 --> 34:50.600\nthat dog was little because we got this dog in New York we would be in Central Park and\n\n34:50.600 --> 34:56.400\nfavorite food horseshit the fucking handsome cabs that would go to take married couples\n\n34:56.400 --> 35:02.800\ndown the lane yeah Nigel and giant horse apples and this dog just loved eating just just couldn't\n\n35:02.800 --> 35:08.960\nget enough horseshit Nigel and Harvey dogs even so happy and we didn't like want to stop\n\n35:08.960 --> 35:13.360\nthe dog from being happy but it was really embarrassing because like what is what's what's\n\n35:13.360 --> 35:21.360\nyour dog problem Nigel and Harvey every morning they they bark at the the neighbor's cat dash\n\n35:21.360 --> 35:30.080\nthe cute little cute little black and white cat that I never told my neighbors I accidentally\n\n35:30.080 --> 35:33.360\ncaught in a humane trap when I was trying to catch a raccoon that was eating all my dog\n\n35:33.360 --> 35:40.240\nfood right you go back I went over to my neighbor's house once and I was like oh that's your cat\n\n35:40.240 --> 35:44.320\nthat was like the thought below and I was like I caught your cat in a trap once and let it\n\n35:44.320 --> 35:48.760\ngo like there's a raccoon once yeah I was there was a raccoon coming in the doggy dog\n\n35:48.760 --> 35:54.040\nyou almost you almost murdered their cat and almost murdered it I definitely I certainly\n\n35:54.040 --> 36:00.840\nmade it it gave it the most miserable night of its life depending on when it took the\n\n36:00.840 --> 36:06.480\nbait that was a raccoon which is a bunch of you got caught in a cage and it was a humane\n\n36:06.480 --> 36:11.640\ntrap it wasn't it just came out of the backyard like I gotta I got my prey and it was that\n\n36:11.640 --> 36:18.240\nyeah anyways very very very adorable outdoor cat named also bad name for a cat dash if\n\n36:18.240 --> 36:23.320\nyou can't get out of a fucking trap now come on you think trap sense will be a part of anyways\n\n36:23.320 --> 36:28.880\nthe dogs the dogs when I'm working out in the morning they bark at dash dash comes out\n\n36:28.880 --> 36:32.080\nthere and I'm always like making fun of it because I'm like you at this point like what\n\n36:32.080 --> 36:35.320\ndo you think remember we were talking about like what are the dogs what are the dogs saying\n\n36:35.320 --> 36:39.440\nto the cat well I just realized what they say to the cat because I'm talking to Alice\n\n36:39.440 --> 36:45.040\nin the dog sitter about like what she's like she's like you know they they fucking they\n\n36:45.040 --> 36:48.840\nlove going out in the front yard because they know the cat shits out there and like they\n\n36:48.840 --> 36:52.480\nrace each other to the cat shit like they as I was like it turns out when the dogs are\n\n36:52.480 --> 36:55.800\nbarking at the cat through the front window they're like poop they're like yelling at\n\n36:55.800 --> 37:10.120\nthe Wells Fargo wagon is my how to drop look here yet make it make a nice juicy one for\n\n37:10.120 --> 37:15.520\nme Cynthia they're all up in that cat shit yeah they run out to the spot where he shits\n\n37:15.520 --> 37:20.240\nand they fight over it like raptors what's what's in that cat poo that's so delicious\n\n37:20.240 --> 37:25.200\nI think the dogs because they smell so intensely you have to think you do the backwards math\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:31.040\nand go that means that if they could smell shit which they surely can because we can\n\n37:31.040 --> 37:36.720\nbut they smell the ingredients in there they they have to taste God gave them noses that\n\n37:36.720 --> 37:47.880\ncould smell the concern of a of a poodle an hour away and that can smell their way home\n\n37:47.880 --> 37:52.800\nto to to if they if they're if they're if they get trapped in a u-haul or whatever the\n\n37:52.800 --> 38:00.880\nstories are they can smell a forest fire in in in Utah and so we can smell a turd so so\n\n38:00.880 --> 38:04.880\nthen God's like well they're gonna go nuts about the turds they're gonna just kill themselves\n\n38:04.880 --> 38:08.520\nlike their nose will explode so then he's like well I can't make their nose less sensitive\n\n38:08.520 --> 38:12.580\nI mean I really want these things to live by their nose all right well I'll just make\n\n38:12.580 --> 38:18.680\nthem love it and then so that's why when they meet each other they're like let me check\n\n38:18.680 --> 38:24.040\nout that asshole wow wow you got one coming don't you okay it's cresting I can see it\n\n38:24.040 --> 38:29.000\nlike Barbara Cody's dog came over by the way Nigel's dogs got he's got he's

very sensitive person so I'm just gonna\n\n47:22.920 --> 47:28.560\ndo I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna try to roast Rob but in a positive way and then he did\n\n47:28.560 --> 47:34.440\na whole set of like just jokes about Rob is so such a good person and blah blah blah\n\n47:34.440 --> 47:38.800\nand I was like it was really it was really really funny because it was it was actually\n\n47:38.800 --> 47:46.360\neven to me even more abusive because he was calling you a pussy in a gigantic general\n\n47:46.360 --> 47:53.400\nsense and making a big show of a kid loving you which is actually a great way to hurt\n\n47:53.400 --> 48:03.400\nsomeone very deeply he wasn't he wasn't he didn't say anything untrue does anybody own\n\n48:03.400 --> 48:07.480\nthe tape of the roast for your birthday Dan that we did I don't know at that Armenian\n\n48:07.480 --> 48:11.840\nrestaurant in the Valley because I mean my memory of that was that it was the funniest\n\n48:11.840 --> 48:16.880\nthing that's ever happened but I'm sure it's not yeah I'm sure it's not comedy doesn't\n\n48:16.880 --> 48:20.560\nage well but what was funny about it which is the thing that we do remember is that I\n\n48:20.560 --> 48:25.800\nturned 30 we had a roast and we specifically were like well what if we what if no one shows\n\n48:25.800 --> 48:31.160\nup we're like well why do we want anyone to show up all we want to do is is have a dais\n\n48:31.160 --> 48:38.480\nlike like we don't care so it was like three like plus ones like like like like like wives\n\n48:38.480 --> 48:43.320\nhusbands girlfriends like who were like had to sit there next to a salad bar in the back\n\n48:43.320 --> 48:50.720\nof the Serbian restaurant and watch ten guys like just piss themselves laughing while they\n\n48:50.720 --> 48:55.080\nwhile they for no reason at all into a microphone because there was no one to address except\n\n48:55.080 --> 49:03.640\neach other just and facing an empty room like

Harmon joke and then hammers on everybody ripped everybody else yeah it's really fun\n\n49:13.480 --> 49:20.280\nbut does that tape exist do we know if anybody has that I don't know I mean I have to imagine\n\n49:20.280 --> 49:25.440\nthat if it exists it's filled with homophobia and racism and say you know things that don't\n\n49:25.440 --> 49:31.520\nage well because not only is it a roast but it's a roast from 15 years ago and it's and\n\n49:31.520 --> 49:36.400\nit wasn't made for television so I'm sure if we found it for our own purposes sorry I'm\n\n49:36.400 --> 49:41.080\nnot saying

movies\n\n51:10.480 --> 51:19.040\nwith Kirkman and like so I'm I and I'm not I'm not gonna say if the answer is yes oh\n\n51:19.040 --> 51:22.960\nthe movie sucks or whatever but but I just like what I will do is throw a parade if the\n\n51:22.960 --> 51:30.000\nanswer is no are there inconsistencies in the rules of these things ie like a lot of times\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:34.200\nin movies like that where there's rules that are so clear-cut it's like is there a scene\n\n51:34.200 --> 51:41.600\nwhere the person is like in the corner and it's like you know the Foley person is like\n\n51:41.600 --> 51:45.680\nmaking their breath dramatic but it's like well come on you did a whole scene earlier\n\n51:45.680 --> 51:51.760\nabout how it literally a pin dropping could have brought them I I thought it would then\n\n51:51.760 --> 51:58.240\nyou might watch it and go hey Schrab I can hear breathing you know I thought it was very\n\n51:58.240 --> 52:05.720\nconsistent I thought it was a very simple rule to this creature that that you make any\n\n52:05.720 --> 52:11.280\nno I mean they spend a long time setting up the world before they ever introduced the\n\n52:11.280 --> 52:16.800\nother thing it's like they're walking around barefoot there's they have like these pre-made\n\n52:16.800 --> 52:25.040\nsand pads so they're not like stepping on twigs right going through the forest and stuff and\n\n52:25.040 --> 52:31.240\nit's just it is a great it's a great monster that's new which I really like you get to\n\n52:31.240 --> 52:40.040\nsee him before the spoiler probably a decent look at him you know is it true Rob that you've\n\n52:40.040 --> 52:49.080\nbeen asked to make a sequel to it called don't make a pee pee is there crying right now would\n\n52:49.080 --> 52:54.520\nyou feel bad that would be awesome would you laugh I'd laugh curious it's more it's more\n\n52:54.520 --> 52:58.040\nit says more about well I can't wait to see it I mean I love I love it's really good I\n\n52:58.040 --> 53:07.240\nwish I saw Isle of Dogs stop oh that's Wes Anderson yeah I kind of agree with I can't\n\n53:07.240 --> 53:13.240\nremember was Lauren Duker like tweeted like well I want to see a Wes Anderson movie about\n\n53:13.240 --> 53:18.840\nanimals but and then a list of like are you like is there gonna be I mean it just seems\n\n53:18.840 --> 53:26.680\nlike a setup for a fucking heartbreak like no it there's it's it's a really good I really\n\n53:26.680 --> 53:33.800\nliked it a lot I think you as a starburn co-owner might want to check it out because it's I thought\n\n53:33.800 --> 53:40.120\nit was just beautifully designed and it there's some off-putting stuff you know with with dog\n\n53:41.160 --> 53:46.760\nI just am very sensitive to that so but I think it's sorry is it animation yeah stop motion\n\n53:46.760 --> 53:54.920\nanimation yeah and they do they do a bunch of stuff up front that that I kind of was like\n\n53:54.920 --> 53:59.720\nlike oh god and I think they're saying like this if you brought kids to this you should\n\n53:59.720 --> 54:05.880\nprobably take them out you know because it's but the voice talent is great I just think it's\n\n54:05.880 --> 54:10.840\nit's a beautiful well-designed film I love the Wes Anderson's loves stop motion is it literally\n\n54:10.840 --> 54:17.960\nstop motion or yeah that's great it I mean like the first all moving it looks clunky I mean like\n\n54:17.960 --> 54:24.840\nit's like I don't know if you saw the Mr. Fox movie that he did I can now admit that I haven't seen\n\n54:24.840 --> 54:30.440\nit yet because the guy I would have offended that I would have been working with I think is\n\n54:30.440 --> 54:35.400\nis that now has to take the movie take is doing for us the bubbles movie\n\n54:39.080 --> 54:44.920\nit's co-director was the co-director of Mr. Fox I haven't seen Mr. Fox fantastic Fox man\n\n54:45.720 --> 54:51.640\nI've never seen it it's that one's fun too I mean I just I I love I love stop motion\n\n54:51.640 --> 54:57.480\nanimation I just love the model building I think it's just really great it's amazing speaking of\n\n54:57.480 --> 55:06.360\nsegues the reason why you know take a YTT world's most sought after director you know of course\n\n55:06.360 --> 55:13.640\nhis next movie is for me and well after a quick hop over to Prague where he's gonna make his amazing\n\n55:13.640 --> 55:20.200\nlike Hitler movie but the but he's gonna call the amazing Hitler movie it's good I mean I think\n\n55:20.200 --> 55:27.320\nI think it's gonna be truly like like he's gonna it's it's gonna be pretty his description of the\n\n55:27.320 --> 55:33.960\nmovie like to me like maybe it made me really jealous for the first time in a long time of a\n\n55:34.520 --> 55:40.760\nof another guy my age it's like like I was just like God you're just fucking doing what you want\n\n55:40.760 --> 55:47.560\nlike I really like made me spiritually jealous as opposed to like oh he has a Tesla you know\n\n55:47.560 --> 55:51.960\nit was like like oh fuck I'm creatively jealous of someone like like you just finished your\n\n55:51.960 --> 55:56.040\nThor movie and now you're gonna go make this fucking thing but and so I think people are gonna\n\n55:56.040 --> 56:01.960\nbe blown away by it but then he's gonna do our Michael Jackson monkey movie over here I know\n\n56:01.960 --> 56:07.640\nI know that chimpanzees are apes not monkeys put your fucking life up your ass oh man\n\n56:08.920 --> 56:14.440\nwrite us in until a shitty veterinarian has to cut it out and see how you feel write us in if\n\n56:14.440 --> 56:21.160\nchimpanzees aren't monkeys um write us in and the election of problem is that they look like they\n\n56:21.160 --> 56:25.560\nlook exactly like I mean yeah let's just call all monkeys for Christ's sake like you didn't know\n\n56:25.560 --> 56:32.760\nwhat I meant yeah like you didn't know what I meant why is language so living um exactly we but but\n\n56:32.760 --> 56:40.600\nthe uh we we're getting evicted by this piece of shit studio star burns I don't know who's running\n\n56:40.600 --> 56:47.880\nthis fucking place but we're leaving star burns castle and we mentioned it last week yeah and if\n\n56:47.880 --> 56:54.280\nyou can't hear the silent cries of the audience we're not allowed to have in here um believe me\n\n56:54.280 --> 56:58.280\nthey're they're happening in the ether with that ghost bee from our second sketch what's what's the\n\n56:58.280 --> 57:02.360\nnext step for us what's well I'm kind of excited about it we toured a place I don't know I don't\n\n57:02.360 --> 57:07.960\nwant to speak out of school so I'll you know well we went over there and looked at it is the one\n\n57:07.960 --> 57:12.920\nkind of downtown ish yeah it's kind of downtown ish I met with an agent and he's like if you guys\n\n57:12.920 --> 57:17.320\nneed a new space there's this place and it's the same place okay yeah I mean oh it's popping I don't\n\n57:17.320 --> 57:22.440\nI don't know why it would be secret but just in case I don't want to cold it rhymes with no it doesn't\n\n57:22.440 --> 57:26.360\nit rhymes with it doesn't he's lying it's the staple center we're going to the state he's lying\n\n57:26.360 --> 57:32.520\nit's not that we haven't locked it down yet and don't say staple center I think that our LA fans\n\n57:32.520 --> 57:38.280\nwill be excited what would be excited to be able to come see us even if it was in a shithole this\n\n57:38.280 --> 57:44.040\nplace is not a shithole um it's it's really nice and it's uh it seems like it's for it's you know\n\n57:44.040 --> 57:50.920\nit's it's run by good people and as I said I think our next home very likely will be like like um\n\n57:50.920 --> 57:59.000\nyou know a rebirth of this show as a as a as not what it was at meltdown like a new it's like we\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:04.440\nwere something at meltdown then we came here and we're like kind of building to god knows what and\n\n58:04.440 --> 58:09.720\nthen collapsed into this cocoon phase where we found out we don't care if anyone is in the audience\n\n58:09.720 --> 58:15.320\nwhich is a cool thing to find out but the reason it's cool is because it allows you to miss the\n\n58:15.320 --> 58:22.120\naudience and then maybe we can now go in front of an audience again and like not be I won't be as\n\n58:22.120 --> 58:31.000\nfucking maybe I can be a little more spalding gray a little less uh speaking of audiences Dan\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:37.320\nwhile I remember this uh we have to talk about we're doing a show in Boston oh shit uh Friday\n\n58:37.320 --> 58:41.880\nJune 22nd will

01:06:08.440\n11 everybody you know what that means it's time to drink coors light and pop some hymns crack open a\n\n01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:15.800\nnice cool tall glass of me andies i was talking to a Broadway composer uh Lin-Manuel bow annihilation\n\n01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:26.120\nmanuel lin i won't say yes i won't say no his his wario lin manwell's wario manwell lin was out\n\n01:06:26.120 -->

go on tell it i was telling a story about the timing of a thing and he said and then it's\n\n01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:58.600\nlike oh it's like a broad broadway people refer to 9 11 like a lot because the history of broadway\n\n01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.720\nwas heavily in fact so it's like don't don't break a leg i did the joke or that's what they\n\n01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:10.280\nsay before you

soundboard yeah that with the laughter i like that idea that's fun\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:29.080\nthat's an atom bomb of an idea then all right well come back\n\n01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:35.080\nyou guys were talking about like cutting open people and cadavers and stuff like that earlier\n\n01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:42.600\nbefore i remember that reminded me of like in the return of the living dead like special features\n\n01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:49.480\nthe production designer goes goes like oh i wonder if i can tell this so we went you know uh\n\n01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:56.040\ndaniel bannon and i we went to several funeral homes in southern california where we were shooting\n\n01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.680\nand we for research to see what they look like on the inside the morgues and the and uh in the\n\n01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:07.720\nfuneral homes and every single time as we were leaving somebody would run out to the parking lot\n\n01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:14.040\nand go they're fucking they're fucking them they're fucking the bodies every night every night they're\n\n01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:26.200\nfucking them so when you die you go to the funeral home and somebody's probably fucking you\n\n01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:37.320\ni have i have necrophilia questions okay shoot and they're not based on shaming anyone\n\n01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.760\nbecause although hold your head up high if you fuck dead people necrophilia is a tricky area\n\n01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:49.720\nbecause the rule the safe easy rule is don't fuck don't kink shame people but if your kink has no\n\n01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:56.600\nvictim it's a tough area necrophilia a dead person has not consented they have loved ones i don't\n\n01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:02.680\nknow vandalism like it's well also like though you're also trusting the person if you're do if\n\n01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:07.720\nyou're if you're if you're fucking a corpse in a funeral home i would you know that's unprofessional\n\n01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.200\nif nothing else we don't have to go into unethical we could just call it unprofessional it's like if\n\n01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:17.720\ni fucked uh uh the director's cut of community in the edit bay it's like well i don't know if\n\n01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.840\nhe's doing anything bad i just know that he should be working on the show yeah all right that's that's\n\n01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:29.400\na good so but but but but but but so apart from that so i'm not judging if you if you're listening\n\n01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:36.280\nand you have necrophilia necrophilia ask uh stop it look i got i got mannequin legs in my in my home\n\n01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:42.680\ni go etc if you listen to the podcast i'm of i i got i'm up i i could i have perisexual tendencies\n\n01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:48.520\nso uh what is perisexual me paraphilic other than you know what it sounds like like like like like\n\n01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:54.120\nlike it's like uh you you do it jumping out of an airplane behind enemy lines it's not like a pussy\n\n01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:00.280\nbut it's sexual to you like it's like like a manic paraphilic is that what is it i don't know\n\n01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:05.560\nis it it's just like a paranormal paranormal anything para para mannequin leg isn't a pussy\n\n01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:10.440\nor a boob exactly like a foot isn't if you have a foot fetish right you're under under the umbrella\n\n01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:15.720\nof para para philic which when you start to it's like the end of revenge of the nerds everyone\n\n01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.320\nwho's a nerd come down here if you're a nerd for any tiny reason and you're all under one tenth\n\n01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:25.560\nthan everyone is we all like what is normal sexuality that's what the kinsey uh studies\n\n01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.960\nwords you know the most useful that isn't coming like look we're all we're all kinked like hair\n\n01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:38.360\nyou know what follicles perfectly circular uh uh so anyways the my question to people who are\n\n01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:44.920\nnecrophiles or rather not my question to them my question about necrophilia is how does that work\n\n01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:54.680\nis it because i aren't they like what they're cold and they're like like we we tend to leap to\n\n01:19:54.680 --> 01:20:03.320\noh they're putting their penis in a dead vagina oh yeah which then we go all logistically that\n\n01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:08.840\ndoesn't make any sense to me right that doesn't make any sense but you masturbate with a mannequin\n\n01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.680\nleg isn't right well that's what i'm saying like is necrophilia is it necrophilia if you're like\n\n01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:20.440\nworking at a mortuary and you're like well this person died very attractive uh now they're uh\n\n01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:29.400\ntheir blood is pooling on the underside but uh and their joints are kind of stiff but uh\n\n01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:33.800\nyou know a foot's a foot and i'm going to rub my dick on the sole of the foot yeah until i count\n\n01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:39.640\nis that necrophilia here's a question that counts can i uh ask a question to you all right so\n\n01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:46.600\nso i'm i'm a mortician and i like to fuck dead people okay so win win right there right\n\n01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.520\neverybody's a winner just just just like just like just like dead master priest all these\n\n01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:58.680\ni can pay yeah just go follow the heat right exactly so follow the money somebody somebody\n\n01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:03.960\nbrings in you when they bring in a dead a dead body and i've decided i'm gonna fuck this one\n\n01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:08.280\ntoday okay i'm gonna fuck you're seeing it when they bring it in you're like you're like yeah i think\n\n01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:17.080\nfrom across the room okay yeah perfect boing ding it's great do uh and but my job is really\n\n01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.280\nnot to fuck the dead people the job is too can you make this\n\n01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:27.080\npresentable for us the customer is saying that the customer is like can you please take this\n\n01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:33.160\nand make this look more sleeping than dead right like alive but we know you make our loved one\n\n01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:43.880\nlook beautiful yeah can you do that so my question is do they fuck it before or after do they like uh\n\n01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.400\nyou have a better necrophilia questions than i do because i'd like if it's all\n\n01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:54.360\nthe blood pooling is what made me go uh i say i say you do both and that way true like you\n\n01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:00.440\nlike you go like oh wow you look at how you grandma you clean up nice and then you start\n\n01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:06.040\nyou know like you know well here's an important question are these necrophilia questions when\n\n01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:11.960\nwe're talking about mortuaries where there's like an influx of corpses uh and but but exactly at the\n\n01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:20.840\nsame time the whole point of that point of sale is to cheat death in a way to restore levity to\n\n01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:27.480\nall these things like if if you're if if it's if there's a problem as there is in forgive me\n\n01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:35.240\ncatholics uh you know like where there be uh priests there be um problems we've found if there's\n\n01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:42.120\nlike nexus points of uh is is that properly be necrophilia do do necrophiliacs i want to\n\n01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.640\nbecause because because like how many necrophiliacs do you think there are like do you think that's\n\n01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.920\na common well he's just telling an anecdote about how they went to a bunch of funeral homes they went\n\n01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:55.640\nto like three or four funeral homes in southern california and every and he would made it a\n\n01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:02.520\npoint that it was like every single one some intern some person a whistleblower somebody you go these\n\n01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.920\nguys are fucking the corpses for sure they're fucking them so it's like that westworld dude that\n\n01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:13.720\nfucking is like fucking all the robots but here's the thing how like like i i'm not i'm not forgiving\n\n01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:19.960\nthat behavior i'm calling it unprofessional like like like but i'm not but i'm wondering though\n\n01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:25.080\nthat's what i would say if i caught him in the act i want to understand what genuine necrophilia\n\n01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:32.200\nis and if there's a distinction between that and someone who for instance if i walk by jeffrey\n\n01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:41.160\ndommer like he like he was he was he was drilling holes in guys heads and and like experimenting\n\n01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:48.600\nwith like pouring water and acid and stuff into the holes because he said to the police that his\n\n01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:53.480\ndream was to create what he called a zombie and what i think he really meant by that i'm not a\n\n01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:58.680\npsychologist but it's like everybody gets to pile in on this but i think the the popular theory\n\n01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:06.680\nis that what he really means by that is a man that won't judge him for being gay which he was\n\n01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:12.680\nbut he didn't have a healthy relationship with his gayness and he he didn't he didn't you know\n\n01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.560\nhe didn't realize that it's okay to go out and get a drink and tell another dude that what you\n\n01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:21.480\nreally want to do is this or that like he had a lot of shame and all this stuff and like he was\n\n01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:28.040\nit's like did he really want to fuck corpses is that what a necrophiliac really is or is a\n\n01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:34.040\nit like because i always wonder like if there's an actual genuine necrophiliac if someone's like\n\n01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:43.160\nlike i love rotting flesh i love dead people i i'm turned on by the idea of a dead person\n\n01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:49.160\nis that person offended by all these other yahoos who are basically just like\n\n01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:57.160\nlike yeah i'm insecure i just don't want people judging me so i'm gonna because uh yeah like\n\n01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:07.240\ndommer uh hid out in a mannequin in a store so he could abscond with a mannequin once like he\n\n01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:13.080\nhe was he was taking these steps he Schrab came over to my apartment in hollywood once it was like\n\n01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:17.400\nwhen i was like starting to become aware of my like fetishes and stuff and he's like\n\n01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:23.000\nwhat the fuck is going on like are you a serial killer because i had fucking man i wasn't allowed\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.360\nin your bedroom because you said like there's stuff in there that i don't want you to see\n\n01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:33.400\nthe menagerie yeah the menagerie and it's you know and it's like i it i was exploring stuff\n\n01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:39.160\nthat had a lot to do with the intersections between my self-awareness my shame and all the stuff like\n\n01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.920\ni came out on the other side a guy who could say in a podcast you know what i really want\n\n01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:47.640\nis for a woman wearing pantyhose to rubber toe on my nipple and i got i like like and\n\n01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.200\ncody can be like yeah i like doing that too it it it strengthens my core and then we do other\n\n01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:58.520\nstuff and it's like it's a it it really had nothing to do with so much like like it's\n\n01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:05.720\nthe all of this that's my necrophilia question it's like people is there such a thing as a\n\n01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:11.160\nperson who's like i want the corpse to be like stinky and bruised i'm sure there is there's\n\n01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:16.680\nsomebody who's into anything you know they'd be into like there's people who want to like roll\n\n01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:22.920\naround in blood and guts i mean they i mean it's like it's like you know like you can find anything\n\n01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:28.440\non the internet to jerk off to because of that people some people want to whatever some people\n\n01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:32.840\nwant to eat people some people want some people want to eat poop so i listen to a lot of true\n\n01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:38.360\ncrime podcasts with cody we go to sleep on them and there's this uh the the sunset strip killers uh\n\n01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.320\nuh i think that's what they're called like there's this couple that were it was the guy indulging\n\n01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:48.120\nhimself and the woman was like kind of raised you know there's a lot of questions about it but\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.200\nbut she according to her testimony like he would he loved to like pay people for sex and then\n\n01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:03.400\nkill them while they were performing sex on him because he would he's like sex workers were a\n\n01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:09.800\nbig target for him but then he would according to her he would do shit like he would he would\n\n01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:15.240\nlike he he took he took a person's head into the shower with him and he fucked the head and\n\n01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:21.880\nthe cops said that they found semen in the the decapitated head's throat and um but then the guy\n\n01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:29.160\nwho like they have him recorded in like giving his like deposition and stuff and he's like\n\n01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:35.800\nhe's going like what so what what do you think i did i put a head in a freezer and i and i took a\n\n01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:41.400\nfrozen head have you ever heard of rigor mortis like what do i like wow and i'm gonna i'm gonna take\n\n01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:47.400\nthat in the shower and i'm gonna put my dick in and he's like he sounds like a completely rational\n\n01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:53.480\nperson going like yeah what what do you mean i fucked a decapitated head that doesn't make\n\n01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:59.960\nany sense but he probably did but he has another lobe of his brain going like that's crazy why would\n\n01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.600\nthat give you a hard-on why would you be able to it's another thing to be able to achieve orgasm\n\n01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:11.960\ntoo like that's how imagine how being turned on that much by the idea that the head is dead\n\n01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.280\nnot the idea that the head's gonna do whatever you want because it's no longer judging you\n\n01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:21.320\ni feel like that's a different it's a power thing so no i'm talking like like well yeah i think\n\n01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.760\ni think for a large amount of people under a larger umbrella we like it's a a more quote\n\n01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:32.200\nunquote mainstream thing to have fantasies about loss of control and about controlling others\n\n01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:40.040\nbecause we carry a lot of shame into sex and so we naturally grow our sexual fantasies over\n\n01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:46.920\nacross lines where for outside circumstances in our taboo imagination i have permission to do\n\n01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:52.360\nthis or i have to do that and that's where you know btsm kind of like it's almost at this point\n\n01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:58.200\npost-internet like we can acknowledge that like you know there's a like there's mainstream which\n\n01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.680\nis almost a theoretical construct which is a man and woman getting into their pajamas at night\n\n01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.920\nand laying next to each other and then a baby being brought by a stork and then there's everything\n\n01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:11.480\nkinky which which which involves people thinking about things that they know they're not supposed\n\n01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:16.520\nto think about so that they can you know they're not supposed to think about so that they can\n\n01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:23.800\nreach and scratch itches um that they they they grow up thinking or denied them when the truth\n\n01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:29.640\nis with a consenting adult you could actually just say let's pretend this or let's have you do that\n\n01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:39.080\nmy safe word is apples but so i guess my my fascination and my question is but then that\n\n01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:45.400\nmeans i think that people who feel free to like meet someone and say let's kill a hooker together\n\n01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.640\nlike these people aren't ashamed they're not later they're not living with like all this shame\n\n01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:56.680\nso then when it's reported that they fucked the head or they they really they they always killed\n\n01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:03.080\nthe person and then sodomized the corpse these are people who actually can't wait for the dead part\n\n01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:09.160\nto happen right so the answer would be to go back to my original question is that person would\n\n01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:15.880\ndo those people fuck the the gunshot wound person without sewing up the holes right then they would\n\n01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:20.200\nget done and they go well i'm gonna clean it off anyway right i mean that's the thing it's like\n\n01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:24.520\nyou're cleaning it off twice if you're but then there's a and then there's a different kind of\n\n01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:28.520\nperson and i'm sorry if this i don't know who i'm apologizing to that'd be like i didn't subscribe\n\n01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:33.000\nto this podcast to here's i don't i don't know who that person is but my family listens to this\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.040\npodcast but but but i do it is kind of fascinating then to think about the two there's like like\n\n01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:44.120\nlike you could do a sitcom in a mortuary and like like there's the guy who's like well man i\n\n01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:49.320\ni could barely contain myself uh before we make him look alive again and then the other person is\n\n01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:57.960\nlike oh now that we added all that rouge i'm like i know now yeah okay you watch the door i don't\n\n01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:02.600\nthink these guys i think you guys both i watched the door last time you watched i don't know if\n\n01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:06.280\nthose guys cooperate it's like a fucking most dangerous thing in the world like i think they\n\n01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.400\nboth like go home to their wives and go like i think ted's a pervert i think i think this is\n\n01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.960\nhow it is okay so there's what a fucking the old guy in the new guy the new guy comes in and the\n\n01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:24.040\nold guy teaches them hey you know hey yeah you know go for it no cop no stop man go for it you\n\n01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:30.200\nknow what are you talking about i see you i see you look checking them out if we lived in the\n\n01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:35.400\nidealized society there would be like a good classic like like karate kid kind of movie where\n\n01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.080\nit's like is that like but it would i think it would be like a student becomes a teacher thing\n\n01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:44.360\nwhere the uh or no okay or is it like the classic version would be like the new guy comes in and\n\n01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:49.720\nhe's like yeah come on let's put some let's put some embalming fluid in these things and like\n\n01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:56.760\nlet's get them dressed up and and and and looking alive uh so because i you know the truth is i got\n\n01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:01.080\nto tell you now that we're having a drink in the back room i want to i want to fuck a corpse and\n\n01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:07.640\nthe and the mentor goes like you want to fuck a corpse no you don't listen to yourself you can't\n\n01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:13.000\nwait until it's pretty you can't wait until its eyes are closed instead of popped open staring\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.960\ninto the dead air you can't you you hate the bruising if you were a real necrophile brother\n\n01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:26.840\nyou'd be at the indoor with your hard-on out it's in the way that you use it and it's like he\n\n01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:42.440\nlearns to be a purist okay write it yeah the necrophilia acts it's just brought to you by\n\n01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:50.200\nReebok it soon will be well i guess i will okay so i'm the only one that has these necrophilia\n\n01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:55.480\nquestions i'd never really given any thought i mean i i think there's probably people that\n\n01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:01.880\nthat death is a turn on because of their shame and because of the feeling of\n\n01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:06.440\nlike lack of judgment and then there's also people i think that are just so fucked up like\n\n01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:13.480\nthere's something about it's so naughty it's it's so fucking crazy that like i'm i'm the\n\n01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:21.800\njohnny rotten of sex like i'm right yeah it's right it's like like like like like misanthropic\n\n01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:27.640\nlike because it's like when you get to the point where it's no longer a person like that that's\n\n01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:37.800\nwhy it turns you on is that it's rotting flesh that person is so fucked up not to i mean whatever\n\n01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:44.360\nbut like like that person has gone past so far past a threshold they're like they hate\n\n01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:51.240\nhumanity itself and they're to the point where they love death they're a necrophile i want to\n\n01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:56.040\nfuck a corpse because it's dead so if you were from like i say a small town\n\n01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:04.680\nand you were a mortician it would be a good chance that you would know a lot of the people\n\n01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:11.960\nthat would come through right that's that's the ticket that's the ticket why is that the ticket\n\n01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:19.160\nbecause if you can go eat us wait but you don't want to put you what he said well yeah because\n\n01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:25.320\nthe johnny rotten thing that it's vandalistic you're like well i remember gladis from the diner\n\n01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:29.640\nand now she's dead and that makes my yeah i mean like if you were into that all right maybe there's\n\n01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.840\na different thrill and maybe there's a motivation to work in a small town i don't know\n\n01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:42.520\ndommer went to uh was at the milwaukee institute of art and design\n\n01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:50.840\ndid he wait no he didn't he didn't go to it but i had when i went back for my um talk that i did\n\n01:34:50.840 --> 01:35:00.680\nthere one of my old sculptor teacher bruce says like a week before he was busted he was at the\n\n01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:09.000\nmyad like not gift shop but like supply store looking at the there was i don't know if you remember\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.640\nthis but back in the early 90s there was this thing called spray fix or whatever or stone fleck and\n\n01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:23.560\nit was like a a can of spray paint but it wasn't painted would just like make it look like uh your\n\n01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:28.440\nblock of wood was made out of marble or or stone or concrete or whatever and he was looking for\n\n01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:36.120\nflesh well no here's the thing is that you know like the joke was in sculpture class that there\n\n01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:43.480\nwould be like like out of 10 people there would be nine stone fleck like shoes like that it was\n\n01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:49.320\njust like instant art whatever right but dommer was checking out that's where he bought the stone\n\n01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:55.160\nfleck if you look into it i think he sprayed like some skull some skulls with this stuff\n\n01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:00.600\nbut my teacher like talked to him for a second yeah you're kind of a weird oh why is this guy here\n\n01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:08.760\nand then like a week later yeah dommer got busted wow and i was like oh i like the true crime my true\n\n01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.720\ncrime podcast addiction is like obviously every every every podcast is going to eventually\n\n01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.040\ntouch on dommer and i thought i was a bit of a dommer expert compared to the rest of the country\n\n01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:24.840\nbecause we're from milwaukee when he was doing it and uh boy oh boy it's just you missed out well\n\n01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:32.200\nit's it's paying attention the the police scandal thing is just fucking like what do you mean well\n\n01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:40.040\nthe you know how you know most people that have heard of dommer know the fact that that the cops\n\n01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:48.680\nbrought victim number i'm going to make up a number like 14 of 17 or something like that like\n\n01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:56.840\nwas brought back to his apartment because he escaped and it was just like this like dommer\n\n01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:03.800\nshowed up he would with his bag of liquor that he went to go buy while he chained this guy to a\n\n01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:08.680\nbed who escaped that it's like the cops brought him back to dommer's apartment and because dommer\n\n01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:16.040\nsaid oh we're just look we're lovers and yeah i know he looks underage and he's bleeding and he's\n\n01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:21.640\ndelirious and he has handcuffs on his wrist but we're we're just gay like that and the cops like\n\n01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:26.600\nhanded him over and and he killed him immediately well of course he did but then also he killed\n\n01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:34.280\nmore people after right right uh and and and the like i knew about all that and i was like okay shame\n\n01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:42.600\nof a city and blah blah blah but what i didn't know is that those cops were uh something like even\n\n01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:48.360\nlighter than suspended without pay it was like they still got paid they and they and and one of\n\n01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:55.640\nthem ended up like captain of like it was like it's like you hear this shit and then you go like\n\n01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:00.200\nwell i'm sure you know it's important to be shameful and all this stuff but that it's like\n\n01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:07.560\nit's like for real like it just like it just they like there was no punishment there was no\n\n01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.200\nno nothing happened to those two cops and it's like like because it doesn't your instinct your human\n\n01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:17.000\npath against it go like well i'd hate to be those two cops because they didn't know they were thrust\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.200\ninto the midst of this thing and who knows what it's like to be a cop and all this stuff and you\n\n01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.000\nextend all this empathy and then you and then you realize that there's you're dealing with a system\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.400\nthat does not extend even the slightest bit of that empathy by saying like well maybe you should\n\n01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:36.520\nfucking even if for symbolic purposes never be a fucking cop again ever like ever right within the\n\n01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:42.200\nall right within the hundred mile radius of the people whose families were eaten by this guy yeah\n\n01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:47.480\ni'd like like like like go to detroit i don't know what let's figure something out of the vatican\n\n01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:53.960\ncan come up with a system we can but no they they're just like it was like i i can't believe can you\n\n01:38:53.960 --> 01:39:00.760\nimagine being like like living in that neighborhood which was you know on marquette's campus where i\n\n01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:09.480\nwent to school anyways it's just it's fucking insane whatever what were you talking about\n\n01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:14.280\nannihilation corpses annihilation yeah what were your questions oh what's annihilation about is it\n\n01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:18.680\noh what my not i think i answered all but i didn't know he had annihilation questions oh you didn't\n\n01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:24.760\nanswer most of your necrophilia questions right i thought we did at least um it's a pretty heady\n\n01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:33.800\nmovie so heady yeah i mean like it was it just i mean like looking i watched the movie and it's\n\n01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:39.560\nvery like i kind of i could it would have been a better movie if it was made like say in the 70s\n\n01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:47.480\nor maybe even the 90s but it's like it because it was like about like this meteor that crashed\n\n01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:54.520\non earth or something like that is a zone a weird zone a zone crashed on earth or something appeared\n\n01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:00.680\non earth a what a zone appeared on earth a zone appeared on earth and where it is things where\n\n01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:09.080\nit is different and then and then like the prism effect not only reflected reflected\n\n01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:17.560\nlighter refracted light but it also refracted uh feelings feelings and dna and stuff like that\n\n01:40:17.560
