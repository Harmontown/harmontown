00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session!

00:15.000 --> 00:40.000
Please welcome the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Alright, thank you. Thank you so much for last minute comp-trolling.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Oh, thank you for having me, Dan.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
You're old hat at this now.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I love comp-trolling. It's like my favorite thing.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm sorry I didn't even hear that you called my name.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I thought people were just excited that the show was happening.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
I usually wait to see if they're excited for me to be here.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, please welcome this fucking guy.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
B-BJ Black Basilits!

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
This fucking guy is here too.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
From Castle Wolfenstein.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh yeah, that's what Hitler wanted us to look like.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
That's a huge compliment. Do not take that the wrong way.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
It is.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
You are very handsome.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You're very handsome.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
You look like Duke Nukem.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
That is, yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Did you know that Duke Nukem is related to B.J. Blazkowicz from the...

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
What? No way!

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Are you serious?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
They're in the canon of video game stuff.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Okay, this is very deep.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I just want to say a couple of things.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Just a couple of things.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Great.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
You can keep the bullet train moving.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
The San Diego thing we talked about last week.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
So the sexual harassment, the cosplay thing?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And I don't think we touched upon it last week.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I don't know if it was a thing last week.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
It's...

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
They touched upon it there.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
No, we touched upon it a lot.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Is that your joke?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Is the audience...

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
They're small minds.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
They're very easily...

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
It's that kind of dot connecting that makes sexual harassment happen.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
You guys are worse than sexual harassers.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
I don't know if we mentioned the young lady who's become the poster child of cosplay,

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
sexual harassment.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
She got...

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Well, we thought that she'd gotten attacked.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
And I don't... And I kind of want to sidestep.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Because I don't...

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Of course.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Like whether or not she...

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I don't know.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Because other podcasts talk about that.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I just...

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I only narcissistically wanted to talk about that incident for one reason,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
which is that there was this one article, and I can't remember what publication it was,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
but one of the Rick and Morty writers pulled it out and said,

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
there's this huge article about cosplay and sexual assault and harassment,

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
and a terrible article outlining the whole thing and terrible darkness, darkness,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
cosplay, sexual assault, cosplay, sexual assault, cosplay, sexual assault.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
And at the bottom of the article, there's just kind of the equivalent of some stock photography

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
of some people cosplaying.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
It was the couple that dressed as Mr. Meeseeks at the...

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
No such thing as bad press.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
It's just great to have stuff out there.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
You can't control how it gets out there.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
It was the weirdest sensation of my life, cos I'm like,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
I'm a nerd, and this girl got hurt, or didn't she, or whatever.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
When I was talking about this thing, it was like,

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
oh shit, that's gonna pump us up, like 1.7.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Alright.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
There's Frank.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I don't think that's his name.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Nope.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
It's not.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I just ran out with the vodka bucket.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
People are just running out on stage this show.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Day late, dollar short.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Okay, there was a homeless guy in the Starburns parking lot, apparently,

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
and I was really bummed out because I was working late at Starburns, the animation studio,

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
and our writer's assistant, Adam, got a call from a PA who said,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I walked out, there was a guy, he's parked on this spot,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
and he's got a blanket over him, and I don't know what's going on,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I called the non-emergency police line.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Is it 3-1-1?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I don't know, 9-1-0?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Okay.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
It's not quite 9-1-1, back it off.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
9-1 less than 1.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I was like, okay, I guess that's, I don't know,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
and then we walked out the back, and there were three squad cars,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
and I was a homeless kid who obviously just wanted a safe place to sleep,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
and I'm part of the problem.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
And I'm living with that, and I thought if I said it to these kids, I could somehow gain something.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
You're not going to get to him, though, this message,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
because he probably doesn't listen to podcasts.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
No, his life is probably fucking ruined now.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
He maybe could have, with one night's safe sleep in my parking lot,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
he could have fucking, like, gained a foothold,

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
and I came down on him like a fucking, like, I didn't even know I was doing it.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm part of the problem.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
All right, enough of that.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Wedding planning is fun.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Is it?

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
Some of these segues are rough, dude.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
When you wedding plan, you get to make a whole list

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
of all the people you've ever known in your entire life

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
and do nothing with the person you love,

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
but talk shit about all of them.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
It's almost worth getting married.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Even if you don't really love someone,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I recommend getting married,

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
because there's so much shit you could get to do.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Just like deciding, like, I don't know, these people.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
This is just a fun activity to just make a list of everyone

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
you've ever known in your whole life and be like, fuck them.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
That does have to be satisfying.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Then there's a bunch of shit I wrote while I was high

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
at Sarah Silverman's party.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
This is serious warning shit.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Well, this is symptomatic.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Oh, shit, what did I...

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I'm reading my Evernote notepad.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
This is when I was at a party of a friend of ours

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
on a rooftop overlooking Los Angeles.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
This is when I typed into my notepad.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
For you kids, should I get high, Dan?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I don't know. Do you want to think like this?

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm not cutting any corners.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm not sanding any edges.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
This is what I wrote.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Hydrophilic and hydrophobic.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Duality between being good at being between people

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
and being good at being between people and whatever is beyond.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
It should just say, don't smoke pot. This is a PSN.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Please read that again.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I want to try and make sense of it.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Hydrophilic and hydrophobic.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Duality between...

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
On board so far.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Being good at being between people.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I just left.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
I think I know what I meant. I can tell you what I meant.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
And being good at being...

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
So one side is being good at being between people.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
The other side is being good at being between people

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
and whatever is beyond.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh, you're a people person or not?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
You're either the membrane of a cell

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
or you're the endoplasmic reticulum.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
And you didn't feel like the membrane last night?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I was a membrane because I was out in the fucking rail.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I was looking out over at LA and I was like,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Yeah, entourage! What the fuck?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I don't know what happened to me.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
One of the guys from entourage was there.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Probably.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
No, he was. I saw him.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And you were there and I didn't see you.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
But a guy from Futurama...

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
We spoke for a while.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
I, earlier tonight, apologized to you for walking away from you

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
and you must have thought I was a crazy person

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
because you don't remember talking to me at all.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
There were people walking up to me all night.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I was up against the rail.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
There were people constantly walking up to me

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
and saying the nicest things to me

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
and I would talk for five minutes

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
and then they would go,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Okay, cool.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm going to go talk to Bill Maher.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I was Charles Manson at that party.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I was just...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm not bragging.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It didn't sound like a bragging.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I was Charles Manson.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I don't want to...

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I don't want to be horned, but...

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I may or may not have rallied some

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
profligate youth into a few homicidal sprees.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Here's the other paragraph I wrote.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And then I have a little birthday present for you.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I know it's not your birthday, but you're getting older,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
like all of us.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Is that the present?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
A reminder of mortality.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
This is the next paragraph I wrote.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Well, like the girl in the cold open of lethal weapon one,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I was like fucking over a rail

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
to the point where people were tweeting,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I think Dan Harmon is going to kill himself tonight.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm flattered.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I wrote this into my Evernote pad.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
A question of significance, period.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
A topographic map of significance, period.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Everything has an attribute, comma.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Every attribute is numerical.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
That means every society

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
has a weighted numerical amount of significance

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
and every element of that society is significant

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
to the extent that it affects the significance

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
of that society.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Good morning, sober Dan.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
You have one message from...

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Hi, Dan.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I gotta say, for some reason,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
that sounded racist to me.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Really? You think the bottom line of that is

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
don't trust black people?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
You're going to use that to justify some shit.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Alright, so I have a special present for you.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah, I know you love music.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah, I know you love... I know you love fame.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I love fame, I love music.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Those are my favorite things.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
I want you to tell me, Dan,

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
you can't have famous people at Harmontown.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Is it a show for famous people to come out?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
No, this isn't the show for famous people to come out.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Challenge me, challenge me.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
There's no way you have anybody huge on the show tonight.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Fuck you! Tenacious D, get out here!

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Can't you do the first part of it?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
No.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Can't you see he's the man?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Let me hear you applaud.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
He is more than the man.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
He's a shiny golden god.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
If you think it's time to fucking rock

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
and fucking roll out of control

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
well then you know you got to rock the block

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
you fucking suck, you fucking cock

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
cause when you rule, you fucking fool

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
all of them fools and other chews

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
cause if you think it's time to...

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
If you think it's time to...

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
If you think it's time to fucking rock

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
he is going to take your fucking ass

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
and you know his name is Hylgas

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
rocking and fucking rolling

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
and fucking rocking and fucking rolling

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
and fucking rolling and fucking rolling

12:14.000 --> 12:28.400
Jack Black and Kyle Gass, they're leaving. There's probably some stuff if

12:28.400 --> 12:32.440
your fans are there, you should probably, you might want to know about some

12:32.440 --> 12:37.720
stuff they're doing, I think, and I don't quite know what it is. Festival Supreme?

12:37.720 --> 12:41.400
Yeah, FestivalSupreme.com, they're doing this festival on October 25th,

12:41.400 --> 12:47.000
downtown LA, amazing people are on it, obviously those guys are on it, I'm on it,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.400
but like there's like huge, huge awesome people on it, and I kind of think of one

12:50.400 --> 12:53.960
person right now. Do you know when it is, how they can see it, what it is?

12:53.960 --> 12:59.520
October.com.org? It's October, I just said all that, but I'll say it again. I'm drunk.

12:59.520 --> 13:05.000
October, October 25th, go to FestivalSupreme.com, get tickets, it's

13:05.000 --> 13:10.800
downtown LA, it's a huge, huge amazing festival, like Fred Armisen's doing

13:10.800 --> 13:14.440
something, Bill Hader is doing something, the workaholics guys are gonna be there.

13:14.440 --> 13:28.280
Are you? I am, I'm gonna, yes, I will be there. We spoke last night, it's, I was this close to

13:28.280 --> 13:32.120
jumping down. You aren't, you didn't, you didn't really consider that. I can't think about it,

13:32.120 --> 13:37.800
sometimes. I did Bill Maher, I met Bill Maher last night, and I literally got

13:37.800 --> 13:43.440
tongue-tied. I, he said hi to me, and I couldn't get the words out, because I'm so

13:43.440 --> 13:46.680
scared of him. Because you, you were afraid you're gonna be like, you're fucking

13:46.680 --> 13:54.000
dick! No comment. I was just, I was just very intimidated. I admire him too. I,

13:54.000 --> 14:01.240
he's a very distinct face, and I saw Bill Maher hanging out. Yeah. And probably, he

14:01.240 --> 14:04.360
doesn't care that I mentioned that he was smoking a joint, like it was just

14:04.360 --> 14:09.000
a weird, it was just walking around a party. I was like, Bill Maher, it's like weird to see

14:09.000 --> 14:12.840
a famous face. Hey, Kumail, do you think, do you, would you liken me to like a

14:12.840 --> 14:16.840
star fucker? Do you, do you think? No dude. There's no stars, I mean ten

14:16.840 --> 14:20.160
nations need, that was a fucking food. Do you think that this show is suffering?

14:20.160 --> 14:25.080
Because it has celebrities? Is that what you think? No, no. So you just want to

14:25.080 --> 14:29.040
hang out and talk to me. You don't think that famous people coming up on the show

14:29.040 --> 14:33.600
is important? I think it really sells the show out, so I hope you have nobody else's

14:33.600 --> 14:39.960
famous people. Fuck you, Dana Carvey's here! Fuck you!

14:43.760 --> 14:57.440
Isn't that fucking special? Yeah! Could it be Satan, you bitches? I'm trying to get hip.

14:57.440 --> 15:01.720
Where do I sit? You sit anywhere you want. Well, there's a mic for every chair. Thank

15:01.720 --> 15:09.200
you very much. This is in the way. Anyway, thanks for coming. I, and Dan

15:09.200 --> 15:16.640
Harmon, thank you. Thank you. Kumail. This is, I just want, could we, could you guys

15:16.640 --> 15:21.120
get a little closer? Is there any way to get them a little closer? Because I don't

15:21.120 --> 15:25.320
feel as connected as I would within that far away. Is there any way to scooch up?

15:25.320 --> 15:28.960
Just a little bit? You're used to the SNL days where they were in a like a

15:28.960 --> 15:33.000
hyperbaric chamber. Yes, in L days. What are you saying, Dan? Orbiting a like space

15:33.000 --> 15:36.320
shuttle and then your stages would rotate. It was, it was nothing. You'd be

15:36.320 --> 15:40.440
sitting in a chair like this and then there'd be like five seconds and then

15:40.440 --> 15:43.480
the red light would come on and you knew there were 20 million people and the

15:43.480 --> 15:48.120
cue cards were not properly placed and you had to improvise. Are you nervous yet?

15:48.120 --> 15:55.360
What year did you start? 1947. How do I look this good?

15:55.360 --> 16:01.200
No, you look fucking great. I don't want to be that guy. I think I love you. No, I was 86. 86.

16:01.200 --> 16:06.360
So when I was, when I was a kid, when I talked to people, I've had, I've been

16:06.360 --> 16:10.440
fortunate enough to have a career path where I have friends who have written an

16:10.440 --> 16:16.640
SNL and have been an SNL. Yeah. And it's like, okay, institutional comedy is stupid

16:16.640 --> 16:20.280
and bullshit. Right. Why would, how could that ever be funny? Yes. And then at the

16:20.280 --> 16:23.200
same time, it's like, holy shit, I'm walking down the halls or there's a

16:23.200 --> 16:29.160
poster of, there's a John Belushi's headshot is on the wall, etc. And SNL

16:29.160 --> 16:32.320
has endured. It's the only comedic institution that we have in this

16:32.320 --> 16:35.920
country that's lasted as long as it has. Well, what I did does seem very old

16:35.920 --> 16:41.000
fashion now and it did become, when I did the show in 96 with Stephen Colbert and

16:41.000 --> 16:46.560
Steve Carell, you guys familiar? The Dana Carvey sketch show. By that point, we

16:46.560 --> 16:51.120
thought it, I discovered that it was really considered corny and hack to have

16:51.120 --> 16:55.560
a character with a catchphrase that you would repeat, you know, but they're hard

16:55.560 --> 17:00.400
to come by. I mean, well, isn't that special? My God. No, and you, yeah, once you

17:00.400 --> 17:04.880
fucking resonate, you don't, you don't back away from that. No, you, you, you, you

17:04.880 --> 17:11.560
are a people pleaser. Like you, I want to destroy the audience. I need to have, I

17:11.560 --> 17:16.040
need, you know, but condescension is still funny to me, even though the character

17:16.040 --> 17:20.720
is so hacky, a guy in drag and notice it was, you know, it was, I didn't have fake

17:20.720 --> 17:25.000
tits or anything. First of all, it's not hacky. It was very specific and it's, it's

17:25.000 --> 17:32.040
still very, very funny. Well, well, well, that's easy for you to say. My boner just

17:32.040 --> 17:40.000
started. Condescension is funny and she's the ultimate patronizing. It starts

17:40.000 --> 17:47.040
with we. We like ourselves. Don't we? We did a show called community. Now it's on a

17:47.040 --> 17:53.000
thing called, you know, it's just, it's a, it's a sausage factory that you can work

17:53.000 --> 17:57.880
through any attitude. I realized later that I am passive aggressive, a nice

17:57.880 --> 18:01.720
passive aggressive guy. And a lot of my characters were just passive aggressive,

18:01.720 --> 18:08.560
you know, so like, they're, they're, they're, explain how Hans and Franz are

18:08.560 --> 18:13.360
passive aggressive. Like, well, first of all, when we did them, you know, obviously

18:13.360 --> 18:16.840
it was born on Arnold and this and that Kevin and I were touring with Dennis

18:16.840 --> 18:22.560
Miller. So we saw Arnold on TV and we loved how he was, he always wins Arnold

18:22.560 --> 18:26.040
Schwarzenegger. Everything is organized. So this is what he said, you know, you're

18:26.040 --> 18:32.400
on the road and you get to a hotel. I'm just quoting. I know the voice is fun.

18:32.400 --> 18:37.520
I can do it. They're happy. I'm happy. All right. You do the stairs. You break a

18:37.520 --> 18:42.480
light sweat and you, you take a light shower and you put on a light white

18:42.480 --> 18:48.600
cotton shirt and, and you're ready for the evening. We thought that was so cool.

18:48.600 --> 18:52.160
We repeated it for weeks and weeks and then we came up with the sort of

18:52.160 --> 18:56.720
mentally deficient cousins. And when we first came out with the padding, the

18:56.720 --> 19:01.560
audience expected us to be super strong and lift up and they soon found out we

19:01.560 --> 19:05.680
were never going to lift weights. We were paranoid and delusional and we were

19:05.680 --> 19:09.320
fighting imaginary enemies. We were just stoked about fitness. Yeah, if you don't

19:09.320 --> 19:13.600
think, yeah, but we were, there was that imaginary enemy. If you doubt us, if you

19:13.600 --> 19:18.920
think that we are not properly pumped up men, we could, you know, stretch the

19:18.920 --> 19:24.120
flab of your back into the shape of a ladder and you could crawl back down in

19:24.120 --> 19:33.200
the sewer because that's where losers live. So that was the whole, so it had a

19:33.200 --> 19:37.760
cartoon artifice. I never connected the dot that the church lady and Hansen

19:37.760 --> 19:41.480
Frans, they're, that's the thing they have in common is that they're, they're

19:41.480 --> 19:46.640
inactive. They are passive aggressive. Yeah, and they, I am developing a

19:46.640 --> 19:52.000
church lady Hansen Frans cartoon adventure movie. I had a booze at Comic-Con and

19:52.000 --> 20:00.320
nothing. Camille, why so quiet? My teeth are vibrating from excitement. I fucking

20:00.320 --> 20:08.480
love you. Come here. Let me tell you, man. You are something very special, my

20:08.480 --> 20:15.880
friend. Yeah, so anyway, that was that. You're sitting over there with your thing.

20:15.880 --> 20:21.760
It's fun to do. Everyone does it. You're all, all of your impressions are, everyone

20:21.760 --> 20:26.200
flocks to do them. You're, no one knew how to do an impression of George Bush

20:26.200 --> 20:33.160
until you did it. I went to school the next day. I told you backstage like I, I

20:33.160 --> 20:40.240
was in sophomore year. I remember, I could tell you the color of the walls. I

20:40.240 --> 20:46.520
could tell you what was on the jockstraps on the floor when I gained respect from

20:46.520 --> 20:52.680
the guys that would have otherwise been beating me up because I did my huge

20:52.680 --> 20:57.800
air quotes. My impression of Jimmy Stewart. Oh, Jimmy Stewart. I thought you're

20:57.800 --> 21:03.200
going because I watched and you had done your as I and then the jocks would go

21:03.200 --> 21:06.720
like, Hey, Harmon, do do Jimmy Stewart. They don't know what Jimmy Stewart is. Neither

21:06.720 --> 21:13.240
did I. Right. I knew that you, but you've seen it's a wonderful life, right? No,

21:13.240 --> 21:23.200
no. Absolutely not. Can we hear your version? Oh, I can't get my locker open. How do you do yours?

21:23.200 --> 21:30.320
I worked that thing for 20 years. There's nothing funnier and a visceral comic sense

21:30.320 --> 21:38.840
than Jimmy Stewart swearing. So my first bit ever in the 70s in college, you know,

21:38.840 --> 21:44.840
doing stand up in these shit box clubs, something familiar. Anyway, I'm doing

21:44.840 --> 21:50.640
with him Shatner. Anyway, it was like Jimmy Stewart is a waiter. Yeah. Yeah. So do

21:50.640 --> 21:57.120
you know what you want to order? Because you want to go slow. Yeah. So you don't

21:57.120 --> 22:06.160
know what you want to order. So you're gonna, you're gonna make me wait. Well,

22:06.160 --> 22:15.360
fuck you. It's always funny, right? It's only funny when you do it. I mean, you did

22:15.360 --> 22:19.120
a million of those things and like we fucking stood on your shoulders. I would

22:19.120 --> 22:22.960
go to high school every day and I would be the funny guy in high school because

22:22.960 --> 22:28.360
I did impressions of your impressions. Well, I copied Jimmy Carter from Dan

22:28.360 --> 22:32.120
Eckroyd. I used to record it on the TV and stuff, but you know, because a lot of

22:32.120 --> 22:37.160
times I didn't have your relationship with SNL when you were like, how old were

22:37.160 --> 22:44.280
you in 1975? Was that when you didn't know basis? But I was. Don't ask, don't tell.

22:44.280 --> 22:53.240
Why is this white? I need some pepper. No, I was 20. So I was 21, 22, 23, 24,

22:53.240 --> 22:56.840
whatever. And it was this new show. It was a variety show for hippies. And they were

22:56.840 --> 23:02.000
badass pirates. To me, you know, John Belushi and Bill Murray and those guys,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.920
they would beat you up or make you laugh, you know? So I was completely in all of

23:06.920 --> 23:10.440
the show and I auditioned for it three times for you guys out there and women

23:10.440 --> 23:14.080
were trying to get on the show. Meaning that two times you went out there to

23:14.080 --> 23:18.320
New York, you stood on the stage in front of and I've talked to people. No. No,

23:18.320 --> 23:23.000
mine was one of the worst ever. Get this, okay? The comedy store. Saturday Night Live

23:23.000 --> 23:27.240
people are out there. It's like 84, two years before I got the show. One comic

23:27.240 --> 23:32.480
after another, no MC, just and now somebody from. So at midnight, this

23:32.480 --> 23:37.480
comedian named Sam Kenneson goes up in his prime, who I thought was maybe the

23:37.480 --> 23:41.480
best standup ever, arguably the best standup ever, destroys dismantles,

23:41.480 --> 23:45.960
levitates the room. I'm off the side and now it's Dana Flungam with somebody, you

23:45.960 --> 23:52.000
know, I go up and go in that festival, then that dead silence. I'll never be

23:52.000 --> 24:01.600
on Saturday Night Live. Isn't that special? Isn't that special? Isn't that special? I don't know.

24:01.600 --> 24:05.720
When are people going to realize how special everything is? In desperation, I went,

24:05.720 --> 24:14.360
well, fuck you. And I still didn't get the show. So I didn't, you know. So you

24:14.360 --> 24:17.880
stopped me in the middle of that, like you go out, when you auditioned for

24:17.880 --> 24:23.760
SNL, you go out to New York, you go out on a stage, there is absolutely no, from

24:23.760 --> 24:29.320
what I've heard, there are eight people sitting in the back of a dark room.

24:29.320 --> 24:34.720
They're instructed not to laugh. There are video cameras pointed at you

24:34.720 --> 24:39.320
everywhere and you know, because you've walked past the writer's room on your

24:39.320 --> 24:43.240
way to the audition, you fully know that there is a feed to the writer's room.

24:43.240 --> 24:49.800
You can see that there is a room full of sarcastic snarky writers who are

24:49.800 --> 24:55.400
watching every audition in their own room. You walk past that reality and walk

24:55.400 --> 25:00.160
out onto a dark stage under the thrust. And Lauren, I realized later, wanted to

25:00.160 --> 25:02.960
test you, because I'm bombing out there. I was doing Chomping Broccoli on the

25:02.960 --> 25:06.160
piano and doing these things. And then there was a pause. It was Lauren and like

25:06.160 --> 25:10.360
Nora Dunn and three other people. And Lauren said, oh, do you have anything else

25:10.360 --> 25:16.080
that we could see? Is there anything? Or are you just going to do that?

25:16.080 --> 25:19.920
And I realized, are you just going to keep chopping broccoli?

25:19.920 --> 25:24.280
Isn't the broccoli chopped at this point? At this point, I would think you could

25:24.280 --> 25:29.360
fucking chop broccoli. I'd say the broccoli would be diced at this point.

25:29.360 --> 25:33.000
So it's like, he was testing to see when the red light went on, if you wouldn't

25:33.000 --> 25:36.720
just go, you know. Meltdown, what do you mean by that though, really?

25:36.720 --> 25:40.680
Well, literally, well, the meltdown wouldn't be so much that you just cry and go off.

25:40.680 --> 25:44.240
But it would be that you would stumble bum, because they're flipping credit cards.

25:44.240 --> 25:49.240
He was betting for people who are good at auditioning, as opposed to people who

25:49.240 --> 25:53.160
could be part of a live show. Yeah, you know, the first three years, it's just

25:53.160 --> 25:57.200
ridiculous. I mean, you see how people go out there. You don't really know. It's

25:57.200 --> 26:00.680
in the cards. You don't know your lines. The show's under rehearse. You don't want

26:00.680 --> 26:03.680
to look like you're reading the cue card. So, like, if I was doing a scene with

26:03.680 --> 26:07.560
you, and it's like, hey, let's go get some milk. I know there's a card over there.

26:07.560 --> 26:12.080
So I didn't want to just do this split thing. God forbid. So I'd go, let's go

26:12.080 --> 26:15.760
for milk. And then I would kind of look over there for my next line, grab it, come

26:15.760 --> 26:20.360
back, you know. And Phil Hartman was the best at that. They were testing for

26:20.360 --> 26:24.360
that in the audition. No, well, let me back up one story that's a little

26:24.360 --> 26:27.720
interesting. So I auditioned at the comedy store in the Improv. I always

26:27.720 --> 26:32.440
bombed. I didn't get SNL. It came around again in 86. Rosie O'Donnell was playing

26:32.440 --> 26:36.720
Igby's on the West Side, 100 seat club, kind of like this, small. I called, I didn't

26:36.720 --> 26:40.520
know Rosie, but I said, can I go to, can I go there and audition for the show?

26:40.520 --> 26:45.040
Because Lauren Michaels was going to see me. So she allowed me to come in and do

26:45.040 --> 26:48.880
like 40 minutes in a room like this. And Lauren showed up. Remember, I'm not on

26:48.880 --> 26:55.400
TV. I'm scared. It's Saturday Night Live with Cher. And the president of the

26:55.400 --> 27:00.880
network at the time. So it's just like, I was just so scared and so nervous, but it

27:00.880 --> 27:04.480
was a regular audience like this. I did okay. That really helped me get the show.

27:04.480 --> 27:11.840
Did you talk to Cher? No, I never really liked her. So you probably don't have like

27:11.840 --> 27:16.240
a really good Cher impression. No, I never worked on Cher. Do you want to hear mine?

27:16.240 --> 27:25.720
Yeah. I don't know. I like it. It's based on someone else's half-breed. Oh, yeah.

27:25.720 --> 27:38.160
You can't have a Cher impression without Christmas lights. How about Jimmy Stewart explains the

27:38.160 --> 27:43.400
banking crisis? Because all I ever knew about banking was from It's a Wonderful Life. Mr. Potter,

27:43.400 --> 27:47.840
there's a run on the bank, you know, kind of thing. So here's what they did. You see,

27:47.840 --> 27:53.880
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, they took the bad mortgages and they packaged them into

27:53.880 --> 28:01.080
an investment vehicle, kind of like a security set. Then they got moody to put four stars

28:01.080 --> 28:07.640
on them, an S&P, you know, and they sold them to investors, but they knew they were bad.

28:07.640 --> 28:11.920
So they did a thing, they shorted them, so they bet against them while they sold them.

28:11.920 --> 28:19.000
So if they lose, they win. If they win, they win. And you all put together, well, fuck

28:19.000 --> 28:29.840
you. Okay, now, this is the first time I've understood the housing crisis. I never fucking

28:29.840 --> 28:35.600
paid attention. You know what? Now I'm like, those fuckers. It really is kind of that simple.

28:35.600 --> 28:40.520
It feels like you're in a taking request mode. So I'll do and say whatever. I'm not going

28:40.520 --> 28:44.840
to make you do anything. I'll do and say whatever. But I would only say that it would be interesting

28:44.840 --> 28:52.920
to hear what would happen if Ted Kennedy... Ted Kennedy! When I returned, Mary Jo and

28:52.920 --> 29:02.360
the call were gone. If Ted Kennedy got into a hotel room and found out that Kirk Douglas

29:02.360 --> 29:08.600
had the same hotel room and that they, because they both, the hotel was overbooked. Can I

29:08.600 --> 29:13.240
do it with Burt Lancaster? Okay, right. Burt Lancaster is there too. I did a movie with

29:13.240 --> 29:19.120
Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. Years later, I learned to do them and I don't really like

29:19.120 --> 29:25.880
blue humor in the sense of anal penetration and cheese. Okay, I hate that. But I like

29:25.880 --> 29:31.080
the old fashioned vernacular applied to sexual situations. So this is Burt Lancaster and Kirk

29:31.080 --> 29:37.520
Douglas two male macho superstar icons as lovers. Here we go. This is what made John

29:37.520 --> 29:45.280
Lovitz throw up in a parking lot. You mean because he was laughing so hard. Not to pat

29:45.280 --> 29:50.160
yourself on the back, but John Lovitz... John loves this. John's Burt Lancaster, Kirk

29:50.160 --> 29:57.720
Douglas. I want you. I want you very bad. It doesn't mean we're gay. We're two men having

29:57.720 --> 30:16.680
fun. I'm inside you now. I want you inside me and I need you. I want all of it. I don't

30:16.680 --> 30:24.840
want just his stem. I don't want it all. All right, son, slow down. Don't keep bucking

30:24.840 --> 30:29.400
around like that. You keep bucking around like that. I got to pull out and splooge all over

30:29.400 --> 30:45.120
your backside. It's the poetry. Can't do this on Fallon. I love Jimmy though. You did chopping

30:45.120 --> 30:50.320
broccoli on Fallon and fucking everyone went wild because chopping broccoli is the comedic

30:50.320 --> 30:57.040
version of Dancing in the Dark. You're the Bruce Springsteen of comedy. It was Jimmy's

30:57.040 --> 31:00.920
idea to do it with an orchestra this last time. I don't know if you saw it, but I only

31:00.920 --> 31:05.680
did it once on SNL and I did it the very first show right before the end. You did it in your

31:05.680 --> 31:11.760
stand-up special, right? That's what I find special. Yeah, but I only did it once on SNL.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.840
I don't know why I resonate. It's so stupid. I think there's a ton of people in this audience

31:15.840 --> 31:19.600
probably. I think the median age is probably 25 and I think that probably without doing

31:19.600 --> 31:24.280
a lot of math, I think that puts them around the age. When I was 10 years old, Martin Short

31:24.280 --> 31:28.520
was like, yeah, that's how I learned about comedy. I think the irony is that actually

31:28.520 --> 31:33.640
in SNL terms, Lauren Michaels wasn't even there. Those were the Embersol years. No,

31:33.640 --> 31:36.840
not that year. I love the Martin Short. But I was like, holy shit, Martin Short is the

31:36.840 --> 31:41.920
fucking, and I would just go to grade school and I would do. At Grimly? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

31:41.920 --> 31:46.520
And I would do everything that Martin Short did. That's, and my hackness extended to high

31:46.520 --> 31:51.040
school. I was still, then I was doing you. I was going, oh, I'm going to be in a store.

31:51.040 --> 31:56.680
Can I go? Can I be on a date with you? Not going to do it. I'm not going to drive at this

31:56.680 --> 32:01.080
juncture. Will you be on a date with me? And it was all you. Did you do John Travolta or

32:01.080 --> 32:06.080
Robin Leach? Did you do some of the other stuff? I'm Robin. Did you do John Travolta?

32:06.080 --> 32:14.280
They're all kind of. I want a Christmas tree with lights. I'm Robin Leach and I'm yelling

32:14.280 --> 32:22.280
and I don't know why. Now, that is really an 80s reference. I'm Robin Leach and I was

32:22.280 --> 32:28.920
one of a life and I'm going to pump you up. I would just do that. It's very good. Let

32:28.920 --> 32:34.000
me tell you, this is Regis Filbert. I'm 87 years old, baby. I love Regis. I love what

32:34.000 --> 32:39.440
you have going on here, Dad Slavitt or whatever your name is, Daddy Flopla. And Farnel, you're

32:39.440 --> 32:46.120
terrific. Farnel! When you get your green card, you can call me. You're terrific. Anyway,

32:46.120 --> 32:50.880
I love you all. You're cover card people. It's a wonderful rhythm to do. You just,

32:50.880 --> 32:55.800
you take Groucho Marx and slow it down, you know? Pick a singer what and divide it up

32:55.800 --> 33:00.520
on you. Pick a singer what and divide it up on you. Pick a singer what and divide it up

33:00.520 --> 33:06.520
on you. He's doing Groucho with a nasal a little bit faster. So, hopefully kids are

33:06.520 --> 33:13.640
enjoying these. Got it. Got it. Do it. I don't want to keep you.

33:13.640 --> 33:18.240
Mine are great. Mine are great. Can I ask you a question? When did you know you could

33:18.240 --> 33:22.240
do Impressions? I feel like there's a certain, certain people are just good at them and certain

33:22.240 --> 33:26.160
people are just bad at them and in the good part, obviously some people are better than

33:26.160 --> 33:29.040
others. You're fantastic. When did you realize you could do that?

33:29.040 --> 33:35.160
That I could alter my voice. Literally, really, it was when we had a, the Beatles came on

33:35.160 --> 33:40.320
Ed Sullivan. I was nine years old and we had a Collier's Encyclopedia LP where the Beatles

33:40.320 --> 33:44.520
were being interviewed. So, the first altering of my voice when I was nine years old, and

33:44.520 --> 33:48.800
I had three older brothers and a younger sister, was I was able, I was able, you know, and

33:48.800 --> 33:53.360
I'll do, I'll do the bit, you know, it's like I go out to my mom, you know, after the Beatles

33:53.360 --> 33:57.360
are on, I go, you, hello mom, do you think I could get me some pancakes?

33:57.360 --> 34:02.160
It's like a very musical. Yeah. So, that was the first voice.

34:02.160 --> 34:07.280
You've been getting fucking pancakes ever since. And it's still, you know, I do these

34:07.280 --> 34:14.760
for myself sometimes. I mean, it's very comforting to be in this persona, you know. Here we are,

34:14.760 --> 34:22.000
you have a little gooby-gooby. I mean, it's, it's very, because McCartney is the most humble

34:22.000 --> 34:27.440
genius in the world, you know, he won't go, you go, Paul, I just want to say, you know,

34:27.440 --> 34:34.080
I, you know, we did some plunkers, you know, John would get a guitar and we'd face each

34:34.080 --> 34:38.840
other and we're plunking, you know, and I'm looking at him, he's looking at me and we're

34:38.840 --> 34:48.360
plunking away. And that's how we came up with Abbey Rose, but it's a comfortable, yeah.

34:48.360 --> 34:53.920
And I do it for myself. This is not a joke. George Bush Sr., that robotic, monosyllabic

34:53.920 --> 34:59.840
thing is comforting for me because I tend to, tend toward anxiety. But like I, he would

34:59.840 --> 35:08.480
say, he'd go, well, Camille, there, sidekick, nice mic, quick-witted audience there, just

35:08.480 --> 35:24.040
sodas, comic area, Dan Harmon, writer, superb, community, yahoo, money. It's just, we can

35:24.040 --> 35:27.280
just say thank you, Dana Carby for coming, or you can hang out all night as far as I'm

35:27.280 --> 35:31.040
concerned, but. Probably have peaked already, but I, do they have any requests? I'll do

35:31.040 --> 35:37.240
one more. Oh, okay. He's taking requests. Well, well, well, we raised our hand very

35:37.240 --> 35:50.240
quickly. Oh, Garth, yeah. Well, I'll tell you quickly. Garth, Mike, the brilliant Mike

35:50.240 --> 35:54.320
Myers came in with, with Wayne and then he asked me to be a sidekick. He said his name

35:54.320 --> 36:00.800
is Garth. That's what he, and he digs Wayne. And I saw, I saw he had brown hair. So I remember,

36:00.800 --> 36:06.640
I went to the makeup area and I saw I could do a blonde wig and I could wear those kind

36:06.640 --> 36:12.000
of Peter Seller glasses. And then I didn't really have a construct for the surfer dude

36:12.000 --> 36:16.400
nerd, like, what are you doing? You know, that kind of thing, which is, we'll do it,

36:16.400 --> 36:22.360
how I ruin Wayne's World 2, we can do next time. But, by bad makeup and pushing too hard,

36:22.360 --> 36:28.120
yeah. I'll tell you. Did you produce Wayne's World 2? Do you, why would you take, why would

36:28.120 --> 36:34.200
you feel guilty? Well, I was 38 and there was a line in the, in the movie that Garth

36:34.200 --> 36:40.360
just, Garth just got pukes, you know. So, and I'm 38 playing the character. And so the

36:40.360 --> 36:44.440
edict was we got to cover my five o'clock shadow. I'm not Richard Nixon, but if you

36:44.440 --> 36:49.720
watch the first movie, I had very light makeup. So they tried to cover my five o'clock shadow.

36:49.720 --> 36:54.480
By the time they did that, then they caked it on. So I'm, I look orange, I look like

36:54.480 --> 36:59.520
an orange Betty Davis in the second movie. And then my performance. But anyway, but what

36:59.520 --> 37:06.200
does that have to do with you? This is what's fascinating to me about you, your self-afacement,

37:06.200 --> 37:12.200
your self-awareness, your accountability in the face of being a fucking icon who is this

37:12.200 --> 37:17.960
guy who doesn't like, like I, Jim Carrey hasn't come out here yet. But I think, I think there's

37:17.960 --> 37:21.840
a kind of archetype that we have in our heads. We're like, Oh, this guy that comes out and

37:21.840 --> 37:28.840
makes everybody happy is this clown. But you're so smart and so humble and so almost to the

37:28.840 --> 37:32.800
point of like, do you say stuff like that? No, there was really good stuff that I liked

37:32.800 --> 37:37.520
that I did here and there, but most of it was disappointing. How could that possibly be

37:37.520 --> 37:42.320
your fault? What, what, what, what, what, what was your role in Wayne's World too? Aside

37:42.320 --> 37:46.120
from Karth, your job was to show up and play Karth. Look, in the first movie, I mean, I

37:46.120 --> 37:50.360
did, I trusted the rhythm in the first movie based on my brother, my brother, Brad, who

37:50.360 --> 37:55.840
does, I took the rhythm from my brother. We could, he would love to come on this podcast.

37:55.840 --> 38:01.000
He's an LA. He's welcome to, he's great. And he had this rhythm and this was the best

38:01.000 --> 38:09.680
rhythm of Garth. That was the goal. And I did it mostly in the first movie. And then

38:09.680 --> 38:14.000
the second movie, you know, it just became more cartoony. And I just lost that thread

38:14.000 --> 38:21.000
and I was pushing and you blame yourself for fucking Wayne's World too. I do. I fucked

38:21.000 --> 38:28.640
Wayne's World too. You're insane. I am orange. I am orange and I'm pushing and I'm mugging.

38:28.640 --> 38:34.400
But in the first movie, I had some very nice moments where I stayed in this rhythm. I did.

38:34.400 --> 38:38.640
This was the core of Garth and I look at it and I go, what the fuck happened to me that

38:38.640 --> 38:46.120
I pushed in the second movie? Maybe it was the money. I know you said in the green room

38:46.120 --> 38:59.120
you're sleepy. Can we stay for just a little bit? Sure. Yeah. Can I bring my, from Hollywood,

38:59.120 --> 39:06.800
California, Meltdown Comics, Harmontown. Jeff, Jeff, now it's session. Please welcome to

39:06.800 --> 39:16.800
the stage the mayor of Harmontown. It's Dan Harmon. Jeff. Let's start this fucker.

39:16.800 --> 39:23.480
Jeff, I imagine you driving here, reading Twitter and being like, what the fuck is going

39:23.480 --> 39:31.800
on? Tenacious D? Dana Carvey? Tenacious D with her? Oh shit, Dana Carvey. Hello. Jeff,

39:31.800 --> 39:37.080
we started without you. Now, what I was going to say is. I overslept. I set my alarm for

39:37.080 --> 39:45.080
the wrong. I set my alarm for AM instead of PM. It happens to podcasters too. It's okay.

39:45.080 --> 39:50.080
You're not taking blame for that and he's blaming himself for Wings World II. That's why I wanted

39:50.080 --> 39:58.800
to bring up my fiance, my 29 year old fiance, Erin McGathy, so that she could talk to. Before

39:58.800 --> 40:06.440
you leave, Dana, I wanted you to talk to the love of my life because that's insane hearing

40:06.440 --> 40:13.320
that. Your self-deprecation, it's too far. It's too much. There was good things I did.

40:13.320 --> 40:19.920
That just bald-faced fact that I destroyed Wings World II. Listen, here's the example.

40:19.920 --> 40:24.200
This is not my fault. Is this what Mike Myers has been telling you, Dana? Yeah, does he

40:24.200 --> 40:31.400
call you and leave faster? Don't let him push you around. No, Mike was consistent. Here's

40:31.400 --> 40:35.240
the story. Okay, look, if you budget something, they're going to spend the budget. So the

40:35.240 --> 40:40.680
first movie, we had 12 million in 36 days. So we're on the car and he goes, yes, she's

40:40.680 --> 40:47.120
a babe. And I go, yeah, if she was a president, she'd be Abraham Lincoln, right? So we make

40:47.120 --> 40:52.200
fun of corporate profiteering. We hold up the stuff. Meanwhile, heroin's paying us.

40:52.200 --> 40:58.120
Never mind. The second movie, we have a $40 million budget. And so Wayne and Garth suddenly

40:58.120 --> 41:04.200
have a loft that is a $500,000 a lot. I remember walking into it and go, what? What happened

41:04.200 --> 41:10.560
to the humble little set? Did everything got blown up? Did you write the movie? I basically,

41:10.560 --> 41:16.240
and another thing I regret, I did the arc with Kim Basinger. I did the- Yeah, but you

41:16.240 --> 41:22.640
did you rate the movie? Not the movie per se, but the Garth parts for the most part. Dana

41:22.640 --> 41:30.080
Carvey, what? You have never done anything wrong ever. Oh no. You need to understand

41:30.080 --> 41:36.000
that. You need to understand that you have never done anything wrong. No, the first one

41:36.000 --> 41:42.160
was really good. I mean, it did inflation adjusted like $275 million. I'm not that I

41:42.160 --> 41:48.120
checked. So Dana Carvey. Inflation adjusted. Dana Carvey, why do you think- Can we talk

41:48.120 --> 41:56.520
Dana? No, Dana Carvey. Dana Carvey. Why? Yes. What was it? So you went in, why did

41:56.520 --> 42:01.400
it feel different making that movie? You said it's a bigger budget? It was a bigger budget.

42:01.400 --> 42:10.760
My face was orange. I think that, look, the first time we were on the car, we had an hour

42:10.760 --> 42:15.040
to shoot that. You know, Babe Abraham Lincoln, Mike's laughing, I'm laughing. It's just like,

42:15.040 --> 42:20.960
you know, almost in one take. Then the second time, we had two full days to shoot us hanging

42:20.960 --> 42:28.040
out on the car with like 55 takes of different camera angles. So you tend to get bored and

42:28.040 --> 42:31.600
you tend to push, you know? I mean, that's all. That just happened to me. Are you looking

42:31.600 --> 42:35.240
back on Wayne's World 2 as being some kind of point where you think- Are you thinking

42:35.240 --> 42:38.040
that you did something wrong on that movie? No, no, I don't think I did anything wrong.

42:38.040 --> 42:42.280
I just, I did, my instincts were a little off on that one, but they were spot on in

42:42.280 --> 42:46.040
the first one. So one out of two ain't bad. May I, I can't- Is this gonna, I have to

42:46.040 --> 42:50.680
apologize. No, no, no, I think it's important to have a conversation. We've never- Well,

42:50.680 --> 42:56.960
there's many, many other regrets I have. So, emotionally. What's, what's that, Baby?

42:56.960 --> 43:05.080
I can't handle this show emotionally. I'm losing my fucking mind. I like, I, my hero,

43:05.080 --> 43:12.240
I, I just, uh, I can't deal. She loves Mike Myers. I, I do too. Her story, she loves

43:12.240 --> 43:18.200
Kurt Lancaster. Um, such a thrill. I have had the opportunity to meet many famous people.

43:18.200 --> 43:26.080
I can't, so. Um, they were, I, I'm not completely, it's not like, uh- I will start crying. There

43:26.080 --> 43:30.600
was stuff that I liked. I mean, I love, uh, Massive Heaven when Harry, I love the McLaughlin

43:30.600 --> 43:35.400
reports. I love the Carson's I did with Phil. Uh, there's a lot of stuff I, I did like,

43:35.400 --> 43:39.080
and I liked the First Wayne's World, but second one, I fucked it. I feel- I, when I was in

43:39.080 --> 43:47.120
high school. Uh-oh. Dana, you know, backstage, I told you, I, I really like you, and I said

43:47.120 --> 43:51.000
the words, I don't care about how you feel about this emotionally. I don't, I know that

43:51.000 --> 43:59.840
I'm embarrassing you, but I like you so much. Um. Thank you. You talked to my woman backstage.

43:59.840 --> 44:04.520
I don't want to drill the conversation. Please say you wrote a song. I really want you to

44:04.520 --> 44:13.040
break the song. I, uh, when I was in high school, I had a, a Yahoo email account, and

44:13.040 --> 44:20.320
after speaking with Dana. You had email on high school? I did. Wow. She's a lot younger.

44:20.320 --> 44:29.400
And I told Dana backstage that when, when his first HBO special came out in 1995, yeah,

44:29.400 --> 44:37.480
I recorded it with my little, uh, uh, tape player. Kids, there used to be these boxes

44:37.480 --> 44:43.640
with tape inside them. I recorded it and me and my brother both had copies of it. And

44:43.640 --> 44:48.160
when we would walk to school, we would look at each other for two years. We would look

44:48.160 --> 44:52.280
at each other and be like, and go. And we would listen to Dana Carvey's special on

44:52.280 --> 44:57.040
the way to school together. And I went to, I was like, I feel like I may have written

44:57.040 --> 45:05.560
a, uh, diary. That all that makes me feel is like, I wish I tried harder. I think you

45:05.560 --> 45:12.760
tried really hard. I don't know what, if she's chewing something up, I, I don't want to derail

45:12.760 --> 45:17.200
her, but I, I, the, the overwhelming feeling I have when I hear you talk about yourself

45:17.200 --> 45:20.320
because I don't think you're fishing for it. I think you're a guy that works really,

45:20.320 --> 45:23.720
really hard from it. Cause we didn't even talk about the fact that you were on this

45:23.720 --> 45:29.400
Meg Ryan sitcom when you were like, like our, our public consciousness of you was like,

45:29.400 --> 45:34.480
oh, you were on SNL and then you were in SNL and then there were our radar blips and stuff.

45:34.480 --> 45:39.800
But the, you were, you worked your entire life. You tried to make people laugh the entire

45:39.800 --> 45:44.640
time and you never stopped. And I don't, I think that there's a million people that

45:44.640 --> 45:50.560
we look at publicly and we go, uh, oh, that guy, uh, he thought he was something and then

45:50.560 --> 45:54.720
that's why he did this. I think it was like, like you were church lady and you were Hans

45:54.720 --> 45:59.880
and Franz and you were doing the shit. And then everyone loved you. America loved you.

45:59.880 --> 46:03.000
And then there were a couple of movies where you were like with Nicholas Cage and you were

46:03.000 --> 46:10.480
going, Hey, I'm a cat burglar. And it was, it was, is it blank slate? Trapped in paradise.

46:10.480 --> 46:15.960
Yeah. That movie's awesome. Clean slate is a fucking great movie. Oh man. Well, I won't

46:15.960 --> 46:21.480
even go to there. But the idea that you're responsible for range world two, not being

46:21.480 --> 46:25.680
as good as one is it's fucking insane to me. That's so insane. It wasn't totally mine.

46:25.680 --> 46:29.640
I just was disappointed in my instincts. But what happened to me is I did not, I grew up

46:29.640 --> 46:35.000
very humble, uh, you know, uh, dad was a high school teacher, uh, five kids. So between

46:35.000 --> 46:40.200
80 and 86, when I was doing standup, I took everything they gave me and because I had

46:40.200 --> 46:44.520
the reverse dumb blonde effect, like I had a little teen idol thing going. I had blonde

46:44.520 --> 46:51.600
hair and I had a real baby face. So no one thought I was a con. Take it. Take it. No

46:51.600 --> 46:56.280
one thought I was a calm. Yeah. I don't like where I'm sitting either. A piece of bubblegum

46:56.280 --> 47:00.960
that can make children. But that's why I did all those straight roles. Although I will

47:00.960 --> 47:06.680
say if I'm going to lose my fiance to anybody, I would like it to be Janet Carmen. Can we

47:06.680 --> 47:12.680
hear this? Is this real? It's real. It's real. It's from my fan fiction. What is this? This

47:12.680 --> 47:18.400
is, uh, with my Yahoo mail account. I would email myself and you guys have done this before.

47:18.400 --> 47:24.080
I like sit yourself. There's no need for you to shake your head. So aggressively, not really

47:24.080 --> 47:28.280
looking for people like you. I'm looking for other people that are like, yes, I don't need

47:28.280 --> 47:36.160
you to say no. I'm glad, I'm glad they're getting married because I have, I've just kind

47:36.160 --> 47:43.760
of got to know this dynamic and it seems like perfection. I do love you immediately jumped

47:43.760 --> 47:48.960
into couples counseling us upon meeting us after 30 seconds. Stubbornness is the key

47:48.960 --> 47:53.040
to a long relationship. But both are stubborn. I hate you. You hate me, but I ain't quitting

47:53.040 --> 48:00.240
you. I, uh, with my Yahoo mail account, and I still do this with my current account, I'll

48:00.240 --> 48:06.360
mail myself, uh, diary entries basically. It just like, I'm angry about this thing. I

48:06.360 --> 48:10.600
like this thing, but I, I, I had a feeling that maybe I talked about Dana Carvey in one

48:10.600 --> 48:18.040
of these entries and I searched his name and my Yahoo mail and an email came up and, uh,

48:18.040 --> 48:23.960
it's very short and I would like to read it. So this is you as a teenager. This is me.

48:23.960 --> 48:28.360
Uh, it's, it's, I feel like this is your life or something. I'm, this is embarrassing. Go

48:28.360 --> 48:34.360
ahead. I want to hear it. Yeah. This is you at what age do you think? Uh, 2001. So, six.

48:34.360 --> 48:42.240
So, 13 years ago. 16. But six years after the special. Yes. So you weren't old enough

48:42.240 --> 48:50.320
to do anything when 9-11 happened. Hey, none of us were. That's true. Everything changed.

48:50.320 --> 48:59.480
That's true. Good point, Camille. We were all children before then. We all, we were all 16.

48:59.480 --> 49:12.280
America was 16. Yeah. We were only 16. All right. Read it. Read it. Okay. All right. What,

49:12.280 --> 49:20.000
what the fuck? Oh, it's my heart playing. Okay. I'm just, I, I'm gonna read it. I'm gonna read it.

49:20.000 --> 49:28.680
And I would only feel comfortable reading this on stage. With Dana Carvey. Subject Dana Carvey.

49:28.680 --> 49:34.760
Subject Dana Carvey. It's my fiancé. I'm not going to, I'm just gonna read, I'm saying this to

49:34.760 --> 49:38.360
myself because I'm going to read through this and I'm not going to editorialize because I will

49:38.360 --> 49:44.600
feel compelled to do so because I don't think I sound very smart. Just, just present it and we'll,

49:44.600 --> 49:55.240
we'll judge it. Okay. That's a tradition as old as time. There, I'm, I'm told this moment I haven't

49:55.240 --> 49:59.320
really felt that we were friends, but in this moment I feel like we are friends. Just read it. It's

49:59.320 --> 50:02.960
gonna be very sweet. I'm very excited. It's very short. Okay. I'm very excited. Hello, older me.

50:02.960 --> 50:15.800
Oh God. How are you? I'm okay, but I'm working, I'm working thought things. Can I judge you right

50:15.800 --> 50:24.520
now? No. It's very short. Here is personal and real thought. To be an artist. To be a comedic

50:24.520 --> 50:36.640
artist in all caps. To mold, to mold thine artifice like clay to the noble end of create joy. To

50:36.640 --> 50:42.080
exhibit kindness and performance absent of personal need. To be a clown, but not because you're

50:42.080 --> 50:49.440
scarier, stupid, but because you sacrifice your pride for the audience's joy. To make people laugh

50:49.440 --> 50:56.560
in all caps. This is what I, this is what is important. This is what I aspire to. This is what

50:56.560 --> 51:04.480
I promise. That's it. And it's about Dana Carby. By the way, Dana Carby. That's a hand for

51:04.480 --> 51:18.120
Dana Carby for coming out. Please let him know when you see him on the sidewalk that nothing bad

51:18.120 --> 51:24.600
was ever his fault. All he ever wanted to do is make everyone happy. That's all he ever wanted.

51:24.600 --> 51:33.760
I think he succeeded. So you, so that email, that email was about, you wrote that about Dana

51:33.760 --> 51:40.600
Carby. Yeah. You must not have seen Wayne's World too. You know, he really fucked that movie up.

51:40.600 --> 51:49.680
Oh God. Now that he's gone, holy shit. I blame it all on Garth. Yeah. Wayne's World P.U., right?

51:49.680 --> 51:57.280
I just wish it was Wayne's World. And there was, well it was Wayne's World, but I mean, I, I just

51:57.280 --> 52:04.360
wanted more Wayne and less Garth. Let's bring up Tenacious D. No, they're not, okay. I gotta say,

52:04.360 --> 52:12.000
honestly. Jeff is, Jeff is, Jeff, you, you, you realize you got here late. We started the show

52:12.000 --> 52:16.600
without you. As far as I'm concerned. As far as I'm concerned, the show started the moment I arrived.

52:16.600 --> 52:25.920
Right? That is not true. Tenacious D was here. Fuck Tenacious D. They left. It's all honestly

52:25.920 --> 52:31.440
very inspiring to hear him talk like that, being as, you know, done so much amazing stuff as he

52:31.440 --> 52:37.320
has. He still has. I fucking love that guy so much. I, I, I, it's not, it's like, we had, you know,

52:37.320 --> 52:41.120
I don't know, people come traipsing out here. Wait, is there music playing? Yeah, there's music

52:41.120 --> 52:49.160
playing. Are you still at home, Jeff? I had a great nap. I, I'm in such a euphoric state. I thought

52:49.160 --> 52:57.840
that was just in my head. For real. There is no, like, it's, it's a, it's a really big deal. Yeah,

52:57.840 --> 53:03.400
it's huge for me. I don't think, like Martin's short, if Martin's short, we're ever to come by.

53:03.400 --> 53:09.480
Fuck Martin's short. I think I would, I would, I would, I would go into a seizure because I

53:09.480 --> 53:14.640
wouldn't really quite know how to handle it. But, but, but like Dana, Dana Carvey represents, like,

53:14.640 --> 53:20.600
for me, my adolescent years, represents the idea that we've all had, that all we want to do when we

53:20.600 --> 53:27.240
get up in the morning, if there's those of us who decide, I just want to write, do makeup, make

53:27.240 --> 53:33.720
chairs, build, build decks, design dump trucks, act, stunt coordinate, whatever. I want to make other

53:33.720 --> 53:38.720
people happy. And, and, and all of a sudden, to make so many people laugh without hurting anybody.

53:38.720 --> 53:45.160
Right. He's not a coomail, as they say in the bed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Coomail. Coomail makes

53:45.160 --> 53:50.920
people laugh. Yes. But at what price? Yeah. He's fucking, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sharp sword.

53:50.920 --> 53:57.320
Yeah. It's the self-esteem of others is the price. Yeah. I take no prisoners. Coomail's material is

53:57.320 --> 54:02.600
like, my first album is called Fuck You. I feel like when I'm laughing at Coomail, I'm laughing at,

54:02.600 --> 54:08.400
like, I'm laughing out of fear. I'm laughing at cripples when I'm laughing at Coomail. Yeah. Like,

54:08.400 --> 54:14.040
I'm like, no, I hope Coomail doesn't beat me up. That's a big target for me. I really take on the

54:14.040 --> 54:25.520
cripples. Is cripples still PC? No. No. Listen to the word. I would say, I would say that you're

54:25.520 --> 54:35.240
tough, but fair on cripples. Hey, cripple, but cripple just means your leg is hurt. It does. It

54:35.240 --> 54:41.520
does. And my best friends in the audience, she's a cripple, Kimber Hall. She's a cripple. Share

54:41.520 --> 54:48.360
her leg is hurt. Well, she, she, she sprained her ankle partying. She's a cripple. Yeah. You gotta get

54:48.360 --> 54:53.840
on your knees and say you're a midget. Wait, there's crutches, there's crutches on the side of the

54:53.840 --> 54:58.600
wall here. Yeah. No, but do people identify themselves as so cripple? I'm sorry. So I don't

54:58.600 --> 55:06.400
think anybody's a PC cripple. Kimber, are you a cripple? She's not. No one would call and be like,

55:06.400 --> 55:12.840
Hey, do you have an elevator? I'm a cripple. Nobody would say that. But you would say, I'm

55:12.840 --> 55:20.520
crippled. No, I'm just, but even if your leg is hurt. Okay, here's my question. If your leg is

55:20.520 --> 55:27.320
broken, you don't say I'm disabled. You say I'm crippled. No, not anymore. All right, well, it's

55:27.320 --> 55:33.160
like midget. It was, it was okay for a while. And then it got sideline. Like, you know, crippled

55:33.160 --> 55:38.920
became disabled. We all learned some fun. That guy's leaving. But we know it's not because he's

55:38.920 --> 55:43.780
offended because he's walking out. He's not lending away. He's like, he's he's able. He's able

55:43.780 --> 55:51.560
bodied. He's showing off. Let's bring up professional linguist and physical ability expert, Spencer

55:51.560 --> 56:09.160
Clinton. Hey, guys. Hey, Spencer. You're probably the youngest guy up here. Do you what's your

56:09.160 --> 56:15.520
relationship with Dana Carvey? I don't know him. I mean, he was in the he was in the back room for

56:15.520 --> 56:21.560
a while. I said a couple of words to him. Jesus. He's a Spencer. Can you talk to me about I've

56:22.080 --> 56:30.760
felt obviously that I am mistaken with my use of the word cripple. But like, can you explain to

56:30.760 --> 56:36.840
me? What is the right thing? Is it just disabled and not but you because people I guess call people

56:36.840 --> 56:42.640
who are in wheelchairs crippled and that's inappropriate. Well, the best way it's yeah, it's

56:42.640 --> 56:48.360
across the line now. It was like a Charles Dickens thing. Well, it was. Yeah, it was a Charles

56:48.360 --> 56:55.560
Dickens thing. But that was a long time ago. If you live in 1809, like the society for the

56:55.560 --> 57:01.640
advancement of handicapped people is not the name for the society. I'm trying to talk about that

57:01.640 --> 57:07.200
I'm trying to talk about. I'm still trying to talk about it. It used to be called like the

57:07.200 --> 57:12.800
International Society for Cripples and they changed it. Like I say it definitely used to be like

57:12.800 --> 57:18.520
that. I would never call especially abled person different differently abled differently abled.

57:18.520 --> 57:18.840
Yeah.

57:22.880 --> 57:26.720
And the last and the last person to be put to task for this and I have I was obviously have made

57:26.720 --> 57:32.280
myself a target. We keep moving the we keep moving the goalpost and I think we do it because we do

57:32.280 --> 57:37.560
it for the best reasons in the world. We are all against as human beings, we're all against

57:37.560 --> 57:43.480
dehumanization. So the minute that we come up with a word that can sum up anybody, and people

57:43.480 --> 57:50.080
start to use it to refer to people like as a group as an object, then we start to get uncomfortable.

57:50.080 --> 57:53.280
So we move the goalpost and we go like let's let's shake things up.

57:53.880 --> 57:59.440
Absolutely. I'm an idiot. I thought that cripple just referred to like when you can't move it is

57:59.440 --> 58:06.000
temporarily than you're crippled. That's not the problem that is differently about fashion versus

58:06.000 --> 58:10.440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry everybody. The word retarded was fine for a long time. It's also

58:10.440 --> 58:15.320
technically accurate. It's just not the right one to use the National Association for the

58:15.320 --> 58:21.080
advancement of colored people. My grandma calls black people colored people that to the extent

58:21.080 --> 58:26.320
that the the the that there is a institution, institutions move more slowly. You can't what

58:26.320 --> 58:32.400
are you going to do? Are we going to change the NAACP? It's and I don't think there's anything

58:32.400 --> 58:39.480
wrong with the word colored, but the words take on it's just like like they adhere to social

58:39.480 --> 58:44.200
customs. And so my grandma looks out the window and she goes there's a colored fella on the corner

58:44.200 --> 58:49.920
and and they she said no better. She doesn't think she's doing anything wrong. You call people

58:49.920 --> 58:57.520
cripples. It's it's people who are temporarily disabled. I didn't realize this is my biggest

58:57.520 --> 59:03.800
problem. It's because what have we learned from fucking policing language? We keep changing our

59:03.800 --> 59:10.000
language and we keep not changing the class system. We keep not changing the way we live our

59:10.000 --> 59:15.560
fucking life. We keep not changing the way things are. Yeah, my grandma looks out the window goes

59:15.560 --> 59:20.200
there's a colored guy in the corner. Oh, well, let's make the word colored bad. That'll change

59:20.200 --> 59:29.960
my fucking grandma. No, it will not change my grandma. Death will change my grandma. Let's come

59:29.960 --> 59:38.680
up with a new name for death. Let's kill your grandma. She's a buried person. Yeah. And now it's

59:38.680 --> 59:45.120
over problem solved. Nothing other than that will solve the fucking problem and nothing other than

59:45.120 --> 59:52.800
violence has ever solved any fucking problem ever. You don't change shit behind a fucking curtain.

59:52.800 --> 01:00:01.640
He's yelling it was powerful. It would be illegal. If voting was powerful, it would be illegal.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:13.000
Dan, but that being said, that would be out of your revolution. I'm I'm a millionaire and I would

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.920
really like to I'd like to I have a golden doodle and I'd like to die in peace. You just earlier

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:26.440
tonight told a story of kicking a homeless guy out of your parking lot. I felt terrible. That was

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:34.080
not terrible enough. Yeah, but that guy should have voted better. Right? Right? If he had voted,

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.840
right, he'd be allowed to sleep in a fucking parking lot. Wrong. No, you should have stopped that

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.960
happening. I couldn't fucking stop it. Yeah, you could have. Yeah, you could have. You should

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:52.080
have stopped that fucking countries. Do we invade? Don't don't don't change the subject. We're not

01:00:52.080 --> 01:01:00.520
talking about every four years. No, I'm gonna vote for the guy with the red hat. The guy with the

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:08.040
blue hat. Meanwhile, Middle East boom, boom, boom, boom, bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs, boom,

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:16.040
doesn't fucking matter. It's called a fucking empire. We play a game in this country. We fucking

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.920
hang out. We have a great time. You could have made an impact. You could have made a difference

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:25.880
with that guy and you didn't. Dana Carvey is really funny. I fucking love that guy. He never

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:31.160
did anything wrong to anybody. I'm gonna go home tonight broken hearted because he's thinking

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:37.040
about Wayne's World two. He's a fucking hero, man. He never did anything wrong. I heard that he

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.840
stopped someone getting arrested in a parking lot once. I bet he would. I bet Dana Carvey

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:48.440
would stop somebody from. How are you? What's what's life like as a handsome Pakistani air?

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:55.480
Pakistani air? Oh, Pakistani. Oh, I thought you like I'm gonna air do something. Well,

01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.400
that's what I was thinking. I was gonna say handsome millionaire because in my mind, you know,

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.640
when you when you do a lot of stuff, you equate that with a lot of money, but that's

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:12.400
real government is bullshit. It's a fucking fundamental lie. Have you ever talked to anybody

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:21.840
whose job is to tell other people what to do? Fuck those people. If you like run your life

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.080
through this asset test, talk to everybody that you've ever talked to. What's your fucking job?

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:33.000
If it's only telling other people what to do, fuck you. Fuck that person. Government's bullshit.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.560
All right. What are you doing now, though? You're telling people I'm telling them to go

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:44.400
run and be flip over cop cars and burn stuff. I'm saying leave me leave my mansion alone. I was

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:53.120
on your side. I have a golden doodle and I love him. I just I'm 41. Leave me out of it. But you're

01:02:53.120 --> 01:03:04.360
25. Burn down the fucking White House. Go do it. Set shit on fire. But leave me out of it. Dan and I

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:11.480
did an improv show last night. The vibe is so different from when Dana Carvey was on stage.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:18.240
Yeah, it's become more yelling. The vibe is so different. I would put him in charge. I would

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.640
Dana Carvey would be the poet laureate of the moon colony. I would go I would I would come out

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.880
and I would go no shoelaces. Dan, where are you? And then I would go now the church lady. And he'd

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:35.960
come out and go special. Dan, there's obviously this angry energy boiling up inside you. Do you know

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:45.760
where that's coming from right now? Is this couple's counseling stuff? I'm excited. Camille

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:52.240
always comes to our sessions, by the way. Yeah, I kind of I kind of am like the hype man for their

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:58.640
sessions. I would actually be very into that. That's right. Yeah, tell me how you feel. Yeah,

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:09.760
a moat. All right, what were you? You were asking Camille how his career was going? Oh, no, you

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:20.400
choose. Well, I did ask you question government. I am very I was wondering how Camille's travels

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:27.320
were. And then I also asked Dan where his asked I asked Dan where his anger was coming from. I

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:35.640
remember that. I have a question for Jeff. All right, if if we're moving on, but if we're not,

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:43.000
let's stay and let's move on. Let's move on. I saw I'm bringing up a different thing. I saw a

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:50.480
throwback Thursday picture that you posted a view at 11. The most fuckable 11 year old boy I've ever

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:58.480
seen. You are a gorgeous kid and you're a gorgeous man. But like at 11, you look like that. No wonder

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:03.080
you're going around talking to strangers. It's like a China play. Honestly, I don't mean that in a

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:07.720
bad way. My mom told me my my nose looked like an eggplant and I didn't know what it was. And so she

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:16.200
took me to the store and pointed it out. You carry the lead with your origin story. So I don't

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:26.160
want to talk to anybody. But you that's a picture. Have you guys seen this? Hashtag fuckers. His eyes

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:34.560
are like sapphires. His cheekbones are like God sculpted a mountain for pedophiles. And you

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.120
peaked in that catalog. He does have amazing cheekbones. Amazing cheekbones. I mean, I don't want

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.480
this to sound weird, but the way they still happen to you. What happened to you? I fell apart, man.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:51.600
When I was when I was at that age, I was modeling as a New Yorker doing a play was the

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.520
King and I King and I. You were also modeling. I didn't know this. Yes. What are boy modeling

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:04.560
poses? That picture was it was a private. He's doing it right now. Dan is doing a cheer. But this

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.920
picture was modeling, right? This was like a catalog. It was a it was a centerfold of a New

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:15.680
York Times magazine. You're for sure smizing. Smizing. You're smiling with your eyes. You're

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:21.720
smizing. And you're also you're looking right now. You're looking through the in your. I think the

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:27.280
very special thing about your child photography photos is that they are very sexual because it

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:32.400
looks like you're looking through the camera and you're like, yeah, definitely. Go for it. Like

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:41.360
there's some kind of like. Super sexual child. No, but talk to me about it. Yeah. That's a

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:45.680
terrible thing to say. You're an adult now. So it feels okay. I'm going to I'm going to ask you for

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.960
it as well. I'm going to post a couple other photos like I'm coming upcoming. I'm coming. I'm

01:06:49.960 --> 01:07:04.360
telling you, please don't come on 11 year old me. I do think that when Spencer comes, that's how

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:18.360
it sounds. I'm coming. After Spencer has sex with a woman, he says that happened. That happened.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:24.360
And then he goes to the fridge. Yeah, it's just weird because a critical hit. Other than that,

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:34.760
it's utter, utter silence. It's just I'm coming. Maybe also when the girl does something a little

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:40.720
inventive, you're like, and you do some sort of action with your hands, which symbolizes rolling

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.480
a dice and you're like, yeah, okay, not effective. And when she's like my parents are coming, you're

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:56.280
like, you're metagaming right now. You're metacoming. If I did this, would you like it? And he goes

01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:07.520
like, yeah, no, metagaming. I'm not about Spencer's sex. Had you already had sex at that age? No, I

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:24.800
lost my virginity at 24 years old. I was 24. But did you lose it to 20 showgirls? Like, what do

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:33.080
you mean? Are you talking about anal sex? What do you mean? I had never put my penis inside of

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:42.360
one minute cause 24 years old. That's a bad thing. It's just because he's a Casanova. I was a late

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:50.080
bloomer. I but no, we saw you as an 11 year old. I look at that. I look at that picture of you at

01:08:50.080 --> 01:09:00.680
eight and I'm like, I want to sit on that eight year old's face. No, it's true. I felt the same

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:10.920
way. Just sexuality at eight surpasses sexuality. It's a I just I bet if yeah, if that happened, the

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:24.040
judge would be like, I kind of see that. I get it. I get it. I see the victim in my chambers. And

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:34.320
could he please wear that windbreaker? Also hashtag rape culture. Yay. I'm very glad you weren't

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:44.520
raped. When I was thinking, I feel raped right now. When I was four years old, you asked for it. I

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:54.600
wouldn't have worn those eyelashes. By a round of applause, who has seen Jeff Davis at eight years

01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:05.400
old? 11. 11. This was 11. The picture I saw was 11. But I mean, do you hear that applause? Who

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:18.720
here and be honest, who has seen Dan Harmon at eight years old? I mean, there's a reason. There's a

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.600
reason. I wasn't an actor. I wasn't. Yeah. And 10 years after that, he was asking his mom if he was

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:32.000
handsome. When I was four, I think I'm not even quite not quite for like maybe maybe like almost

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:39.360
for when I went to preschool. And the first day of preschool is the first time as a as a as a human

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.920
being, I was around other kids that you didn't know you went to a building, there was other kids.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:48.760
Sure. And I remember it very vividly. And when when the class was over, we took naps and we drew on

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:54.440
chalkboard. And then when it was over, we all ran out. When the day was over, all the parents were

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.760
outside. And it was a big like grass lawn and all the kids we all ran out like bats coming out of

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:04.120
a cave because we're so wound up for being around other other human beings our age. You had to have

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:11.800
a popsicle. And I ran around the circle and I ran up to this girl, Petria Beth Hayes. And she was a

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.400
little blonde girl, four years old. I just went up to her and I just fucking Clark Gable there

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.800
grabbed her with the back of the head, leaned her over and kissed her like gone with the wind

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:29.840
style and then pushed her down in the grass and ran off. And that's kind of in my MO since then. That's

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:39.960
your dating history. You can insert 20 years between the kissing and the pushing down, but that's

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.320
basically what we're all doing. I got a big laugh out of the adults. And then like when the king and

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.360
I started when I was nine when I got into the king and I you've been doing that for years you did

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.920
that. I did it for her from nine through 11. Like the age nine and with clothes I was 11 years old.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:03.400
And I did at the Pantages here in LA when I was nine. And there were seven girls that were the kids

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.360
in the show like seven like Asian girls that were the king's daughters. There were seven Asian boys

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:14.320
with the king's sons. And then we went on tour. Where did you fall into that? I was an Asian kid.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.240
There's one white kid in the king and I, the son of Anna. Oh, you're the one white kid too, huh?

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:28.800
Everything's so easy for Jeff. Did you feel that? Did you know you were the only way kid?

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:36.200
You're a kid and we weren't racist. Also my understudy was white and I went through seven

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.560
understudies in that year and a half because it was hard to keep a kid to be like the white kid

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:47.560
had to put on really bad Asian makeup every night. Like they made them look orange really

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:52.400
and then like slanty eye makeup and shit. It was really shitty. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't move

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.640
on from this. We're still here. So but you were playing a white kid. Yes. But your understudy had

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:04.000
to play an Asian kid. Why? Because they had a free kid on the set. Also they would just be like,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:11.840
all right, so he got the Mickey Rooney makeup. There was no making any of these these kids.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:17.920
Did you have to be white for a narrative reason? The story of the king and I is a British woman

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:24.760
goes to Siam, what is now Thailand, to instruct the king of Siam in like modern like Western ways.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:33.880
It's like Apocalypse Now the story, right? No. It's like the boring dinner scene in Apocalypse Now.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.600
If you just took the shitty parts in Redux. There's a teacher. So we would go from town to town

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:45.280
and the kids would range from like six and seven years old up to 13. And so we traveled with

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:52.240
seven kids. And we would go to town to be seven new girls every city we went to. Were any of them

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:59.240
crippled? Don't derail. So we go to town. And the girls wouldn't travel with you, but the boys

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:04.760
would. Don't derail. No masking. You are not allowed to tell people to do something you do constantly.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:10.840
I'm the derail master. Seven kids traveled. Three of them were boys. Four of them were girls. And

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:16.080
then we would get like 14 new kids, half of which were, you know, like boys and girls. So I would

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.680
have a dressing room and there would be little girls and we would just play Truth or Dare. We

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:25.840
invented the game. No one had taught us this. Jeff, you did not invent the game. In your head,

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.160
your life has made sense. Yeah, you think your four is gone. And then the world said thank you for

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:36.000
the game. Nobody taught us how to play Truth or Dare, but we played a game that is absolutely

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.360
Truth or Dare without anyone having taught us. Do you feel like you invented that game? Well,

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.800
for us, we did because we didn't. That's fine. But for the world, you see, you guys called it

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.520
D-Bull or Durbal. Aaron, a guy's walking out in crutches. You want to say anything? Why so crippled?

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:57.840
You're good. Like, you do what you want, man. You don't have to stay here. Are you going to the

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:08.280
bathroom? He's going to get some chips. Can I guess you hurt your like skateboarding? You ran

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:14.960
into a stair. So he's a cripple because it's a temporary thing. We really have to go. That's not

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.040
how it works at all. That's not how it works. So I want to go back and talk to somebody.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.880
I take that back. I don't want to be the person behind that fight. Jeff, come on. Jeff's talking

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.680
about fucking four-year-olds. As a kid, we would make out. Now, I was a kissing bandit all throughout

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.920
my life. I kissed everybody. I was like, and then I just never had sex until I was 24. However,

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:45.200
when I was four years old in preschool. All right, take it easy. He got the chips that he said he

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:51.680
was going to get, and now he's opening them. Well, it's expected. It's so loud. First of all, how

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:57.560
do you get the chips so fast? He's crippled. Yeah. No, don't call him crippled. Those are the loudest

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.080
chips I've ever heard. You're like surprised. There's a line for chips just for handicapped

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:09.560
people. It's way closer. Did the mic pick that up? Those are the loudest chips. I've never said that out loud.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.920
I thought that that was just... Jeff, I'm so sorry. Please continue the story. You just interrupted

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:21.320
the thing. Those are the chips. Jalapeno. Yeah, those are the best. Wait, Jalapeno? No more for this

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:28.760
kid. This kid, this kid, he lived his life. He hurt his leg. You ran into a stair. You ran into a

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:35.520
stair? That's what someone says when they've been abused. Someone says, I fell onto a door. You ran

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:45.520
into a stair? What kind of bullshit story is that? I don't think abusers hit people's feet. Do you think that

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:51.400
you didn't, the stair was there and you're like, this is just a hallway? I mean, you thought it was a

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.880
hallway and you just ran into the hallway and then you're like, oh no, this goes up. It was like

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:04.400
Looney Tunes, someone drew floor on the stairs and he just ran into it. But I mean, really, when you

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:10.680
say I ran into a stair, that's not acceptable information. I'm sure the doctor was like, I think

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:15.920
it's fine. Otherwise, next week, there's going to be eight people with crutches opening chip bags

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:20.720
really loudly and they're like, what about me? Can I be famous? I don't think that'll happen. Okay,

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:27.000
so so you were you were you invented truth or dare? My friend, my the guy that played the prince,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.040
the Asian, there's two kid leads in the King and I. Oh, Jesus Christ, he's eating him loud too. Did you

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:42.320
hear? Did you hear that fucking? You're not allowed to say. It's not my fault. Did you hear the

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:51.520
fucking crunch on this guy? Is there a mic on him? It's like a Pringles commercial. So loud. What

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:58.320
flavor is that? They're hollow. That's so loud. I don't want to drill the whole thing. This band

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.720
with the crutches looks like he was a very handsome child. It's a he still is. He still is a handsome

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:12.480
child. Yeah, he's a handsome child. So guys, no, just everybody be quiet and just eat one more chip.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:21.920
Just everybody be dead quiet. That's fucking loud. They're potato chips. Can you hear that in

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:30.720
America? The podcast audience? Yeah, he has an amplifier. What's going on? Perfect shape for

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:38.800
projecting sound. He's a fully artist. He's a fully artist. All right, so I want to go back. Okay,

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:46.000
so truth or dare, you've invented truth or dare. My friend Doug, the other kid, not he also fucking

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.800
Doug Clay fuck guy. He was so great. He was like I was 11. He was 13. And he he would he jerked

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:59.680
off in front of us. Nice story. All right, let's do DMD. All right. Well, thanks for coming tonight,

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:07.040
folks. I hope you enjoyed Janet Karby. But we were kids. But hang on. So when I was four, when I was

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:13.040
four years old, no, no, no, finish the jerk off story. That's that's the way how old were you? I

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:18.800
was 11. He's just talked about this before. When I was nine, 10, 11 years old, we would be we had

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:25.280
dressing rooms. And we were all the way the truth of their started was I had like a halls like

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:32.560
you were like, what shall we do with our time? I've got an idea. I had a cough drop. We just knew

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.640
there were boys and there were girls. And then we all knew we didn't know what was going on. We just

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:42.560
knew that something must happen. There was that's what I said. Yeah. So I would I would take a

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.680
cough drop and Kathy or or you vet the girls that were in the show and they were nine years old.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.480
The guy was we would lay on top of each other and then we would pass a cough drop from one mouth

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:58.640
to the other. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Except these names are like from a math textbook. So

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:06.640
you don't know any events really. But you read event has an idea about the how about

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:13.280
patria beth was a fucking great name. But if that was oh my god. So cute. Oh, she could suck a cough

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:19.760
drop. She could suck a menthol off a lozenge. So

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:29.920
so our tutor, our tutor, who is a very beautiful woman named Bridget, she told our parents,

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.880
we have to give these kids sex education. We were all like the average ages nine years old.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:39.200
You guys are just going around laying on each other. They kept walking into a room and we would

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.000
just be we just be on top of each other making out. Yeah, it's like frog DNA. Like they found a way.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.760
We didn't tell them. So we had to get sex ed. We didn't we didn't know what sex was. But then

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.040
later on when we were like in Washington, D.C., like this tour was kind of ending when I was about

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.600
11, we found a bunch of porn mags under a bed in a hotel room. And we were like, oh, fuck. Like

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:09.280
like, we've been doing this wrong the whole time. We have tiny dicks. Yeah. But so as a kid that

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.160
no one instructs you how to play truth or dare. So then we would dare people to do stuff that was

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.320
I think I think it's an organic things that that children create on their own without any instruction.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:24.480
When I was four years old, we played doctor and I guess what I was someone is a big fan of four

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:33.280
year olds. I was laughing hysterically. Our teacher, Mrs. Newhouse, would leave the preschool room

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:40.480
and then she had a giant oak desk and I would take like I am I am Jeff me and Jeffrey and Craig.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.560
We would take a girl and everybody would watch was all around and she would take her clothes off.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.000
What? She'd take her clothes off. And we would take a close and we guys are four and we played

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.680
doctor. So everybody was watching right and there were nurses and there were other doctors.

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:57.360
And so the girl would take her take her clothes off and I would touch your boobs and I would touch

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.240
your pussy and I would touch everything. Does it hurt here? And I was the doctor. When you say I

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:13.360
would touch her pussy. Yeah, these are all doctor. I mean playing doctor. When you would touch with

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:21.120
the medical community refers to as a pussy. It wasn't like a like what or was it a here or was

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:27.280
it a did you put your hand and then push pressure like when they check for the gallbladder. I would

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.680
say I would I would like touch her stomach go. Does it hurt here? We're playing because we

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:38.160
don't always at four years old. Just hurt here. Shut the fuck up. Finish the story. Jesus Christ.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.120
It's not a long story. If I can just be a naked girl and I would go does it hurt here? Just

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:48.000
lightly touch people and it wasn't sexy. We just knew that there was boys and girls were different

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.400
and we're just old enough to recognize those differences. So we invented for us playing

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.440
doctor. Wait, that's that's a thing that kids do like two games now. Well, I can understand.

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.160
I invented four corners. I don't know if you've all played that.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.800
What's I don't know for a corner. I was the first one to say see you later alligator.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.280
My brother told me he invented peanut butter and jelly.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:19.120
He told me he fucking invented it and I knew he was lying and just had no choice.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.240
And then after I mastered peanut butter, I moved on to fruits.

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:26.960
So the teacher had walked back in the room and there would be Gloria naked under the desk and

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.120
me and Jeffrey Kim and Craig were just like really just like was it always glory or a different

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:38.160
ones. It was different every time. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. No, no, no, not fucked up. But like

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:50.960
no fuck him. He got more fucking trim. In 1969. Trim. Trim. Trim.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.240
Really? You guys are going to boo the use of the word trim. Well, it's not a desirable that

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:05.520
is what is a what is a four year old. You can't do it. But Jeff, you can pass on this question.

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.880
But you lost your virginity at 24. Yes. We're hearing about all these sexual experiences

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:16.080
that you had and you don't have to answer this. But like, do you in like in a few sentences,

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.440
could you quantify why maybe you lost your virginity at 24? Because obviously, well, very sexy man.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:30.560
Yes, I can. That was a tepid response. Yeah, really. It was a little late. It was a little late.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.160
Response to me not to Jeff, but I look back on those on like junior high and high school as times

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:41.520
when if I knew what was going on and if I could have read the signal, you were too busy inventing

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:48.160
games. Well, you weren't you. You were Christian. Weren't you Christian? So first it was me being

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:52.240
like late bloomer and being terrified of girls. And also there was a girl I dated when I was a

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.280
sophomore in high school. No, I was a freshman. She was a sophomore. You fuck you. That's what I'm

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.440
saying. And everyone had me because I use the wrong word. But fine. Yeah, you said trim due to

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.960
four to a four year old. They should. Okay, I missed up. I made a misstep. But I'm still a good guy.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:12.880
Yeah, you're a good guy. It was getting more action. Yeah, we're in action. We're all on your

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:18.640
side. I never I never kissed her. Her name is Ursula. Oh, by the way, I she just did it in

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:24.160
math textbooks. She she was a cheerleader and she was very beautiful. And I had five apples. I was

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:35.760
terrified of her math, math textbook, Joe. I never she also wanted to know how long a train would

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:41.680
take to get we never even kissed. I had girlfriends that I never kissed because I thought my

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:47.920
brother's friends who are two years older than me said, then I said, was this guy was his name

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:53.920
fucking asshole. Really tall. It was probably Jamal. His name was Kevin. Okay, Kevin's also a

01:25:53.920 --> 01:26:01.120
textbook. He comes up and he goes like, So you fucking Ursula? I'm like, No, sir. Like, the very

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:07.280
idea. I thought that to have sex with girls would be the highest insult that they wouldn't want it.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:13.120
They were like, they told me that's only something that guys wanted to do to girls. And girls are

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.480
like, No, they're like, like, like, like, that's really rude. Like, No. So I was I was really,

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.120
really rude. Then in college, I don't think of anything rude or you could do to it. It's rude.

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:30.160
It's rude to have sex with a woman. It is rude. Yeah. I apologize every time. It's surely it really

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:40.480
is. It's like rude. Sorry. That shouldn't happen. Thank you. Thank you very much. I absolutely

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.080
do feel that way. I got, I got, I got done and I go, Thank you. Sorry. Sorry about that.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.560
I fall out and I walk backwards out of the room and go get a towel.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:57.840
There's a visualization of your animal person. So sorry. It's we were ashamed of ourselves.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.560
Wait, wait, wait. Then I went through and like a born again. How long did you date Ursula?

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.520
Like for 45 minutes, like, like, like no time at all. She's still your voice is there's no clock

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:14.560
behind you. What time is it? 940? Okay, we're overdue for D&D. We're going to start D&D.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:22.000
Sorry. Thank you for all of that. This show brought to you by four year old Trim.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.040
I'm sorry. I use the word Trim. It's a gross word. I'm sorry. Trim.

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:35.520
No, I'm sorry. I use the word and I want to apologize on part of Camille for using the C word.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.440
I didn't use the color. Colored? We'll say.

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.280
My bit was that you said that word. I don't know.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.680
There's a Tylenol with codeine. Oh, that's that's just got mixed in there. I did.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.840
But Spencer announced that he would never return at the last and the last session, right?

01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:00.400
He disappeared. He used his amulet. So let's hear it for Spencer as Tylenol with codeine

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:06.800
in the last episode. Amazing. That was good. The best thing ever. All right. Thank you. Give me

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.440
some quirks. I don't want to get into it. You were born again for how long? Just real quick.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.520
Just tell me the year and we won't talk about it. Three, four years. Okay. And your teen years.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.440
Then I was like family and do it. I had never had sex, so I became abstinent, but I was abstaining

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.800
from something that I accidentally abstained from a long time. And then I would date girls and

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:32.240
they were like, you really like four players. That's all you're going to get. So says Jesus.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.960
Yeah. Dry humping is okay. I was I was abstinent and in a similar program called true love waits.

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.760
And my excuse, I never did any for true love wait. You were in a thing called true love waits.

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.760
Yeah. And look what she waited for. Amazing.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.360
The program called true love waiting pays off.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:02.560
Yeah. True love should have waited a little bit longer. Yeah. True love. True love could have

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:11.760
held out. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Spencer,

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:22.080
would you take us away? Yeah, sorry. Oh, boy. When we last met, our heroes had just fended off

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:29.520
flaming goblins and gem bugs in the purple canyons. After looting a power stone, the robot baby was

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:36.800
activated who the game gang dubbed Lodgy due to its damaged logic core. The baby spoke of a place

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:42.000
that it was designed to locate, although it was not designed to locate it very effectively.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:48.080
And the damaged logic core prevented it from recalling what or where it was looking for.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:54.160
But as they spoke, Sharpie smelled a funky sack and realized his bag was a blaze.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:30:00.240
He emptied its contents, a flaming goblin named Justin. And after some interrogation determined

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:07.920
that the robot's power core was from the Air City, home of technological wonders and flying machines,

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:14.640
the gang was unsure of how to proceed. But Justin suggested they get some arrow hawks,

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:22.080
then Tylona with codeine piped up and disappeared right afterwards. So it was off to Rosebrook,

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:29.040
a nearby village susceptible to pillage to plan their next move. But could our heroes truly reach

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:36.800
the Air City? Where was the said city? The Air City? And what dangers might Rosebrook hold?

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:42.240
And what of the robot baby find out now on an all new Harmontown time?

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:52.080
That's good shit, Spencer. So I know it occurred to me while I was writing that it's very hard to

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:57.360
summarize all the weird shit that happened. Well, we don't usually listen. So what? Oh, I know.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:02.320
I mean, it's not for you guys. I don't know who it's for, to be honest. Yeah, because they could

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:07.600
rewind and listen to it. Oh, they know what's going on, chances are. They know so much better than

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:12.800
us. Yeah. And then they're like, why don't you use the rope you're holding? I'm not holding a rope.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:20.160
The town is called Rosebrook. I think I called it Rosebook. Let's just call it Rosebook in the

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:24.960
last episode. So are we in Rosebook? Are we on our way to Rosebook? You're on the way to Rosebook.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:31.840
We got like outside. Yeah, there's this. You saw the city. You can see it. You can see it far off.

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:37.840
You're right by a town that says Rosebook. The baby's walking with us. Yeah, yeah. He's watched

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:43.440
by himself. Well, I don't know. I think someone was carrying him. I'll carry him. Oh, I have the

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:49.760
baby. Is my mic working still? Yeah, I just thought it different. Yeah, it did for a bit.

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:56.640
It did for a bit. It's good now. Okay. What is happening? We're trying to solve the problem.

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:05.040
I have the baby. The baby's mine. We're hurt in. Tanisha's D was here. The fucking soupy sales

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:14.880
came out. What? Yeah, soupy sales. D Martin did a ditty. We had, you weren't here. You slept in.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.400
I did. I had a great nap. All right. So you're carrying the baby. I'm going to walk alongside

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:26.240
you in case you get tired. Okay. Give her the baby, Christopher. She wants to hold the baby.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:31.120
I mean, you and I are of the same mindset. Christopher, if you and I could have an aside.

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:39.840
Sure. Shit. I up until this point have been chaotic. Good has been my scuba dude mantra

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:48.560
affiliation, my alignment, alignment, scuba dude. I like that. I'm feeling chaotic bad.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:53.680
Oh, then you don't, I'm not going to give you the baby. No, no, no, I don't want to hurt the baby.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:59.440
I just want to be selfish and do things that are. These are not good arguments to get the baby.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:06.320
Well, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm watching this conversation. No, you're not. I'm jerking off.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:13.440
Okay. That's what you want. That's what I'm going to do. Maybe I said this incorrectly. What I'm

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:19.040
trying to say is I know that you've gotten a lot of flat for the baby, for wanting to get the baby.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.400
He's jacking off like one of Jeff's 13 year old friends.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:30.960
I, I, I'm just saying that I, I am on your side when it comes to wanting to take care of yourself.

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.640
All right. Well, let's, let's, uh, you're in a trial period. I'm going to have the baby,

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:41.760
but we'll see. And if you're okay, do you hear something? No, right? I mean, it sounds like a

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:50.160
trash can moving around. Okay. So you, um, you can be, you can, uh, if you're good, I'll let you

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:58.720
have the baby. But yeah, wait, I definitely hear something. How does making jello sound? I think

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:04.640
someone's making jello in a trash can and they're moving it around, but it, and it smells good

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:08.480
to them. They're making it and they like the smell of the thing that they're making and they're

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:14.960
moving around the trash can. I'm going to go investigate this bush and just, it's moving

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:20.800
in a way. I run away. I run to a different bush. I run to a different bush. It's okay. The bush

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.920
is empty. We're fine. All right. We're fine. We'll understand. I just wait. Special, special,

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.600
special, special roll dice on that. What, what, what did the dice say on that move? Well, yeah,

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:35.920
I did roll the dice. I did. What happened? He didn't hide very well. He was right in that same

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:43.040
bush. Critical fail. What the fuck, Sharpie? What are you, what, what part of that were you

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:47.360
jerking off? What's going on? What are you jerking off about the baby? I'm making jello. What's

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:53.840
happening? Who's that? Who, what's this guy doing in the bush? He was jerking off while we were

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:59.120
talking about who should take care of the baby. Is that normal? No. Oh, good. Oh, you're the baby?

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:05.200
Yeah. Baby. I'm sorry, baby. This is not about you. Baby, what's your, baby, what's your name?

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:12.000
You guys called me Lodgy. Lodgy. Lodgy. Lodgy. Yeah. Baby, is that the only voice you have?

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.600
It sure is. It's one of my main voices. All right, Lodgy, we're fine. Sorry, he was making

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:24.720
gel. Stop it. Oh, sorry. We're looking at you. I jerk off during plot points. That's my fetish.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:33.760
I get turned on by plot points when the story changes direction. That's the only thing that

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.320
can make me come. That sucks. What we need, what we need to most is you're jerking off. That's why,

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.840
uh, yeah, that's what turns me on about it. Also, also weird because that wasn't a plot point.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.600
Yeah. That was more characterization of any way. It wasn't a plot point. It was just character

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:53.600
development. Are you guys confronting me about a thing that, that, that in a big way that, that

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.960
for the first time, because I'm going to come in my fucking pants. All right. All right. All right.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:04.240
Nope. I'm going to say is that's what it's all about for me. You're creating plot points by

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:09.600
jerking off. And then the plot point is you jerking off. I'm into thresholds. I walk up and

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:15.040
go, guys, it seems like a really crossing. It's a weird threshold here. No, no, no. Don't use,

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:21.280
don't use that word. I'm, I can finish. I don't care. Okay. It's not, it wasn't meant to be the

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:27.200
big deal. You guys are having the baby. I don't want to, I don't want to be a part of this. Okay,

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:32.640
great. Well, it seems like you very much want it. No, no, no, no, no. Because there are beach nearby.

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.920
Uh, no. All right, let's go find a beach. Let's go to the, let's go to the village. Okay. I

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:44.000
started masturbating at the idea of them going to a village. I need to, sorry. This is just me,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:52.320
Spencer. What, making Jello, you just stir a fluid in a bowl. It sounds like a little spoon

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.640
hitting another metal. Exactly. And think about that noise. That sounds nothing like you are not

01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:04.240
intimate with Dan Harmon. Oh, okay. Sure. It's all metal. This is a specific detail. Wait, what is

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:10.320
the noise? It's all metal spoons down there. She's right. It sounds like stirring up gelatinous

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:21.200
fluid. With a casual garbage can. Everyone's jealous. She's getting away of tonight. I take back

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:26.480
that I was masturbating. I'm sorry. I want, I want Spencer to take, take control. Let's go into the

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.680
place. The Rose Book. Rose Book, right. So you're heading towards Rose Book and you can see,

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.760
no, there's nothing important here. Don't worry about it. Nothing's happening. No, no, no, nothing's

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:43.520
happening. Nothing's happening. The stakes are low. You can see the happy little village. Oh, great.

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:50.080
It's happy a little, but on the path before you, you see it looks like a stopped horse and carriage

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:56.400
surrounded by a green skinned man on the top of the carriage. There's a little, he must be a gnome

01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:02.880
or half length standing on top of it. Like he's swinging a sack, like a weapon. Is he, is his

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:08.320
expression friendly? He's, he's back as torches. These guys are, it seems like these guys are

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.240
robbing it. So we should, I think, run up and disrupt this and help the poor man who's being

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.960
attacked by the green skinned men, right? Don't you get that? All right, yeah, yeah.

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:22.080
Christopher, you're sneaky. I'll go out and cause a diversion. You sneak up and flank the guy

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:27.280
swinging the sack. One guy can't flank. No, no, no, I'll go up and get his attention. You flank

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.360
him around the side. I'll flank the other side. Then what do I do? We'll take it from there.

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.760
Okay, all right. What is Lodge going to do? Lodge is with me. Lodge is fine.

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.600
Don't worry about Lodge. I hope I get kicked.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:48.240
What did he say? What did he say? Shit, we've, what did he say? Lodge, what did you say?

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.880
I hope I get kicked. No, hope you get kicked. Lodge, why do you hope you get kicked? Oh,

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:58.720
just things that happened in the past. Jesus Christ, it's fucking horrible. No, we have to fix

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:04.640
this. Let's fight. Let's, let's fix that. Lodge is fine. He's a baby. He hopes he gets kicked. No,

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:09.760
no, no, he'll fuck that. You're not helping. You're jerking off in the corner. I wasn't

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:15.440
jerking off to the kid. I was jerking off to the idea that we, that something new was happening.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:20.000
All right. The kid's another matter. He wrote us all of a sudden after jerking off in a bush.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I go up, I go up to the left side of this. Is it like a coach kind of thing? Like a stage

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:38.320
coach. So I went up and go like, what, what goes? You see, you see six orcs there. They're menacing

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:44.640
a guy stand, the little no man stand in the top as carriage. He's like, ah, ah, ah. Sorry,

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:50.560
did you say a top as carriage, like a carriage of tall plates? He's a top, a top. I see. That

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:55.360
makes a lot more sense than what I envisioned. I was mumbling. I'm sorry. I'm a real mumble

01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.160
boy. Christopher, it looks like this, the orcs are attacking this. Yeah, we should, we should.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:08.000
I could have told you that. I say, I say to the orcs, hey, assholes, you want to fuck with somebody,

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:15.440
pick on somebody, his own size. And I'm also short. That's right. Yeah. And I have the baby,

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.160
which is also about your size. Right. Yeah. You, you, you emerge, huh? Yeah, where are you? Yeah,

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:26.080
I come out too. I also emerge when I say, I know the recipe for your deaths.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:36.480
Can I hide? I mean, I, where's I, wait, are you going to hide? No, I'm done jerking off. I want

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.040
to hide in a bush. Why are you hiding in a bush? We've, we've, we've made our play. There's a

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.360
bunch of orcs attacking a little guy. Fine. Okay. All right. I'm all blustery. I go, hey, what do

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.160
you guys want? Your ass is kicked or what? Yeah. I know you're in your refractory period, but try to

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:56.400
pull yourself together. I don't think he ever came. All right. I can't. I can't. Okay. I'm sorry.

01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:02.560
He isn't as effective. So the biggest orcs or the biggest of the orcs he raises a large golden,

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:08.080
what is it, an axe, large golden axe above his head and brings it down to the floor and his orcs

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:17.680
charge. What? See, you guys need to fucking learn how to approach a city. I fucking like you come

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:23.440
up to the door and you go, Dan, can we come in sharpie? I don't, you don't need to give us notes

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.680
right now. You walk into a town and maybe there's going to be bad guys look like as you walk in.

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:32.400
So on the off chance that there's going to be bad guys, you just roll up and go, fuck your mother,

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:38.400
fuck everybody, fuck everything. I didn't, I just said, Hey, what goes and they started attacking

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.360
me. No, that's not what happened. Don't don't revise history. Exactly what happened. We rolled up

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.720
and we were pricks to them and they're attacking us. I was going to kill them. I'm going to kill

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:52.400
them all. I said what goes castically. I was just trying to, I saw, I saw a little halfling gnome

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.920
guy and I thought, shit, he's in trouble. And I went, wait, what's up? What's happening? Yeah,

01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:00.800
now that now they're charging. So get in the fight or get out. I'm in the fight. You call me

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:09.520
skencer? I mean, I'm fine with that. I like that better. Um, can I, can I produce my whisper bow?

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:19.840
Yeah. Okay. And I'm going to fire that at the, the head. Orc. Yeah, go for the minions first,

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:26.160
right? They'll die easier. Minions or whatever's closest to you, I would say. Okay, I'm gonna,

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:38.000
I'm going to fire at the minion that's closest to me. Closest to me. All right. An arrow from

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.680
your bow. You blast two arrows from your bow. The first one smashes them in the face dealing

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:51.360
six damage. We just got here. We just got to this city. It's too late. The fight is too late,

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:57.920
which we just choose too early. We just got here. You should start, start jerking off again. So you

01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:05.200
love the orc that you hit in the face. It dies causing your second arrow to miss. All right.

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:12.240
Nice. I say under my breath, adventure. A feeling that I've forgotten over this.

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:19.840
Someone else go wage. I'll have my ribbon dagger and I go for the next ribbon dagger.

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.400
A ribbon dagger. I'm just hearing everything and I'm envisioning things. I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.640
So you heard a Rubin. I'll have the money, crystal sword and

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:35.200
I love Rubin. Sarah crowd and Thousand Island. We're just, we're not even in the city yet.

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:40.000
That's true. Stop complaining. To get in the city. There's bad guys. We're gonna

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.480
fucking, we're going to loot these people. Are they going to have the money? Why do you think

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:50.400
you're fucking raging about the government and jerking off on a bush like you? Yeah. When did

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:59.440
you lose your nerve Sharpie? Okay. Eight cities ago. I lost my nerve. So yeah. And you know,

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:06.400
I might do that. I might, my character might go off and kill himself. What do you think about that?

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.720
I think that's, I don't think you have the guts.

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:16.160
I dare you to go, I dare you to go kill yourself. I'll roll the dice for you.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.400
All right. The only way you can win is by killing yourself.

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:33.920
I mean, it's better than there being a problem with everything that's happening at every turn.

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:39.600
Do you guys don't, you guys don't. We're being attacked by orcs right now. We're being attacked

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:45.600
by, we came up to the city. Am I so drunk that I don't understand this? I think maybe. Yes. Yes.

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.720
Answer is yes. Spencer, like it's Camille's move, right? You're still delivering Camille's

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.320
dance. We walked up. There was a guy being attacked. Camille and I decided to go help. There was

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:58.880
absolutely no need to attack me. Camille's move. We didn't attack shit. We walked up and got in

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.560
a flanking position and said, what the fuck is happening? And they started attacking us.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:11.840
That's what happened. What do you think happened, Dan? There wasn't a non-conflict resolution to

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:17.280
this encounter. What do you think is happening right now in the game? We came up to a city,

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:24.400
a brand new city. Yes. And we started attacking them. That's what happened. We did not. That's

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.720
not what happened. All right. This is out of turn. Well, we should tell them what happened.

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:35.280
It's Camille's turn. We walked up. We walked up. There was a stage coach with a guy defending

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.360
himself with a sack over his head. There were eight orcs attacking him. And I came up and said,

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.720
hey, what goes? And with Christopher flanking around the side, and they turned to us and started

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:53.360
attacking me. I'm sorry. It's okay. And we spoke last night for like 40 minutes. I'm sorry. I'm

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:58.480
sorry. And I didn't, I didn't mean to cut Aaron off. I just, we went down this path so long. It's like,

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:02.400
why did you go down it again when we could just end it? Can I, can I take out my sword? Yeah,

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:08.000
I have my ribbon dagger that I threw. Oh yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. So you stabbed that guy in the,

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.360
just the arm, but poison courses through his veins. And he almost instantly just falls down dead.

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:24.320
I feel terrible. I feel terrible. I take out my sword. Wait, it's somebody else's turn. No, no,

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:32.640
it's her turn now. Oh, okay. I take out my sword. In my pocket, there's a letter. But I take out my

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:41.440
sword. I stab my eyes and I drag the sword. That's just what's happening. I take the sword and I

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:48.880
drag, I stab both of my eyes. I can hardly see. It's in the sword is in my left eye socket. I drag

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:56.480
it down to my heart. I get it down to my heart and I mix it around like I'm mixing a cake mix.

01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:03.680
Like you're making Jello. Like I'm making Jello. And then I drag it down to my stomach and I open

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.000
up my stomach and I take out my intestines and I make a necklace and I make a little like,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:16.320
like goodbye. I write goodbye. Wait, this isn't my intestines. I die. I thought that we were

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:24.160
at two and I die. He has to roll. Oh, I rolled it. Yeah, I just my only question. Here's here's

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:30.080
my only question. How's how hard are you trying to stab yourself in the eyes? I get everything

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:36.160
real hard. Yeah, okay, real hard. Yeah. I'm trying to I am stabbing myself in the eyes. I have a

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:41.440
letter in my pocket. But as you're doing that, I say to the baby, she would have made a terrible

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:46.480
mother. That's her in the town, everybody. Thank you for coming.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.440
All right.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:01.360
What a cliffhanger. Rest in peace. I really thought we were just coming up to a city. I should

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.840
probably drink. I know it's fine. So we're doing it in space. Let's hear it first. An S.S.D. who

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:15.520
was apparently here. Kumail Nanjiani, Erin McGathy, Spencer Crittenden, Dana Carvey.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:25.520
I'm Jeff. Sorry I was late. Dan Harmon is your man. Thanks very much, everybody. We love you.

01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:35.600
Well, if you don't play the blues, you don't play no rock and roll.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:47.920
So if you don't play the blues, yes. You said we don't know the definition of rock and roll, oh my

01:48:47.920 --> 01:49:03.920
girl. Rock and roll's a-jumping. Yeah, to the core of his soul. Oh my god. Rock is there. Rock is

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:15.600
there. Rock is there. Rock is there. I talk to my friend. But that's what he said. That's what I said.

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:35.360
Who is he? Who is he? My other friend? Rock is there. No. No rock and roll is there. Oh my god.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:46.320
Let me solo.

01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:17.520
Mercury friend. Muscle car. Grateful dead. The lord of the ring. Zeppelin' red. The devil touch

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:28.560
you. There is it. It's all over. Yeah, oh, rock and roll is there. Oh my god. Let me do another

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:39.520
solo.

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:44.480
Oh

01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:03.200
started with blues. Barely a lead. Then there was hellish. Making some bed. The

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:12.160
Beatles arrived. Started to shred. Axel rose. Rock is there.

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:42.160
Oh

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:52.160
take that big chain out of my head because the rock and roll is a-jumping.

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:57.280
It is all over. I can't roll this thing. One more time. It's all over.

01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:06.240
Rock and roll is there. Two more times. It's all over.

01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:29.200
I said, but now I'm rock and roll. I said, but now I'm rock and roll. Yeah.
