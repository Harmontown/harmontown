It's like my favorite thing.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:55.000\nI'm sorry I didn't even hear that you called my name.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:57.000\nI thought people were just excited that the show was happening.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:02.000\nI usually wait to see if they're excited for me to be here.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:07.000\nYeah, please welcome this fucking guy.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nB-BJ Black Basilits!\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nThis fucking guy is here too.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:13.000\nFrom Castle Wolfenstein.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:18.000\nOh yeah, that's what Hitler wanted us to look like.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:23.000\nThat's a huge compliment. Do not take that the wrong way.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:24.000\nIt is.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:25.000\nYou are very handsome.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:27.000\nYou're very handsome.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:30.000\nYou look like Duke Nukem.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:32.000\nThat is, yeah.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:36.000\nDid you know that Duke Nukem is related to B.J. Blazkowicz from the...\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:37.000\nWhat? No way!\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:38.000\nYeah.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:39.000\nAre you serious?\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:41.000\nThey're in the canon of video game stuff.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nOkay, this is very deep.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.000\nI just want to say a couple of things.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:46.000\nYeah.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:47.000\nJust a couple of things.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:48.000\nGreat.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:49.000\nYou can keep the bullet train moving.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\nThe San Diego thing we talked about last week.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:57.000\nSo the sexual harassment, the cosplay thing?\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nYes.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nAnd I don't think we touched upon it last week.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nI don't know if it was a thing last week.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:03.000\nIt's...\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nThey touched upon it there.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:07.000\nNo, we touched upon it a lot.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:08.000\nIs that your joke?\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:09.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:10.000\nIs the audience...\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:11.000\nThey're small minds.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:12.000\nThey're very easily...\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:17.000\nIt's that kind of dot connecting that makes sexual harassment happen.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:21.000\nYou guys are worse than sexual harassers.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:22.000\nYeah.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:28.000\nI don't know if we mentioned the young lady who's become the poster child of cosplay,\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:29.000\nsexual harassment.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:30.000\nShe got...\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:32.000\nWell, we thought that she'd gotten attacked.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:35.000\nAnd I don't... And I kind of want to sidestep.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:36.000\nBecause I don't...\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:37.000\nOf course.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.000\nYeah.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:39.000\nLike whether or not she...\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:40.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:41.000\nBecause other podcasts talk about that.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:42.000\nI just...\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nI only narcissistically wanted to talk about that incident for one reason,\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nwhich is that there was this one article, and I can't remember what publication it was,\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:51.000\nbut one of the Rick and Morty writers pulled it out and said,\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:57.000\nthere's this huge article about cosplay and sexual assault and harassment,\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:04.000\nand a terrible article outlining the whole thing and terrible darkness, darkness,\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:08.000\ncosplay, sexual assault, cosplay, sexual assault, cosplay, sexual assault.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\nAnd at the bottom of the article, there's just kind of the equivalent of some stock photography\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nof some people cosplaying.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:21.000\nIt was the couple that dressed as Mr. Meeseeks at the...\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nNo such thing as bad press.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:29.000\nIt's just great to have stuff out there.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nYou can't control how it gets out there.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:34.000\nIt was the weirdest sensation of my life, cos I'm like,\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nI'm a nerd, and this girl got hurt, or didn't she, or whatever.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nWhen I was talking about this thing, it was like,\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:45.000\noh shit, that's gonna pump us up, like 1.7.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:46.000\nAlright.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:49.000\nThere's Frank.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nI don't think that's his name.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nNope.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:52.000\nIt's not.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nI just ran out with the vodka bucket.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nPeople are just running out on stage this show.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:59.000\nDay late, dollar short.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nOkay, there was a homeless guy in the Starburns parking lot, apparently,\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:08.000\nand I was really bummed out because I was working late at Starburns, the animation studio,\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:15.000\nand our writer's assistant, Adam, got a call from a PA who said,\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nI walked out, there was a guy, he's parked on this spot,\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nand he's got a blanket over him, and I don't know what's going on,\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:24.000\nI called the non-emergency police line.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nIs it 3-1-1?\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nI don't know, 9-1-0?\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:29.000\nOkay.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nIt's not quite 9-1-1, back it off.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\n9-1 less than 1.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:38.000\nI was like, okay, I guess that's, I don't know,\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nand then we walked out the back, and there were three squad cars,\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nand I was a homeless kid who obviously just wanted a safe place to sleep,\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.000\nand I'm part of the problem.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:51.000\nAnd I'm living with that, and I thought if I said it to these kids, I could somehow gain something.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.000\nYou're not going to get to him, though, this message,\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nbecause he probably doesn't listen to podcasts.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:59.000\nNo, his life is probably fucking ruined now.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:05.000\nHe maybe could have, with one night's safe sleep in my parking lot,\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nhe could have fucking, like, gained a foothold,\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:12.000\nand I came down on him like a fucking, like, I didn't even know I was doing it.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nI'm part of the problem.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nAll right, enough of that.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nWedding planning is fun.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nIs it?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:26.000\nSome of these segues are rough, dude.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:30.000\nWhen you wedding plan, you get to make a whole list\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nof all the people you've ever known in your entire life\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nand do nothing with the person you love,\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:40.000\nbut talk shit about all of them.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nIt's almost worth getting married.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nEven if you don't really love someone,\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nI recommend getting married,\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\nbecause there's so much shit you could get to do.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nJust like deciding, like, I don't know, these people.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nThis is just a fun activity to just make a list of everyone\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:02.000\nyou've ever known in your whole life and be like, fuck them.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nThat does have to be satisfying.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nThen there's a bunch of shit I wrote while I was high\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nat Sarah Silverman's party.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.000\nThis is serious warning shit.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nWell, this is symptomatic.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nOh, shit, what did I...\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nI'm reading my Evernote notepad.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:24.000\nThis is when I was at a party of a friend of ours\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\non a rooftop overlooking Los Angeles.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nThis is when I typed into my notepad.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:31.000\nFor you kids, should I get high, Dan?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nI don't know. Do you want to think like this?\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nI'm not cutting any corners.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nI'm not sanding any edges.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nThis is what I wrote.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nHydrophilic and hydrophobic.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:46.000\nDuality between being good at being between people\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:51.000\nand being good at being between people and whatever is beyond.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:56.000\nIt should just say, don't smoke pot. This is a PSN.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nPlease read that again.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nI want to try and make sense of it.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nHydrophilic and hydrophobic.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nDuality between...\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nOn board so far.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nBeing good at being between people.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nI just left.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nI think I know what I meant. I can tell you what I meant.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nAnd being good at being...\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nSo one side is being good at being between people.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nThe other side is being good at being between people\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nand whatever is beyond.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nOh, you're a people person or not?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nYou're either the membrane of a cell\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nor you're the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd you didn't feel like the membrane last night?\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nI was a membrane because I was out in the fucking rail.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nI was looking out over at LA and I was like,\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nYeah, entourage! What the fuck?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nI don't know what happened to me.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nOne of the guys from entourage was there.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.000\nProbably.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nNo, he was. I saw him.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nAnd you were there and I didn't see you.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nBut a guy from Futurama...\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nWe spoke for a while.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nI, earlier tonight, apologized to you for walking away from you\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nand you must have thought I was a crazy person\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nbecause you don't remember talking to me at all.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nThere were people walking up to me all night.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nI was up against the rail.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nThere were people constantly walking up to me\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nand saying the nicest things to me\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nand I would talk for five minutes\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nand then they would go,\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nOkay, cool.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nI'm going to go talk to Bill Maher.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nI was Charles Manson at that party.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nI was just...\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nI'm not bragging.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nIt didn't sound like a bragging.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nI was Charles Manson.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nI don't want to...\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nI don't want to be horned, but...\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nI may or may not have rallied some\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nprofligate youth into a few homicidal sprees.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nHere's the other paragraph I wrote.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nAnd then I have a little birthday present for you.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nI know it's not your birthday, but you're getting older,\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nlike all of us.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nIs that the present?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nA reminder of mortality.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nThis is the next paragraph I wrote.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nWell, like the girl in the cold open of lethal weapon one,\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nI was like fucking over a rail\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nto the point where people were tweeting,\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nI think Dan Harmon is going to kill himself tonight.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nI'm flattered.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nI wrote this into my Evernote pad.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:17.000\nA question of significance, period.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:21.000\nA topographic map of significance, period.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nEverything has an attribute, comma.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nEvery attribute is numerical.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nThat means every society\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nhas a weighted numerical amount of significance\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nand every element of that society is significant\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nto the extent that it affects the significance\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nof that society.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nGood morning, sober Dan.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.000\nYou have one message from...\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nHi, Dan.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nI gotta say, for some reason,\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nthat sounded racist to me.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nReally? You think the bottom line of that is\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\ndon't trust black people?\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nYou're going to use that to justify some shit.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\nAlright, so I have a special present for you.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nYeah, I know you love music.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nYeah, I know you love...

I am, I'm gonna, yes, I will be there. We spoke last night, it's, I was this close to\n\n13:28.280 --> 13:32.120\njumping down. You aren't, you didn't, you didn't really consider that. I can't think about it,\n\n13:32.120 --> 13:37.800\nsometimes. I did Bill Maher, I met Bill Maher last night, and I literally got\n\n13:37.800 --> 13:43.440\ntongue-tied. I, he said hi to me, and I couldn't get the words out, because I'm so\n\n13:43.440 --> 13:46.680\nscared of him. Because you, you were afraid you're gonna be like, you're fucking\n\n13:46.680 --> 13:54.000\ndick! No comment. I was just, I was just very intimidated. I admire him too. I,\n\n13:54.000 --> 14:01.240\nhe's a very distinct face, and I saw Bill Maher hanging out. Yeah. And probably, he\n\n14:01.240 --> 14:04.360\ndoesn't care that I mentioned that he was smoking a joint, like it was just\n\n14:04.360 --> 14:09.000\na weird, it was just walking around a party. I was like, Bill Maher, it's like weird to see\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.840\na famous face. Hey, Kumail, do you think, do you, would you liken me to like a\n\n14:12.840 --> 14:16.840\nstar fucker? Do you, do you think? No dude. There's no stars, I mean ten\n\n14:16.840 --> 14:20.160\nnations need, that was a fucking food. Do you think that this show is suffering?\n\n14:20.160 --> 14:25.080\nBecause it has celebrities? Is that what you think? No, no. So you just want to\n\n14:25.080 --> 14:29.040\nhang out and talk to me. You don't think that famous people coming up on the show\n\n14:29.040 --> 14:33.600\nis important? I think it really sells the show out, so I hope you have nobody else's\n\n14:33.600 --> 14:39.960\nfamous people. Fuck you, Dana Carvey's here! Fuck you!\n\n14:43.760 --> 14:57.440\nIsn't that fucking special? Yeah! Could it be Satan, you bitches? I'm trying to get hip.\n\n14:57.440 --> 15:01.720\nWhere do I sit? You sit anywhere you want. Well, there's a mic for every chair. Thank\n\n15:01.720 --> 15:09.200\nyou very much. This is in the way. Anyway, thanks for coming. I, and Dan\n\n15:09.200 --> 15:16.640\nHarmon, thank you. Thank you. Kumail. This is, I just want, could we, could you guys\n\n15:16.640 --> 15:21.120\nget a little closer? Is there any way to get them a little closer? Because I don't\n\n15:21.120 --> 15:25.320\nfeel as connected as I would within that far away. Is there any way to scooch up?\n\n15:25.320 --> 15:28.960\nJust a little bit? You're used to the SNL days where they were in a like a\n\n15:28.960 --> 15:33.000\nhyperbaric chamber. Yes, in L days. What are you saying, Dan? Orbiting a like space\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.320\nshuttle and then your stages would rotate. It was, it was nothing. You'd be\n\n15:36.320 --> 15:40.440\nsitting in a chair like this and then there'd be like five seconds and then\n\n15:40.440 --> 15:43.480\nthe red light would come on and you knew there were 20 million people and the\n\n15:43.480 --> 15:48.120\ncue cards were not properly placed and you had to improvise. Are you nervous yet?\n\n15:48.120 --> 15:55.360\nWhat year did you start? 1947. How do I look this good?\n\n15:55.360 --> 16:01.200\nNo, you look fucking great. I don't want to be that guy. I think I love you. No, I was 86. 86.\n\n16:01.200 --> 16:06.360\nSo when I was, when I was a kid, when I talked to people, I've had, I've been\n\n16:06.360 --> 16:10.440\nfortunate enough to have a career path where I have friends who have written an\n\n16:10.440 --> 16:16.640\nSNL and have been an SNL. Yeah. And it's like, okay, institutional comedy is stupid\n\n16:16.640 --> 16:20.280\nand bullshit. Right. Why would, how could that ever be funny? Yes. And then at the\n\n16:20.280 --> 16:23.200\nsame time, it's like, holy shit, I'm walking down the halls or there's a\n\n16:23.200 --> 16:29.160\nposter of, there's a John Belushi's headshot is on the wall, etc. And SNL\n\n16:29.160 --> 16:32.320\nhas endured. It's the only comedic institution that we have in this\n\n16:32.320 --> 16:35.920\ncountry that's lasted as long as it has. Well, what I did does seem very old\n\n16:35.920 --> 16:41.000\nfashion now and it did become, when I did the show in 96 with Stephen Colbert and\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:46.560\nSteve Carell, you guys familiar? The Dana Carvey sketch show. By that point, we\n\n16:46.560 --> 16:51.120\nthought it, I discovered that it was really considered corny and hack to have\n\n16:51.120 --> 16:55.560\na character with a catchphrase that you would repeat, you know, but they're hard\n\n16:55.560 --> 17:00.400\nto come by. I mean, well, isn't that special? My God. No, and you, yeah, once you\n\n17:00.400 --> 17:04.880\nfucking resonate, you don't, you don't back away from that. No, you, you, you, you\n\n17:04.880 --> 17:11.560\nare a people pleaser. Like you, I want to destroy the audience. I need to have, I\n\n17:11.560 --> 17:16.040\nneed, you know, but condescension is still funny to me, even though the character\n\n17:16.040 --> 17:20.720\nis so hacky, a guy in drag and notice it was, you know, it was, I didn't have fake\n\n17:20.720 --> 17:25.000\ntits or anything. First of all, it's not hacky. It was very specific and it's, it's\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:32.040\nstill very, very funny. Well, well, well, that's easy for you to say. My boner just\n\n17:32.040 --> 17:40.000\nstarted. Condescension is funny and she's the ultimate patronizing. It starts\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:47.040\nwith we. We like ourselves. Don't we? We did a show called community. Now it's on a\n\n17:47.040 --> 17:53.000\nthing called, you know, it's just, it's a, it's a sausage factory that you can work\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:57.880\nthrough any attitude. I realized later that I am passive aggressive, a nice\n\n17:57.880 --> 18:01.720\npassive aggressive guy. And a lot of my characters were just passive aggressive,\n\n18:01.720 --> 18:08.560\nyou know, so like, they're, they're, they're, explain how Hans and Franz are\n\n18:08.560 --> 18:13.360\npassive aggressive. Like, well, first of all, when we did them, you know, obviously\n\n18:13.360 --> 18:16.840\nit was born on Arnold and this and that Kevin and I were touring with Dennis\n\n18:16.840 --> 18:22.560\nMiller. So we saw Arnold on TV and we loved how he was, he always wins Arnold\n\n18:22.560 --> 18:26.040\nSchwarzenegger. Everything is organized. So this is what he said, you know, you're\n\n18:26.040 --> 18:32.400\non the road and you get to a hotel. I'm just quoting. I know the voice is fun.\n\n18:32.400 --> 18:37.520\nI can do it. They're happy. I'm happy. All right. You do the stairs. You break a\n\n18:37.520 --> 18:42.480\nlight sweat and you, you take a light shower and you put on a light white\n\n18:42.480 --> 18:48.600\ncotton shirt and, and you're ready for the evening. We thought that was so cool.\n\n18:48.600 --> 18:52.160\nWe repeated it for weeks and weeks and then we came up with the sort of\n\n18:52.160 --> 18:56.720\nmentally deficient cousins. And when we first came out with the padding, the\n\n18:56.720 --> 19:01.560\naudience expected us to be super strong and lift up and they soon found out we\n\n19:01.560 --> 19:05.680\nwere never going to lift weights. We were paranoid and delusional and we were\n\n19:05.680 --> 19:09.320\nfighting imaginary enemies. We were just stoked about fitness. Yeah, if you don't\n\n19:09.320 --> 19:13.600\nthink, yeah, but we were, there was that imaginary enemy. If you doubt us, if you\n\n19:13.600 --> 19:18.920\nthink that we are not properly pumped up men, we could, you know, stretch the\n\n19:18.920 --> 19:24.120\nflab of your back into the shape of a ladder and you could crawl back down in\n\n19:24.120 --> 19:33.200\nthe sewer because that's where losers live. So that was the whole, so it had a\n\n19:33.200 --> 19:37.760\ncartoon artifice. I never connected the dot that the church lady and Hansen\n\n19:37.760 --> 19:41.480\nFrans, they're, that's the thing they have in common is that they're, they're\n\n19:41.480 --> 19:46.640\ninactive. They are passive aggressive. Yeah, and they, I am developing a\n\n19:46.640 --> 19:52.000\nchurch lady Hansen Frans cartoon adventure movie. I had a booze at Comic-Con and\n\n19:52.000 --> 20:00.320\nnothing. Camille, why so quiet? My teeth are vibrating from excitement. I fucking\n\n20:00.320 --> 20:08.480\nlove you. Come here. Let me tell you, man. You are something very special, my\n\n20:08.480 --> 20:15.880\nfriend. Yeah, so anyway, that was that. You're sitting over there with your thing.\n\n20:15.880 --> 20:21.760\nIt's fun to do. Everyone does it. You're all, all of your impressions are, everyone\n\n20:21.760 --> 20:26.200\nflocks to do them. You're, no one knew how to do an impression of George Bush\n\n20:26.200 --> 20:33.160\nuntil you did it. I went to school the next day. I told you backstage like I, I\n\n20:33.160 --> 20:40.240\nwas in sophomore year. I remember, I could tell you the color of the walls. I\n\n20:40.240 --> 20:46.520\ncould tell you what was on the jockstraps on the floor when I gained respect from\n\n20:46.520 --> 20:52.680\nthe guys that would have otherwise been beating me up because I did my huge\n\n20:52.680 --> 20:57.800\nair quotes. My impression of Jimmy Stewart. Oh, Jimmy Stewart. I thought you're\n\n20:57.800 --> 21:03.200\ngoing because I watched and you had done your as I and then the jocks would go\n\n21:03.200 --> 21:06.720\nlike, Hey, Harmon, do do Jimmy Stewart. They don't know what Jimmy Stewart is. Neither\n\n21:06.720 --> 21:13.240\ndid I. Right. I knew that you, but you've seen it's a wonderful life, right? No,\n\n21:13.240 --> 21:23.200\nno. Absolutely not. Can we hear your version? Oh, I can't get my locker open. How do you do yours?\n\n21:23.200 --> 21:30.320\nI worked that thing for 20 years. There's nothing funnier and a visceral comic sense\n\n21:30.320 --> 21:38.840\nthan Jimmy Stewart swearing. So my first bit ever in the 70s in college, you know,\n\n21:38.840 --> 21:44.840\ndoing stand up in these shit box clubs, something familiar. Anyway, I'm doing\n\n21:44.840 --> 21:50.640\nwith him Shatner. Anyway, it was like Jimmy Stewart is a waiter. Yeah. Yeah. So do\n\n21:50.640 --> 21:57.120\nyou know what you want to order? Because you want to go slow. Yeah. So you don't\n\n21:57.120 --> 22:06.160\nknow what you want to order. So you're gonna, you're gonna make me wait. Well,\n\n22:06.160 --> 22:15.360\nfuck you. It's always funny, right? It's only funny when you do it. I mean, you did\n\n22:15.360 --> 22:19.120\na million of those things and like we fucking stood on your shoulders. I would\n\n22:19.120 --> 22:22.960\ngo to high school every day and I would be the funny guy in high school because\n\n22:22.960 --> 22:28.360\nI did impressions of your impressions. Well, I copied Jimmy Carter from Dan\n\n22:28.360 --> 22:32.120\nEckroyd. I used to record it on the TV and stuff, but you know, because a lot of\n\n22:32.120 --> 22:37.160\ntimes I didn't have your relationship with SNL when you were like, how old were\n\n22:37.160 --> 22:44.280\nyou in 1975? Was that when you didn't know basis? But I was. Don't ask, don't tell.\n\n22:44.280 --> 22:53.240\nWhy is this white? I need some pepper. No, I was 20. So I was 21, 22, 23, 24,\n\n22:53.240 --> 22:56.840\nwhatever. And it was this new show. It was a variety show for hippies. And they were\n\n22:56.840 --> 23:02.000\nbadass pirates. To me, you know, John Belushi and Bill Murray and those guys,\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:06.920\nthey would beat you up or make you laugh, you know? So I was completely in all of\n\n23:06.920 --> 23:10.440\nthe show and I auditioned for it three times for you guys out there and women\n\n23:10.440 --> 23:14.080\nwere trying to get on the show. Meaning that two times you went out there to\n\n23:14.080 --> 23:18.320\nNew York, you stood on the stage in front of and I've talked to people. No. No,\n\n23:18.320 --> 23:23.000\nmine was one of the worst ever. Get this, okay? The comedy store. Saturday Night Live\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:27.240\npeople are out there. It's like 84, two years before I got the show. One comic\n\n23:27.240 --> 23:32.480\nafter another, no MC, just and now somebody from. So at midnight, this\n\n23:32.480 --> 23:37.480\ncomedian named Sam Kenneson goes up in his prime, who I thought was maybe the\n\n23:37.480 --> 23:41.480\nbest standup ever, arguably the best standup ever, destroys dismantles,\n\n23:41.480 --> 23:45.960\nlevitates the room. I'm off the side and now it's Dana Flungam with somebody, you\n\n23:45.960 --> 23:52.000\nknow, I go up and go in that festival, then that dead silence. I'll never be\n\n23:52.000 --> 24:01.600\non Saturday Night Live. Isn't that special? Isn't that special? Isn't that special? I don't know.\n\n24:01.600 --> 24:05.720\nWhen are people going to realize how special everything is? In desperation, I went,\n\n24:05.720 --> 24:14.360\nwell, fuck you. And I still didn't get the show. So I didn't, you know. So you\n\n24:14.360 --> 24:17.880\nstopped me in the middle of that, like you go out, when you auditioned for\n\n24:17.880 --> 24:23.760\nSNL, you go out to New York, you go out on a stage, there is absolutely no, from\n\n24:23.760 --> 24:29.320\nwhat I've heard, there are eight people sitting in the back of a dark room.\n\n24:29.320 --> 24:34.720\nThey're instructed not to laugh. There are video cameras pointed at you\n\n24:34.720 --> 24:39.320\neverywhere and you know, because you've walked past the writer's room on your\n\n24:39.320 --> 24:43.240\nway to the audition, you fully know that there is a feed to the writer's room.\n\n24:43.240 --> 24:49.800\nYou can see that there is a room full of sarcastic snarky writers who are\n\n24:49.800 --> 24:55.400\nwatching every audition in their own room. You walk past that reality and walk\n\n24:55.400 --> 25:00.160\nout onto a dark stage under the thrust. And Lauren, I realized later, wanted to\n\n25:00.160 --> 25:02.960\ntest you, because I'm bombing out there. I was doing Chomping Broccoli on the\n\n25:02.960 --> 25:06.160\npiano and doing these things. And then there was a pause. It was Lauren and like\n\n25:06.160 --> 25:10.360\nNora Dunn and three other people. And Lauren said, oh, do you have anything else\n\n25:10.360 --> 25:16.080\nthat we could see? Is there anything? Or are you just going to do that?\n\n25:16.080 --> 25:19.920\nAnd I realized, are you just going to keep chopping broccoli?\n\n25:19.920 --> 25:24.280\nIsn't the broccoli chopped at this point? At this point, I would think you could\n\n25:24.280 --> 25:29.360\nfucking chop broccoli. I'd say the broccoli would be diced at this point.\n\n25:29.360 --> 25:33.000\nSo it's like, he was testing to see when the red light went on, if you wouldn't\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.720\njust go, you know. Meltdown, what do you mean by that though, really?\n\n25:36.720 --> 25:40.680\nWell, literally, well, the meltdown wouldn't be so much that you just cry and go off.\n\n25:40.680 --> 25:44.240\nBut it would be that you would stumble bum, because they're flipping credit cards.\n\n25:44.240 --> 25:49.240\nHe was betting for people who are good at auditioning, as opposed to people who\n\n25:49.240 --> 25:53.160\ncould be part of a live show. Yeah, you know, the first three years, it's just\n\n25:53.160 --> 25:57.200\nridiculous. I mean, you see how people go out there. You don't really know. It's\n\n25:57.200 --> 26:00.680\nin the cards. You don't know your lines. The show's under rehearse. You don't want\n\n26:00.680 --> 26:03.680\nto look like you're reading the cue card. So, like, if I was doing a scene with\n\n26:03.680 --> 26:07.560\nyou, and it's like, hey, let's go get some milk. I know there's a card over there.\n\n26:07.560 --> 26:12.080\nSo I didn't want to just do this split thing. God forbid. So I'd go, let's go\n\n26:12.080 --> 26:15.760\nfor milk. And then I would kind of look over there for my next line, grab it, come\n\n26:15.760 --> 26:20.360\nback, you know. And Phil Hartman was the best at that. They were testing for\n\n26:20.360 --> 26:24.360\nthat in the audition. No, well, let me back up one story that's a little\n\n26:24.360 --> 26:27.720\ninteresting. So I auditioned at the comedy store in the Improv. I always\n\n26:27.720 --> 26:32.440\nbombed. I didn't get SNL. It came around again in 86. Rosie O'Donnell was playing\n\n26:32.440 --> 26:36.720\nIgby's on the West Side, 100 seat club, kind of like this, small. I called, I didn't\n\n26:36.720 --> 26:40.520\nknow Rosie, but I said, can I go to, can I go there and audition for the show?\n\n26:40.520 --> 26:45.040\nBecause Lauren Michaels was going to see me. So she allowed me to come in and do\n\n26:45.040 --> 26:48.880\nlike 40 minutes in a room like this. And Lauren showed up. Remember, I'm not on\n\n26:48.880 --> 26:55.400\nTV. I'm scared. It's Saturday Night Live with Cher. And the president of the\n\n26:55.400 --> 27:00.880\nnetwork at the time. So it's just like, I was just so scared and so nervous, but it\n\n27:00.880 --> 27:04.480\nwas a regular audience like this. I did okay. That really helped me get the show.\n\n27:04.480 --> 27:11.840\nDid you talk to Cher? No, I never really liked her. So you probably don't have like\n\n27:11.840 --> 27:16.240\na really good Cher impression. No, I never worked on Cher. Do you want to hear mine?\n\n27:16.240 --> 27:25.720\nYeah. I don't know. I like it. It's based on someone else's half-breed. Oh, yeah.\n\n27:25.720 --> 27:38.160\nYou can't have a Cher impression without Christmas lights. How about Jimmy Stewart explains the\n\n27:38.160 --> 27:43.400\nbanking crisis? Because all I ever knew about banking was from It's a Wonderful Life. Mr. Potter,\n\n27:43.400 --> 27:47.840\nthere's a run on the bank, you know, kind of thing. So here's what they did. You see,\n\n27:47.840 --> 27:53.880\nMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, they took the bad mortgages and they packaged them into\n\n27:53.880 --> 28:01.080\nan investment vehicle, kind of like a security set. Then they got moody to put four stars\n\n28:01.080 --> 28:07.640\non them, an S&P, you know, and they sold them to investors, but they knew they were bad.\n\n28:07.640 --> 28:11.920\nSo they did a thing, they shorted them, so they bet against them while they sold them.\n\n28:11.920 --> 28:19.000\nSo if they lose, they win. If they win, they win. And you all put together, well, fuck\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:29.840\nyou. Okay, now, this is the first time I've understood the housing crisis. I never fucking\n\n28:29.840 --> 28:35.600\npaid attention. You know what? Now I'm like, those fuckers. It really is kind of that simple.\n\n28:35.600 --> 28:40.520\nIt feels like you're in a taking request mode. So I'll do and say whatever. I'm not going\n\n28:40.520 --> 28:44.840\nto make you do anything. I'll do and say whatever. But I would only say that it would be interesting\n\n28:44.840 --> 28:52.920\nto hear what would happen if Ted Kennedy... Ted Kennedy! When I returned, Mary Jo and\n\n28:52.920 --> 29:02.360\nthe call were gone. If Ted Kennedy got into a hotel room and found out that Kirk Douglas\n\n29:02.360 --> 29:08.600\nhad the same hotel room and that they, because they both, the hotel was overbooked. Can I\n\n29:08.600 --> 29:13.240\ndo it with Burt Lancaster? Okay, right. Burt Lancaster is there too. I did a movie with\n\n29:13.240 --> 29:19.120\nBurt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. Years later, I learned to do them and I don't really like\n\n29:19.120 --> 29:25.880\nblue humor in the sense of anal penetration and cheese. Okay, I hate that. But I like\n\n29:25.880 --> 29:31.080\nthe old fashioned vernacular applied to sexual situations. So this is Burt Lancaster and Kirk\n\n29:31.080 --> 29:37.520\nDouglas two male macho superstar icons as lovers. Here we go. This is what made John\n\n29:37.520 --> 29:45.280\nLovitz throw up in a parking lot. You mean because he was laughing so hard. Not to pat\n\n29:45.280 --> 29:50.160\nyourself on the back, but John Lovitz... John loves this. John's Burt Lancaster, Kirk\n\n29:50.160 --> 29:57.720\nDouglas. I want you. I want you very bad. It doesn't mean we're gay. We're two men having\n\n29:57.720 --> 30:16.680\nfun. I'm inside you now. I want you inside me and I need you. I want all of it. I don't\n\n30:16.680 --> 30:24.840\nwant just his stem. I don't want it all. All right, son, slow down. Don't keep bucking\n\n30:24.840 --> 30:29.400\naround like that. You keep bucking around like that. I got to pull out and splooge all over\n\n30:29.400 --> 30:45.120\nyour backside. It's the poetry. Can't do this on Fallon. I love Jimmy though. You did chopping\n\n30:45.120 --> 30:50.320\nbroccoli on Fallon and fucking everyone went wild because chopping broccoli is the comedic\n\n30:50.320 --> 30:57.040\nversion of Dancing in the Dark. You're the Bruce Springsteen of comedy. It was Jimmy's\n\n30:57.040 --> 31:00.920\nidea to do it with an orchestra this last time. I don't know if you saw it, but I only\n\n31:00.920 --> 31:05.680\ndid it once on SNL and I did it the very first show right before the end. You did it in your\n\n31:05.680 --> 31:11.760\nstand-up special, right? That's what I find special. Yeah, but I only did it once on SNL.\n\n31:11.760 --> 31:15.840\nI don't know why I resonate. It's so stupid. I think there's a ton of people in this audience\n\n31:15.840 --> 31:19.600\nprobably. I think the median age is probably 25 and I think that probably without doing\n\n31:19.600 --> 31:24.280\na lot of math, I think that puts them around the age. When I was 10 years old, Martin Short\n\n31:24.280 --> 31:28.520\nwas like, yeah, that's how I learned about comedy. I think the irony is that actually\n\n31:28.520 --> 31:33.640\nin SNL terms, Lauren Michaels wasn't even there. Those were the Embersol years. No,\n\n31:33.640 --> 31:36.840\nnot that year. I love the Martin Short. But I was like, holy shit, Martin Short is the\n\n31:36.840 --> 31:41.920\nfucking, and I would just go to grade school and I would do. At Grimly? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\n31:41.920 --> 31:46.520\nAnd I would do everything that Martin Short did. That's, and my hackness extended to high\n\n31:46.520 --> 31:51.040\nschool. I was still, then I was doing you. I was going, oh, I'm going to be in a store.\n\n31:51.040 --> 31:56.680\nCan I go? Can I be on a date with you? Not going to do it. I'm not going to drive at this\n\n31:56.680 --> 32:01.080\njuncture. Will you be on a date with me? And it was all you. Did you do John Travolta or\n\n32:01.080 --> 32:06.080\nRobin Leach? Did you do some of the other stuff? I'm Robin. Did you do John Travolta?\n\n32:06.080 --> 32:14.280\nThey're all kind of. I want a Christmas tree with lights. I'm Robin Leach and I'm yelling\n\n32:14.280 --> 32:22.280\nand I don't know why. Now, that is really an 80s reference. I'm Robin Leach and I was\n\n32:22.280 --> 32:28.920\none of a life and I'm going to pump you up. I would just do that. It's very good. Let\n\n32:28.920 --> 32:34.000\nme tell you, this is Regis Filbert. I'm 87 years old, baby. I love Regis. I love what\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:39.440\nyou have going on here, Dad Slavitt or whatever your name is, Daddy Flopla. And Farnel, you're\n\n32:39.440 --> 32:46.120\nterrific. Farnel! When you get your green card, you can call me. You're terrific. Anyway,\n\n32:46.120 --> 32:50.880\nI love you all. You're cover card people. It's a wonderful rhythm to do. You just,\n\n32:50.880 --> 32:55.800\nyou take Groucho Marx and slow it down, you know? Pick a singer what and divide it up\n\n32:55.800 --> 33:00.520\non you. Pick a singer what and divide it up on you. Pick a singer what and divide it up\n\n33:00.520 --> 33:06.520\non you. He's doing Groucho with a nasal a little bit faster. So, hopefully kids are\n\n33:06.520 --> 33:13.640\nenjoying these. Got it. Got it. Do it. I don't want to keep you.\n\n33:13.640 --> 33:18.240\nMine are great. Mine are great. Can I ask you a question? When did you know you could\n\n33:18.240 --> 33:22.240\ndo Impressions? I feel like there's a certain, certain people are just good at them and certain\n\n33:22.240 --> 33:26.160\npeople are just bad at them and in the good part, obviously some people are better than\n\n33:26.160 --> 33:29.040\nothers. You're fantastic. When did you realize you could do that?\n\n33:29.040 --> 33:35.160\nThat I could alter my voice. Literally, really, it was when we had a, the Beatles came on\n\n33:35.160 --> 33:40.320\nEd Sullivan. I was nine years old and we had a Collier's Encyclopedia LP where the Beatles\n\n33:40.320 --> 33:44.520\nwere being interviewed. So, the first altering of my voice when I was nine years old, and\n\n33:44.520 --> 33:48.800\nI had three older brothers and a younger sister, was I was able, I was able, you know, and\n\n33:48.800 --> 33:53.360\nI'll do, I'll do the bit, you know, it's like I go out to my mom, you know, after the Beatles\n\n33:53.360 --> 33:57.360\nare on, I go, you, hello mom, do you think I could get me some pancakes?\n\n33:57.360 --> 34:02.160\nIt's like a very musical. Yeah. So, that was the first voice.\n\n34:02.160 --> 34:07.280\nYou've been getting fucking pancakes ever since. And it's still, you know, I do these\n\n34:07.280 --> 34:14.760\nfor myself sometimes. I mean, it's very comforting to be in this persona, you know. Here we are,\n\n34:14.760 --> 34:22.000\nyou have a little gooby-gooby. I mean, it's, it's very, because McCartney is the most humble\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:27.440\ngenius in the world, you know, he won't go, you go, Paul, I just want to say, you know,\n\n34:27.440 --> 34:34.080\nI, you know, we did some plunkers, you know, John would get a guitar and we'd face each\n\n34:34.080 --> 34:38.840\nother and we're plunking, you know, and I'm looking at him, he's looking at me and we're\n\n34:38.840 --> 34:48.360\nplunking away. And that's how we came up with Abbey Rose, but it's a comfortable, yeah.\n\n34:48.360 --> 34:53.920\nAnd I do it for myself. This is not a joke. George Bush Sr., that robotic, monosyllabic\n\n34:53.920 --> 34:59.840\nthing is comforting for me because I tend to, tend toward anxiety. But like I, he would\n\n34:59.840 --> 35:08.480\nsay, he'd go, well, Camille, there, sidekick, nice mic, quick-witted audience there, just\n\n35:08.480 --> 35:24.040\nsodas, comic area, Dan Harmon, writer, superb, community, yahoo, money. It's just, we can\n\n35:24.040 --> 35:27.280\njust say thank you, Dana Carby for coming, or you can hang out all night as far as I'm\n\n35:27.280 --> 35:31.040\nconcerned, but. Probably have peaked already, but I, do they have any requests? I'll do\n\n35:31.040 --> 35:37.240\none more. Oh, okay. He's taking requests. Well, well, well, we raised our hand very\n\n35:37.240 --> 35:50.240\nquickly. Oh, Garth, yeah. Well, I'll tell you quickly. Garth, Mike, the brilliant Mike\n\n35:50.240 --> 35:54.320\nMyers came in with, with Wayne and then he asked me to be a sidekick. He said his name\n\n35:54.320 --> 36:00.800\nis Garth. That's what he, and he digs Wayne. And I saw, I saw he had brown hair. So I remember,\n\n36:00.800 --> 36:06.640\nI went to the makeup area and I saw I could do a blonde wig and I could wear those kind\n\n36:06.640 --> 36:12.000\nof Peter Seller glasses. And then I didn't really have a construct for the surfer dude\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:16.400\nnerd, like, what are you doing? You know, that kind of thing, which is, we'll do it,\n\n36:16.400 --> 36:22.360\nhow I ruin Wayne's World 2, we can do next time. But, by bad makeup and pushing too hard,\n\n36:22.360 --> 36:28.120\nyeah. I'll tell you. Did you produce Wayne's World 2? Do you, why would you take, why would\n\n36:28.120 --> 36:34.200\nyou feel guilty? Well, I was 38 and there was a line in the, in the movie that Garth\n\n36:34.200 --> 36:40.360\njust, Garth just got pukes, you know. So, and I'm 38 playing the character. And so the\n\n36:40.360 --> 36:44.440\nedict was we got to cover my five o'clock shadow. I'm not Richard Nixon, but if you\n\n36:44.440 --> 36:49.720\nwatch the first movie, I had very light makeup. So they tried to cover my five o'clock shadow.\n\n36:49.720 --> 36:54.480\nBy the time they did that, then they caked it on. So I'm, I look orange, I look like\n\n36:54.480 --> 36:59.520\nan orange Betty Davis in the second movie. And then my performance. But anyway, but what\n\n36:59.520 --> 37:06.200\ndoes that have to do with you? This is what's fascinating to me about you, your self-afacement,\n\n37:06.200 --> 37:12.200\nyour self-awareness, your accountability in the face of being a fucking icon who is this\n\n37:12.200 --> 37:17.960\nguy who doesn't like, like I, Jim Carrey hasn't come out here yet. But I think, I think there's\n\n37:17.960 --> 37:21.840\na kind of archetype that we have in our heads. We're like, Oh, this guy that comes out and\n\n37:21.840 --> 37:28.840\nmakes everybody happy is this clown. But you're so smart and so humble and so almost to the\n\n37:28.840 --> 37:32.800\npoint of like, do you say stuff like that? No, there was really good stuff that I liked\n\n37:32.800 --> 37:37.520\nthat I did here and there, but most of it was disappointing. How could that possibly be\n\n37:37.520 --> 37:42.320\nyour fault? What, what, what, what, what, what was your role in Wayne's World too? Aside\n\n37:42.320 --> 37:46.120\nfrom Karth, your job was to show up and play Karth. Look, in the first movie, I mean, I\n\n37:46.120 --> 37:50.360\ndid, I trusted the rhythm in the first movie based on my brother, my brother, Brad, who\n\n37:50.360 --> 37:55.840\ndoes, I took the rhythm from my brother. We could, he would love to come on this podcast.\n\n37:55.840 --> 38:01.000\nHe's an LA. He's welcome to, he's great. And he had this rhythm and this was the best\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:09.680\nrhythm of Garth. That was the goal. And I did it mostly in the first movie. And then\n\n38:09.680 --> 38:14.000\nthe second movie, you know, it just became more cartoony. And I just lost that thread\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:21.000\nand I was pushing and you blame yourself for fucking Wayne's World too. I do. I fucked\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:28.640\nWayne's World too. You're insane. I am orange. I am orange and I'm pushing and I'm mugging.\n\n38:28.640 --> 38:34.400\nBut in the first movie, I had some very nice moments where I stayed in this rhythm. I did.\n\n38:34.400 --> 38:38.640\nThis was the core of Garth and I look at it and I go, what the fuck happened to me that\n\n38:38.640 --> 38:46.120\nI pushed in the second movie? Maybe it was the money. I know you said in the green room\n\n38:46.120 --> 38:59.120\nyou're sleepy. Can we stay for just a little bit? Sure. Yeah. Can I bring my, from Hollywood,\n\n38:59.120 --> 39:06.800\nCalifornia, Meltdown Comics, Harmontown. Jeff, Jeff, now it's session. Please welcome to\n\n39:06.800 --> 39:16.800\nthe stage the mayor of Harmontown. It's Dan Harmon. Jeff. Let's start this fucker.\n\n39:16.800 --> 39:23.480\nJeff, I imagine you driving here, reading Twitter and being like, what the fuck is going\n\n39:23.480 --> 39:31.800\non? Tenacious D? Dana Carvey? Tenacious D with her? Oh shit, Dana Carvey. Hello. Jeff,\n\n39:31.800 --> 39:37.080\nwe started without you. Now, what I was going to say is. I overslept. I set my alarm for\n\n39:37.080 --> 39:45.080\nthe wrong. I set my alarm for AM instead of PM. It happens to podcasters too. It's okay.\n\n39:45.080 --> 39:50.080\nYou're not taking blame for that and he's blaming himself for Wings World II. That's why I wanted\n\n39:50.080 --> 39:58.800\nto bring up my fiance, my 29 year old fiance, Erin McGathy, so that she could talk to. Before\n\n39:58.800 --> 40:06.440\nyou leave, Dana, I wanted you to talk to the love of my life because that's insane hearing\n\n40:06.440 --> 40:13.320\nthat. Your self-deprecation, it's too far. It's too much. There was good things I did.\n\n40:13.320 --> 40:19.920\nThat just bald-faced fact that I destroyed Wings World II. Listen, here's the example.\n\n40:19.920 --> 40:24.200\nThis is not my fault. Is this what Mike Myers has been telling you, Dana? Yeah, does he\n\n40:24.200 --> 40:31.400\ncall you and leave faster? Don't let him push you around. No, Mike was consistent. Here's\n\n40:31.400 --> 40:35.240\nthe story. Okay, look, if you budget something, they're going to spend the budget. So the\n\n40:35.240 --> 40:40.680\nfirst movie, we had 12 million in 36 days. So we're on the car and he goes, yes, she's\n\n40:40.680 --> 40:47.120\na babe. And I go, yeah, if she was a president, she'd be Abraham Lincoln, right? So we make\n\n40:47.120 --> 40:52.200\nfun of corporate profiteering. We hold up the stuff. Meanwhile, heroin's paying us.\n\n40:52.200 --> 40:58.120\nNever mind. The second movie, we have a $40 million budget. And so Wayne and Garth suddenly\n\n40:58.120 --> 41:04.200\nhave a loft that is a $500,000 a lot. I remember walking into it and go, what? What happened\n\n41:04.200 --> 41:10.560\nto the humble little set? Did everything got blown up? Did you write the movie? I basically,\n\n41:10.560 --> 41:16.240\nand another thing I regret, I did the arc with Kim Basinger. I did the- Yeah, but you\n\n41:16.240 --> 41:22.640\ndid you rate the movie? Not the movie per se, but the Garth parts for the most part. Dana\n\n41:22.640 --> 41:30.080\nCarvey, what? You have never done anything wrong ever. Oh no. You need to understand\n\n41:30.080 --> 41:36.000\nthat. You need to understand that you have never done anything wrong. No, the first one\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:42.160\nwas really good. I mean, it did inflation adjusted like $275 million. I'm not that I\n\n41:42.160 --> 41:48.120\nchecked. So Dana Carvey. Inflation adjusted. Dana Carvey, why do you think- Can we talk\n\n41:48.120 --> 41:56.520\nDana? No, Dana Carvey. Dana Carvey. Why? Yes. What was it? So you went in, why did\n\n41:56.520 --> 42:01.400\nit feel different making that movie? You said it's a bigger budget? It was a bigger budget.\n\n42:01.400 --> 42:10.760\nMy face was orange. I think that, look, the first time we were on the car, we had an hour\n\n42:10.760 --> 42:15.040\nto shoot that. You know, Babe Abraham Lincoln, Mike's laughing, I'm laughing. It's just like,\n\n42:15.040 --> 42:20.960\nyou know, almost in one take. Then the second time, we had two full days to shoot us hanging\n\n42:20.960 --> 42:28.040\nout on the car with like 55 takes of different camera angles. So you tend to get bored and\n\n42:28.040 --> 42:31.600\nyou tend to push, you know? I mean, that's all. That just happened to me. Are you looking\n\n42:31.600 --> 42:35.240\nback on Wayne's World 2 as being some kind of point where you think- Are you thinking\n\n42:35.240 --> 42:38.040\nthat you did something wrong on that movie? No, no, I don't think I did anything wrong.\n\n42:38.040 --> 42:42.280\nI just, I did, my instincts were a little off on that one, but they were spot on in\n\n42:42.280 --> 42:46.040\nthe first one. So one out of two ain't bad. May I, I can't- Is this gonna, I have to\n\n42:46.040 --> 42:50.680\napologize. No, no, no, I think it's important to have a conversation. We've never- Well,\n\n42:50.680 --> 42:56.960\nthere's many, many other regrets I have. So, emotionally. What's, what's that, Baby?\n\n42:56.960 --> 43:05.080\nI can't handle this show emotionally. I'm losing my fucking mind. I like, I, my hero,\n\n43:05.080 --> 43:12.240\nI, I just, uh, I can't deal. She loves Mike Myers. I, I do too. Her story, she loves\n\n43:12.240 --> 43:18.200\nKurt Lancaster. Um, such a thrill. I have had the opportunity to meet many famous people.\n\n43:18.200 --> 43:26.080\nI can't, so. Um, they were, I, I'm not completely, it's not like, uh- I will start crying. There\n\n43:26.080 --> 43:30.600\nwas stuff that I liked. I mean, I love, uh, Massive Heaven when Harry, I love the McLaughlin\n\n43:30.600 --> 43:35.400\nreports. I love the Carson's I did with Phil. Uh, there's a lot of stuff I, I did like,\n\n43:35.400 --> 43:39.080\nand I liked the First Wayne's World, but second one, I fucked it. I feel- I, when I was in\n\n43:39.080 --> 43:47.120\nhigh school. Uh-oh. Dana, you know, backstage, I told you, I, I really like you, and I said\n\n43:47.120 --> 43:51.000\nthe words, I don't care about how you feel about this emotionally. I don't, I know that\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:59.840\nI'm embarrassing you, but I like you so much. Um. Thank you. You talked to my woman backstage.\n\n43:59.840 --> 44:04.520\nI don't want to drill the conversation. Please say you wrote a song. I really want you to\n\n44:04.520 --> 44:13.040\nbreak the song. I, uh, when I was in high school, I had a, a Yahoo email account, and\n\n44:13.040 --> 44:20.320\nafter speaking with Dana. You had email on high school? I did. Wow. She's a lot younger.\n\n44:20.320 --> 44:29.400\nAnd I told Dana backstage that when, when his first HBO special came out in 1995, yeah,\n\n44:29.400 --> 44:37.480\nI recorded it with my little, uh, uh, tape player. Kids, there used to be these boxes\n\n44:37.480 --> 44:43.640\nwith tape inside them. I recorded it and me and my brother both had copies of it. And\n\n44:43.640 --> 44:48.160\nwhen we would walk to school, we would look at each other for two years. We would look\n\n44:48.160 --> 44:52.280\nat each other and be like, and go. And we would listen to Dana Carvey's special on\n\n44:52.280 --> 44:57.040\nthe way to school together. And I went to, I was like, I feel like I may have written\n\n44:57.040 --> 45:05.560\na, uh, diary. That all that makes me feel is like, I wish I tried harder. I think you\n\n45:05.560 --> 45:12.760\ntried really hard. I don't know what, if she's chewing something up, I, I don't want to derail\n\n45:12.760 --> 45:17.200\nher, but I, I, the, the overwhelming feeling I have when I hear you talk about yourself\n\n45:17.200 --> 45:20.320\nbecause I don't think you're fishing for it. I think you're a guy that works really,\n\n45:20.320 --> 45:23.720\nreally hard from it. Cause we didn't even talk about the fact that you were on this\n\n45:23.720 --> 45:29.400\nMeg Ryan sitcom when you were like, like our, our public consciousness of you was like,\n\n45:29.400 --> 45:34.480\noh, you were on SNL and then you were in SNL and then there were our radar blips and stuff.\n\n45:34.480 --> 45:39.800\nBut the, you were, you worked your entire life. You tried to make people laugh the entire\n\n45:39.800 --> 45:44.640\ntime and you never stopped. And I don't, I think that there's a million people that\n\n45:44.640 --> 45:50.560\nwe look at publicly and we go, uh, oh, that guy, uh, he thought he was something and then\n\n45:50.560 --> 45:54.720\nthat's why he did this. I think it was like, like you were church lady and you were Hans\n\n45:54.720 --> 45:59.880\nand Franz and you were doing the shit. And then everyone loved you. America loved you.\n\n45:59.880 --> 46:03.000\nAnd then there were a couple of movies where you were like with Nicholas Cage and you were\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:10.480\ngoing, Hey, I'm a cat burglar. And it was, it was, is it blank slate? Trapped in paradise.\n\n46:10.480 --> 46:15.960\nYeah. That movie's awesome. Clean slate is a fucking great movie. Oh man. Well, I won't\n\n46:15.960 --> 46:21.480\neven go to there. But the idea that you're responsible for range world two, not being\n\n46:21.480 --> 46:25.680\nas good as one is it's fucking insane to me. That's so insane. It wasn't totally mine.\n\n46:25.680 --> 46:29.640\nI just was disappointed in my instincts. But what happened to me is I did not, I grew up\n\n46:29.640 --> 46:35.000\nvery humble, uh, you know, uh, dad was a high school teacher, uh, five kids. So between\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:40.200\n80 and 86, when I was doing standup, I took everything they gave me and because I had\n\n46:40.200 --> 46:44.520\nthe reverse dumb blonde effect, like I had a little teen idol thing going. I had blonde\n\n46:44.520 --> 46:51.600\nhair and I had a real baby face. So no one thought I was a con. Take it. Take it. No\n\n46:51.600 --> 46:56.280\none thought I was a calm. Yeah. I don't like where I'm sitting either. A piece of bubblegum\n\n46:56.280 --> 47:00.960\nthat can make children. But that's why I did all those straight roles. Although I will\n\n47:00.960 --> 47:06.680\nsay if I'm going to lose my fiance to anybody, I would like it to be Janet Carmen. Can we\n\n47:06.680 --> 47:12.680\nhear this? Is this real? It's real. It's real. It's from my fan fiction. What is this? This\n\n47:12.680 --> 47:18.400\nis, uh, with my Yahoo mail account. I would email myself and you guys have done this before.\n\n47:18.400 --> 47:24.080\nI like sit yourself. There's no need for you to shake your head. So aggressively, not really\n\n47:24.080 --> 47:28.280\nlooking for people like you. I'm looking for other people that are like, yes, I don't need\n\n47:28.280 --> 47:36.160\nyou to say no. I'm glad, I'm glad they're getting married because I have, I've just kind\n\n47:36.160 --> 47:43.760\nof got to know this dynamic and it seems like perfection. I do love you immediately jumped\n\n47:43.760 --> 47:48.960\ninto couples counseling us upon meeting us after 30 seconds. Stubbornness is the key\n\n47:48.960 --> 47:53.040\nto a long relationship. But both are stubborn. I hate you. You hate me, but I ain't quitting\n\n47:53.040 --> 48:00.240\nyou. I, uh, with my Yahoo mail account, and I still do this with my current account, I'll\n\n48:00.240 --> 48:06.360\nmail myself, uh, diary entries basically. It just like, I'm angry about this thing. I\n\n48:06.360 --> 48:10.600\nlike this thing, but I, I, I had a feeling that maybe I talked about Dana Carvey in one\n\n48:10.600 --> 48:18.040\nof these entries and I searched his name and my Yahoo mail and an email came up and, uh,\n\n48:18.040 --> 48:23.960\nit's very short and I would like to read it. So this is you as a teenager. This is me.\n\n48:23.960 --> 48:28.360\nUh, it's, it's, I feel like this is your life or something. I'm, this is embarrassing. Go\n\n48:28.360 --> 48:34.360\nahead. I want to hear it. Yeah. This is you at what age do you think? Uh, 2001. So, six.\n\n48:34.360 --> 48:42.240\nSo, 13 years ago. 16. But six years after the special. Yes. So you weren't old enough\n\n48:42.240 --> 48:50.320\nto do anything when 9-11 happened. Hey, none of us were. That's true. Everything changed.\n\n48:50.320 --> 48:59.480\nThat's true. Good point, Camille. We were all children before then. We all, we were all 16.\n\n48:59.480 --> 49:12.280\nAmerica was 16. Yeah. We were only 16. All right. Read it. Read it. Okay. All right. What,\n\n49:12.280 --> 49:20.000\nwhat the fuck? Oh, it's my heart playing. Okay. I'm just, I, I'm gonna read it. I'm gonna read it.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:28.680\nAnd I would only feel comfortable reading this on stage. With Dana Carvey. Subject Dana Carvey.\n\n49:28.680 --> 49:34.760\nSubject Dana Carvey. It's my fiancé. I'm not going to, I'm just gonna read, I'm saying this to\n\n49:34.760 --> 49:38.360\nmyself because I'm going to read through this and I'm not going to editorialize because I will\n\n49:38.360 --> 49:44.600\nfeel compelled to do so because I don't think I sound very smart. Just, just present it and we'll,\n\n49:44.600 --> 49:55.240\nwe'll judge it. Okay. That's a tradition as old as time. There, I'm, I'm told this moment I haven't\n\n49:55.240 --> 49:59.320\nreally felt that we were friends, but in this moment I feel like we are friends. Just read it. It's\n\n49:59.320 --> 50:02.960\ngonna be very sweet. I'm very excited. It's very short. Okay. I'm very excited. Hello, older me.\n\n50:02.960 --> 50:15.800\nOh God. How are you? I'm okay, but I'm working, I'm working thought things. Can I judge you right\n\n50:15.800 --> 50:24.520\nnow? No. It's very short. Here is personal and real thought. To be an artist. To be a comedic\n\n50:24.520 --> 50:36.640\nartist in all caps. To mold, to mold thine artifice like clay to the noble end of create joy. To\n\n50:36.640 --> 50:42.080\nexhibit kindness and performance absent of personal need. To be a clown, but not because you're\n\n50:42.080 --> 50:49.440\nscarier, stupid, but because you sacrifice your pride for the audience's joy. To make people laugh\n\n50:49.440 --> 50:56.560\nin all caps. This is what I, this is what is important. This is what I aspire to. This is what\n\n50:56.560 --> 51:04.480\nI promise. That's it. And it's about Dana Carby. By the way, Dana Carby. That's a hand for\n\n51:04.480 --> 51:18.120\nDana Carby for coming out. Please let him know when you see him on the sidewalk that nothing bad\n\n51:18.120 --> 51:24.600\nwas ever his fault. All he ever wanted to do is make everyone happy. That's all he ever wanted.\n\n51:24.600 --> 51:33.760\nI think he succeeded. So you, so that email, that email was about, you wrote that about Dana\n\n51:33.760 --> 51:40.600\nCarby. Yeah. You must not have seen Wayne's World too. You know, he really fucked that movie up.\n\n51:40.600 --> 51:49.680\nOh God. Now that he's gone, holy shit. I blame it all on Garth. Yeah. Wayne's World P.U., right?\n\n51:49.680 --> 51:57.280\nI just wish it was Wayne's World. And there was, well it was Wayne's World, but I mean, I, I just\n\n51:57.280 --> 52:04.360\nwanted more Wayne and less Garth. Let's bring up Tenacious D. No, they're not, okay. I gotta say,\n\n52:04.360 --> 52:12.000\nhonestly. Jeff is, Jeff is, Jeff, you, you, you realize you got here late. We started the show\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:16.600\nwithout you. As far as I'm concerned. As far as I'm concerned, the show started the moment I arrived.\n\n52:16.600 --> 52:25.920\nRight? That is not true. Tenacious D was here. Fuck Tenacious D. They left. It's all honestly\n\n52:25.920 --> 52:31.440\nvery inspiring to hear him talk like that, being as, you know, done so much amazing stuff as he\n\n52:31.440 --> 52:37.320\nhas. He still has. I fucking love that guy so much. I, I, I, it's not, it's like, we had, you know,\n\n52:37.320 --> 52:41.120\nI don't know, people come traipsing out here. Wait, is there music playing? Yeah, there's music\n\n52:41.120 --> 52:49.160\nplaying. Are you still at home, Jeff? I had a great nap. I, I'm in such a euphoric state. I thought\n\n52:49.160 --> 52:57.840\nthat was just in my head. For real. There is no, like, it's, it's a, it's a really big deal. Yeah,\n\n52:57.840 --> 53:03.400\nit's huge for me. I don't think, like Martin's short, if Martin's short, we're ever to come by.\n\n53:03.400 --> 53:09.480\nFuck Martin's short. I think I would, I would, I would, I would go into a seizure because I\n\n53:09.480 --> 53:14.640\nwouldn't really quite know how to handle it. But, but, but like Dana, Dana Carvey represents, like,\n\n53:14.640 --> 53:20.600\nfor me, my adolescent years, represents the idea that we've all had, that all we want to do when we\n\n53:20.600 --> 53:27.240\nget up in the morning, if there's those of us who decide, I just want to write, do makeup, make\n\n53:27.240 --> 53:33.720\nchairs, build, build decks, design dump trucks, act, stunt coordinate, whatever. I want to make other\n\n53:33.720 --> 53:38.720\npeople happy. And, and, and all of a sudden, to make so many people laugh without hurting anybody.\n\n53:38.720 --> 53:45.160\nRight. He's not a coomail, as they say in the bed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Coomail. Coomail makes\n\n53:45.160 --> 53:50.920\npeople laugh. Yes. But at what price? Yeah. He's fucking, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sharp sword.\n\n53:50.920 --> 53:57.320\nYeah. It's the self-esteem of others is the price. Yeah. I take no prisoners. Coomail's material is\n\n53:57.320 --> 54:02.600\nlike, my first album is called Fuck You. I feel like when I'm laughing at Coomail, I'm laughing at,\n\n54:02.600 --> 54:08.400\nlike, I'm laughing out of fear. I'm laughing at cripples when I'm laughing at Coomail. Yeah. Like,\n\n54:08.400 --> 54:14.040\nI'm like, no, I hope Coomail doesn't beat me up. That's a big target for me. I really take on the\n\n54:14.040 --> 54:25.520\ncripples. Is cripples still PC? No. No. Listen to the word. I would say, I would say that you're\n\n54:25.520 --> 54:35.240\ntough, but fair on cripples. Hey, cripple, but cripple just means your leg is hurt. It does. It\n\n54:35.240 --> 54:41.520\ndoes. And my best friends in the audience, she's a cripple, Kimber Hall. She's a cripple. Share\n\n54:41.520 --> 54:48.360\nher leg is hurt. Well, she, she, she sprained her ankle partying. She's a cripple. Yeah. You gotta get\n\n54:48.360 --> 54:53.840\non your knees and say you're a midget. Wait, there's crutches, there's crutches on the side of the\n\n54:53.840 --> 54:58.600\nwall here. Yeah. No, but do people identify themselves as so cripple? I'm sorry. So I don't\n\n54:58.600 --> 55:06.400\nthink anybody's a PC cripple. Kimber, are you a cripple? She's not. No one would call and be like,\n\n55:06.400 --> 55:12.840\nHey, do you have an elevator? I'm a cripple. Nobody would say that. But you would say, I'm\n\n55:12.840 --> 55:20.520\ncrippled. No, I'm just, but even if your leg is hurt. Okay, here's my question. If your leg is\n\n55:20.520 --> 55:27.320\nbroken, you don't say I'm disabled. You say I'm crippled. No, not anymore. All right, well, it's\n\n55:27.320 --> 55:33.160\nlike midget. It was, it was okay for a while. And then it got sideline. Like, you know, crippled\n\n55:33.160 --> 55:38.920\nbecame disabled. We all learned some fun. That guy's leaving. But we know it's not because he's\n\n55:38.920 --> 55:43.780\noffended because he's walking out. He's not lending away. He's like, he's he's able. He's able\n\n55:43.780 --> 55:51.560\nbodied. He's showing off. Let's bring up professional linguist and physical ability expert, Spencer\n\n55:51.560 --> 56:09.160\nClinton. Hey, guys. Hey, Spencer. You're probably the youngest guy up here. Do you what's your\n\n56:09.160 --> 56:15.520\nrelationship with Dana Carvey? I don't know him. I mean, he was in the he was in the back room for\n\n56:15.520 --> 56:21.560\na while. I said a couple of words to him. Jesus. He's a Spencer. Can you talk to me about I've\n\n56:22.080 --> 56:30.760\nfelt obviously that I am mistaken with my use of the word cripple. But like, can you explain to\n\n56:30.760 --> 56:36.840\nme? What is the right thing? Is it just disabled and not but you because people I guess call people\n\n56:36.840 --> 56:42.640\nwho are in wheelchairs crippled and that's inappropriate. Well, the best way it's yeah, it's\n\n56:42.640 --> 56:48.360\nacross the line now. It was like a Charles Dickens thing. Well, it was. Yeah, it was a Charles\n\n56:48.360 --> 56:55.560\nDickens thing. But that was a long time ago. If you live in 1809, like the society for the\n\n56:55.560 --> 57:01.640\nadvancement of handicapped people is not the name for the society. I'm trying to talk about that\n\n57:01.640 --> 57:07.200\nI'm trying to talk about. I'm still trying to talk about it. It used to be called like the\n\n57:07.200 --> 57:12.800\nInternational Society for Cripples and they changed it. Like I say it definitely used to be like\n\n57:12.800 --> 57:18.520\nthat. I would never call especially abled person different differently abled differently abled.\n\n57:18.520 --> 57:18.840\nYeah.\n\n57:22.880 --> 57:26.720\nAnd the last and the last person to be put to task for this and I have I was obviously have made\n\n57:26.720 --> 57:32.280\nmyself a target. We keep moving the we keep moving the goalpost and I think we do it because we do\n\n57:32.280 --> 57:37.560\nit for the best reasons in the world. We are all against as human beings, we're all against\n\n57:37.560 --> 57:43.480\ndehumanization. So the minute that we come up with a word that can sum up anybody, and people\n\n57:43.480 --> 57:50.080\nstart to use it to refer to people like as a group as an object, then we start to get uncomfortable.\n\n57:50.080 --> 57:53.280\nSo we move the goalpost and we go like let's let's shake things up.\n\n57:53.880 --> 57:59.440\nAbsolutely. I'm an idiot. I thought that cripple just referred to like when you can't move it is\n\n57:59.440 --> 58:06.000\ntemporarily than you're crippled. That's not the problem that is differently about fashion versus\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:10.440\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry everybody. The word retarded was fine for a long time. It's also\n\n58:10.440 --> 58:15.320\ntechnically accurate. It's just not the right one to use the National Association for the\n\n58:15.320 --> 58:21.080\nadvancement of colored people. My grandma calls black people colored people that to the extent\n\n58:21.080 --> 58:26.320\nthat the the the that there is a institution, institutions move more slowly. You can't what\n\n58:26.320 --> 58:32.400\nare you going to do? Are we going to change the NAACP? It's and I don't think there's anything\n\n58:32.400 --> 58:39.480\nwrong with the word colored, but the words take on it's just like like they adhere to social\n\n58:39.480 --> 58:44.200\ncustoms. And so my grandma looks out the window and she goes there's a colored fella on the corner\n\n58:44.200 --> 58:49.920\nand and they she said no better. She doesn't think she's doing anything wrong. You call people\n\n58:49.920 --> 58:57.520\ncripples. It's it's people who are temporarily disabled. I didn't realize this is my biggest\n\n58:57.520 --> 59:03.800\nproblem. It's because what have we learned from fucking policing language? We keep changing our\n\n59:03.800 --> 59:10.000\nlanguage and we keep not changing the class system. We keep not changing the way we live our\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:15.560\nfucking life. We keep not changing the way things are. Yeah, my grandma looks out the window goes\n\n59:15.560 --> 59:20.200\nthere's a colored guy in the corner. Oh, well, let's make the word colored bad. That'll change\n\n59:20.200 --> 59:29.960\nmy fucking grandma. No, it will not change my grandma. Death will change my grandma. Let's come\n\n59:29.960 --> 59:38.680\nup with a new name for death. Let's kill your grandma. She's a buried person. Yeah. And now it's\n\n59:38.680 --> 59:45.120\nover problem solved. Nothing other than that will solve the fucking problem and nothing other than\n\n59:45.120 --> 59:52.800\nviolence has ever solved any fucking problem ever. You don't change shit behind a fucking curtain.\n\n59:52.800 --> 01:00:01.640\nHe's yelling it was powerful. It would be illegal. If voting was powerful, it would be illegal.\n\n01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:13.000\nDan, but that being said, that would be out of your revolution. I'm I'm a millionaire and I would\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.920\nreally like to I'd like to I have a golden doodle and I'd like to die in peace. You just earlier\n\n01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:26.440\ntonight told a story of kicking a homeless guy out of your parking lot. I felt terrible. That was\n\n01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:34.080\nnot terrible enough. Yeah, but that guy should have voted better. Right? Right? If he had voted,\n\n01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.840\nright, he'd be allowed to sleep in a fucking parking lot. Wrong. No, you should have stopped that\n\n01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.960\nhappening. I couldn't fucking stop it. Yeah, you could have. Yeah, you could have. You should\n\n01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:52.080\nhave stopped that fucking countries. Do we invade? Don't don't don't change the subject. We're not\n\n01:00:52.080 --> 01:01:00.520\ntalking about every four years. No, I'm gonna vote for the guy with the red hat. The guy with the\n\n01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:08.040\nblue hat. Meanwhile, Middle East boom, boom, boom, boom, bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs, boom,\n\n01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:16.040\ndoesn't fucking matter. It's called a fucking empire. We play a game in this country. We fucking\n\n01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.920\nhang out. We have a great time. You could have made an impact. You could have made a difference\n\n01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:25.880\nwith that guy and you didn't. Dana Carvey is really funny. I fucking love that guy. He never\n\n01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:31.160\ndid anything wrong to anybody. I'm gonna go home tonight broken hearted because he's thinking\n\n01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:37.040\nabout Wayne's World two. He's a fucking hero, man. He never did anything wrong. I heard that he\n\n01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.840\nstopped someone getting arrested in a parking lot once. I bet he would. I bet Dana Carvey\n\n01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:48.440\nwould stop somebody from. How are you? What's what's life like as a handsome Pakistani air?\n\n01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:55.480\nPakistani air? Oh, Pakistani. Oh, I thought you like I'm gonna air do something. Well,\n\n01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.400\nthat's what I was thinking. I was gonna say handsome millionaire because in my mind, you know,\n\n01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.640\nwhen you when you do a lot of stuff, you equate that with a lot of money, but that's\n\n01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:12.400\nreal government is bullshit. It's a fucking fundamental lie. Have you ever talked to anybody\n\n01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:21.840\nwhose job is to tell other people what to do? Fuck those people. If you like run your life\n\n01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.080\nthrough this asset test, talk to everybody that you've ever talked to. What's your fucking job?\n\n01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:33.000\nIf it's only telling other people what to do, fuck you. Fuck that person. Government's bullshit.\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.560\nAll right. What are you doing now, though? You're telling people I'm telling them to go\n\n01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:44.400\nrun and be flip over cop cars and burn stuff. I'm saying leave me leave my mansion alone. I was\n\n01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:53.120\non your side. I have a golden doodle and I love him. I just I'm 41. Leave me out of it. But you're\n\n01:02:53.120 --> 01:03:04.360\n25. Burn down the fucking White House. Go do it. Set shit on fire. But leave me out of it. Dan and I\n\n01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:11.480\ndid an improv show last night. The vibe is so different from when Dana Carvey was on stage.\n\n01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:18.240\nYeah, it's become more yelling. The vibe is so different. I would put him in charge. I would\n\n01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.640\nDana Carvey would be the poet laureate of the moon colony. I would go I would I would come out\n\n01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.880\nand I would go no shoelaces. Dan, where are you? And then I would go now the church lady. And he'd\n\n01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:35.960\ncome out and go special. Dan, there's obviously this angry energy boiling up inside you. Do you know\n\n01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:45.760\nwhere that's coming from right now? Is this couple's counseling stuff? I'm excited. Camille\n\n01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:52.240\nalways comes to our sessions, by the way. Yeah, I kind of I kind of am like the hype man for their\n\n01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:58.640\nsessions. I would actually be very into that. That's right. Yeah, tell me how you feel. Yeah,\n\n01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:09.760\na moat. All right, what were you? You were asking Camille how his career was going? Oh, no, you\n\n01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:20.400\nchoose. Well, I did ask you question government. I am very I was wondering how Camille's travels\n\n01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:27.320\nwere. And then I also asked Dan where his asked I asked Dan where his anger was coming from. I\n\n01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:35.640\nremember that. I have a question for Jeff. All right, if if we're moving on, but if we're not,\n\n01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:43.000\nlet's stay and let's move on. Let's move on. I saw I'm bringing up a different thing. I saw a\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:50.480\nthrowback Thursday picture that you posted a view at 11. The most fuckable 11 year old boy I've ever\n\n01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:58.480\nseen. You are a gorgeous kid and you're a gorgeous man. But like at 11, you look like that. No wonder\n\n01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:03.080\nyou're going around talking to strangers. It's like a China play. Honestly, I don't mean that in a\n\n01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:07.720\nbad way. My mom told me my my nose looked like an eggplant and I didn't know what it was. And so she\n\n01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:16.200\ntook me to the store and pointed it out. You carry the lead with your origin story. So I don't\n\n01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:26.160\nwant to talk to anybody. But you that's a picture. Have you guys seen this? Hashtag fuckers. His eyes\n\n01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:34.560\nare like sapphires. His cheekbones are like God sculpted a mountain for pedophiles. And you\n\n01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.120\npeaked in that catalog. He does have amazing cheekbones. Amazing cheekbones. I mean, I don't want\n\n01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.480\nthis to sound weird, but the way they still happen to you. What happened to you? I fell apart, man.\n\n01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:51.600\nWhen I was when I was at that age, I was modeling as a New Yorker doing a play was the\n\n01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.520\nKing and I King and I. You were also modeling. I didn't know this. Yes. What are boy modeling\n\n01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:04.560\nposes? That picture was it was a private. He's doing it right now. Dan is doing a cheer. But this\n\n01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.920\npicture was modeling, right? This was like a catalog. It was a it was a centerfold of a New\n\n01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:15.680\nYork Times magazine. You're for sure smizing. Smizing. You're smiling with your eyes. You're\n\n01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:21.720\nsmizing. And you're also you're looking right now. You're looking through the in your. I think the\n\n01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:27.280\nvery special thing about your child photography photos is that they are very sexual because it\n\n01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:32.400\nlooks like you're looking through the camera and you're like, yeah, definitely. Go for it. Like\n\n01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:41.360\nthere's some kind of like. Super sexual child. No, but talk to me about it. Yeah. That's a\n\n01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:45.680\nterrible thing to say. You're an adult now. So it feels okay. I'm going to I'm going to ask you for\n\n01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.960\nit as well. I'm going to post a couple other photos like I'm coming upcoming. I'm coming. I'm\n\n01:06:49.960 --> 01:07:04.360\ntelling you, please don't come on 11 year old me. I do think that when Spencer comes, that's how\n\n01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:18.360\nit sounds. I'm coming. After Spencer has sex with a woman, he says that happened. That happened.\n\n01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:24.360\nAnd then he goes to the fridge. Yeah, it's just weird because a critical hit. Other than that,\n\n01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:34.760\nit's utter, utter silence. It's just I'm coming. Maybe also when the girl does something a little\n\n01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:40.720\ninventive, you're like, and you do some sort of action with your hands, which symbolizes rolling\n\n01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.480\na dice and you're like, yeah, okay, not effective. And when she's like my parents are coming, you're\n\n01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:56.280\nlike, you're metagaming right now. You're metacoming. If I did this, would you like it? And he goes\n\n01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:07.520\nlike, yeah, no, metagaming. I'm not about Spencer's sex. Had you already had sex at that age? No, I\n\n01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:24.800\nlost my virginity at 24 years old. I was 24. But did you lose it to 20 showgirls? Like, what do\n\n01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:33.080\nyou mean? Are you talking about anal sex? What do you mean? I had never put my penis inside of\n\n01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:42.360\none minute cause 24 years old. That's a bad thing. It's just because he's a Casanova. I was a late\n\n01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:50.080\nbloomer. I but no, we saw you as an 11 year old. I look at that. I look at that picture of you at\n\n01:08:50.080 --> 01:09:00.680\neight and I'm like, I want to sit on that eight year old's face. No, it's true. I felt the same\n\n01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:10.920\nway. Just sexuality at eight surpasses sexuality. It's a I just I bet if yeah, if that happened, the\n\n01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:24.040\njudge would be like, I kind of see that. I get it. I get it. I see the victim in my chambers. And\n\n01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:34.320\ncould he please wear that windbreaker? Also hashtag rape culture. Yay. I'm very glad you weren't\n\n01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:44.520\nraped. When I was thinking, I feel raped right now. When I was four years old, you asked for it. I\n\n01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:54.600\nwouldn't have worn those eyelashes. By a round of applause, who has seen Jeff Davis at eight years\n\n01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:05.400\nold? 11. 11. This was 11. The picture I saw was 11. But I mean, do you hear that applause? Who\n\n01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:18.720\nhere and be honest, who has seen Dan Harmon at eight years old? I mean, there's a reason. There's a\n\n01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.600\nreason. I wasn't an actor. I wasn't. Yeah. And 10 years after that, he was asking his mom if he was\n\n01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:32.000\nhandsome. When I was four, I think I'm not even quite not quite for like maybe maybe like almost\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:39.360\nfor when I went to preschool. And the first day of preschool is the first time as a as a as a human\n\n01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.920\nbeing, I was around other kids that you didn't know you went to a building, there was other kids.\n\n01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:48.760\nSure. And I remember it very vividly. And when when the class was over, we took naps and we drew on\n\n01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:54.440\nchalkboard. And then when it was over, we all ran out. When the day was over, all the parents were\n\n01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.760\noutside. And it was a big like grass lawn and all the kids we all ran out like bats coming out of\n\n01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:04.120\na cave because we're so wound up for being around other other human beings our age. You had to have\n\n01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:11.800\na popsicle. And I ran around the circle and I ran up to this girl, Petria Beth Hayes. And she was a\n\n01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.400\nlittle blonde girl, four years old. I just went up to her and I just fucking Clark Gable there\n\n01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.800\ngrabbed her with the back of the head, leaned her over and kissed her like gone with the wind\n\n01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:29.840\nstyle and then pushed her down in the grass and ran off. And that's kind of in my MO since then. That's\n\n01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:39.960\nyour dating history. You can insert 20 years between the kissing and the pushing down, but that's\n\n01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.320\nbasically what we're all doing. I got a big laugh out of the adults. And then like when the king and\n\n01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.360\nI started when I was nine when I got into the king and I you've been doing that for years you did\n\n01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.920\nthat. I did it for her from nine through 11. Like the age nine and with clothes I was 11 years old.\n\n01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:03.400\nAnd I did at the Pantages here in LA when I was nine. And there were seven girls that were the kids\n\n01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.360\nin the show like seven like Asian girls that were the king's daughters. There were seven Asian boys\n\n01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:14.320\nwith the king's sons. And then we went on tour. Where did you fall into that? I was an Asian kid.\n\n01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.240\nThere's one white kid in the king and I, the son of Anna. Oh, you're the one white kid too, huh?\n\n01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:28.800\nEverything's so easy for Jeff. Did you feel that? Did you know you were the only way kid?\n\n01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:36.200\nYou're a kid and we weren't racist. Also my understudy was white and I went through seven\n\n01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.560\nunderstudies in that year and a half because it was hard to keep a kid to be like the white kid\n\n01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:47.560\nhad to put on really bad Asian makeup every night. Like they made them look orange really\n\n01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:52.400\nand then like slanty eye makeup and shit. It was really shitty. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't move\n\n01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.640\non from this. We're still here. So but you were playing a white kid. Yes. But your understudy had\n\n01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:04.000\nto play an Asian kid. Why? Because they had a free kid on the set. Also they would just be like,\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:11.840\nall right, so he got the Mickey Rooney makeup. There was no making any of these these kids.\n\n01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:17.920\nDid you have to be white for a narrative reason? The story of the king and I is a British woman\n\n01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:24.760\ngoes to Siam, what is now Thailand, to instruct the king of Siam in like modern like Western ways.\n\n01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:33.880\nIt's like Apocalypse Now the story, right? No. It's like the boring dinner scene in Apocalypse Now.\n\n01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.600\nIf you just took the shitty parts in Redux. There's a teacher. So we would go from town to town\n\n01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:45.280\nand the kids would range from like six and seven years old up to 13. And so we traveled with\n\n01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:52.240\nseven kids. And we would go to town to be seven new girls every city we went to. Were any of them\n\n01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:59.240\ncrippled? Don't derail. So we go to town. And the girls wouldn't travel with you, but the boys\n\n01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:04.760\nwould. Don't derail. No masking. You are not allowed to tell people to do something you do constantly.\n\n01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:10.840\nI'm the derail master. Seven kids traveled. Three of them were boys. Four of them were girls. And\n\n01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:16.080\nthen we would get like 14 new kids, half of which were, you know, like boys and girls. So I would\n\n01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.680\nhave a dressing room and there would be little girls and we would just play Truth or Dare. We\n\n01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:25.840\ninvented the game. No one had taught us this. Jeff, you did not invent the game. In your head,\n\n01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.160\nyour life has made sense. Yeah, you think your four is gone. And then the world said thank you for\n\n01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:36.000\nthe game. Nobody taught us how to play Truth or Dare, but we played a game that is absolutely\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.360\nTruth or Dare without anyone having taught us. Do you feel like you invented that game? Well,\n\n01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.800\nfor us, we did because we didn't. That's fine. But for the world, you see, you guys called it\n\n01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.520\nD-Bull or Durbal. Aaron, a guy's walking out in crutches. You want to say anything? Why so crippled?\n\n01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:57.840\nYou're good. Like, you do what you want, man. You don't have to stay here. Are you going to the\n\n01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:08.280\nbathroom? He's going to get some chips. Can I guess you hurt your like skateboarding? You ran\n\n01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:14.960\ninto a stair. So he's a cripple because it's a temporary thing. We really have to go. That's not\n\n01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.040\nhow it works at all. That's not how it works. So I want to go back and talk to somebody.\n\n01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.880\nI take that back. I don't want to be the person behind that fight. Jeff, come on. Jeff's talking\n\n01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.680\nabout fucking four-year-olds. As a kid, we would make out. Now, I was a kissing bandit all throughout\n\n01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.920\nmy life. I kissed everybody. I was like, and then I just never had sex until I was 24. However,\n\n01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:45.200\nwhen I was four years old in preschool. All right, take it easy. He got the chips that he said he\n\n01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:51.680\nwas going to get, and now he's opening them. Well, it's expected. It's so loud. First of all, how\n\n01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:57.560\ndo you get the chips so fast? He's crippled. Yeah. No, don't call him crippled. Those are the loudest\n\n01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.080\nchips I've ever heard. You're like surprised. There's a line for chips just for handicapped\n\n01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:09.560\npeople. It's way closer. Did the mic pick that up? Those are the loudest chips. I've never said that out loud.\n\n01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.920\nI thought that that was just... Jeff, I'm so sorry. Please continue the story. You just interrupted\n\n01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:21.320\nthe thing. Those are the chips. Jalapeno. Yeah, those are the best. Wait, Jalapeno? No more for this\n\n01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:28.760\nkid. This kid, this kid, he lived his life. He hurt his leg. You ran into a stair. You ran into a\n\n01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:35.520\nstair? That's what someone says when they've been abused. Someone says, I fell onto a door. You ran\n\n01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:45.520\ninto a stair? What kind of bullshit story is that? I don't think abusers hit people's feet. Do you think that\n\n01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:51.400\nyou didn't, the stair was there and you're like, this is just a hallway? I mean, you thought it was a\n\n01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.880\nhallway and you just ran into the hallway and then you're like, oh no, this goes up. It was like\n\n01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:04.400\nLooney Tunes, someone drew floor on the stairs and he just ran into it. But I mean, really, when you\n\n01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:10.680\nsay I ran into a stair, that's not acceptable information. I'm sure the doctor was like, I think\n\n01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:15.920\nit's fine. Otherwise, next week, there's going to be eight people with crutches opening chip bags\n\n01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:20.720\nreally loudly and they're like, what about me? Can I be famous? I don't think that'll happen. Okay,\n\n01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:27.000\nso so you were you were you invented truth or dare? My friend, my the guy that played the prince,\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.040\nthe Asian, there's two kid leads in the King and I. Oh, Jesus Christ, he's eating him loud too. Did you\n\n01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:42.320\nhear? Did you hear that fucking? You're not allowed to say. It's not my fault. Did you hear the\n\n01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:51.520\nfucking crunch on this guy? Is there a mic on him? It's like a Pringles commercial. So loud. What\n\n01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:58.320\nflavor is that? They're hollow. That's so loud. I don't want to drill the whole thing. This band\n\n01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.720\nwith the crutches looks like he was a very handsome child. It's a he still is. He still is a handsome\n\n01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:12.480\nchild. Yeah, he's a handsome child. So guys, no, just everybody be quiet and just eat one more chip.\n\n01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:21.920\nJust everybody be dead quiet. That's fucking loud. They're potato chips. Can you hear that in\n\n01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:30.720\nAmerica? The podcast audience? Yeah, he has an amplifier. What's going on? Perfect shape for\n\n01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:38.800\nprojecting sound. He's a fully artist. He's a fully artist. All right, so I want to go back. Okay,\n\n01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:46.000\nso truth or dare, you've invented truth or dare. My friend Doug, the other kid, not he also fucking\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.800\nDoug Clay fuck guy. He was so great. He was like I was 11. He was 13. And he he would he jerked\n\n01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:59.680\noff in front of us. Nice story. All right, let's do DMD. All right. Well, thanks for coming tonight,\n\n01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:07.040\nfolks. I hope you enjoyed Janet Karby. But we were kids. But hang on. So when I was four, when I was\n\n01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:13.040\nfour years old, no, no, no, finish the jerk off story. That's that's the way how old were you? I\n\n01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:18.800\nwas 11. He's just talked about this before. When I was nine, 10, 11 years old, we would be we had\n\n01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:25.280\ndressing rooms. And we were all the way the truth of their started was I had like a halls like\n\n01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:32.560\nyou were like, what shall we do with our time? I've got an idea. I had a cough drop. We just knew\n\n01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.640\nthere were boys and there were girls. And then we all knew we didn't know what was going on. We just\n\n01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:42.560\nknew that something must happen. There was that's what I said. Yeah. So I would I would take a\n\n01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.680\ncough drop and Kathy or or you vet the girls that were in the show and they were nine years old.\n\n01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.480\nThe guy was we would lay on top of each other and then we would pass a cough drop from one mouth\n\n01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:58.640\nto the other. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Except these names are like from a math textbook. So\n\n01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:06.640\nyou don't know any events really. But you read event has an idea about the how about\n\n01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:13.280\npatria beth was a fucking great name. But if that was oh my god. So cute. Oh, she could suck a cough\n\n01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:19.760\ndrop. She could suck a menthol off a lozenge. So\n\n01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:29.920\nso our tutor, our tutor, who is a very beautiful woman named Bridget, she told our parents,\n\n01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.880\nwe have to give these kids sex education. We were all like the average ages nine years old.\n\n01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:39.200\nYou guys are just going around laying on each other. They kept walking into a room and we would\n\n01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.000\njust be we just be on top of each other making out. Yeah, it's like frog DNA. Like they found a way.\n\n01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.760\nWe didn't tell them. So we had to get sex ed. We didn't we didn't know what sex was. But then\n\n01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.040\nlater on when we were like in Washington, D.C., like this tour was kind of ending when I was about\n\n01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.600\n11, we found a bunch of porn mags under a bed in a hotel room. And we were like, oh, fuck. Like\n\n01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:09.280\nlike, we've been doing this wrong the whole time. We have tiny dicks. Yeah. But so as a kid that\n\n01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.160\nno one instructs you how to play truth or dare. So then we would dare people to do stuff that was\n\n01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.320\nI think I think it's an organic things that that children create on their own without any instruction.\n\n01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:24.480\nWhen I was four years old, we played doctor and I guess what I was someone is a big fan of four\n\n01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:33.280\nyear olds. I was laughing hysterically. Our teacher, Mrs. Newhouse, would leave the preschool room\n\n01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:40.480\nand then she had a giant oak desk and I would take like I am I am Jeff me and Jeffrey and Craig.\n\n01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.560\nWe would take a girl and everybody would watch was all around and she would take her clothes off.\n\n01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.000\nWhat? She'd take her clothes off. And we would take a close and we guys are four and we played\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.680\ndoctor. So everybody was watching right and there were nurses and there were other doctors.\n\n01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:57.360\nAnd so the girl would take her take her clothes off and I would touch your boobs and I would touch\n\n01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.240\nyour pussy and I would touch everything. Does it hurt here? And I was the doctor. When you say I\n\n01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:13.360\nwould touch her pussy. Yeah, these are all doctor. I mean playing doctor. When you would touch with\n\n01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:21.120\nthe medical community refers to as a pussy. It wasn't like a like what or was it a here or was\n\n01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:27.280\nit a did you put your hand and then push pressure like when they check for the gallbladder. I would\n\n01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.680\nsay I would I would like touch her stomach go. Does it hurt here? We're playing because we\n\n01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:38.160\ndon't always at four years old. Just hurt here. Shut the fuck up. Finish the story. Jesus Christ.\n\n01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.120\nIt's not a long story. If I can just be a naked girl and I would go does it hurt here? Just\n\n01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:48.000\nlightly touch people and it wasn't sexy. We just knew that there was boys and girls were different\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.400\nand we're just old enough to recognize those differences. So we invented for us playing\n\n01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.440\ndoctor. Wait, that's that's a thing that kids do like two games now. Well, I can understand.\n\n01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.160\nI invented four corners. I don't know if you've all played that.\n\n01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.800\nWhat's I don't know for a corner. I was the first one to say see you later alligator.\n\n01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.280\nMy brother told me he invented peanut butter and jelly.\n\n01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:19.120\nHe told me he fucking invented it and I knew he was lying and just had no choice.\n\n01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.240\nAnd then after I mastered peanut butter, I moved on to fruits.\n\n01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:26.960\nSo the teacher had walked back in the room and there would be Gloria naked under the desk and\n\n01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.120\nme and Jeffrey Kim and Craig were just like really just like was it always glory or a different\n\n01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:38.160\nones. It was different every time. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. No, no, no, not fucked up. But like\n\n01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:50.960\nno fuck him. He got more fucking trim. In 1969. Trim. Trim. Trim.\n\n01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.240\nReally? You guys are going to boo the use of the word trim. Well, it's not a desirable that\n\n01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:05.520\nis what is a what is a four year old. You can't do it. But Jeff, you can pass on this question.\n\n01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.880\nBut you lost your virginity at 24. Yes. We're hearing about all these sexual experiences\n\n01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:16.080\nthat you had and you don't have to answer this. But like, do you in like in a few sentences,\n\n01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.440\ncould you quantify why maybe you lost your virginity at 24? Because obviously, well, very sexy man.\n\n01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:30.560\nYes, I can. That was a tepid response. Yeah, really. It was a little late. It was a little late.\n\n01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.160\nResponse to me not to Jeff, but I look back on those on like junior high and high school as times\n\n01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:41.520\nwhen if I knew what was going on and if I could have read the signal, you were too busy inventing\n\n01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:48.160\ngames. Well, you weren't you. You were Christian. Weren't you Christian? So first it was me being\n\n01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:52.240\nlike late bloomer and being terrified of girls. And also there was a girl I dated when I was a\n\n01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.280\nsophomore in high school. No, I was a freshman. She was a sophomore. You fuck you. That's what I'm\n\n01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.440\nsaying. And everyone had me because I use the wrong word. But fine. Yeah, you said trim due to\n\n01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.960\nfour to a four year old. They should. Okay, I missed up. I made a misstep. But I'm still a good guy.\n\n01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:12.880\nYeah, you're a good guy. It was getting more action. Yeah, we're in action. We're all on your\n\n01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:18.640\nside. I never I never kissed her. Her name is Ursula. Oh, by the way, I she just did it in\n\n01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:24.160\nmath textbooks. She she was a cheerleader and she was very beautiful. And I had five apples. I was\n\n01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:35.760\nterrified of her math, math textbook, Joe. I never she also wanted to know how long a train would\n\n01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:41.680\ntake to get we never even kissed. I had girlfriends that I never kissed because I thought my\n\n01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:47.920\nbrother's friends who are two years older than me said, then I said, was this guy was his name\n\n01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:53.920\nfucking asshole. Really tall. It was probably Jamal. His name was Kevin. Okay, Kevin's also a\n\n01:25:53.920 --> 01:26:01.120\ntextbook. He comes up and he goes like, So you fucking Ursula? I'm like, No, sir. Like, the very\n\n01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:07.280\nidea. I thought that to have sex with girls would be the highest insult that they wouldn't want it.\n\n01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:13.120\nThey were like, they told me that's only something that guys wanted to do to girls. And girls are\n\n01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.480\nlike, No, they're like, like, like, like, that's really rude. Like, No. So I was I was really,\n\n01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.120\nreally rude. Then in college, I don't think of anything rude or you could do to it. It's rude.\n\n01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:30.160\nIt's rude to have sex with a woman. It is rude. Yeah. I apologize every time. It's surely it really\n\n01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:40.480\nis. It's like rude. Sorry. That shouldn't happen. Thank you. Thank you very much. I absolutely\n\n01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.080\ndo feel that way. I got, I got, I got done and I go, Thank you. Sorry. Sorry about that.\n\n01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.560\nI fall out and I walk backwards out of the room and go get a towel.\n\n01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:57.840\nThere's a visualization of your animal person. So sorry. It's we were ashamed of ourselves.\n\n01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.560\nWait, wait, wait. Then I went through and like a born again. How long did you date Ursula?\n\n01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.520\nLike for 45 minutes, like, like, like no time at all. She's still your voice is there's no clock\n\n01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:14.560\nbehind you. What time is it? 940? Okay, we're overdue for D&D. We're going to start D&D.\n\n01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:22.000\nSorry. Thank you for all of that. This show brought to you by four year old Trim.\n\n01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.040\nI'm sorry. I use the word Trim. It's a gross word. I'm sorry. Trim.\n\n01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:35.520\nNo, I'm sorry. I use the word and I want to apologize on part of Camille for using the C word.\n\n01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.440\nI didn't use the color. Colored? We'll say.\n\n01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.280\nMy bit was that you said that word. I don't know.\n\n01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.680\nThere's a Tylenol with codeine. Oh, that's that's just got mixed in there. I did.\n\n01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.840\nBut Spencer announced that he would never return at the last and the last session, right?\n\n01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:00.400\nHe disappeared. He used his amulet. So let's hear it for Spencer as Tylenol with codeine\n\n01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:06.800\nin the last episode. Amazing. That was good. The best thing ever. All right. Thank you. Give me\n\n01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.440\nsome quirks. I don't want to get into it. You were born again for how long? Just real quick.\n\n01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.520\nJust tell me the year and we won't talk about it. Three, four years. Okay. And your teen years.\n\n01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.440\nThen I was like family and do it. I had never had sex, so I became abstinent, but I was abstaining\n\n01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.800\nfrom something that I accidentally abstained from a long time. And then I would date girls and\n\n01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:32.240\nthey were like, you really like four players. That's all you're going to get. So says Jesus.\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.960\nYeah. Dry humping is okay. I was I was abstinent and in a similar program called true love waits.\n\n01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.760\nAnd my excuse, I never did any for true love wait. You were in a thing called true love waits.\n\n01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.760\nYeah. And look what she waited for. Amazing.\n\n01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.360\nThe program called true love waiting pays off.\n\n01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:02.560\nYeah. True love should have waited a little bit longer. Yeah. True love. True love could have\n\n01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:11.760\nheld out. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Spencer,\n\n01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:22.080\nwould you take us away? Yeah, sorry. Oh, boy. When we last met, our heroes had just fended off\n\n01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:29.520\nflaming goblins and gem bugs in the purple canyons. After looting a power stone, the robot baby was\n\n01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:36.800\nactivated who the game gang dubbed Lodgy due to its damaged logic core. The baby spoke of a place\n\n01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:42.000\nthat it was designed to locate, although it was not designed to locate it very effectively.\n\n01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:48.080\nAnd the damaged logic core prevented it from recalling what or where it was looking for.\n\n01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:54.160\nBut as they spoke, Sharpie smelled a funky sack and realized his bag was a blaze.\n\n01:29:54.160 --> 01:30:00.240\nHe emptied its contents, a flaming goblin named Justin. And after some interrogation determined\n\n01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:07.920\nthat the robot's power core was from the Air City, home of technological wonders and flying machines,\n\n01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:14.640\nthe gang was unsure of how to proceed. But Justin suggested they get some arrow hawks,\n\n01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:22.080\nthen Tylona with codeine piped up and disappeared right afterwards. So it was off to Rosebrook,\n\n01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:29.040\na nearby village susceptible to pillage to plan their next move. But could our heroes truly reach\n\n01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:36.800\nthe Air City? Where was the said city? The Air City? And what dangers might Rosebrook hold?\n\n01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:42.240\nAnd what of the robot baby find out now on an all new Harmontown time?\n\n01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:52.080\nThat's good shit, Spencer. So I know it occurred to me while I was writing that it's very hard to\n\n01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:57.360\nsummarize all the weird shit that happened. Well, we don't usually listen. So what? Oh, I know.\n\n01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:02.320\nI mean, it's not for you guys. I don't know who it's for, to be honest. Yeah, because they could\n\n01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:07.600\nrewind and listen to it. Oh, they know what's going on, chances are. They know so much better than\n\n01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:12.800\nus. Yeah. And then they're like, why don't you use the rope you're holding? I'm not holding a rope.\n\n01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:20.160\nThe town is called Rosebrook. I think I called it Rosebook. Let's just call it Rosebook in the\n\n01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:24.960\nlast episode. So are we in Rosebook? Are we on our way to Rosebook? You're on the way to Rosebook.\n\n01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:31.840\nWe got like outside. Yeah, there's this. You saw the city. You can see it. You can see it far off.\n\n01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:37.840\nYou're right by a town that says Rosebook. The baby's walking with us. Yeah, yeah. He's watched\n\n01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:43.440\nby himself. Well, I don't know. I think someone was carrying him. I'll carry him. Oh, I have the\n\n01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:49.760\nbaby. Is my mic working still? Yeah, I just thought it different. Yeah, it did for a bit.\n\n01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:56.640\nIt did for a bit. It's good now. Okay. What is happening? We're trying to solve the problem.\n\n01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:05.040\nI have the baby. The baby's mine. We're hurt in. Tanisha's D was here. The fucking soupy sales\n\n01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:14.880\ncame out. What? Yeah, soupy sales. D Martin did a ditty. We had, you weren't here. You slept in.\n\n01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.400\nI did. I had a great nap. All right. So you're carrying the baby. I'm going to walk alongside\n\n01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:26.240\nyou in case you get tired. Okay. Give her the baby, Christopher. She wants to hold the baby.\n\n01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:31.120\nI mean, you and I are of the same mindset. Christopher, if you and I could have an aside.\n\n01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:39.840\nSure. Shit. I up until this point have been chaotic. Good has been my scuba dude mantra\n\n01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:48.560\naffiliation, my alignment, alignment, scuba dude. I like that. I'm feeling chaotic bad.\n\n01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:53.680\nOh, then you don't, I'm not going to give you the baby. No, no, no, I don't want to hurt the baby.\n\n01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:59.440\nI just want to be selfish and do things that are. These are not good arguments to get the baby.\n\n01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:06.320\nWell, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm watching this conversation. No, you're not. I'm jerking off.\n\n01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:13.440\nOkay. That's what you want. That's what I'm going to do. Maybe I said this incorrectly. What I'm\n\n01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:19.040\ntrying to say is I know that you've gotten a lot of flat for the baby, for wanting to get the baby.\n\n01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.400\nHe's jacking off like one of Jeff's 13 year old friends.\n\n01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:30.960\nI, I, I'm just saying that I, I am on your side when it comes to wanting to take care of yourself.\n\n01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.640\nAll right. Well, let's, let's, uh, you're in a trial period. I'm going to have the baby,\n\n01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:41.760\nbut we'll see. And if you're okay, do you hear something? No, right? I mean, it sounds like a\n\n01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:50.160\ntrash can moving around. Okay. So you, um, you can be, you can, uh, if you're good, I'll let you\n\n01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:58.720\nhave the baby. But yeah, wait, I definitely hear something. How does making jello sound? I think\n\n01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:04.640\nsomeone's making jello in a trash can and they're moving it around, but it, and it smells good\n\n01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:08.480\nto them. They're making it and they like the smell of the thing that they're making and they're\n\n01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:14.960\nmoving around the trash can. I'm going to go investigate this bush and just, it's moving\n\n01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:20.800\nin a way. I run away. I run to a different bush. I run to a different bush. It's okay. The bush\n\n01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.920\nis empty. We're fine. All right. We're fine. We'll understand. I just wait. Special, special,\n\n01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.600\nspecial, special roll dice on that. What, what, what did the dice say on that move? Well, yeah,\n\n01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:35.920\nI did roll the dice. I did. What happened? He didn't hide very well. He was right in that same\n\n01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:43.040\nbush. Critical fail. What the fuck, Sharpie? What are you, what, what part of that were you\n\n01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:47.360\njerking off? What's going on? What are you jerking off about the baby? I'm making jello. What's\n\n01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:53.840\nhappening? Who's that? Who, what's this guy doing in the bush? He was jerking off while we were\n\n01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:59.120\ntalking about who should take care of the baby. Is that normal? No. Oh, good. Oh, you're the baby?\n\n01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:05.200\nYeah. Baby. I'm sorry, baby. This is not about you. Baby, what's your, baby, what's your name?\n\n01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:12.000\nYou guys called me Lodgy. Lodgy. Lodgy. Lodgy. Yeah. Baby, is that the only voice you have?\n\n01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.600\nIt sure is. It's one of my main voices. All right, Lodgy, we're fine. Sorry, he was making\n\n01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:24.720\ngel. Stop it. Oh, sorry. We're looking at you. I jerk off during plot points. That's my fetish.\n\n01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:33.760\nI get turned on by plot points when the story changes direction. That's the only thing that\n\n01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.320\ncan make me come. That sucks. What we need, what we need to most is you're jerking off. That's why,\n\n01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.840\nuh, yeah, that's what turns me on about it. Also, also weird because that wasn't a plot point.\n\n01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.600\nYeah. That was more characterization of any way. It wasn't a plot point. It was just character\n\n01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:53.600\ndevelopment. Are you guys confronting me about a thing that, that, that in a big way that, that\n\n01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.960\nfor the first time, because I'm going to come in my fucking pants. All right. All right. All right.\n\n01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:04.240\nNope. I'm going to say is that's what it's all about for me. You're creating plot points by\n\n01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:09.600\njerking off. And then the plot point is you jerking off. I'm into thresholds. I walk up and\n\n01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:15.040\ngo, guys, it seems like a really crossing. It's a weird threshold here. No, no, no. Don't use,\n\n01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:21.280\ndon't use that word. I'm, I can finish. I don't care. Okay. It's not, it wasn't meant to be the\n\n01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:27.200\nbig deal. You guys are having the baby. I don't want to, I don't want to be a part of this. Okay,\n\n01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:32.640\ngreat. Well, it seems like you very much want it. No, no, no, no, no. Because there are beach nearby.\n\n01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.920\nUh, no. All right, let's go find a beach. Let's go to the, let's go to the village. Okay. I\n\n01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:44.000\nstarted masturbating at the idea of them going to a village. I need to, sorry. This is just me,\n\n01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:52.320\nSpencer. What, making Jello, you just stir a fluid in a bowl. It sounds like a little spoon\n\n01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.640\nhitting another metal. Exactly. And think about that noise. That sounds nothing like you are not\n\n01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:04.240\nintimate with Dan Harmon. Oh, okay. Sure. It's all metal. This is a specific detail. Wait, what is\n\n01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:10.320\nthe noise? It's all metal spoons down there. She's right. It sounds like stirring up gelatinous\n\n01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:21.200\nfluid. With a casual garbage can. Everyone's jealous. She's getting away of tonight. I take back\n\n01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:26.480\nthat I was masturbating. I'm sorry. I want, I want Spencer to take, take control. Let's go into the\n\n01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.680\nplace. The Rose Book. Rose Book, right. So you're heading towards Rose Book and you can see,\n\n01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.760\nno, there's nothing important here. Don't worry about it. Nothing's happening. No, no, no, nothing's\n\n01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:43.520\nhappening. Nothing's happening. The stakes are low. You can see the happy little village. Oh, great.\n\n01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:50.080\nIt's happy a little, but on the path before you, you see it looks like a stopped horse and carriage\n\n01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:56.400\nsurrounded by a green skinned man on the top of the carriage. There's a little, he must be a gnome\n\n01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:02.880\nor half length standing on top of it. Like he's swinging a sack, like a weapon. Is he, is his\n\n01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:08.320\nexpression friendly? He's, he's back as torches. These guys are, it seems like these guys are\n\n01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.240\nrobbing it. So we should, I think, run up and disrupt this and help the poor man who's being\n\n01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.960\nattacked by the green skinned men, right? Don't you get that? All right, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:22.080\nChristopher, you're sneaky. I'll go out and cause a diversion. You sneak up and flank the guy\n\n01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:27.280\nswinging the sack. One guy can't flank. No, no, no, I'll go up and get his attention. You flank\n\n01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.360\nhim around the side. I'll flank the other side. Then what do I do? We'll take it from there.\n\n01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.760\nOkay, all right. What is Lodge going to do? Lodge is with me. Lodge is fine.\n\n01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.600\nDon't worry about Lodge. I hope I get kicked.\n\n01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:48.240\nWhat did he say? What did he say? Shit, we've, what did he say? Lodge, what did you say?\n\n01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.880\nI hope I get kicked. No, hope you get kicked. Lodge, why do you hope you get kicked? Oh,\n\n01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:58.720\njust things that happened in the past. Jesus Christ, it's fucking horrible. No, we have to fix\n\n01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:04.640\nthis. Let's fight. Let's, let's fix that. Lodge is fine. He's a baby. He hopes he gets kicked. No,\n\n01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:09.760\nno, no, he'll fuck that. You're not helping. You're jerking off in the corner. I wasn't\n\n01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:15.440\njerking off to the kid. I was jerking off to the idea that we, that something new was happening.\n\n01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:20.000\nAll right. The kid's another matter. He wrote us all of a sudden after jerking off in a bush.\n\n01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:30.000\nI go up, I go up to the left side of this. Is it like a coach kind of thing? Like a stage\n\n01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:38.320\ncoach. So I went up and go like, what, what goes? You see, you see six orcs there. They're menacing\n\n01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:44.640\na guy stand, the little no man stand in the top as carriage. He's like, ah, ah, ah. Sorry,\n\n01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:50.560\ndid you say a top as carriage, like a carriage of tall plates? He's a top, a top. I see. That\n\n01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:55.360\nmakes a lot more sense than what I envisioned. I was mumbling. I'm sorry. I'm a real mumble\n\n01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.160\nboy. Christopher, it looks like this, the orcs are attacking this. Yeah, we should, we should.\n\n01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:08.000\nI could have told you that. I say, I say to the orcs, hey, assholes, you want to fuck with somebody,\n\n01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:15.440\npick on somebody, his own size. And I'm also short. That's right. Yeah. And I have the baby,\n\n01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.160\nwhich is also about your size. Right. Yeah. You, you, you emerge, huh? Yeah, where are you? Yeah,\n\n01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:26.080\nI come out too. I also emerge when I say, I know the recipe for your deaths.\n\n01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:36.480\nCan I hide? I mean, I, where's I, wait, are you going to hide? No, I'm done jerking off. I want\n\n01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.040\nto hide in a bush. Why are you hiding in a bush? We've, we've, we've made our play. There's a\n\n01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.360\nbunch of orcs attacking a little guy. Fine. Okay. All right. I'm all blustery. I go, hey, what do\n\n01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.160\nyou guys want? Your ass is kicked or what? Yeah. I know you're in your refractory period, but try to\n\n01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:56.400\npull yourself together. I don't think he ever came. All right. I can't. I can't. Okay. I'm sorry.\n\n01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:02.560\nHe isn't as effective. So the biggest orcs or the biggest of the orcs he raises a large golden,\n\n01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:08.080\nwhat is it, an axe, large golden axe above his head and brings it down to the floor and his orcs\n\n01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:17.680\ncharge. What? See, you guys need to fucking learn how to approach a city. I fucking like you come\n\n01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:23.440\nup to the door and you go, Dan, can we come in sharpie? I don't, you don't need to give us notes\n\n01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.680\nright now. You walk into a town and maybe there's going to be bad guys look like as you walk in.\n\n01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:32.400\nSo on the off chance that there's going to be bad guys, you just roll up and go, fuck your mother,\n\n01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:38.400\nfuck everybody, fuck everything. I didn't, I just said, Hey, what goes and they started attacking\n\n01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.360\nme. No, that's not what happened. Don't don't revise history. Exactly what happened. We rolled up\n\n01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.720\nand we were pricks to them and they're attacking us. I was going to kill them. I'm going to kill\n\n01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:52.400\nthem all. I said what goes castically. I was just trying to, I saw, I saw a little halfling gnome\n\n01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.920\nguy and I thought, shit, he's in trouble. And I went, wait, what's up? What's happening? Yeah,\n\n01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:00.800\nnow that now they're charging. So get in the fight or get out. I'm in the fight. You call me\n\n01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:09.520\nskencer? I mean, I'm fine with that. I like that better. Um, can I, can I produce my whisper bow?\n\n01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:19.840\nYeah. Okay. And I'm going to fire that at the, the head. Orc. Yeah, go for the minions first,\n\n01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:26.160\nright? They'll die easier. Minions or whatever's closest to you, I would say. Okay, I'm gonna,\n\n01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:38.000\nI'm going to fire at the minion that's closest to me. Closest to me. All right. An arrow from\n\n01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.680\nyour bow. You blast two arrows from your bow. The first one smashes them in the face dealing\n\n01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:51.360\nsix damage. We just got here. We just got to this city. It's too late. The fight is too late,\n\n01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:57.920\nwhich we just choose too early. We just got here. You should start, start jerking off again. So you\n\n01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:05.200\nlove the orc that you hit in the face. It dies causing your second arrow to miss. All right.\n\n01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:12.240\nNice. I say under my breath, adventure. A feeling that I've forgotten over this.\n\n01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:19.840\nSomeone else go wage. I'll have my ribbon dagger and I go for the next ribbon dagger.\n\n01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.400\nA ribbon dagger. I'm just hearing everything and I'm envisioning things. I'm hungry. I'm hungry.\n\n01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.640\nSo you heard a Rubin. I'll have the money, crystal sword and\n\n01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:35.200\nI love Rubin. Sarah crowd and Thousand Island. We're just, we're not even in the city yet.\n\n01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:40.000\nThat's true. Stop complaining. To get in the city. There's bad guys. We're gonna\n\n01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.480\nfucking, we're going to loot these people. Are they going to have the money? Why do you think\n\n01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:50.400\nyou're fucking raging about the government and jerking off on a bush like you? Yeah. When did\n\n01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:59.440\nyou lose your nerve Sharpie? Okay. Eight cities ago. I lost my nerve. So yeah. And you know,\n\n01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:06.400\nI might do that. I might, my character might go off and kill himself. What do you think about that?\n\n01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.720\nI think that's, I don't think you have the guts.\n\n01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:16.160\nI dare you to go, I dare you to go kill yourself. I'll roll the dice for you.\n\n01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.400\nAll right. The only way you can win is by killing yourself.\n\n01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:33.920\nI mean, it's better than there being a problem with everything that's happening at every turn.\n\n01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:39.600\nDo you guys don't, you guys don't. We're being attacked by orcs right now. We're being attacked\n\n01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:45.600\nby, we came up to the city. Am I so drunk that I don't understand this? I think maybe. Yes. Yes.\n\n01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.720\nAnswer is yes. Spencer, like it's Camille's move, right? You're still delivering Camille's\n\n01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.320\ndance. We walked up. There was a guy being attacked. Camille and I decided to go help. There was\n\n01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:58.880\nabsolutely no need to attack me. Camille's move. We didn't attack shit. We walked up and got in\n\n01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.560\na flanking position and said, what the fuck is happening? And they started attacking us.\n\n01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:11.840\nThat's what happened. What do you think happened, Dan? There wasn't a non-conflict resolution to\n\n01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:17.280\nthis encounter. What do you think is happening right now in the game? We came up to a city,\n\n01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:24.400\na brand new city. Yes. And we started attacking them. That's what happened. We did not. That's\n\n01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.720\nnot what happened. All right. This is out of turn. Well, we should tell them what happened.\n\n01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:35.280\nIt's Camille's turn. We walked up. We walked up. There was a stage coach with a guy defending\n\n01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.360\nhimself with a sack over his head. There were eight orcs attacking him. And I came up and said,\n\n01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.720\nhey, what goes? And with Christopher flanking around the side, and they turned to us and started\n\n01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:53.360\nattacking me. I'm sorry. It's okay. And we spoke last night for like 40 minutes. I'm sorry. I'm\n\n01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:58.480\nsorry. And I didn't, I didn't mean to cut Aaron off. I just, we went down this path so long. It's like,\n\n01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:02.400\nwhy did you go down it again when we could just end it? Can I, can I take out my sword? Yeah,\n\n01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:08.000\nI have my ribbon dagger that I threw. Oh yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. So you stabbed that guy in the,\n\n01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.360\njust the arm, but poison courses through his veins. And he almost instantly just falls down dead.\n\n01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:24.320\nI feel terrible. I feel terrible. I take out my sword. Wait, it's somebody else's turn. No, no,\n\n01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:32.640\nit's her turn now. Oh, okay. I take out my sword. In my pocket, there's a letter. But I take out my\n\n01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:41.440\nsword. I stab my eyes and I drag the sword. That's just what's happening. I take the sword and I\n\n01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:48.880\ndrag, I stab both of my eyes. I can hardly see. It's in the sword is in my left eye socket. I drag\n\n01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:56.480\nit down to my heart. I get it down to my heart and I mix it around like I'm mixing a cake mix.\n\n01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:03.680\nLike you're making Jello. Like I'm making Jello. And then I drag it down to my stomach and I open\n\n01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.000\nup my stomach and I take out my intestines and I make a necklace and I make a little like,\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:16.320\nlike goodbye. I write goodbye. Wait, this isn't my intestines. I die. I thought that we were\n\n01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:24.160\nat two and I die. He has to roll. Oh, I rolled it. Yeah, I just my only question. Here's here's\n\n01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:30.080\nmy only question. How's how hard are you trying to stab yourself in the eyes? I get everything\n\n01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:36.160\nreal hard. Yeah, okay, real hard. Yeah. I'm trying to I am stabbing myself in the eyes. I have a\n\n01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:41.440\nletter in my pocket. But as you're doing that, I say to the baby, she would have made a terrible\n\n01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:46.480\nmother. That's her in the town, everybody. Thank you for coming.\n\n01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.440\nAll right.\n\n01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:01.360\nWhat a cliffhanger. Rest in peace. I really thought we were just coming up to a city. I should\n\n01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.840\nprobably drink. I know it's fine. So we're doing it in space. Let's hear it first. An S.S.D. who\n\n01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:15.520\nwas apparently here. Kumail Nanjiani, Erin McGathy, Spencer Crittenden, Dana Carvey.\n\n01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:25.520\nI'm Jeff. Sorry I was late. Dan Harmon is your man. Thanks very much, everybody. We love you.\n\n01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:35.600\nWell, if you don't play the blues, you don't play no rock and roll.\n\n01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:47.920\nSo if you don't play the blues, yes. You said we don't know the definition of rock and roll, oh my\n\n01:48:47.920 --> 01:49:03.920\ngirl. Rock and roll's a-jumping. Yeah, to the core of his soul. Oh my god. Rock is there. Rock is\n\n01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:15.600\nthere. Rock is there. Rock is there. I talk to my friend. But that's what he said. That's what I said.\n\n01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:35.360\nWho is he? Who is he? My other friend? Rock is there. No. No rock and roll is there. Oh my god.\n\n01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:46.320\nLet me solo.\n\n01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:17.520\nMercury friend. Muscle car. Grateful dead. The lord of the ring. Zeppelin' red. The devil touch\n\n01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:28.560\nyou. There is it. It's all over. Yeah, oh, rock and roll is there. Oh my god. Let me do another\n\n01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:39.520\nsolo.\n\n01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:44.480\nOh\n\n01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:03.200\nstarted with blues. Barely a lead. Then there was hellish. Making some bed. The\n\n01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:12.160\nBeatles arrived. Started to shred. Axel rose. Rock is there.\n\n01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:42.160\nOh\n\n01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:52.160\ntake that big chain out of my head because the rock and roll is a-jumping.\n\n01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:57.280\nIt is all over. I can't roll this thing. One more time. It's all over.\n\n01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:06.240\nRock and roll is there. Two more times. It's all over.\n\n01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:29.200\nI said, but now I'm rock and roll. I said, but now I'm rock and roll. Yeah.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.001s"],"str_size":[130749]}
