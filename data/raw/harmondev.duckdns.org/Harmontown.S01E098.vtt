00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Welcome back everybody

00:25.000 --> 00:34.000

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
After two years on hiatus, Harmontown is now in session

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
For those of you not here live in Hollywood, California

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Meltdown Comics, I am dressed as a pirate

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Because I came from the Renaissance Fair

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
With all of the Harmonians

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
The Harmontown cast more or less

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
But without further ado, please welcome

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
The main pirate charge of shit, Mr. Dan Harmon

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Feral Audio

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Thank you

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Thank you

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Welcome back

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I missed you too

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
We all missed each other

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I missed you too

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
We took a month off

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It was good that we took a month off

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
I didn't really miss you during that month

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I was exactly ready to come back

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Because we spent the entire month at a Renaissance Fair

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, we went to the Renaissance Fair

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Listen, honestly, it seems dumb to disclaim this

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
But I am so fucking drunk and high

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
It seems stupid to even bother to say it

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
But I have to tell you

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
And that doesn't mean that I'm giving myself an excuse

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
I absolutely take it upon myself to give you your ten dollars worth

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Is it still ten?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
You're not walking out of here

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Feeling like you wasted ten dollars

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
That's the fucking Harmon guarantee

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
But I am so drunk and so high

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Because we went into a...

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
We got in a bus dressed as pirates

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
We went into a field

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And we went into a place...

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
We've been doing this every year for the last four years

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
It's a goddamn...

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
The Renaissance Fair, you don't know what it really is

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
It's a goddamn mecca

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
It's more than Comic-Con

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
It's a more important thing

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
It's a Malcolm X level actual statement of fucking position

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
You go through these turnstiles and then it's like

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
No, there's guys that are wearing baseball caps

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
They're like, you're the nerd now!

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
You're the nerd!

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Why don't you look weird?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
You're the fucking nerd!

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
They're having fun and they're pushing their strollers

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
We like the Renaissance a little bit

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Not enough!

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
You don't like it enough!

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Where's your eye shadow?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Just fucking bully them!

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
You're the fucking nerd tonight!

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Nothing bad happens to anybody

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
But it's just your blood pumps

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
That's why I go

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Everybody's got a plastic sword

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
And you're the fucking nerd

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Is that what you get out of it?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I started going...

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
You just like to wear women's shoes

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
You'll find that these slippers are Prada

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
They were given to me by Greg Poops

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
They were too big for him

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm never going to wear size 14 jazz slippers

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Until the Renaissance Fair came into my life

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Those are my own socks though

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Now...

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
There's a section that...

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Everything I'm wearing right now

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Minus my socks

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Everything I'm wearing right now

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
Is from the women's section at a buffalo exchange to a store

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
These fucking pirate pants

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Look like pirate pants, right?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I didn't do anything but rip the bottoms

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
And make them a little shaggy

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
It's fucking great

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
You get like Renaissance Fair

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Guys, go to the ladies section

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And you get a big ass billowy shirt

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I don't know how I got this one

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
They even specifically look like...

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Cookie... cookie thief

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Like you're a cookie thief

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
It's hard to believe that there's a time and place in America

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
When women were pursuing the...

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I don't know when these pants were

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Ever anybody's idea

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Except for me to find them and make pirate pants

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Fucking great

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
And it's so comfortable I'm wearing these forever

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Alright, Jeff's happy

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
I guess I'm experiencing my happiness through an angry valve

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, a long time ago, years ago

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I mean, well, a long time ago

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Let's say six years ago

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Before we had ever gone to the Renaissance Fair together

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I was against Renaissance fairs

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Because it sounded really stupid

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
It sounded like a big bummer

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
It sounded like a lot of bad improv

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
And a lot of people doing fake

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Like Elizabethan and whatnot

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
And taking something stupid too seriously

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
So my friend Diva Zappa, the youngest of the Zappa clan

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
She also hates...

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
She hated Renaissance fairs

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And she goes, I'm going to the Renaissance fair

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I was like, why?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
She's like, because I hate it

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Because it's stupid

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
And I have to go look it in the eye

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I have to go confront my terror

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
She went and I texted her the next day

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I go, how was it?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
She goes, I applied for a job

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm like, what?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
She's like, I don't know why

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't know why I like it

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I don't know if it's ironic

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I don't know if it's sincere

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I think it's a combination of both

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Something magical

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I know I need to be closer to that flame

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Something magical is happening there

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
And it has absolutely nothing to do with history

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Nothing to do with academia

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
There's no appreciation of anything

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Does a guy dress like a little finger?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Like nobody fucking knows

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And there's a million goggles

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Like the steampunk is kind of like

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Like a weird syphilitic bay

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
That runs through it

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
To the point where there's no kiosks

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
You can buy steampunk goggles

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
At the Renaissance fair

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Because they're like

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Somehow that overlaps

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Not somehow

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I know how

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
That's the point

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
I don't know

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
It's just anything that you could wear

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
That would make someone want to beat you up

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
It's just a bunch of people

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Like, oh, wearing it

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Who's going to beat me up?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Nobody's going to beat me up

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
But there's also a lot of avert

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I would call generally

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Not a jock culture

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Not a macho culture

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
But a lot of avert sexuality

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Where guys are just wholesale

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
That's the part I don't like

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
All right, on to that

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Hashtag rape culture

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
If you have a Tumblr blog

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
And you would like to get outraged

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Holy Toledo

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
That's right

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Toledo with a C-H

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
It's a cheeto

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Form of Toledo

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
It's an extra cheesy holy Toledo

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
If you're a 17-year-old girl

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And you would like to be a social activist

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
If you're interested in rape culture

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
And the elimination of it

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Starts at Irwindale, California

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Where people are juggling and just going

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Like every fucking booth you walk by

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Like, oh, glass blowing

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Oh, hello, Malini

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Would you like a hard six inches

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Of something hard and transparent

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
To go up into your purse

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Like every fucking thing is like a joke

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
About non-consensual sex

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Absolutely

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Oh, I was like the drip my mead

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
On the globes of the thing

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And everybody's just like

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
It's none of its inventive

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
But on the flip side

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Weird Al Rapovic

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Is what I would call the vibe

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
They're kind of like connecting semantic dots

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Like, oh, I make a rainstake

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Oh, it's a hard, hard eight inches of wood

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh, my lady

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Just because something looks like a dick

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Doesn't mean you can say it's a dick

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
And threaten to hit someone with it

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And come with them, come on

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
They're really thinking still there

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
In the middle of that field

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
They're like, well, if you can

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
If you can connect those dots

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
If something looked like a dick

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
If it was longer than it was wide

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Whether you're selling a candle

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Or a glass or a sword or a turtle

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
Like, it's satire

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I think it's satire of rape

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
What we're selling

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
From what I've heard, and I cannot verify this

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
But from what I've heard, like

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
First hand, I've gone now to, I would say

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Four of these, right? We've gone to four, right?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I think we've gone to four

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Four and five years we've gone

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
There are certain groups

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
That go to the Renaissance fair

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And pleasure fuckfest

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
And they, some are war camps

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Or the people that put on the war pageants

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And the jousting bits and stuff like that

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Some are old, like, kind of Medici looking

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Like, you know, kind of Borgia

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Like Italian kind of clans

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And they stay there, they stay there for the whole

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I think the whole goddamn time

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
And I believe they stay in character

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And they get down

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Because it gets down, they get down

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
When the sun goes down, if you're leaving

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
If you're leaving the Renaissance fair

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
As the sun is starting to set

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
And it's like, it's time to get the feel

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
The mosquitoes are coming out

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah, and it's like, everybody that works there

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Is already like, got sights set on somebody

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
That they're just like, I'm gonna fuck that

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Corn dog, selling lady over there so much

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
I'm gonna fuck that corn dog lady

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I'm just, yes, I'm gonna go

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah, I'm gonna fuck that corn dog lady

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
From what I've heard, that

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
When the paying customers leave

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And when the lights

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
That don't exist go down

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
When the anachronistic lights go down

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
In the non-city

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Do I wanna be there

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Using a period excuse to not use a condom

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Yes, sir

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Whoa

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
From what I've heard, maybe somebody

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Maybe somebody in our audience here tonight

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Can hit me to the actual details

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
What I've heard is that

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I would be surprised if Herman John's audience

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
But there's three people here tonight

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Who lost their virginity at a red fair

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Or that certainist corn dogs

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Four hours ago

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
But I've heard that it's like a rampant STD situation

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Because nobody wants to wear condoms

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Because that ain't period correct

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah, you don't want to be an anachronistic

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
And not give somebody herpes or aids or whatever

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I've heard that it's just like

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Spyrokeets of poppin'

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Spyrokeets of poppin'

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Alright

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Can anybody verify or deny that?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
No

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Yes, I am professor

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Like a guy would come up and

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Someone could say they worked at a thing

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
That's what I've heard

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
But apparently it's a really

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
But it's fine so far

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Can we talk about the party bus a little bit?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
No way, we're in a party bus

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
There's limos

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And there's limbs of veins

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
And there's ham of veins

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
And there's all kinds of different

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
There's golden doodles and chip o' vacays

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
There's different kinds of vehicles you can get

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
If you get a party bus

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
That's a fuckin' like

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
That's a bus that

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Usually relegated to

11:48.000 --> 12:02.720
you know, developmentally empowered students where they've stripped the tent off the windows

12:02.720 --> 12:09.960
and then put it back on. Like, now it's for partying. What I'm saying to you kids is it's

12:09.960 --> 12:15.040
a short bus, but they've taken out all the seeds and then they've put plywood on the

12:15.040 --> 12:23.000
floor. There was at least one stripper pole in it. There's a stripper pole in it. How else

12:23.000 --> 12:28.040
are you going to dance and have a good time? There was a hole under my feet. I sat in the

12:28.040 --> 12:31.920
back and there was a hole that you could see the highway. There's a freeway underneath

12:31.920 --> 12:38.560
your feet. You can look down. It is concrete. You can see it. I'm wearing slippers. If my

12:38.560 --> 12:41.680
slipper fell off, that was the end of that slipper because there was just the freeway

12:41.680 --> 12:48.000
underneath it. You could drop your phone down that hole and never see it again. Hold me

12:48.000 --> 12:53.640
up with a beat. No, I'm kidding. I don't know why. Also, I'm really drunk. I'm really

12:53.640 --> 13:00.080
drunk. But Dan, let me say, I'm doing it off my iPhone because I didn't remember to bring

13:00.080 --> 13:07.800
my iPads. That's why tonight's going to be great. I'm on the beats section in case you

13:07.800 --> 13:13.520
want to be. What wasn't there a... Okay. Do you guys see my $70 wooden cup I'm drinking

13:13.520 --> 13:19.480
out of? They told them that the wood enhances the flavor. It enhances the flavor of the

13:19.480 --> 13:26.320
beer. It enhances me that wood. It doesn't make any sense because you'd have to coat

13:26.320 --> 13:31.680
it with some kind of plastic. You don't know that, man. It's not such a thing as a wooden

13:31.680 --> 13:38.920
cup. The idea that it enhances the flavor is funny. Also, I thought I was being environmentally

13:38.920 --> 13:42.400
sound because I went to a show the other night and there was a charity there that was funding

13:42.400 --> 13:50.480
it and it was all about not refusing to use one-use plastic. Not having just a plastic

13:50.480 --> 13:56.240
water bottle or the order food to go. I don't want the plastic fork. I'm taking it home.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.560
I don't want the plastic fork that I'll use once throw away and it ends up in one of the

13:59.560 --> 14:05.080
gyre systems in the ocean. Yeah, great. I don't want the straw. I'll drink it without

14:05.080 --> 14:09.400
the straw. It's a very noble thing. So you go to the rent fair and you buy a nice $70

14:09.400 --> 14:15.560
wooden cup that enhances the flavor of the beer and then they can't pour it into the

14:15.560 --> 14:19.880
goddamn wooden cup. They had to pour it into a plastic cup that you pour into your beer

14:19.880 --> 14:26.320
and then they throw it out. It's fucking bullshit, man. How'd you get so drunk and high, Dan?

14:26.320 --> 14:35.320
Walk us through it. How'd your day start? Before we bring other people up, wasn't there

14:35.320 --> 14:40.480
a news item? Wasn't there a party bus where a woman was dancing and she was party busing

14:40.480 --> 14:47.040
and then she felt through the floor? No one heard about that? Okay. All right. Well, let's

14:47.040 --> 14:52.240
not worry about it. Wait, I worried about it. Tonight, tonight, we were brought to the

14:52.240 --> 15:00.840
rent fair by FirstImpressions.com. Look them up. Dan had a flintlock gun, not quite a blunder

15:00.840 --> 15:05.480
bus, but sort of like a flintlock musket, we'll call it. And you left it at the goddamn

15:05.480 --> 15:10.000
restaurant. Fuck that. I had it the whole time. We walked into Elkham Prodway down the

15:10.000 --> 15:14.280
road and people were unhappy about it. No, no, we were well received. I didn't think

15:14.280 --> 15:19.040
it was great. To do was great. I went to the men's room and one of the waiters came up

15:19.040 --> 15:22.440
and said, no, no, no, the ladies room is that way. Then I turned around and he's like,

15:22.440 --> 15:30.480
Oh, but that's just him. He's just seven feet tall. This is a West Hollywood. We had

15:30.480 --> 15:37.800
a bad time. No, we had a good time today. I can't believe that parrot stayed safety

15:37.800 --> 15:49.480
pinned to your shoulder the entire time. All right, come on. Give me a beat. Give me a

15:49.480 --> 15:59.360
beat. Let's fucking rap. Why do these people come here? Let's fucking rap. Yeah, yo, yo,

15:59.360 --> 16:08.200
yo, smooth rap. Yeah. Yeah. Smooth, slow, smooth, you want a faster rap? No, no, no.

16:08.200 --> 16:14.160
No, no, no, no. From the street rap, from the tip to the sky to the top of the floor.

16:14.160 --> 16:19.840
I'm gonna fuck your mama down to the ceiling and floor. I just, I just run the words floor

16:19.840 --> 16:24.880
and floor and when I'm done getting fucking your mama gonna rhyme some more. I fucked

16:24.880 --> 16:31.240
your mama in her knee in her eye. I fucked your mama with her shoe in her thigh. I fucked

16:31.240 --> 16:36.840
your mama's legs fucked her butt. I fucked your mama in the eye and your dad said, What?

16:36.840 --> 16:47.320
I said, Hey, Mr. Domino fence. I'm just fucking your wife. It's the best defense. And he was

16:47.320 --> 16:56.680
like, Whoa, okay, let me process this. And after a while, he was open to it. He got dressed

16:56.680 --> 17:03.600
up a spider man sat on a chair. Watch me fuck your mama and he didn't seem to care. He started

17:03.600 --> 17:08.880
rubbing his crotch and getting hot. I fucked your mama like her name was Tater Tot. Fuck

17:08.880 --> 17:20.480
daddy too. Fucked everyone and you were taking a bath. I came creeping in and said, Let me

17:20.480 --> 17:27.680
help you with your math. Two plus two is four. But what's going down below here and more?

17:27.680 --> 17:33.000
He looked at balls and stroke your shaft. I was like, head with the angry inch. You're

17:33.000 --> 17:40.440
fucking doing that. Yeah. Down the drain. Everyone's homophobia is catching the train.

17:40.440 --> 17:48.520
We're going cross country and more. Every culture is going to advance more. Everybody's

17:48.520 --> 17:58.160
cool with everything. Yeah. All the races. Yeah. Fuck your mama some more black people

17:58.160 --> 18:09.760
game people. Dan Harmon, everybody. Dan Harmon. Is that what you wanted? I know that's why

18:09.760 --> 18:14.520
you came here tonight. I thought I thought your rap would be a little bit more renaissancey.

18:14.520 --> 18:20.680
I thought it would rhyme more. I thought there'd be more rhyming. It rhymed plenty when you

18:20.680 --> 18:26.600
were rhyming the same word. I thought your mama was a shoe. And then I put on a sock

18:26.600 --> 18:34.040
and put on a shoe. I'm really drunk and high. I can't stress the high part enough. I need

18:34.040 --> 18:39.160
people to know. I'm also high. Yeah? Yeah. You're not allowed to just say you're drunk.

18:39.160 --> 18:47.520
How high are you? I'm super high. All right. So let's bring up. Come on. The show's going

18:47.520 --> 18:56.520
great. We've been off for a month. We're coming back with the best show ever. There's nothing

18:56.520 --> 19:15.600
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get Kumeil Nanjiani out here. Yeah. Yeah.

19:15.600 --> 19:25.840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, you don't look like your face doesn't match

19:25.840 --> 19:32.600
the renaissance era, but you really were born in the wrong time, my friend. But you saw

19:32.600 --> 19:37.280
Spencer, right? Like Spencer. Oh, of course. We all know that. Like Spencer, Spencer's

19:37.280 --> 19:40.800
the last guy that would like bother to dress up for something. But if a renaissance guy

19:40.800 --> 19:47.120
came through a portal, yeah, he would, if he caught a glance at Spencer, he'd be like,

19:47.120 --> 19:54.320
Hey, what's going on? Oh, a friend. Spencer looks like a fucking alchemist. Yeah. And

19:54.320 --> 20:00.240
all he did is put on a mustard shirt at our best. Yeah. He, Spencer could be wearing a

20:00.240 --> 20:04.720
Ninja Turtles shirt in the time travel. We're like, what am I on? How are we? We should,

20:04.720 --> 20:20.320
let's bring Spencer out just to look. Spencer. You guys are dressed like assholes. Yeah.

20:20.320 --> 20:28.640
Sorry. Where did you get that hat? It's just my hat. When the sun's out, that's the hat

20:28.640 --> 20:34.480
you put on. Yeah. Going to the game. It's great. Yeah. It's got a very straight bill.

20:34.480 --> 20:40.880
It doesn't impede my vision. No, I got all this stuff at a costume place. I just went

20:40.880 --> 20:45.200
in there and came out. Was that your first renaissance fair experience? This is my first

20:45.200 --> 20:52.400
all sorts of experiences. I drink mead. There's a turkey leg involved. I was surprised that

20:52.400 --> 21:00.800
you were, that you wanted to go. Okay. Did you have a good time, Spencer? Yeah. I mean,

21:00.800 --> 21:05.760
it's like a state fair, except everyone's acting all dumb and weird. Well, so you have

21:05.760 --> 21:11.120
a very different take than Dan does. No, I loved it, but everyone's like, oh, the lord

21:11.120 --> 21:20.400
wants a ducket for his coop. I'm like, no, I want a cider. What does meat taste like?

21:20.400 --> 21:26.160
Is it just like beer? I mean, it's not as good. I mean, well, beer's not. I don't know. Alcohol

21:26.160 --> 21:33.520
tastes alcoholic, and then it has these weird flavors that taste bad. That's about all I've

21:33.520 --> 21:42.560
been able to understand in terms of flavor profile of alcohol. I wish I'd gone. I just

21:42.560 --> 21:46.280
got back in town this evening. I would have loved to have gone. I've never been. What have

21:46.280 --> 21:59.360
you been up to? Nothing, right? Aside from being the star of a television show. Yeah,

21:59.360 --> 22:05.360
I haven't been up to anything. She's been hanging out. I was in Atlanta, which is actually,

22:05.360 --> 22:13.960
is anyone from Atlanta? It's like a pretty good city. It's what is it? Okay, that's

22:13.960 --> 22:21.520
crazy. Yeah, I remember Woody Allen made that movie Midnight in Atlanta. What a great movie

22:21.520 --> 22:33.240
that was. The black and white one called Atlanta. It's a, it's a good. Was that Casablanca?

22:33.240 --> 22:38.120
No. Well, I was going with Woody Allen, so it was Manhattan. Oh, Manhattan. Yeah. That

22:38.120 --> 22:43.680
is fantastic. It's, it's, yeah. Don't they have like, like all the traffic lights, they're

22:43.680 --> 22:49.800
on strings. That's weird. What? They just hang in from strings. Why can't you just let

22:49.800 --> 22:55.400
a city do something? Well, you know, here we have them on poles and stuff. What are

22:55.400 --> 23:02.320
the strings hanging from? The stars? Yeah. Yeah. No, the ceiling. The ceiling. The ceiling

23:02.320 --> 23:09.280
of Atlanta? He doesn't know. Nobody tell him. Nobody tell him. Atlanta, the entire city

23:09.280 --> 23:14.480
is indoors. Yeah, should have mentioned it's under a dome. I don't know why we didn't bring

23:14.480 --> 23:18.520
that up. Is that, I didn't even notice. I barely look up. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, they

23:18.520 --> 23:21.880
have these big white roads and they have a lot of traffic signals and they just have

23:21.880 --> 23:25.600
like six or seven traffic signals just on this big string that's strung between two

23:25.600 --> 23:31.000
poles. It's weird. It's not even a, it's not funny. It's weird. I didn't notice that. Is

23:31.000 --> 23:37.200
that right? Atlanta Lake? She, she disagreed. I've been there like two or three times. That

23:37.200 --> 23:43.840
was literally the only takeaway I had. When you're there, you feel like the city's trying

23:43.840 --> 23:47.720
to make you fat. That's the takeaway I took. They're like, you don't want, for a side,

23:47.720 --> 23:51.960
you want a fried chicken biscuit? Just for a side, it was $2. I was like, yeah, that's

23:51.960 --> 23:58.160
just a side. It was like a full fried chicken sandwich for $2. That's how I felt in Nashville

23:58.160 --> 24:04.840
and Portland and everywhere, but Los Angeles. Los Angeles is the only city where there's

24:04.840 --> 24:10.480
such a thing as a restaurant. It's like, well, we're, we're, you know, high protein, low

24:10.480 --> 24:17.840
lactose. Like you can go in and get a little square of fish. We were, we were at this,

24:17.840 --> 24:21.400
the same diner and this guy was there and he was very nice and we ordered food and we

24:21.400 --> 24:24.680
told some funny story and he laughed and he was like, the funniest thing happened earlier

24:24.680 --> 24:29.960
today. You guys missed it. This woman came in and I'm not going to do the Southern accent,

24:29.960 --> 24:38.160
but like imagine like a racist version of that and then don't change anything. And he's

24:38.160 --> 24:41.960
like, the funniest thing happened earlier today. This woman came in, came in and she

24:41.960 --> 24:48.160
asked for toast. She asked for, she asked for gluten free and then we were like silent

24:48.160 --> 24:53.240
for what seemed like three minutes. It's just like staring like, are there, is there more

24:53.240 --> 24:58.920
to this story? Nope. I think the world was silent for three minutes and then one put

24:58.920 --> 25:10.760
in our order. Good story guy. So life changed for you now that you're, I mean, it seems

25:10.760 --> 25:18.480
like you've been on a very linear 45 degree rise. Like I don't perceive your life as changing

25:18.480 --> 25:26.880
in quantum shifts, but you are now a regular character on this Mike Judge show. Yeah. I

25:26.880 --> 25:34.000
just, I'm curious as have you perceived any shifts happening in your reality? No, I mean,

25:34.000 --> 25:39.400
I, I get recognized like more, but you know, the kind of recognize where they're like,

25:39.400 --> 25:43.760
Hey, how's it going? Where they think I went to like college with them or something? There's

25:43.760 --> 25:47.760
a lot of that. We'll be like, Hey, how are you? I'm like, good. I've never seen your

25:47.760 --> 25:52.600
face before. So they don't, they don't put it together a lot of times. How are your mom

25:52.600 --> 25:59.840
and dad taking this? Well, they're taking it by not bringing it up at all. So it aired,

25:59.840 --> 26:04.080
you know, it aired and I was like, Hey, watch the show. Two weeks went by and they did not

26:04.080 --> 26:10.120
bring it up. And then I said, Hey, did you watch my new show? And she said, Yeah. And

26:10.120 --> 26:15.240
then it was silent for longer than it was silent with that waiter in Atlanta. She didn't

26:15.240 --> 26:21.200
say anything. And then she was like, it's good. And that was it. Great. This is all

26:21.200 --> 26:25.840
I want from them. I don't want them to love it. First of all, fuck, I do want them to

26:25.840 --> 26:30.480
love it. If your son is on a show, even if you don't love it, fucking love it, you know,

26:30.480 --> 26:35.840
love the fucking show that your son is on. But even if you don't love it, just tell me

26:35.840 --> 26:38.920
you love it. That's all I want. What do you think? Because that's a that's a through line

26:38.920 --> 26:42.440
in your life. You've told several of these kinds of stories where they're terse about

26:42.440 --> 26:49.200
your, yeah, like career. What do you think there is blocking them from just being effusive

26:49.200 --> 26:53.640
or being upfront about what they don't like about it? I don't know. My brother was in

26:53.640 --> 26:58.280
town and he sees him every other week. He lives like by them. And I, we were like hanging

26:58.280 --> 27:02.600
out and I hadn't really hung out with my brother as an adult very much. And I was like, Hey,

27:02.600 --> 27:09.640
so like, how's your relationship with your pair with our parents? Your parents? That

27:09.640 --> 27:20.200
says something. Are their parents to you? No. And he was like, he was like, it's fucking

27:20.200 --> 27:25.480
weird. And then we just bonded over how weird he said, he talked about how like there's

27:25.480 --> 27:30.400
like this wall where we don't talk about there's like a big filter. Is that just because that's

27:30.400 --> 27:34.800
that that's their identity? Or is that could you expand that and say that's a Pakistani

27:34.800 --> 27:39.120
kind of cultural thing or no? I don't know. I mean, I don't know how many Pakistani parents

27:39.120 --> 27:46.040
have kids who, you know, are in HBO shows. Is it a, is it a religious thing? Are your

27:46.040 --> 27:51.440
parents like devout Muslim, for instance? They are devout Muslims. But I think this

27:51.440 --> 27:56.680
is more like, you know, usually when you have, when you have parents, your relationship evolves

27:56.680 --> 28:00.480
in the beginning, they're just your caretakers and they're your disciplinarians. And as you

28:00.480 --> 28:04.880
grow, it becomes more of sort of a friendly relationship, not you never become peers,

28:04.880 --> 28:12.720
but there's like a warmth to it that, hopefully. Yeah. We have a warmth, but we never crossed

28:12.720 --> 28:18.160
like the line into actually being able to talk about stuff. It reminds me of like Dan,

28:18.160 --> 28:22.760
like you and Schrab and like my, my, my Midwestern friends. Yeah. It's a very Midwestern. It's

28:22.760 --> 28:28.120
funny how familiar that sounds. Like I truly like, there is a weird filter there where

28:28.120 --> 28:35.280
I felt like my parents were like lizard people. I, I, there was a certain, it was like, I,

28:35.280 --> 28:42.280
I remember being a kid and laying my head on my mom's lap and it was, and then, and

28:42.280 --> 28:48.200
then I remember the day when my mom tried to touch me and I was like, yeah. And I, and

28:48.200 --> 28:53.800
I, religion did have something to do with it, but it was also moreover, it was almost

28:53.800 --> 29:00.240
like there was an unspoken tradition about the nature of kids and their parents that,

29:00.240 --> 29:06.880
that I, I hit an age where actually on both sides, there was an unspoken agreement that

29:06.880 --> 29:11.640
like this is over. Yeah. We're not, we're not, we're not cuddly anymore. Yeah. Because

29:11.640 --> 29:16.400
there's no reason to be. It's not you. It's not me. It's all based on logic. And when

29:16.400 --> 29:21.240
I see that Star Trek episode when Spock says like, huh, well, it's every seven years, here's

29:21.240 --> 29:28.320
something I buried the lead on before I joined Starfleet, uh, every seven years. I, I have

29:28.320 --> 29:31.320
to go back to my planet and I got to fuck her fight. Yeah.

29:31.320 --> 29:36.600
I should have brought it up earlier, but the writers ran out of storylines this year.

29:36.600 --> 29:41.120
Honestly, Captain Kirk, I got your back and everything else, but can you give me a ride

29:41.120 --> 29:48.040
to third and Lancashire? And, and, and Captain Kirk's like, okay, that's fine. Is there anything

29:48.040 --> 29:51.960
you want to talk about? Absolutely nothing. And he just like goes back to his planet and

29:51.960 --> 29:55.480
has to deal with the shit. There's a compartmentalization.

29:55.480 --> 29:58.840
Yeah. Certainly there is. And I think part of it for me was, you know, I left when I

29:58.840 --> 30:03.880
was 17 and I wasn't like a person yet. And then I became a person away from them. And

30:03.880 --> 30:09.080
when they met me, I was like a, a person. And I think they never were able to reconcile

30:09.080 --> 30:13.480
the person with their son. So I think that divide is still there where they never really

30:13.480 --> 30:19.320
see me develop into like an actual, you know, is that because they, they didn't feel they

30:19.320 --> 30:23.480
were a part of that change of that shift? I think it probably weird them out that I'm

30:23.480 --> 30:28.400
not the same, you know, I'm very different from when I was a kid. I was very, very shy.

30:28.400 --> 30:33.080
Like I wouldn't talk like I wouldn't go to, okay, this is kind of revealing. It's weird.

30:33.080 --> 30:39.200
I had this weird thing until I was like pretty, um, well, I wouldn't, I was very shy. I couldn't

30:39.200 --> 30:44.720
like buy stuff at the store. I thought they wouldn't like sell me stuff here in the States

30:44.720 --> 30:49.240
or back home, back home, back home. Well, I was like, because I thought that I was very

30:49.240 --> 30:57.280
ugly always until like, I was pretty like, you know, old. Uh, and, uh, so, so I thought

30:57.280 --> 31:03.240
like, Oh, the stores won't sell me stuff. So because I'm ugly, what did you want a handsome

31:03.240 --> 31:15.080
hat? I feel ugly again. Come on, sell me the chips. No, I just felt weird. I don't know.

31:15.080 --> 31:19.640
And so I was like very, very shy and introverted. And then they suddenly met me and I was like,

31:19.640 --> 31:23.880
you know, more outgoing and like talkative and stuff. And so I think I was weird. Where

31:23.880 --> 31:32.080
did that, that extreme shyness come from? Like, can you trace that back? Um, well, it came

31:32.080 --> 31:38.400
from how I thought I looked at, that's how it came, which was weird. Did you ever ask

31:38.400 --> 31:50.760
your mom if you were handsome? Uh, no, I did. How old were you to tell me how old? Yeah,

31:50.760 --> 32:00.160
I want to know what room of the house you're in. Yeah, set the scene. Interior. I was in

32:00.160 --> 32:04.240
my living room. And I want you to word it exactly as you were in it. I was in my living

32:04.240 --> 32:14.080
room and I, I think it was 14 or 15. And I asked my mom, that's funny that one detail

32:14.080 --> 32:23.400
could make a story go from funny to sad. You guys thought I was 23. You thought I was some

32:23.400 --> 32:31.760
kind of loser? I got it. I know, I know. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I learned to drive

32:31.760 --> 32:41.000
a car soon, but tell me, am I handsome? I asked my mom if I was handsome. Would you, if you

32:41.000 --> 32:45.520
had to go back and sort of pinpoint when your relationship with your mom got weird?

32:45.520 --> 32:59.480
Did you ask her to rate you from zero to 10? Wait, so she, she, in my mind, she's, in my

32:59.480 --> 33:03.320
mind, she's like in the kitchen, like, like, like, like putting a sandwich in a bag. She's

33:03.320 --> 33:09.160
having a normal day. She doesn't know what's going to happen. She didn't buy a chicken

33:09.160 --> 33:15.880
to this ride. And all I do is get pregnant at 22. A five foot ten gentleman walks into

33:15.880 --> 33:24.440
the kitchen. A Ralph Macchio felt hat, yin-yang on the sleeve of his frosted denim jacket.

33:24.440 --> 33:32.760
Mom, am I good looking? What happened? Is that what you want? What'd she say? She, she,

33:32.760 --> 33:42.920
she laughed. Which anyone would. Well, as the audience did just now. Right. Yeah, I mean,

33:42.920 --> 33:49.120
like, that's the thing. I'm realizing I, I'm the weird one. That's, that's a tough, that's

33:49.120 --> 33:54.560
a tough. What in there? I was steeple to chase. What is, what did her face do? And then what

33:54.560 --> 34:01.680
did her mouth say? She, she immediately made it clear that that was one of the worst questions

34:01.680 --> 34:07.760
you, you can ever ask a mother. And it was like, I don't know. You're fine. Like she

34:07.760 --> 34:12.520
just tried to get through it. You know how they say everyone like in mother's eyes, even

34:12.520 --> 34:18.360
through the mother's eyes, she's like, you're fine. What had happened that day, Dan, that

34:18.360 --> 34:25.040
led you to that question? I don't know. I assume it was some girl in high school that

34:25.040 --> 34:29.000
was, I don't know, that was. Were you going to like go? Inexplicably not responding to

34:29.000 --> 34:37.600
my obsessive compulsive notes that I was giving her. Sir, I said circle one. Yeah. Why haven't

34:37.600 --> 34:43.960
you circled one? Was the plan to go back? Maybe it's the shape of my face. Hey, mom,

34:43.960 --> 34:52.000
was the plan to go back to her armed with your mom's response as a reputable. I asked

34:52.000 --> 35:00.440
my mother. It seems you are mistaken. I believe you. I believe you. I believe you. I believe

35:00.440 --> 35:08.240
you. I believe you. Guess what, Tracy? Someone just told me I look like David Duchovny. I have

35:08.240 --> 35:15.600
a list of references. I think you might want to look over. Yeah. Oh, no. I don't believe

35:15.600 --> 35:21.400
me. I, this will shock you at the age of 15 when I asked my mom if I was good looking.

35:21.400 --> 35:25.760
I didn't know what I was doing. I had no idea where it was going to go from there. She said

35:25.760 --> 35:32.120
you're fine. Yeah. I didn't walk away from that conversation feeling handsome. And that's

35:32.120 --> 35:38.760
not on her. That's not a mom's job. No. Like you said, she just got pregnant before she

35:38.760 --> 35:44.760
was born. She didn't sign up for you. All right, buddy. I imagine it like, try not to

35:44.760 --> 35:50.880
smoke pot. Take it easy on the skateboards. I just had sex that one time and now you're

35:50.880 --> 35:57.880
in my kitchen being weird. Yeah. This is not fair to me. I need a government subsidy if

35:57.880 --> 36:06.080
I'm going to be teaching this activity. Yeah, you're real hot stud. Take your shirt off.

36:06.080 --> 36:11.760
Here's your hot pockets. Get the fuck to school and get out of my house. Jesus Christ, you're

36:11.760 --> 36:21.200
15. You're jerking off. You're shooting cum everywhere. I think no one should be talking

36:21.200 --> 36:29.280
to you about anything. Get the fuck out of here. Thank God for video games. Get the fuck

36:29.280 --> 36:36.360
out of my house. You're a weird, fucking weird, scrawny Gary Busey looking. I imagine you

36:36.360 --> 36:41.720
going back to playing video games and asking Mega Man the same question. Am I good looking?

36:41.720 --> 36:59.280
Yes. Let's get more of our friends out. Oh, brother. Let's bring out my fiance and Matt

36:59.280 --> 37:23.800
Gourley at the same time. There's no way to quit. No. We're trying to find more chairs.

37:23.800 --> 37:34.560
Kumail, he'll get another mic. If I know Kumail, I'm really drunken. Sorry. What do

37:34.560 --> 37:42.240
you guys bring to the table? What do you want? These are just two other people that woke

37:42.240 --> 37:49.040
up too early. Matt Gourley, before Erin, by the way, has a marvelous outfit on that she

37:49.040 --> 37:57.760
cobbled together. Looks like a million bucks. Matt, this is just a trip through your girlfriend's

37:57.760 --> 38:06.320
closet if I'm not mistaken. It's five minutes into my girlfriend's wardrobe. Erin, how many

38:06.320 --> 38:12.640
men implied that they would like to have non-consexual wool sex with you while you're walking

38:12.640 --> 38:23.720
on a circular dirt road around a bunch of vans? I just leave the fare to go to Rape Vanfield.

38:23.720 --> 38:31.240
That's what they're going to say. It's Rape Vanfield. One of the actual booths is just

38:31.240 --> 38:37.800
a Rape van. It really is. I don't know what the protocol for a guy is. If you're walking

38:37.800 --> 38:43.680
with your girlfriend down a dirt road and everyone's dressed like Toucan Sam and Bernie

38:43.680 --> 38:48.560
Rubble and whatever the fuck, everyone's like, oh, we're having a good time. If there's just

38:48.560 --> 38:56.280
a guy at a glass-blowing stand, if he goes like, glass-blowing, oh, hello, my lady. Looks

38:56.280 --> 39:03.240
like you've got two glass bulbs that I'd like to blow on, like the nipples of those glass

39:03.240 --> 39:09.440
bulbs. You're supposed to just keep walking, right? That doesn't make me Willie Lohman

39:09.440 --> 39:15.120
or anything. You stab him. You stab him. Am I supposed to stop and go like, hey, fuck

39:15.120 --> 39:22.160
face? What's up? Yeah. I'm Adam Sandler. I don't think any of those things were specific

39:22.160 --> 39:28.840
to me, but there was a point where there was a nuts salesman or a ball salesman that's

39:28.840 --> 39:34.200
like, how am I eating my nuts? Dan and I were joking about this very thing, and I said,

39:34.200 --> 39:37.400
I just want to go up to him and say, yeah, I'm going to fucking eat your nuts. I'm just

39:37.400 --> 39:42.240
taking my hands. I just want to squeeze your little baby nuts. Just take them. You want

39:42.240 --> 39:49.000
me to squeeze your nuts? Does that feel good? Am I your mommy? I'm going on and on, and

39:49.000 --> 39:55.360
Dan said, Aaron, you're in a forest of children. We had walked, she was doing that, Ben. She's

39:55.360 --> 40:00.960
like, what if I said that? We were walking there. There was like 18 children. And between

40:00.960 --> 40:08.120
them, their collective age wasn't to 30. There was like half a dozen children. Mommy, why

40:08.120 --> 40:13.200
does that, why does that woman want to squeeze that man's testicle? There was this guy at

40:13.200 --> 40:18.800
the Mead Hutch or wherever we were. And he had, he was selling this special deal where

40:18.800 --> 40:23.560
he had these like, like, kooche ball sponges full of cold water and he would put them on

40:23.560 --> 40:29.240
the backs of women to cool them down. He was selling this, mind you. And then the girl

40:29.240 --> 40:32.680
that had it done, her boyfriend was right next to him and then he put it on her chin

40:32.680 --> 40:38.440
and he goes, look familiar. What? To the boyfriend. Wait, meaning that the sponge is like balls?

40:38.440 --> 40:42.360
Yeah, because they were ball shaped. Oh, there was someone with a mister who was like, get

40:42.360 --> 40:46.360
it all over your face. That's what you're, you stare and check, you know, like, you kind

40:46.360 --> 40:51.640
of, you kind of fade away. It doesn't hold up to the fucking cancel cold bear standard.

40:51.640 --> 40:57.280
Like, like, if you go in there with the slightest ounce of fucking, if your Geiger counter is

40:57.280 --> 41:03.960
like, it won't last five seconds. Everyone beyond those gates is like, oh, my balls and

41:03.960 --> 41:10.440
my dick. You look like a fucking dick heartache. Wow, right, my dick on you. Like in the Renaissance.

41:10.440 --> 41:14.440
I will say to their credit, all those men that are saying all those things are very respectful

41:14.440 --> 41:22.600
and bad. That was such a dumb joke. That was such a dumb joke. Hey, real quick. A couple

41:22.600 --> 41:28.200
of days ago, I was watching, I had Conan DVR and I was playing the commercials, which is

41:28.200 --> 41:33.360
something you don't usually, you don't usually see commercials. And I saw a promo. It sounds

41:33.360 --> 41:41.240
like the dumbest. The worst. So there was a promo for a new segment where they said,

41:41.240 --> 41:46.600
prom's proposals, an epidemic. And then it cut to like a clip of these kids proposing

41:46.600 --> 41:50.920
to their girlfriends at prom. And they're like too much too soon. And I remember thinking,

41:50.920 --> 41:54.960
like, oh, that's so silly. Like that seems like a, I don't know, let the kids propose

41:54.960 --> 42:01.880
prom. Totally unrelated from that. I just met someone backstage named Luke. Will Luke

42:01.880 --> 42:09.400
come on stage? Luke, all right. Unrelated. All right. Unrelated. Luke. Real quick. What

42:09.400 --> 42:20.920
are you doing for prom? You want to go with me? Yeah. You go with that. Is he proposing?

42:20.920 --> 42:36.880
He just said not at all what I expected. I hope that was okay. Wait, I'm really confused

42:36.880 --> 42:46.200
right now. Are you guys in high school? Yeah, it was an actual thing. You just asked this

42:46.200 --> 42:51.440
girl to the prom. Yeah. And she said yes. Oh, I thought you were saying, I know I was

42:51.440 --> 42:55.480
here, but I have a lot of questions, Luke. You watched it happen. By the way, she could

42:55.480 --> 42:59.880
not say no. I thought you were saying, I thought you were saying, Aaron, that there are people

42:59.880 --> 43:04.040
that are kids that are proposing at prom to for marriage. Well, he's got another thing

43:04.040 --> 43:10.240
in his pocket that she's gonna see at prom. I thought that maybe that intro would qualify

43:10.240 --> 43:15.200
it in a way is to not embarrass Luke, but maybe it embarrassed him. No, no, no, Luke

43:15.200 --> 43:23.560
is cool. Luke's not the one who's embarrassed. Can I do it again? Can I do it again? Half

43:23.560 --> 43:28.080
the audience just said, no, you cannot do that. Am I the only one here that thought you

43:28.080 --> 43:33.120
were saying a story about how kids are proposing marriage at prom? Yeah. Okay. So I thought

43:33.120 --> 43:37.440
it was a 18 year old reception. That is what she was saying. You were. No, no, no, no.

43:37.440 --> 43:43.360
They were talking about how kids are having very elaborate prom asking. Oh, they're turning

43:43.360 --> 43:48.800
it into... He's got his name written on your hand. I came up before and asked me if I could

43:48.800 --> 43:55.480
get him in. Luke, what's the girl's name? This is Haley. Hello, Haley. Are you happy

43:55.480 --> 44:06.920
about this prom proposal? Okay. Let's take that again with more sincerity. And action.

44:06.920 --> 44:14.560
Are you guys friends? Yeah, we know each other. Yeah. So I know you know each other, but...

44:14.560 --> 44:19.280
They're like this. Luke, how could I have done that better? What were you hoping for?

44:19.280 --> 44:28.480
I did great. You did everything I expected you would do. Why is that so creepy? You did

44:28.480 --> 44:34.880
everything I expected. He just used you as a ploy to do what you do. And he's like she'll

44:34.880 --> 44:40.800
do it bad and then we can make fun of her and that's how we'll fall in love. The dot

44:40.800 --> 44:44.640
I'm not connecting is they're not high school kids. They are high school kids. Oh, they are.

44:44.640 --> 44:53.680
She's asking her to go to prom. Prom proposals. It wasn't a marriage proposal? She's asking

44:53.680 --> 45:07.760
her to go to prom? Yes. God forbid that go wrong. Ken, where were you? In the Renaissance?

45:07.760 --> 45:16.000
What happened? Yeah, but you guys are just friends. We've been friends. Luke and Hailey.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.400
They know each other from history. American friends or French friends?

45:20.400 --> 45:26.680
Luke and Hailey. So you're friends. You want to go prom with each other or you at least

45:26.680 --> 45:32.240
wanted Hailey to go with you, Luke. This is a culture of things that's happening where

45:32.240 --> 45:37.600
kids are doing more and more elaborate proposals. Are we living in a world now where you come

45:37.600 --> 45:43.120
to a podcast and do that? Are your friends also doing that sort of thing? Yeah, they're

45:43.120 --> 45:51.160
a different podcast. There's a guy at Douglas movies right now. Yeah, you couldn't have worked

45:51.160 --> 45:59.120
up a flash. Hailey. They tried to get WTF but he's booked out for a while. Hailey, do

45:59.120 --> 46:04.680
girls ask guys out in the same way? Yeah, what's the Sadie Hawkins protocol? Do girls

46:04.680 --> 46:10.160
also initiate or is it only guys initiating? No, nothing for the girls. They're guys initiate?

46:10.160 --> 46:15.440
But you could, right? I mean, there's nothing precluding you from that. You'd be spit on.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.840
You'd be spit on? What? If a girl asked a guy, would you go to the prom with me? The

46:19.840 --> 46:28.040
guy would spit on them? She's saying you're putting yourself, as much as you're putting

46:28.040 --> 46:33.400
yourself out there, a guy asking a girl to prom. It's way more.

46:33.400 --> 46:39.680
Yeah, we haven't progressed to this point yet. Luke, be honest, Luke. What percentage

46:39.680 --> 46:43.680
would you say that you thought that was a done deal? Like she was going to say yes?

46:43.680 --> 46:54.680
Um, well... 50-50? 80? Be careful, Luke. Yeah, I had that shit in the bag. We're really

46:54.680 --> 46:58.880
good friends. She doesn't go to my school but she used to go to my school. You know,

46:58.880 --> 47:03.640
I feel like she... Was she expelled for a... For going to too many proms? She was the

47:03.640 --> 47:09.720
Hester Prynne of their high school. Big pee on her chest. She did ask a guy to prom?

47:09.720 --> 47:13.800
Oh yeah, she got spat on. That's why she left. Are you kidding me? What is happening?

47:13.800 --> 47:18.560
It's a really bad set of 200. No, no. This is true. Luke, don't try with us. You guys

47:18.560 --> 47:25.320
what, 17, 18 hold you? I'm 18. You're 18? Mm-hmm. And? Mm-hmm. Okay. Really, you're

47:25.320 --> 47:32.000
18? You're 18? As far as we know, yes. Luke, when you asked your mom if you were physically

47:32.000 --> 47:37.120
attractive, when you were nervous about today, what did she say? No offense, I think Luke

47:37.120 --> 47:42.120
is the kind of guy that has the kind of looks where he knows the answer already. We all

47:42.120 --> 47:51.520
do. Yeah, Luke's mom is responding with fine. She's opening with fine. I just came from

47:51.520 --> 47:57.680
a Dusty Love Festival. He wanted to prove that he could ask a girl to prom in any way.

47:57.680 --> 48:02.600
He's just flaunting it. Yeah. He's like, I could poop will you go to prom with me on

48:02.600 --> 48:09.080
a plate? She'll still say yes. I'm going to take her to a show and bear as the fuck out

48:09.080 --> 48:18.720
of her. I'm fucking Luke, man. I feel a little used by Luke a little bit. Well, I'm jealous.

48:18.720 --> 48:24.400
There was nothing, there was no amount of flowers I could give to a girl that would make

48:24.400 --> 48:37.120
her do anything. Spencer, what kind of high school romantic path did you forge? I went

48:37.120 --> 48:48.160
to high school. Did you do it in high school? I went to high school. Did you get any action?

48:48.160 --> 48:55.160
I went to high school. Did you attend a prom or? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I had friends that

48:55.160 --> 49:01.480
were girls. It's not hard to, you know, hey, I mean, they're incredibly lovely people.

49:01.480 --> 49:09.880
Yeah. Women, you know, you know, women, they love, they love dressing themselves up. Right

49:09.880 --> 49:20.160
up book, my friend. Proms? Yeah. Only Spencer could get away with saying that. Yeah. Tim

49:20.160 --> 49:27.880
Allen said that again. Oh, Spencer being delightful. Did you have a, did you have a high school

49:27.880 --> 49:43.040
sweetheart? No, I'm just dodging all these questions for no fucking reason. It's not

49:43.040 --> 49:48.960
that far. Talking about myself, things I do and all my relationships. There was a girl

49:48.960 --> 49:53.040
in high school. I mean, there's tons of girls in high school. Like it was half the student

49:53.040 --> 50:03.040
body. I remember like they're, they're a big, they're a big prom proposals. I'm gonna keep

50:03.040 --> 50:07.600
on saying it until it's a real thing. Did you go to, did you go to any of the functions?

50:07.600 --> 50:12.400
Did you go to the dances? I went to, in high school, there actually weren't like, for what

50:12.400 --> 50:16.320
we did, middle school had a lot of dances and then high school basically only had like

50:16.320 --> 50:21.920
homecoming and prom. So I, I, I didn't go to homecoming because those were just like

50:21.920 --> 50:26.560
a glorified football game. Um, I mean, there was a dance, but no one even went to that.

50:26.560 --> 50:35.120
It was just part of the football game. Everybody went. No. Nerd. I was at the football game

50:35.120 --> 50:39.360
part, but like there's like an auditorium. No one was in it. Like there was, like there's

50:39.360 --> 50:43.480
literally a dance that people weren't attending because they were watching football. I'm not

50:43.480 --> 50:52.640
going to defend football school. Spencer went to football school. That's where he learned

50:52.640 --> 50:58.080
his, uh, what is it? The wolf kicking dance. Oh yeah. Yeah. In the morning, they'd have

50:58.080 --> 51:04.760
to call coyotes out of the field. Yeah. We need, there's a job for 10 men. No, just send

51:04.760 --> 51:11.280
Spencer. I mean, this is, that's like dramatized, but I was like that guy. Like when there's

51:11.280 --> 51:16.160
weird stuff, people would be like, Hey, Spencer, can you climb onto that roof and you know,

51:16.160 --> 51:24.160
I eat that bug for me. I need it. I need someone to eat this bug. Did you really eat bugs?

51:24.160 --> 51:35.240
Not in high school. I mean, people eat sushi. They're water bugs. Yeah. Food's weird, man.

51:35.240 --> 51:39.840
I mean, well, people actually, people actually eat bugs like as a normal thing. It's normal

51:39.840 --> 51:45.440
to them, I guess, right? Sure. Yeah. I should have went with that first. Sushi's a weird

51:45.440 --> 51:50.000
leap. I think we're fishing weird too. I don't need anything that has a non standard number

51:50.000 --> 51:57.880
of legs. So like zero or four is okay. No legs, fish, fuck off. Eight legs. What about

51:57.880 --> 52:03.000
oysters or clams? I don't know. What about amputee livestock? How many? If it's two,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.800
how would you know? If it's two legs, then it's fine. But I mean, you've probably eaten

52:05.800 --> 52:13.520
three legged hamburgers in the past. Yeah, but they were born with four legs. What about

52:13.520 --> 52:20.800
like milk fed three legged veal? I don't do veal, bro. They're about lobsters. No lobsters.

52:20.800 --> 52:25.920
Because of their non standard amount of legs. Well, they look, they look like giant bugs.

52:25.920 --> 52:31.240
Like they are giant bugs. Yeah. Who doesn't have exoskeleton? Bugs have exoskeleton. So

52:31.240 --> 52:36.360
you won't eat lobster? No. By the way, I got to say the term amputee burgers has never

52:36.360 --> 52:41.280
been said before. And Spencer again, blazing trills. No, I don't eat lobster. I don't

52:41.280 --> 52:45.320
eat any seafood. And I don't. It's not like a moral thing. I'm just kind of creeped out

52:45.320 --> 52:51.800
by it. You don't like, cause the, cause the legs. Yeah, that's part of it. Too many legs,

52:51.800 --> 52:57.800
too few legs. No, thank you. Have you ever had good octopus? No, it's got like eight

52:57.800 --> 53:02.520
legs. Yeah. That's defined by his legs. Sea turtles. I'm telling you, that's some good

53:02.520 --> 53:08.320
shit, bro. Octopus is good shit. Octopus is good. Is it springy? Yeah, it is. It's rubbery.

53:08.320 --> 53:15.280
Yeah. But when it's good, it's like, it's a salty bubble gum. It's kind of, it says

53:15.280 --> 53:21.120
it, when it's bad, bad octopus, bad octopus has like a rubbery skin on the outside of

53:21.120 --> 53:28.040
it. I have an issue with this. You and I have been dating for three years and we've gone

53:28.040 --> 53:31.240
out to several places where they have octopus. And every time you get out, you're like, ah,

53:31.240 --> 53:35.960
not the good stuff. I don't believe you anymore. Like, I know, ordering octopus and you're

53:35.960 --> 53:40.320
this octopus expert, but I think maybe you were drunk one time and you had octopus. And

53:40.320 --> 53:44.200
you're like, I'm the best. And then every other time I've been in the shirt. And it

53:44.200 --> 53:49.200
was like meatloaf. He just thought it was good. Yeah. We've been to very fine restaurants

53:49.200 --> 53:52.280
where he's like, no, not the same as blah, blah, blah, blah.

53:52.280 --> 53:56.560
I heard a rumor that a certain percentage of calamari is served that is like cow and

53:56.560 --> 54:03.640
it's like pig, pig butt. Pig butts a little. Who cares? I've heard that. Then guess what?

54:03.640 --> 54:15.200
Pig butts delicious. Nine out of 10 pig anuses are fucking delicious. Because I heard that

54:15.200 --> 54:22.120
story in NPR. That's a real thing. Yeah. I mean, it's not. Yeah. All right. Pig. Yeah.

54:22.120 --> 54:29.600
Some of it's pig anus. It's good. All right. All right. It's time for our next segment.

54:29.600 --> 54:37.840
What time is it? Nine or three. Oh shit. Yeah. There's a lot of people out here tonight.

54:37.840 --> 54:50.520
We started doing the show again. I'm a little I'm a I may be a little drunk and also a little

54:50.520 --> 54:57.720
bit high. But how did you get high? I didn't see you smoking. Shut up. It doesn't. We're

54:57.720 --> 55:02.920
on the same bus. It smelled like like Willie Nelson's bus. Okay. And it's just a sheet

55:02.920 --> 55:07.800
of plywood with four wheels and there was some joints. What bus were you on? I was on the

55:07.800 --> 55:14.120
bus paying attention. How did you not get high? I don't know. All right. Anyways, sure. It

55:14.120 --> 55:22.400
doesn't matter. I'm 41. I need to grow up. I need to be a better person. This is all

55:22.400 --> 55:32.120
very irresponsible. These people paid $10. They came here in record numbers tonight.

55:32.120 --> 55:43.400
I would like to start a new religion just just to do it. Because I just finished listening

55:43.400 --> 55:52.000
to Going Clear, the book about Scientology. Is it what's the perspective? Is it like it's

55:52.000 --> 55:58.520
like starting a religion is like a fucking gangbusters fucking financial jackpot like

55:58.520 --> 56:06.600
it's but also like helps a lot of people. No, for real, like I'm not kidding. Like here's

56:06.600 --> 56:10.640
the thing going into it, like you think of Scientology have like all these weird like

56:10.640 --> 56:16.400
kind of voodoo, you know, you heard about it and you have like these weird urban legends

56:16.400 --> 56:22.200
that you've heard about it. Yeah, there's fucking crazy people are in charge and all

56:22.200 --> 56:28.440
this stuff. But like listening to that book, like the 600 page book, the story of the thing,

56:28.440 --> 56:33.480
what emerges is the same thing that emerges when you watch Book of Mormon, which we just

56:33.480 --> 56:39.560
saw like people people make too much fun of new modern religions. Like it's like they're

56:39.560 --> 56:44.920
fucking new. Like, of course, they're going to say that. Yeah, Jesus has a toothbrush for

56:44.920 --> 56:51.080
a hat. Of course, they think they have nothing else to do. They're fucking like they're out

56:51.080 --> 56:55.360
in the they're out in the wind, man. It's a new religion. Yeah, their only fault is

56:55.360 --> 57:00.360
that they're so new that they can talk about stuff that like they have the concept of aliens.

57:00.360 --> 57:09.360
So now aliens are part of it. Yeah. And then everyone's like, wow, think about that. Scientology

57:09.360 --> 57:16.440
is a pretty good racket. Like, let's fuck it. Those motherfuckers like by the way, shit

57:16.440 --> 57:22.200
going on like the money changed hands. And the fucking IRS went toe to toe with them

57:22.200 --> 57:30.240
and they fucking beat them. They beat the government. That's a good religion. Any religion

57:30.240 --> 57:36.400
that beats the fucking shit out of the government. Holy shit. What I love is when you get really

57:36.400 --> 57:45.240
worked up, it looks like your parrot is nodding along. Yeah, that's right. That's a good religion.

57:45.240 --> 57:54.200
Those fuckers like sat in a room with the IRS at one point. The IRS was like, like,

57:54.200 --> 57:59.640
we don't know what to do anymore. You've bankrupted our fucking legal department. And Scientology

57:59.640 --> 58:05.240
was like, yeah, we're at our knees to truce ceasefire. They fucking like made a they made

58:05.240 --> 58:11.320
a fucking agreement with the best. What's what's what are the some of the tenants of

58:11.320 --> 58:16.720
your new religion. Okay, well, here's the thing. Okay, so here's the thing. Okay, forget

58:16.720 --> 58:22.480
that money making stuff. He just mentioned. I swear to God, that's not to start a religion.

58:22.480 --> 58:29.160
Best part of our new religion. The Elron Hubbard of it doesn't give a fuck. Like, I don't,

58:29.160 --> 58:34.080
I don't, I don't, I don't, I have no money to make. I don't want to, I don't, you just

58:34.080 --> 58:40.600
set the opposite. No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to make any money. Oh, there. Okay.

58:40.600 --> 58:47.040
Oh, sorry. Oh, you have to pee. Sorry. That's synchronized pee. There's a stress test in

58:47.040 --> 58:54.240
the bathroom. There's two cans. You can't flush it unless you hold the cans. Is a pee

58:54.240 --> 58:59.760
meter in there? No, I, it did seem like for two people that had to pee, like they were

58:59.760 --> 59:04.600
very like, no, I have to. Oh, my God, I felt like they were Scientologists. Yeah, they're

59:04.600 --> 59:12.640
calling Scientology right now, which is fine. Because I mean, I, anyways, I read the book.

59:12.640 --> 59:18.760
A lot of people like benefit from any religion that you start. You don't have to actually

59:18.760 --> 59:23.920
rob anybody blind. You don't have to do anything. I was like, like, Dianetics when Elron Hubbard

59:23.920 --> 59:28.280
wrote Dianetics, it was kind of an open source kind of thing. You should also say that like,

59:28.280 --> 59:32.880
when you were listening and reading to that movie, that movie, that book, that your, your

59:32.880 --> 59:36.760
reaction every moment of it was like, Oh my God, this is fucking crazy. These people are

59:36.760 --> 59:41.760
mistreating these other people. Like that's your, like, but, but you were also like, Oh,

59:41.760 --> 59:49.160
you, Oh God, I could make my own. That's, that's possible. But like your reaction to Scientology

59:49.160 --> 59:55.440
as a religion isn't like, Oh God, this is great. This is doing so much good for people.

59:55.440 --> 59:59.920
Any religion does great for people. There's a, if you can call it a religion, it's doing

59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.440
good for people. There's no such thing really. The only, the only thing that hurts people

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:10.760
is like a weird is government. It's, it's, it's, it's people. It's when you tell people,

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:17.720
you have to go into a fucking a double wide trailer and sit in there with no air conditioning

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.800
and do these things. That's, that's not religion. That's fucking government.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.680
Did you change your mind since reading this book? What are you talking about? What do you

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.360
mean? I don't know. I don't want to sell you out. I'm saying like, like when you, if you,

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.040
if you say to people, I have a way, I have a philosophy, I have a way for you to connect

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.160
with the unknown of the universe, there's no way that can hurt anybody. That's not true.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.040
Yeah, I could. What do you mean? All you have to do is give me all your money and go shoot

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.120
up this building and then you'll get in the habit. But that's government. That's, that's

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:52.680
what, what? That could be when, when you tell people what to do, then you're, that's not

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.320
religion. That is religion. Religion tells you what to do.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:03.320
So then you think Scientology is government. So you want to make your own government or

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.200
you want to make your own religion that's not Scientology.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.800
No, you could make a religion that didn't have anything to do. You wouldn't never have

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.160
to tell anybody what to do.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.160
Well then what would people do?

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.160
Well then stop comparing it to Scientology.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.920
So, so you, you wouldn't respect a religion unless it fucking branched over into politics

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920
and government?

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.720
No, no, no, but you're saying that like, that if you tell people what to do, it's government

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.320
and Scientology does tell people what to do. So then I think it's government.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.440
Forget, okay. Forget Scientology. Because,

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.240
But I mean, all religions tell people how to act.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.240
Yeah.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240
What I'm saying is,

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.240
It's a huge part of it.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.240
What I, what I read in that book is like, like,

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.240
Even your parents disagreeing with you.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.240
He's shaking his head.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.640
That's the first time he shook his head the whole time.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:54.000
Which by the way, it's physically impossible for it to do. Must be religion.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:02.560
We tend to politicize religion in a way that makes you say, okay, Mormonism, Scientology,

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.760
Jehovah's Witness, like, we, we, we weigh them on this scale.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.600
But don't you think they politicize their own religion?

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.640
But, but we're too predisposed to do that.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.160
I have a quick, quick question. And this is not to counter anything. I'm curious.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:22.920
So I have a family member who's involved in the Christian religion and she really

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.360
Get her out. Get her out.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.000
So she espouses this belief that she believes she's taught where the Lord will provide and

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.240
will take care of it and has been in two unhappy marriages and won't divorce for that reason.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.040
And that, there's nothing political about that.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.360
Is that, how would you answer to that?

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:48.160
Well, I didn't, I didn't, I'm too drunk and high to have heard all of that, but.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.640
What I'm trying to say is that.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.000
Now that the parrot just cried.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.720
I didn't actually think anything I said would be that controversial. I'm pleased that it

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.560
is. I'm glad I got that response.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.840
It's unintentional because truly whatever I'm, whatever, what I'm trying to say, it

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.080
shouldn't really be that controversial. What I, all I'm trying to say is that there's

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:16.160
a component of every religion that just atones the individual consumer with the unknown and

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.920
costs nothing and doesn't demand anything else.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.880
But that's not at all what Scientology is about as far as I think, as far as I think.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.640
But we're talking about, but, but, but when you, but you, you're rooting for Scientology

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.640
because they beat the government.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.640
I'm not.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.640
I'm sorry.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.640
That was a different thing.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.040
They also feed up on people's pocketbooks and make them rob from their families and friends

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.840
to pay for the un-fucking-known results of whatever they're fucking doing. Like I, I

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.280
know people that went through it and they got a lot of good out of it.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.440
They actually, there's a lot about Scientology. It's clean living and like, like how

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.240
Christianity is the same and they're doing it on the surface of like, that's fine.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.880
Every religion is about clean living. Every religion is about looking within yourself,

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:58.160
figuring out what you're ashamed of and, and laying it out there and like coming clean.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.480
And there are people within every religion, every, even the ones that we call cults, there

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.800
are people that are, that belong to those organizations who get benefit out of it, who are just in

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:14.760
the middle of the bell curve, who are just like, oh, I, I walked into this thing and

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.560
a guy told me, put on this red hat and you're part of red hat-ism. And red hat-ism means

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.720
that you, you flap a hat up and down and then you go like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I used

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.200
to think that I was a bad person for jerking off, but now I don't feel that way anymore.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:38.920
Like, like, good religion, like a street hot dog, like, ah, you guys really miss something.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:49.640
Yeah, catch them up. There are, there are ordinary people who derive good results. Sure,

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.680
there are. But don't get me very good. Every single religion that you would ever make fun

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.960
of. I know, there's a positive side to every religion and that, you know, it gives you

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.800
something to believe in. And they actually, they're the ones that are keeping the things

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:05.720
going. Sure. When we hear the crazy stories about magic underwear or super-duper hats

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:11.240
or like, like they paid this money to this political fund or whatever, we, we weigh these

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:18.120
religions on a triple beam scale. So all I'm saying is, okay, so if that's the problem,

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:24.480
then what if you started a religion that didn't have any of that? If I could promise you,

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:31.000
you know, fuck Buddhism, lady in the front rows at Buddhism, no. I hope that's the title

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.720
of this episode. There's no, there's no, there's no, because there's not enough back

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:45.120
end. They didn't beat the IRS. It's not, it's Buddhism. It's too, there's too much Richard

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.680
Geer involved in it. It's too, it's, it's, you have a long way to go to explain your

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:55.520
love of religion and also the, the clear line you draw where it has to be a profit-based

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.720
stuff. I'm going to, it's not, there's not going to be a profit. I'm going to, I swear,

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:06.200
I know you've heard this before, but I swear I won't make any of you kill anybody. I don't

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:16.560
believe, I don't believe. Least of all yourselves. I swear to God this time. I know it seems,

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:22.360
I know it seems like, like, oh, he's going to, he comes in with one of these guys with

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:27.240
a religion. This time I swear you won't have to kill anybody.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:37.920
Father Harmon. Father Harmon, I, I saw, I saw your flyer at Froyo and I, God, I, I just

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:42.160
moved to Los Angeles and I moved here with my husband and my daughter and I came home

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.720
and there was a note from him saying that I was an unfit mother and they've, they've

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.800
left me. I, I can't afford to pay my rent and I don't know who to turn to. I know that

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:58.040
I need something in my life. I saw on your flyer that you offer, you're not going to

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.520
tell me what to do, but you're going to make me feel good, but also I owe you money and

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:05.240
I just wanted to know. You don't owe me any money. No money.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.200
I just, how do I, what do I, what do I do? How do I do?

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:13.760
Do you play bass? Because the first thing, we have a rock band, do we?

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:19.760
Yeah, I play, I play a little bass. Our band is called Pillars of Fire and we

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:25.600
are meeting. That's the first thing. We just need to put it, to put together a band.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.160
The first problem, I, I, I, I, I might deal. The first problem with your religion is that

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.120
the band doesn't have a bass player.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.560
Uh, have you heard of the Rolling Stones? Yeah.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:46.240
Have you heard of Christianity? Thank you. Both of them needed bass players. I'm, I'm

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.520
a little drunk. I'm just saying, here's what I'm saying.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:55.080
I, I, I just got a contact drunk off of that story.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.800
I think people listening at home just got drunk. I agree with you because I think people

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:04.880
of our, in our demographics seem to dismiss religion offhandedly and without giving it

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:09.760
any sort of thought. All religion, the concept of religion, the concept of religion, because

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.560
every single religion, I think it gives people a lot of stuff, important stuff. I agree with

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.560
you on that.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.560
That's the only thing that has never existed. What, what, what is your essence of how, like

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.600
what is the secret that you're giving or the, the comfort that you're giving?

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.680
Open source religion. It's like a first open source.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.560
So it's like a Wikipedia of religion. You can just add to it. No one's ever, I'm out

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.000
as soon as I fanged it, uh, is that the, uh, found.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.200
So what if somebody comes in and goes, I'm going to start taking some money, like people

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.200
will abuse it.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.200
No, no, they can't do that. How?

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.120
If, if anybody makes money off of it, then it's not a religion.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.120
That's a government.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.520
Is there a theology to it there?

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.800
Yes. Uh, in the beginning, uh, there was a band without a bass player.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:54.800
I, I, it seemed like there needed to be more religion and I made one. No, I don't know.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.080
I'll figure that out later.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.440
I, it's not, it also sounds to me, uh, and look, I, I, I have the sneaking suspicion

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.600
you haven't really thought this through that one, but it sounds to me that perhaps you

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.320
kind of fancy yourself the leader of this religion.

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.440
Nope. I swear to God. I swear to God.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440
What God?

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.360
What's your, what's your theology?

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.240
Uh, what is God and you're in this new religion?

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.000
He spit, spit ball it.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.560
I, I don't want spoilers. It's an open source religion.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.560
What does that mean?

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.120
Uh, that means Tyler in the front, uh, he can, he can, he makes it.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:39.560
I think the slogan, I think the slogan, the first religion with spoilers is a new religion.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:40.560
That's where you would know me.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.560
Well, Christianity is the first one with spoilers.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.960
No, but I don't know, he comes back in his religion. He like, he, he rolls it out.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.160
You know how they back into, okay. Hey, yeah. Okay. All right. Okay.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.120
This is, this is the beginning of a weird period of your life, I think.

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.120
Fuckin' A man. I'm 41.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.520
This is your first step to becoming a Scientologist.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.720
Also, look how you're dressed and you're saying this.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:12.560
Do you think, do you think there was a, a really ship shaped screenplay in place before

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.600
they greenlit the Grinch that stole Christmas with Jim Carrey?

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:22.480
Or do you think they've camera tested some yellow contacts and they didn't know what

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.480
the fuck they were doing?

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480
Yeah, but they stole Christmas.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.920
Best case scenario, your religion is as good as the Grinch who stole Christmas.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.920
With Jim Carrey.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.920
With Jim Carrey.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.920
With Jim Carrey.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.760
You can, you can back into a project. You can say, this is our goal.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.680
You just want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas of religions?

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680
No.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.000
That's what you're shooting for?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.680
I would rather be fast, furious, seven, whatever number you thought done yet and one of the

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.680
actors died.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.680
You can back into a number.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:58.240
So Dan, if, if the Grinch who stole Christmas by Dr. Seuss is to the movie, the Grinch who

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.480
stole Christmas with Jim Carrey, what is the source material?

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:07.120
Like what is the, like if this is a religion you're backing into, like is there a, a thing?

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.120
Just a light spent feeling.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:18.120
And I know, I know that makes me sound like a prophet and I don't, I'm, I swear to God.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.000
We don't think it makes you sound like a prophet.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.760
I promise.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760
You have my word.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760
The O-F-I-T.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.640
We get this thing up and running.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.400
I am out.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.000
I promise I'm not a prophet.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
What is going on?

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
What is going on?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I want to smoke what you had, man.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
It was a fucking one.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
You guys seem like you're taking this more seriously than I am.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Can we eat black?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
No.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
That pattern is whispering.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
At what point you started, you started wagging your finger at us and got really, really

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
upset.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I'm sorry.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.600
You want to do something terrible to people.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.600
No.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.600
I want, I want to.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.600
It's like the point where you disappeared into a sooth shack today and you came out

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600
changing.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600
Yeah.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.400
You walked like an inch off the ground.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.400
All right.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.400
Well, for real.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.400
All right.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.400
Seriously.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.400
All right.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:18.720
Just think for a second about your fears about what happens after you die and just imagine

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:26.600
for one moment that I knew he's not a prophet.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600
He's not a prophet.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600
I swear to God, I'm not a prophet.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.600
He's just a guy with a plastic parrot on his shoulder.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.600
I'm saying hypothetically, if I knew, I knew, I knew.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.600
My biggest fear is that you know.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.600
Yeah, I don't want you to know.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:47.600
If I did, then couldn't everybody, couldn't you just take us out of benign?

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.600
How many, what's your, what's the average salary of the people in this audience here?

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.600
What the fuck is going on?

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.600
I'm trying to alienate you.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.600
What kind of question is this?

01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.600
What if we put it into building a compound?

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:07.600
Everybody's like, oh, I'm the big bad guy.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.600
Just think about it.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.600
You fucking, you parasites.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.600
Are you inferior?

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.600
They're definitely in that scenario.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.600
If you guys can't see what I'm seeing, then maybe, maybe you should leave.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.600
There's definitely a moment where someone's assigned to feed your parrot.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.600
Speak to the people there.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:41.600
Just think about what your soul wants.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.600
Dan, Dan, I'm a, I'm a plumber.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.600
I make $10,000 a year.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600
Well, you should make 20.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.600
No, Dan!

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.600
Take her for your wife.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:14:02.600
I am the parrot Gabriel fallen from heaven.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.600
Just think about everything that you've ever wanted in your life.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.600
And now imagine having twice as much.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.600
And then now ask yourself why you don't have it.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.600
And get mad.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:22.600
I want you to get mad with me about you not having twice as much as you want.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:30.600
You are allowed to have twice as much as you think you should have.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:36.600
I just want to help you have more.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.600
It's not fucking, it's not rocket science.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.600
And it's not a cult.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.600
It's not religion.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.600
And I'm not a prophet.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.600
I'm not doing anything to you.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.600
You don't have to do anything I say ever.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:58.600
You just have to wake up!

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:07.600
You just broke the mic stand of apathy.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.600
We'll work on it.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.600
Well, it's an open source religion.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.600
It's open source.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.600
You're going to feed into it.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.600
What's it called?

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.600
It's called nothing, motherfucker.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.600
It's called fuck you.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.600
It's called...

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.600
It's called harm...

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.600
Harmonology.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.600
Fuck.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.600
It's a working title, working title.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.600
It's called harmonology.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.600
I just made that up.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.600
I just made it up.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600
It's called harm.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.600
It just fucking came out.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.600
It just came out.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.600
Harmonology.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.600
I made it up.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.600
This would have been such a fun time to bring up Luke.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.600
All right, so usually at this time in our show,

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:57.600
we play judges and dragons, but I refused.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.600
Yeah, I was not allowed to leave.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:06.600
I told Spencer he wasn't allowed to go and work on D&D,

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.600
so he just had to come up and sit here dressed like...

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.600
I've been writing holy writings for you behind the scenes.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.600
But I told him that I would DM for him.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.600
You could come up here and I'll DM for you.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.600
Whatever anybody wants, I'll do anything.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.600
I like the sound of that.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.600
All right, so Dan, you want to go to the table?

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600
You want to switch?

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.600
Yeah, what time is it?

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.600
9.25.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600
Okay, that's a good time.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.600
Oh shit, I really broke this.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600
You broke the mic, Stan.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.600
Oh fuck.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.600
All right, I'll pay for that.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.600
But you'll pay for it.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.600
All right, with your prayers.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.600
Because it's not a cult.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.600
By the way, don't say that anymore.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.600
Don't say if you're starting a cult that it's not a cult.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.600
Oh, we don't need it.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.600
All right, hold on.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.600
All right, I'm going to...

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.600
Okay, all right, thank you.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.600
What the people at home missed was that

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.600
Dan reached for a bottle of vodka

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.600
and then Aaron gave him a bottle of water instead.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.600
Here's your...

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.600
Thank you.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.600
All right, Dan, I'll give you some music

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.600
and you'll just freestyle an intro.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.600
Are we continuing our own...

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.600
No, this is a new campaign.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.600
Everything is new.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.600
Everything is not canon, right?

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.600
This is not canon?

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.600
This is a new campaign.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.600
Side quest?

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.600
This is a new...

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.600
It's an elf's world?

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.600
This is a new RPG I've developed.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.600
It's called This World.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.600
Okay, let's do it.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.600
Harmon...

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.600
Great. Sounds great, Dan.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.600
Dan, are you ready to roll?

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:04.600
You guys are all playing yourselves, okay?

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.600
All of your stats are...

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.600
But I'll tell you where you are.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.600
We're not making up characters, we're us.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.600
I'm Jeff, Camille, Camille.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.600
But I need dice. I don't have any dice.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.600
You have to pretend.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.600
Hit the table and see it.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.600
Who has dice?

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.600
One of our comedians has dice,

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.600
which surprises almost nobody, which is great.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.600
What's your name, sir?

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.600
Dylan has dice. Thank you, sir.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.600
Dylan the Dice Man!

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.600
I love it.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.600
By the way, perfect throw.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.600
You hit him right in the hands.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.600
Okay, thank you. Dylan's dice.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.600
Dylan's dice. This is all I need.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.600
What do you play, Dylan? What's your game?

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600
D&D.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.600
Maybe like a pen and pencil, so I can keep track of hit points.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.600
How many hit points do I have in real life?

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.600
I can keep track of them.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.600
Oh, Dylan, are these from the Collector's Edition

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.600
of the D&D, the box set thing?

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.600
Okay, whatever.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.600
Thank you, Dylan.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.600
This is how religions actually start.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.600
With dice?

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.600
Or like, I need one small thing,

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.600
and then you give it to them, and then they want the world.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.600
Anyone have a mortgage they can sign over? Thank you.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.600
Spencer, Aaron, Matt.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.600
She had to look to see who's on stage.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.600
My name's Jeff.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.600
And I'm Camel.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.600
Plus, he's TV writing, where you're not even really moving.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.600
No, I'd like to show you what I wrote.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.600
And I can't wait to talk to you guys after tonight's show.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.600
And Rob us of all of her worldly belongings?

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.600
I can't wait for it when you guys are like,

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.600
wow, that was fucking crazy. You made up a new game.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.600
Oh, I thought you checked with the religions.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.600
Okay, now it's a game.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.600
Oh, that too.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.600
Next week to be like, wow, this religion's taken off.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:02.600
It's going to make people happy. I don't want anyone's money.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.600
You keep saying that too.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.600
It's not a cult. You don't want anyone's money.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.600
It's not typically associated with the concept of religion.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.600
Of course it is.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:14.600
I'm not saying it's not evolved. It's not what comes to mind.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.600
Think of crosses and bunnies and stuff.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.600
Of course it is.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.600
How many people thought about money after the word religion was said?

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.600
Yeah, this is the problem.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.600
Well, fuck all you guys who raise your hands.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.600
They need genuine fucking religion they can trust.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.600
I hate this game.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.600
It's a different thing. This is a new RPG.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.600
This RPG is not.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.600
Can you play the music?

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.600
It's not an indoctrination into my new religion.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.600
I swear to God.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.600
It should be.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:51.600
All right, I'm going off my iPhone, so I'll have to go.

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:55.600
Just play a new cool song.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.600
Okay, you ready?

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.600
Yeah.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.600
It's fine. I don't care.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.600
Introduce it.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.600
That's fine. I don't care.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.600
It's Kumeil and Jeff.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.600
You guys are in a three-foot cube.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.600
What?

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.600
What?

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.600
What?

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.600
What?

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.600
What?

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.600
What?

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.600
Yeah.

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.600
Are we regular size?

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.600
Yeah.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.600
Okay, so that size.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.600
Yeah.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.600
Our lives suck.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.600
Yeah.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.600
Are we a liquid form?

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.600
Are there poop holes in the cube?

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.600
Are we just pooping on each other?

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.600
Yes.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.600
You've only been there for like three minutes.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.600
Okay, all right.

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.600
So all these questions are...

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.600
You guys are in a three-foot cube, all right?

01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.600
Okay.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.600
All right.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:05.600
Matt and Aaron, you guys are in a boat.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.600
That's way back.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600
Easy streets.

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.600
On a river.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.600
We're in a cube?

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.600
I guess.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.600
Spencer, you're in a rock.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.600
You're in a giant rock.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.600
I'm in a rock?

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.600
You're in a huge rock.

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.600
On top of it.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.600
How close are these three things to each other?

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.600
Spencer, you can see

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.600
a river going east and west

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.600
beneath you.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.600
Okay.

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.600
He's not a prophet.

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.600
He's not a prophet, you guys.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.600
No.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.600
We're still in a three-foot cube.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.600
Is it opaque or transparent?

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.600
Can we see out of it?

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.600
There's no light. There's no light source.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.600
So if we just end up there, it takes us a couple...

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.600
Wait, is that you, Jeff?

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.600
Is the intro over?

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.600
Are we going to stop the music?

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.600
Wait.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.600
Who's playing the music?

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.600
Me.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.600
I was giving you a Spencer intro music

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.600
so you could set the scene.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.600
Did you not notice the music?

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.600
Did you not fucking notice it?

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.600
Everyone noticed it.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.600
Waiting for him to...

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.600
I thought you were going to give us...

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.600
You're going to set the stage for us.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.600
With that music?

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.600
Really?

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.600
Okay, now the stage is set.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.600
Now let's go. He's on a rock.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.600
You really thought I would set the stage for that music?

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.600
I think you did an appropriate job.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.600
I think you guys met...

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.600
You met in the middle?

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.600
With the stage is set, we know where we are.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.600
Are you saying that you...

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.600
If I give you spooky music, will you give us a spooky?

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.600
You can give me any music you want.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.600
Now that I know that I'm supposed to set the stage, I'll do that.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.600
I gave you Bluebell Poco by Jimmy Shen.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.600
Wait, he did set the stage. That was the stage.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.600
Dan, not that they're connected,

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.600
but your parrot looks very embarrassed right now.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.600
Do you want proper spooky DM music?

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.600
Yeah, parrots.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.600
I wish I was real parrots that could fly away.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.600
I don't need anything,

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.600
but I will set the stage.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.600
You just...

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.600
Yeah.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.600
Kumail and Jeff.

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.600
Where did your life go?

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.600
What happened?

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.600
In it.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.600
In it. You don't know.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.600
As your blurry eyes,

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.600
blink and

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.600
flicker.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.600
Our eyes are flickering.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.600
They start to take in

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.600
what appears to be total darkness.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.600
So taking nothing at all?

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.600
Okay.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.600
Aaron and Matt,

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.600
you also

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.600
are confused

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.600
about your previous goings

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.600
and comings.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.600
But find yourselves now

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.600
in a boat raft

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.600
going east

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.600
down a river

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.600
which seems to also go west.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.600
Spencer,

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.600
your knees are weary from kneeling.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.600
As your aching muscles

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.600
bend and break,

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.600
your muscles break.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.600
Your muscles are breaking.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.600
You rise up,

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.600
your six foot frame

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.600
hulking into the sky

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.600
air.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.600
You take in the world around you.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.600
Is this

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.600
Galdivan?

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.600
The lost continent

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.600
that your father

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.600
told you about?

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.600
Who knows?

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.600
You are Elrond

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.600
Hubbarding so hard right now.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.600
Creating a myth.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.600
Galdivan.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.600
I could do it better than him, man.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.600
Could it be

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.600
this world is yours

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.600
for the inhabiting?

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.600
Who could know?

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.600
And who could see?

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.600
It's up to you.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.600
And up to me.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.600
That sounded like, you know how sometimes

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.600
you could translate a web page into Russian

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.600
and then back into English?

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.600
He's battle fishing.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.600
Yeah.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.600
We're at Kumail and Jeff's turn.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.600
Where did your mouth get to?

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.600
We're in a three foot cube together.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.600
Oh.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.600
You feel a wriggling

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.600
inside of the three foot cube

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.600
but it seems another person

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.600
is in there with him.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.600
Kumail, is that your asshole?

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.600
How did you recognize me by that?

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.600
And yes.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.600
Look,

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600
deprived of all other sensory

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.600
inputs,

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.600
I just had a feeling

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.600
that this was certainly a Nanjiani

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.600
a-hole.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:07.600
You guys continue to talk about that.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.600
I think one way out of this, I have a theory.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.600
Maybe you should

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.600
lick it. Maybe we'll see what happens.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.600
I lick Kumail's asshole.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.600
You've spent that turn

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.600
talking about it.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.600
Spencer, you are...

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.600
I mean, we're not out,

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.600
but it works.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.600
You spent a round talking about it.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.600
Spencer, you...

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.600
That's not a round.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.600
That's not a full action.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.600
Well, I guess licking my asshole...

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.600
Tiny spider sized holes open up

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.600
in the box and spiders

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.600
come in.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.600
Oh, shit.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.600
What's your...

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.600
spider save is?

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.600
At least my asshole got licked.

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.600
Fuck you guys. You guys are getting bit by spiders.

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.600
Hey, spiders,

01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.600
work your way to my asshole.

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.600
They don't talk, you're getting bit by spiders.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.600
Both of you take damage.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.600
Alright, Spencer,

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.600
you stand up

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.600
on top of a big rock.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.600
Sure, yeah.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.600
You can see a river below you.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.600
What do I... Do I have an inventory?

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.600
Yeah, you have three bags,

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.600
two ropes,

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.600
three sticks,

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.600
two shoes,

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.600
a hammer,

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.600
a corkscrew,

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.600
a three foot

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.600
strip of leather.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.600
I lash some of the strips of wood together

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.600
and create a frame,

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.600
and then I put a sack over it,

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.600
almost like a sackcloth, and I put another sackcloth

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.600
in a bundle atop,

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.600
almost like a head, and then I put it down

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.600
at the shore, and I hide behind the rock

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.600
and look to see if anyone

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.600
sees this crude figure I've

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.600
constructed on the shore,

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.600
maybe by the riverside or something,

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.600
and I just sit and watch, hoping for some clues

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.600
from Gal Devon.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.600
Yeah.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.600
This is the land.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.600
Figure out of leather and

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.600
sticks, you sit

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.600
behind a rock. Yeah.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.600
Alright.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.600
Aaron and Matt,

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.600
you're on a boat, you're going down,

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.600
getting east.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.600
Could be worse, we could be in a cube.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.600
I say we just rest this action

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.600
out, relax.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.600
I'm having a great time, I don't want to

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.600
bring any drama into the situation, but I have

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.600
some margaritas. I was just going to offer you

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.600
a mimosa.

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.600
Well, let's trade.

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.600
I'll bring this to your mouth, and you bring

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.600
your drink to my mouth. What's

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.600
your perception?

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.600
What? That life is pretty good.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.600
And we don't need no religion.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.600
You hear gurgling

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.600
from the wood line.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.600
Oh.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.600
What's a wood line?

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.600
A tree line.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.600
A wood line.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.600
I mean, maybe we've

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:09.600
caught some more fillets.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.600
Oh, maybe.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.600
What's your dexterity?

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.600
Both of you have ten.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.600
Matt Goorley,

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.600
an arrow

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.600
shoots from the wood line

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.600
into your...

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.600
into your knee.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.600
Wait, you had six options of body parts there.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.600
Doing

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.600
four damage.

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.600
Oh, my knee.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.600
This day was going so well.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.600
You got shot in the knee.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.600
It appears to be a goblin.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.600
You recognize it as a goblin

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.600
arrow.

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.600
They use a specific type

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.600
of stone

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.600
on the heads of their arrows.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.600
Oh, it's quartz

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.600
with a bit of theodolite.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.600
That makes sense.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.600
Jeff and Kumail,

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.600
you feel there are rustling

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.600
as if your cube

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.600
has been rustled.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.600
Hey, is there rustling?

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.600
I'm too busy

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.600
being attacked by spiders.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.600
Well, spiders aren't really dangerous, though.

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.600
I think that it's just icky that they're here,

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.600
but it's not anything real, right?

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:27.600
We took damage, though, didn't we?

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.600
No, we didn't.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.600
We're taking damage here, man.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.600
Should we push?

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.600
On the count of three, let's push

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.600
as hard as we can on all sides of this cube

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.600
and try to get out of this.

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.600
I think I know what's going to happen.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.600
One, two, three.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:51.600
Ah!

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.600
Matt and Aaron...

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.600
You hear a strange sound from below deck.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.600
A kind of collapsing.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.600
Oh, we're under the boat.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.600
We're in the boat.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.600
Kumail and Jeff, you...

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.600
The bright light hits your eyes

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600
for the first time in six months.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.600
We've been in this cube for six months.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.600
I thought it was three minutes.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.600
This cube is full of shit.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.600
So is the DM.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.600
You hear male voices from below deck.

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:29.600
I brandished my goblin-killing sword,

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.600
and I just...

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.600
to protect myself,

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.600
because I was going to take care of this guy,

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.600
I run downstairs.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.600
Ah!

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.600
Come party upstairs.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.600
Who's here?

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.600
That happens.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.600
Hey, we're friends.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.600
Aaron is Jeff and Kumail.

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.600
Oh, guys.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.600
I'll leave you alone.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.600
No, no, no, no.

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.600
Matt, there.

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.600
It's what we thought was going to happen, happened.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.600
And I know we're very happy about it.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.600
We should give them some time.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.600
Yeah, let them do it.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.600
That old goblin wound down there.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.600
A little tincture, a little poultice.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.600
There we go. That's better.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.600
I feel good, no matter what any dice roll will tell you.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.600
Taking control of my own destiny.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.600
Looking outside the glass bubble.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.600
What is reality?

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.600
Spencer, from high atop your perch,

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.600
you see in the distance to the west,

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.600
moving down the river,

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.600
a boat-shaped object,

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.600
sailing in sailing-ness,

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.600
down the eastward direction.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.600
Tell us, Prophet.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.600
Okay.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.600
There's a boat.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.600
Who's in that boat?

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.600
I'm going to lift up this crude effigy I made,

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.600
and I'm going to attempt to hurl it.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.600
I'm sure I'm going to fail,

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.600
and throw it at the boat.

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:11.600
I like your resolution mechanic system here.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.600
Very unique.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.600
Lot of rolls.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.600
Aaron, Matt, and Kumail,

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.600
you hear a splash.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:25.600
Jeff, you see an effigy

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.600
fly through frame and into the water.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.600
My sister's drowning.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.600
You hear a voice say that.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.600
An effigy!

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.600
What, you heard it?

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.600
I heard it.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.600
I sounded like an effigy splash.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.600
Was that what it was?

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.600
I saw a thing.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.600
You said you heard what you think was an effigy.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.600
I can't be a hundo, but it felt

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.600
sounded like an effigy in the water.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.600
I didn't hear it hit water.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.600
I just saw it.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.600
It was an effigy!

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.600
Fuck yeah!

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.600
Still got it.

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.600
Man, that sounded like a plain idol to me.

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:05.600
You got a good ear.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.600
Yeah, it's totally an effigy.

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.600
Scraaaah!

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.600
Scraaaah!

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600
Scraaaah!

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.600
I need perception numbers

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.600
from each person.

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.600
Spencer?

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.600
I have plus six.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.600
Good.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.600
I'm pretty astute.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.600
I know all your perceptions.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600
I got good.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.600
What's mine?

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.600
You rolled a two.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.600
What's my perception number?

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.600
You don't even know.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.600
So it must be bad.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.600
How could you know?

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.600
Ask Schrodinger, where's his cat?

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.600
It's in the box.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.600
Is it?

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.600
Yeah.

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.600
It's in the box.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.600
I don't know.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.600
The question was not whether or not

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.600
it's in the box.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.600
I don't know!

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.600
We all know it's in the box.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.600
Who let this fucker drive?

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.600
Dragons are flying at you!

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.600
Dragons!

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.600
I throw it here.

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.600
Six dragons!

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.600
I run below deck

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.600
and I use my sword to hack open the box

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.600
to let out Camille and Jill.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.600
They're out! Their box fell apart.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.600
I don't know that.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.600
Six dragons!

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.600
Roll for initiative. I'll roll.

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.600
None of you have initiative.

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.600
All the dragons have initiative.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.600
Are you the six dragons?

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.600
Six dragons.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.600
Each of them are the size of a football field.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.600
Gods!

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.600
100 yards!

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.600
And they're baby...

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.600
Just this is a footnote.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.600
How wide are they?

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.600
They're baby dragons.

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.600
They're 100 yards long.

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.600
As wide as a football field.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.600
As wide as the length of a football field.

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.600
No, as wide as the length of a football field.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.600
They're perfectly square dragons.

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.600
They're Instagram dragons.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.600
No, they're oblong dragons.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.600
They're oblong dragons.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.600
They're 100 yards long

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.600
and 30 yards wide.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.600
Oblong dragons!

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.600
They scream.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.600
Get used to it.

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.600
I summon

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.600
a Supreme Wrath.

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.600
They have initiative.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.600
I still summon it.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.600
All six of them are going to attack.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.600
I'm summoning it while you're doing it.

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.600
They're attacking you.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.600
You just have to kill us.

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.600
Good luck because I'm summoning Supreme Wrath.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.600
One dragon attacks

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.600
Aaron.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.600
Holy shit.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.600
One dragon asks his mom whether he thinks it's attractive.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.600
One attacks Spencer.

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.600
One attacks Jeff.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.600
One attacks Aaron.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.600
You're fucking full of shit.

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.600
They're basically attacking all of you.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.600
You each get attracted by one dragon.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.600
I summon Supreme Wrath.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.600
Supreme Wrath.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.600
They have initiative.

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.600
You said they attack.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.600
Yeah, wait to find the result.

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.600
Okay.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.600
Jesus Christ.

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.600
So each dragon

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.600
you get attacked.

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.600
All right, you're all right.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.600
You're all right.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.600
A dragon tries to attack Camille and it misses.

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.600
All right.

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.600
The same thing happens to Jeff.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.600
It's like it chomps out of him

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.600
because it misses.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.600
Supreme Wrath.

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.600
Gorley gets bit on the shoulder

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.600
by a dragon.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.600
I don't need that shoulder.

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.600
Leaving him with

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.600
20.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.600
20?

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.600
Great.

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.600
Dollars?

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.600
Aaron gets bit.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.600
I was attacked by two dragons.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.600
60.

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.600
Spencer

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.600
I got bit 60.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.600
80.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.600
Basically what happens is

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.600
I'm going to go...

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.600
Wait.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.600
Camille's walking over to her.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.600
This is a 17.

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.600
That's a dragon.

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.600
That's an attack roll.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.600
I was expecting his dice.

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.600
17 equal 80 damage to him.

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.600
How does 17, what math

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.600
what math leads

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.600
17 to become 80?

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:37.600
It's an attack roll versus his armor.

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.600
Now the parrot looks guilty.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.600
Is there a math where that can work?

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.600
No.

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.600
There might be some obscure system of numbers.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.600
A high number means it's hit.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.600
Is it being multiplied by an imaginary number?

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.600
No.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.600
What number multiplied by 17 gives you 80?

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.600
Let's continue.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.600
For a guy who says he doesn't want to be a prophet

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.600
you have tremendous God issues.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.600
You guys are bummed out

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.600
because you're getting attacked by dragons.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.600
I'm fine.

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.600
I don't think I have 80 hit points.

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.600
I fall on my knees

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.600
and I summon the power

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.600
of the God of Harmon.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.600
I feel like...

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.600
What have you done?

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.600
Woman!

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.600
You killed us all!

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.600
Aaron falls to her knees.

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.600
I summon the God of Spencer,

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600
old school Spencer.

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.600
Spencer is dead

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.600
but Aaron falls to her knees

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.600
and she...

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.600
You just killed Spencer?

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.600
If I have less than 80 hit points

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.600
I think Aaron might have less than 60.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.600
Aaron is saying things like

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.600
I know you're not a prophet.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.600
I know this isn't a big deal.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.600
I know this isn't a religion.

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.600
Everything's fine.

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.600
You changed everything.

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.600
You changed everything but you don't need to.

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.600
There's no money on the back end for you.

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.600
You're a good person.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.600
You're not a prophet.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.600
And...

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.600
Spencer's wounds are healing.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.600
They're closing up.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.600
He's gaining strength.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.600
He's becoming a more powerful character.

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.600
Because Aaron did it right.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.600
Didn't you say I was...

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.600
Did what right?

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.600
She prayed to me.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.600
She said that I was a God

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.600
and that I could...

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.600
She said that I didn't want to be.

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:25.600
Spencer is God! He's healing!

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.600
All hail Spencer!

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.600
The Messiah!

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.600
He's back!

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.600
Spencer!

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.600
You guys have it wrong.

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.600
You have it wrong.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.600
A tree falls on Spencer.

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.600
It's a sign!

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.600
I want to try and dodge.

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.600
When you dodge

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.600
do you say

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:57.600
that you admire me?

01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.600
Admire Dan Harmon.

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.600
Admire...

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.600
Do you acknowledge that I don't want to be

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:05.600
anybody's prophet?

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.600
I just want to help people.

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.600
I just want to...

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.600
I just want people to be happy.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.600
No, that's fucked up.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.600
He's dead.

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.600
You enrolled a guy.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.600
You enrolled a guy.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.600
He's in this universe that are

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.600
fade-a-complete.

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.600
There's spiders all over all of you.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.600
There's spiders everywhere.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.600
There's 100 spiders on each of you.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.600
Are they poisonous or they...

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.600
Yes.

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.600
Fuck, I shouldn't have clarified.

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.600
I go down into the cube and just...

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.600
Just hang...

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.600
The spiders are laying dragon eggs.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.600
Can I have a round?

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:47.600
Yeah.

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:49.600
Okay, he's like...

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.600
What?

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.600
He's...

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.600
You know, some would call

01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.600
kind of a prophet as well.

01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.600
I summoned him and he...

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.600
Yeah, he's here.

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.600
And I cast

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.600
Logic Fight with

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:07.600
Dan Harmon.

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.600
You want Buddha to fight

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.600
Dan Harmon?

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.600
Dan Harmon's god, yeah.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.600
It doesn't look good.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.600
Buddha, like...

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.600
He's like...

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.600
He turns purple and he's like

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.600
deflating like a balloon.

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.600
And I,

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.600
Dan Harmon, like standing over him

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:31.600
and Buddha is like dying.

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.600
He's dead.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.600
He's like... He just killed Buddha?

01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.600
Okay, I summoned Allah

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.600
and just know that this podcast

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:43.600
is going out in the real world.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.600
Right.

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.600
Okay, alright.

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.600
Let's see what happens.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.600
Alright, so Allah...

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.600
Allah shows up

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:57.600
and Dan Harmon's like...

01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:59.600
What's up? And Allah's like

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.600
hey...

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.600
I have no quarrel with you.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.600
And Allah's like...

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.600
Cool word.

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.600
And he leaves. He walks away.

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:13.600
He just goes away.

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.600
But they're cool. They're cool.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.600
Buddha wasn't cool.

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.600
No, Buddha

01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.600
fucking crossed the line.

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.600
I summon Elrond Hubbard.

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.600
Elrond Hubbard appears.

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.600
Okay, alright.

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.600
Cool.

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.600
He turns purple and dies.

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.600
Allah's like... Allah's down the street.

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.600
He's fine.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.600
I summon...

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.600
Because I don't want that trouble.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.600
I summon your mom circa 1980.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.600
Alright.

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.600
My mom shows up in 1980.

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.600
Alright.

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.600
She's like, why are you... What are you doing?

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.600
I'm like...

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.600
I cast...

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.600
My cast find me attractive.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.600
It doesn't work.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.600
I just...

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.600
There's no number high enough on this die.

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.600
Yeah, I charm her.

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.600
And she's like...

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.600
You're a good writer.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.600
Now I know it's a fantasy.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.600
And she's like...

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.600
You should take a bath.

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.600
I hated season 4.

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.600
So I'm taking a bath now.

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.600
With my mom's being a little too

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.600
proactive about washing me.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.600
Over this?

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.600
I don't know.

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.600
It's good to be clean.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.600
You're going to make sure you're clean.

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.600
But I'm 11.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.600
This is really fascinating.

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.600
It's fucked up.

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:47.600
This is one of the most lonely experiments I've ever seen.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.600
Can we everybody just tiptoe

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.600
out?

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.600
Dan doesn't know any of you

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.600
are here right now.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.600
You guys show up for Harvard Town next week.

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:59.600
She's still rolling down.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.600
She's like...

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.600
You're clean now, but I'm crying.

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:05.600
I go to bed.

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.600
I'm sleeping.

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.600
I have weird dreams, and they're loud.

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.600
I feel like it's loud.

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.600
The sounds are loud.

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.600
Now I've been given an etch-a-sketch

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.600
for Christmas.

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.600
And you draw the image of Allah.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.600
I'm actually drawing.

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:23.600
I'm figuring out that

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:25.600
through the lines

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.600
you can see

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.600
a weird metallic thing underneath it.

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.600
So I'm scraping

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.600
the entire etch-a-sketch

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.600
methodically so I can see what's underneath it.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.600
And it's just two armatures

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.600
and a bullet-shaped

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.600
metal thing.

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.600
And it's disturbing.

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.600
Because it's coated in graphite

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.600
and it's

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.600
disturbing.

01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:51.600
It feels like pornography.

01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.600
It feels like the world

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.600
has been controlled by robots.

01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.600
Now dad's home. It's 9.30.

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.600
Oh, fuck.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.600
Shit just got real.

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.600
And he's not...

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.600
He's fucking... He's going through shit of his own.

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.600
Because he's basically me,

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.600
but...

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.600
28?

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.600
Let's be real.

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.600
28?

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.600
And his job is to take customers out

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.600
and fucking, you know...

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.600
carry it on his shoulder right now.

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:25.600
Now he's coming home and his mom's like

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.600
well, the children are terrible.

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.600
And he's like...

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.600
Hold on, I'm rolling.

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.600
He's like, what do you want me to do?

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.600
She's like, I want you to be a father.

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.600
Oh, okay.

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.600
Is this being a father?

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.600
Alright, he's taking off his belt.

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.600
He's being sarcastic, but the kids

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.600
don't know. The kids don't know

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.600
what sarcasm is.

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.600
What's your reflex safe?

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:57.600
I can't save,

01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.600
because the kids don't know.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.600
They just feel like

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.600
they did something wrong

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.600
or they did something wrong.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.600
So the dad's going, okay, this is what you want me to do.

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.600
He's... Alright.

01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.600
He's successfully beaten the children.

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.600
Are there still spiders on this?

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.600
Yes, spiders everywhere.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.600
There's spiders on everything.

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.600
I'm going to cast End Harmontown.

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:21.600
Thank you for coming, everybody.

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.600
Wait a minute.

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.600
There is a God.

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.600
There is a God.

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.600
Matt Goorley.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.600
Erin McGathy.

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.600
Spencer Crittenden and Kumail Nanjiani.

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.600
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.600
Oh, worship.

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:41.600
Dan Harmon.

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.600
Next week, we start in this new religion.

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.600
We're going to start in this new religion.

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.600
Right, Jeff?

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.600
Oh, yeah.

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.600
I think you laid down the basic tenets of it already.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.600
We got the groundwork laid.

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.600
If anyone wants to keep role-playing,

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.600
I'm going to be here all night.

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.600
Did you have a stroke during the show?

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:05.600
It wasn't a bad show, though, right?

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.600
It was a good show.

01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.600
Roll a D20 and find out how good the show is.

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.600
I'd be honest.

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.600
It was a five out of 20.

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.600
It was a good show, though, right?

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.600
I thought so, yeah.

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.600
You're a good person.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:23.600
We got drunk and high and we went to the red fair.

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.600
You're good for coming here.

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.600
Ten dollars. What are you going to do?

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.600
Can I...

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.600
You could spend...

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.600
You could play three free-view games

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.600
on the App Store.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.600
You'll be spending more than that.

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:41.600
Also, if the store is closed,

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.600
you don't have to exit out the back door, if you will, please?

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.600
Oh, where was the fella...

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.600
Whose dice are these? Dwayne?

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.600
Dylan, thanks for the dice, Dylan.

01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.600
Congratulations, Luke and Haley, was it?

01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.600
Yes.

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.600
Congratulations, Luke and Haley,

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.600
on your prom-posal.

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:05.600
Thank you.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.600
Is that yours?

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:33.600
Yes.
