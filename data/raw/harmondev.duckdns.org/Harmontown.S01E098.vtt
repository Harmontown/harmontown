everybody\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:34.000\nFeral Audio\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:39.000\nAfter two years on hiatus, Harmontown is now in session\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:47.000\nFor those of you not here live in Hollywood, California\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:50.000\nMeltdown Comics, I am dressed as a pirate\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:52.000\nBecause I came from the Renaissance Fair\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:54.000\nWith all of the Harmonians\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:56.000\nThe Harmontown cast more or less\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nBut without further ado, please welcome\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:03.000\nThe main pirate charge of shit, Mr. Dan Harmon\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:07.000\nFeral Audio\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\nThank you\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:11.000\nThank you\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:12.000\nWelcome back\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:15.000\nI missed you too\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:16.000\nWe all missed each other\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nI missed you too\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:19.000\nWe took a month off\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:21.000\nIt was good that we took a month off\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.000\nI didn't really miss you during that month\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:26.000\nI was exactly ready to come back\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:29.000\nBecause we spent the entire month at a Renaissance Fair\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:33.000\nYeah, we went to the Renaissance Fair\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nListen, honestly, it seems dumb to disclaim this\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:41.000\nBut I am so fucking drunk and high\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:44.000\nIt seems stupid to even bother to say it\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.000\nBut I have to tell you\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:51.000\nAnd that doesn't mean that I'm giving myself an excuse\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:57.000\nI absolutely take it upon myself to give you your ten dollars worth\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nIs it still ten?\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nYou're not walking out of here\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:05.000\nFeeling like you wasted ten dollars\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:08.000\nThat's the fucking Harmon guarantee\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:13.000\nBut I am so drunk and so high\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nBecause we went into a...\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:17.000\nWe got in a bus dressed as pirates\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:18.000\nWe went into a field\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:20.000\nAnd we went into a place...\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:23.000\nWe've been doing this every year for the last four years\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nIt's a goddamn...\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:29.000\nThe Renaissance Fair, you don't know what it really is\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:32.000\nIt's a goddamn mecca\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:34.000\nIt's more than Comic-Con\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nIt's a more important thing\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:43.000\nIt's a Malcolm X level actual statement of fucking position\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nYou go through these turnstiles and then it's like\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nNo, there's guys that are wearing baseball caps\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nThey're like, you're the nerd now!\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nYou're the nerd!\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nWhy don't you look weird?\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nYou're the fucking nerd!\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:00.000\nThey're having fun and they're pushing their strollers\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:02.000\nWe like the Renaissance a little bit\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nNot enough!\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nYou don't like it enough!\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nWhere's your eye shadow?\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:09.000\nJust fucking bully them!\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.000\nYou're the fucking nerd tonight!\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nNothing bad happens to anybody\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nBut it's just your blood pumps\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:19.000\nThat's why I go\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nEverybody's got a plastic sword\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:26.000\nAnd you're the fucking nerd\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nIs that what you get out of it?\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nI started going...\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:32.000\nYou just like to wear women's shoes\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nYou'll find that these slippers are Prada\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nThey were given to me by Greg Poops\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nThey were too big for him\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nI'm never going to wear size 14 jazz slippers\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nUntil the Renaissance Fair came into my life\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:47.000\nThose are my own socks though\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nNow...\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nThere's a section that...\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:56.000\nEverything I'm wearing right now\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nMinus my socks\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nEverything I'm wearing right now\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:05.000\nIs from the women's section at a buffalo exchange to a store\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nThese fucking pirate pants\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nLook like pirate pants, right?\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nI didn't do anything but rip the bottoms\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nAnd make them a little shaggy\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nIt's fucking great\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nYou get like Renaissance Fair\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nGuys, go to the ladies section\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nAnd you get a big ass billowy shirt\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.000\nI don't know how I got this one\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nThey even specifically look like...\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nCookie... cookie thief\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:29.000\nLike you're a cookie thief\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nIt's hard to believe that there's a time and place in America\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nWhen women were pursuing the...\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nI don't know when these pants were\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nEver anybody's idea\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nExcept for me to find them and make pirate pants\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nFucking great\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nAnd it's so comfortable I'm wearing these forever\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nAlright, Jeff's happy\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:51.000\nI guess I'm experiencing my happiness through an angry valve\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nWell, a long time ago, years ago\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nI mean, well, a long time ago\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nLet's say six years ago\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nBefore we had ever gone to the Renaissance Fair together\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nI was against Renaissance fairs\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.000\nBecause it sounded really stupid\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nIt sounded like a big bummer\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:04.000\nIt sounded like a lot of bad improv\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:05.000\nAnd a lot of people doing fake\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nLike Elizabethan and whatnot\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:12.000\nAnd taking something stupid too seriously\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:16.000\nSo my friend Diva Zappa, the youngest of the Zappa clan\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:19.000\nShe also hates...\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.000\nShe hated Renaissance fairs\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nAnd she goes, I'm going to the Renaissance fair\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:23.000\nI was like, why?\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nShe's like, because I hate it\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:26.000\nBecause it's stupid\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:27.000\nAnd I have to go look it in the eye\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nI have to go confront my terror\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nShe went and I texted her the next day\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nI go, how was it?\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nShe goes, I applied for a job\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nI'm like, what?\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nShe's like, I don't know why\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nI don't know why I like it\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nI don't know if it's ironic\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nI don't know if it's sincere\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nI think it's a combination of both\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nSomething magical\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nI know I need to be closer to that flame\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nSomething magical is happening there\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nAnd it has absolutely nothing to do with history\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nNothing to do with academia\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nThere's no appreciation of anything\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nDoes a guy dress like a little finger?\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nLike nobody fucking knows\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nAnd there's a million goggles\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nLike the steampunk is kind of like\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nLike a weird syphilitic bay\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nThat runs through it\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nTo the point where there's no kiosks\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nYou can buy steampunk goggles\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:14.000\nAt the Renaissance fair\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:15.000\nBecause they're like\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nSomehow that overlaps\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.000\nNot somehow\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:18.000\nI know how\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nThat's the point\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:21.000\nI don't know\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nIt's just anything that you could wear\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nThat would make someone want to beat you up\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nIt's just a bunch of people\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nLike, oh, wearing it\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nWho's going to beat me up?\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nNobody's going to beat me up\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nBut there's also a lot of avert\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nI would call generally\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:37.000\nNot a jock culture\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nNot a macho culture\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nBut a lot of avert sexuality\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nWhere guys are just wholesale\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nThat's the part I don't like\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nAll right, on to that\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nHashtag rape culture\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nIf you have a Tumblr blog\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nAnd you would like to get outraged\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nHoly Toledo\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:57.000\nThat's right\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nToledo with a C-H\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nIt's a cheeto\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nForm of Toledo\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nIt's an extra cheesy holy Toledo\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nIf you're a 17-year-old girl\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nAnd you would like to be a social activist\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nIf you're interested in rape culture\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:17.000\nAnd the elimination of it\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nStarts at Irwindale, California\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nWhere people are juggling and just going\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nLike every fucking booth you walk by\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nLike, oh, glass blowing\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nOh, hello, Malini\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nWould you like a hard six inches\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nOf something hard and transparent\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nTo go up into your purse\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nLike every fucking thing is like a joke\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nAbout non-consensual sex\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.000\nAbsolutely\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nOh, I was like the drip my mead\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nOn the globes of the thing\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nAnd everybody's just like\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nIt's none of its inventive\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nBut on the flip side\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nWeird Al Rapovic\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nIs what I would call the vibe\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nThey're kind of like connecting semantic dots\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nLike, oh, I make a rainstake\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nOh, it's a hard, hard eight inches of wood\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nOh, my lady\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nJust because something looks like a dick\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nDoesn't mean you can say it's a dick\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nAnd threaten to hit someone with it\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nAnd come with them, come on\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:19.000\nThey're really thinking still there\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nIn the middle of that field\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nThey're like, well, if you can\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nIf you can connect those dots\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nIf something looked like a dick\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nIf it was longer than it was wide\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nAnd\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nWhether you're selling a candle\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nOr a glass or a sword or a turtle\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:43.000\nLike, it's satire\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nI think it's satire of rape\n\n08:46.000 -->

Like, now it's for partying. What I'm saying to you kids is it's\n\n12:09.960 --> 12:15.040\na short bus, but they've taken out all the seeds and then they've put plywood on the\n\n12:15.040 --> 12:23.000\nfloor. There was at least one stripper pole in it. There's a stripper pole in it. How else\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:28.040\nare you going to dance and have a good time? There was a hole under my feet. I sat in the\n\n12:28.040 --> 12:31.920\nback and there was a hole that you could see the highway. There's a freeway underneath\n\n12:31.920 --> 12:38.560\nyour feet. You can look down. It is concrete. You can see it. I'm wearing slippers. If my\n\n12:38.560 --> 12:41.680\nslipper fell off, that was the end of that slipper because there was just the freeway\n\n12:41.680 --> 12:48.000\nunderneath it. You could drop your phone down that hole and never see it again. Hold me\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:53.640\nup with a beat. No, I'm kidding. I don't know why. Also, I'm really drunk. I'm really\n\n12:53.640 --> 13:00.080\ndrunk. But Dan, let me say, I'm doing it off my iPhone because I didn't remember to bring\n\n13:00.080 --> 13:07.800\nmy iPads. That's why tonight's going to be great. I'm on the beats section in case you\n\n13:07.800 --> 13:13.520\nwant to be. What wasn't there a... Okay. Do you guys see my $70 wooden cup I'm drinking\n\n13:13.520 --> 13:19.480\nout of? They told them that the wood enhances the flavor. It enhances the flavor of the\n\n13:19.480 --> 13:26.320\nbeer. It enhances me that wood. It doesn't make any sense because you'd have to coat\n\n13:26.320 --> 13:31.680\nit with some kind of plastic. You don't know that, man. It's not such a thing as a wooden\n\n13:31.680 --> 13:38.920\ncup. The idea that it enhances the flavor is funny. Also, I thought I was being environmentally\n\n13:38.920 --> 13:42.400\nsound because I went to a show the other night and there was a charity there that was funding\n\n13:42.400 --> 13:50.480\nit and it was all about not refusing to use one-use plastic. Not having just a plastic\n\n13:50.480 --> 13:56.240\nwater bottle or the order food to go. I don't want the plastic fork. I'm taking it home.\n\n13:56.240 --> 13:59.560\nI don't want the plastic fork that I'll use once throw away and it ends up in one of the\n\n13:59.560 --> 14:05.080\ngyre systems in the ocean. Yeah, great. I don't want the straw. I'll drink it without\n\n14:05.080 --> 14:09.400\nthe straw. It's a very noble thing. So you go to the rent fair and you buy a nice $70\n\n14:09.400 --> 14:15.560\nwooden cup that enhances the flavor of the beer and then they can't pour it into the\n\n14:15.560 --> 14:19.880\ngoddamn wooden cup. They had to pour it into a plastic cup that you pour into your beer\n\n14:19.880 --> 14:26.320\nand then they throw it out. It's fucking bullshit, man. How'd you get so drunk and high, Dan?\n\n14:26.320 --> 14:35.320\nWalk us through it. How'd your day start? Before we bring other people up, wasn't there\n\n14:35.320 --> 14:40.480\na news item? Wasn't there a party bus where a woman was dancing and she was party busing\n\n14:40.480 --> 14:47.040\nand then she felt through the floor? No one heard about that? Okay. All right. Well, let's\n\n14:47.040 --> 14:52.240\nnot worry about it. Wait, I worried about it. Tonight, tonight, we were brought to the\n\n14:52.240 --> 15:00.840\nrent fair by FirstImpressions.com. Look them up. Dan had a flintlock gun, not quite a blunder\n\n15:00.840 --> 15:05.480\nbus, but sort of like a flintlock musket, we'll call it. And you left it at the goddamn\n\n15:05.480 --> 15:10.000\nrestaurant. Fuck that. I had it the whole time. We walked into Elkham Prodway down the\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:14.280\nroad and people were unhappy about it. No, no, we were well received. I didn't think\n\n15:14.280 --> 15:19.040\nit was great. To do was great. I went to the men's room and one of the waiters came up\n\n15:19.040 --> 15:22.440\nand said, no, no, no, the ladies room is that way. Then I turned around and he's like,\n\n15:22.440 --> 15:30.480\nOh, but that's just him. He's just seven feet tall. This is a West Hollywood. We had\n\n15:30.480 --> 15:37.800\na bad time. No, we had a good time today. I can't believe that parrot stayed safety\n\n15:37.800 --> 15:49.480\npinned to your shoulder the entire time. All right, come on. Give me a beat. Give me a\n\n15:49.480 --> 15:59.360\nbeat. Let's fucking rap. Why do these people come here? Let's fucking rap. Yeah, yo, yo,\n\n15:59.360 --> 16:08.200\nyo, smooth rap. Yeah. Yeah. Smooth, slow, smooth, you want a faster rap? No, no, no.\n\n16:08.200 --> 16:14.160\nNo, no, no, no. From the street rap, from the tip to the sky to the top of the floor.\n\n16:14.160 --> 16:19.840\nI'm gonna fuck your mama down to the ceiling and floor. I just, I just run the words floor\n\n16:19.840 --> 16:24.880\nand floor and when I'm done getting fucking your mama gonna rhyme some more. I fucked\n\n16:24.880 --> 16:31.240\nyour mama in her knee in her eye. I fucked your mama with her shoe in her thigh. I fucked\n\n16:31.240 --> 16:36.840\nyour mama's legs fucked her butt. I fucked your mama in the eye and your dad said, What?\n\n16:36.840 --> 16:47.320\nI said, Hey, Mr. Domino fence. I'm just fucking your wife. It's the best defense. And he was\n\n16:47.320 --> 16:56.680\nlike, Whoa, okay, let me process this. And after a while, he was open to it. He got dressed\n\n16:56.680 --> 17:03.600\nup a spider man sat on a chair. Watch me fuck your mama and he didn't seem to care. He started\n\n17:03.600 --> 17:08.880\nrubbing his crotch and getting hot. I fucked your mama like her name was Tater Tot. Fuck\n\n17:08.880 --> 17:20.480\ndaddy too. Fucked everyone and you were taking a bath. I came creeping in and said, Let me\n\n17:20.480 --> 17:27.680\nhelp you with your math. Two plus two is four. But what's going down below here and more?\n\n17:27.680 --> 17:33.000\nHe looked at balls and stroke your shaft. I was like, head with the angry inch. You're\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:40.440\nfucking doing that. Yeah. Down the drain. Everyone's homophobia is catching the train.\n\n17:40.440 --> 17:48.520\nWe're going cross country and more. Every culture is going to advance more. Everybody's\n\n17:48.520 --> 17:58.160\ncool with everything. Yeah. All the races. Yeah. Fuck your mama some more black people\n\n17:58.160 --> 18:09.760\ngame people. Dan Harmon, everybody. Dan Harmon. Is that what you wanted? I know that's why\n\n18:09.760 --> 18:14.520\nyou came here tonight. I thought I thought your rap would be a little bit more renaissancey.\n\n18:14.520 --> 18:20.680\nI thought it would rhyme more. I thought there'd be more rhyming. It rhymed plenty when you\n\n18:20.680 --> 18:26.600\nwere rhyming the same word. I thought your mama was a shoe. And then I put on a sock\n\n18:26.600 --> 18:34.040\nand put on a shoe. I'm really drunk and high. I can't stress the high part enough. I need\n\n18:34.040 --> 18:39.160\npeople to know. I'm also high. Yeah? Yeah. You're not allowed to just say you're drunk.\n\n18:39.160 --> 18:47.520\nHow high are you? I'm super high. All right. So let's bring up. Come on. The show's going\n\n18:47.520 --> 18:56.520\ngreat. We've been off for a month. We're coming back with the best show ever. There's nothing\n\n18:56.520 --> 19:15.600\nLet's get, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get Kumeil Nanjiani out here. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n19:15.600 --> 19:25.840\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, you don't look like your face doesn't match\n\n19:25.840 --> 19:32.600\nthe renaissance era, but you really were born in the wrong time, my friend. But you saw\n\n19:32.600 --> 19:37.280\nSpencer, right? Like Spencer. Oh, of course. We all know that. Like Spencer, Spencer's\n\n19:37.280 --> 19:40.800\nthe last guy that would like bother to dress up for something. But if a renaissance guy\n\n19:40.800 --> 19:47.120\ncame through a portal, yeah, he would, if he caught a glance at Spencer, he'd be like,\n\n19:47.120 --> 19:54.320\nHey, what's going on? Oh, a friend. Spencer looks like a fucking alchemist. Yeah. And\n\n19:54.320 --> 20:00.240\nall he did is put on a mustard shirt at our best. Yeah. He, Spencer could be wearing a\n\n20:00.240 --> 20:04.720\nNinja Turtles shirt in the time travel. We're like, what am I on? How are we? We should,\n\n20:04.720 --> 20:20.320\nlet's bring Spencer out just to look. Spencer. You guys are dressed like assholes. Yeah.\n\n20:20.320 --> 20:28.640\nSorry. Where did you get that hat? It's just my hat. When the sun's out, that's the hat\n\n20:28.640 --> 20:34.480\nyou put on. Yeah. Going to the game. It's great. Yeah. It's got a very straight bill.\n\n20:34.480 --> 20:40.880\nIt doesn't impede my vision. No, I got all this stuff at a costume place. I just went\n\n20:40.880 --> 20:45.200\nin there and came out. Was that your first renaissance fair experience? This is my first\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:52.400\nall sorts of experiences. I drink mead. There's a turkey leg involved. I was surprised that\n\n20:52.400 --> 21:00.800\nyou were, that you wanted to go. Okay. Did you have a good time, Spencer? Yeah. I mean,\n\n21:00.800 --> 21:05.760\nit's like a state fair, except everyone's acting all dumb and weird. Well, so you have\n\n21:05.760 --> 21:11.120\na very different take than Dan does. No, I loved it, but everyone's like, oh, the lord\n\n21:11.120 --> 21:20.400\nwants a ducket for his coop. I'm like, no, I want a cider. What does meat taste like?\n\n21:20.400 --> 21:26.160\nIs it just like beer? I mean, it's not as good. I mean, well, beer's not. I don't know. Alcohol\n\n21:26.160 --> 21:33.520\ntastes alcoholic, and then it has these weird flavors that taste bad. That's about all I've\n\n21:33.520 --> 21:42.560\nbeen able to understand in terms of flavor profile of alcohol. I wish I'd gone. I just\n\n21:42.560 --> 21:46.280\ngot back in town this evening. I would have loved to have gone. I've never been. What have\n\n21:46.280 --> 21:59.360\nyou been up to? Nothing, right? Aside from being the star of a television show. Yeah,\n\n21:59.360 --> 22:05.360\nI haven't been up to anything. She's been hanging out. I was in Atlanta, which is actually,\n\n22:05.360 --> 22:13.960\nis anyone from Atlanta? It's like a pretty good city. It's what is it? Okay, that's\n\n22:13.960 --> 22:21.520\ncrazy. Yeah, I remember Woody Allen made that movie Midnight in Atlanta. What a great movie\n\n22:21.520 --> 22:33.240\nthat was. The black and white one called Atlanta. It's a, it's a good. Was that Casablanca?\n\n22:33.240 --> 22:38.120\nNo. Well, I was going with Woody Allen, so it was Manhattan. Oh, Manhattan. Yeah. That\n\n22:38.120 --> 22:43.680\nis fantastic. It's, it's, yeah. Don't they have like, like all the traffic lights, they're\n\n22:43.680 --> 22:49.800\non strings. That's weird. What? They just hang in from strings. Why can't you just let\n\n22:49.800 --> 22:55.400\na city do something? Well, you know, here we have them on poles and stuff. What are\n\n22:55.400 --> 23:02.320\nthe strings hanging from? The stars? Yeah. Yeah. No, the ceiling. The ceiling. The ceiling\n\n23:02.320 --> 23:09.280\nof Atlanta? He doesn't know. Nobody tell him. Nobody tell him. Atlanta, the entire city\n\n23:09.280 --> 23:14.480\nis indoors. Yeah, should have mentioned it's under a dome. I don't know why we didn't bring\n\n23:14.480 --> 23:18.520\nthat up. Is that, I didn't even notice. I barely look up. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, they\n\n23:18.520 --> 23:21.880\nhave these big white roads and they have a lot of traffic signals and they just have\n\n23:21.880 --> 23:25.600\nlike six or seven traffic signals just on this big string that's strung between two\n\n23:25.600 --> 23:31.000\npoles. It's weird. It's not even a, it's not funny. It's weird. I didn't notice that. Is\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:37.200\nthat right? Atlanta Lake? She, she disagreed. I've been there like two or three times. That\n\n23:37.200 --> 23:43.840\nwas literally the only takeaway I had. When you're there, you feel like the city's trying\n\n23:43.840 --> 23:47.720\nto make you fat. That's the takeaway I took. They're like, you don't want, for a side,\n\n23:47.720 --> 23:51.960\nyou want a fried chicken biscuit? Just for a side, it was $2. I was like, yeah, that's\n\n23:51.960 --> 23:58.160\njust a side. It was like a full fried chicken sandwich for $2. That's how I felt in Nashville\n\n23:58.160 --> 24:04.840\nand Portland and everywhere, but Los Angeles. Los Angeles is the only city where there's\n\n24:04.840 --> 24:10.480\nsuch a thing as a restaurant. It's like, well, we're, we're, you know, high protein, low\n\n24:10.480 --> 24:17.840\nlactose. Like you can go in and get a little square of fish. We were, we were at this,\n\n24:17.840 --> 24:21.400\nthe same diner and this guy was there and he was very nice and we ordered food and we\n\n24:21.400 --> 24:24.680\ntold some funny story and he laughed and he was like, the funniest thing happened earlier\n\n24:24.680 --> 24:29.960\ntoday. You guys missed it. This woman came in and I'm not going to do the Southern accent,\n\n24:29.960 --> 24:38.160\nbut like imagine like a racist version of that and then don't change anything. And he's\n\n24:38.160 --> 24:41.960\nlike, the funniest thing happened earlier today. This woman came in, came in and she\n\n24:41.960 --> 24:48.160\nasked for toast. She asked for, she asked for gluten free and then we were like silent\n\n24:48.160 --> 24:53.240\nfor what seemed like three minutes. It's just like staring like, are there, is there more\n\n24:53.240 --> 24:58.920\nto this story? Nope. I think the world was silent for three minutes and then one put\n\n24:58.920 --> 25:10.760\nin our order. Good story guy. So life changed for you now that you're, I mean, it seems\n\n25:10.760 --> 25:18.480\nlike you've been on a very linear 45 degree rise. Like I don't perceive your life as changing\n\n25:18.480 --> 25:26.880\nin quantum shifts, but you are now a regular character on this Mike Judge show. Yeah. I\n\n25:26.880 --> 25:34.000\njust, I'm curious as have you perceived any shifts happening in your reality? No, I mean,\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:39.400\nI, I get recognized like more, but you know, the kind of recognize where they're like,\n\n25:39.400 --> 25:43.760\nHey, how's it going? Where they think I went to like college with them or something? There's\n\n25:43.760 --> 25:47.760\na lot of that. We'll be like, Hey, how are you? I'm like, good. I've never seen your\n\n25:47.760 --> 25:52.600\nface before. So they don't, they don't put it together a lot of times. How are your mom\n\n25:52.600 --> 25:59.840\nand dad taking this? Well, they're taking it by not bringing it up at all. So it aired,\n\n25:59.840 --> 26:04.080\nyou know, it aired and I was like, Hey, watch the show. Two weeks went by and they did not\n\n26:04.080 --> 26:10.120\nbring it up. And then I said, Hey, did you watch my new show? And she said, Yeah. And\n\n26:10.120 --> 26:15.240\nthen it was silent for longer than it was silent with that waiter in Atlanta. She didn't\n\n26:15.240 --> 26:21.200\nsay anything. And then she was like, it's good. And that was it. Great. This is all\n\n26:21.200 --> 26:25.840\nI want from them. I don't want them to love it. First of all, fuck, I do want them to\n\n26:25.840 --> 26:30.480\nlove it. If your son is on a show, even if you don't love it, fucking love it, you know,\n\n26:30.480 --> 26:35.840\nlove the fucking show that your son is on. But even if you don't love it, just tell me\n\n26:35.840 --> 26:38.920\nyou love it. That's all I want. What do you think? Because that's a that's a through line\n\n26:38.920 --> 26:42.440\nin your life. You've told several of these kinds of stories where they're terse about\n\n26:42.440 --> 26:49.200\nyour, yeah, like career. What do you think there is blocking them from just being effusive\n\n26:49.200 --> 26:53.640\nor being upfront about what they don't like about it? I don't know. My brother was in\n\n26:53.640 --> 26:58.280\ntown and he sees him every other week. He lives like by them. And I, we were like hanging\n\n26:58.280 --> 27:02.600\nout and I hadn't really hung out with my brother as an adult very much. And I was like, Hey,\n\n27:02.600 --> 27:09.640\nso like, how's your relationship with your pair with our parents? Your parents? That\n\n27:09.640 --> 27:20.200\nsays something. Are their parents to you? No. And he was like, he was like, it's fucking\n\n27:20.200 --> 27:25.480\nweird. And then we just bonded over how weird he said, he talked about how like there's\n\n27:25.480 --> 27:30.400\nlike this wall where we don't talk about there's like a big filter. Is that just because that's\n\n27:30.400 --> 27:34.800\nthat that's their identity? Or is that could you expand that and say that's a Pakistani\n\n27:34.800 --> 27:39.120\nkind of cultural thing or no? I don't know. I mean, I don't know how many Pakistani parents\n\n27:39.120 --> 27:46.040\nhave kids who, you know, are in HBO shows. Is it a, is it a religious thing? Are your\n\n27:46.040 --> 27:51.440\nparents like devout Muslim, for instance? They are devout Muslims. But I think this\n\n27:51.440 --> 27:56.680\nis more like, you know, usually when you have, when you have parents, your relationship evolves\n\n27:56.680 --> 28:00.480\nin the beginning, they're just your caretakers and they're your disciplinarians. And as you\n\n28:00.480 --> 28:04.880\ngrow, it becomes more of sort of a friendly relationship, not you never become peers,\n\n28:04.880 --> 28:12.720\nbut there's like a warmth to it that, hopefully. Yeah. We have a warmth, but we never crossed\n\n28:12.720 --> 28:18.160\nlike the line into actually being able to talk about stuff. It reminds me of like Dan,\n\n28:18.160 --> 28:22.760\nlike you and Schrab and like my, my, my Midwestern friends. Yeah. It's a very Midwestern. It's\n\n28:22.760 --> 28:28.120\nfunny how familiar that sounds. Like I truly like, there is a weird filter there where\n\n28:28.120 --> 28:35.280\nI felt like my parents were like lizard people. I, I, there was a certain, it was like, I,\n\n28:35.280 --> 28:42.280\nI remember being a kid and laying my head on my mom's lap and it was, and then, and\n\n28:42.280 --> 28:48.200\nthen I remember the day when my mom tried to touch me and I was like, yeah. And I, and\n\n28:48.200 --> 28:53.800\nI, religion did have something to do with it, but it was also moreover, it was almost\n\n28:53.800 --> 29:00.240\nlike there was an unspoken tradition about the nature of kids and their parents that,\n\n29:00.240 --> 29:06.880\nthat I, I hit an age where actually on both sides, there was an unspoken agreement that\n\n29:06.880 --> 29:11.640\nlike this is over. Yeah. We're not, we're not, we're not cuddly anymore. Yeah. Because\n\n29:11.640 --> 29:16.400\nthere's no reason to be. It's not you. It's not me. It's all based on logic. And when\n\n29:16.400 --> 29:21.240\nI see that Star Trek episode when Spock says like, huh, well, it's every seven years, here's\n\n29:21.240 --> 29:28.320\nsomething I buried the lead on before I joined Starfleet, uh, every seven years. I, I have\n\n29:28.320 --> 29:31.320\nto go back to my planet and I got to fuck her fight. Yeah.\n\n29:31.320 --> 29:36.600\nI should have brought it up earlier, but the writers ran out of storylines this year.\n\n29:36.600 --> 29:41.120\nHonestly, Captain Kirk, I got your back and everything else, but can you give me a ride\n\n29:41.120 --> 29:48.040\nto third and Lancashire? And, and, and Captain Kirk's like, okay, that's fine. Is there anything\n\n29:48.040 --> 29:51.960\nyou want to talk about? Absolutely nothing. And he just like goes back to his planet and\n\n29:51.960 --> 29:55.480\nhas to deal with the shit. There's a compartmentalization.\n\n29:55.480 --> 29:58.840\nYeah. Certainly there is. And I think part of it for me was, you know, I left when I\n\n29:58.840 --> 30:03.880\nwas 17 and I wasn't like a person yet. And then I became a person away from them. And\n\n30:03.880 --> 30:09.080\nwhen they met me, I was like a, a person. And I think they never were able to reconcile\n\n30:09.080 --> 30:13.480\nthe person with their son. So I think that divide is still there where they never really\n\n30:13.480 --> 30:19.320\nsee me develop into like an actual, you know, is that because they, they didn't feel they\n\n30:19.320 --> 30:23.480\nwere a part of that change of that shift? I think it probably weird them out that I'm\n\n30:23.480 --> 30:28.400\nnot the same, you know, I'm very different from when I was a kid. I was very, very shy.\n\n30:28.400 --> 30:33.080\nLike I wouldn't talk like I wouldn't go to, okay, this is kind of revealing. It's weird.\n\n30:33.080 --> 30:39.200\nI had this weird thing until I was like pretty, um, well, I wouldn't, I was very shy. I couldn't\n\n30:39.200 --> 30:44.720\nlike buy stuff at the store. I thought they wouldn't like sell me stuff here in the States\n\n30:44.720 --> 30:49.240\nor back home, back home, back home. Well, I was like, because I thought that I was very\n\n30:49.240 --> 30:57.280\nugly always until like, I was pretty like, you know, old. Uh, and, uh, so, so I thought\n\n30:57.280 --> 31:03.240\nlike, Oh, the stores won't sell me stuff. So because I'm ugly, what did you want a handsome\n\n31:03.240 --> 31:15.080\nhat? I feel ugly again. Come on, sell me the chips. No, I just felt weird. I don't know.\n\n31:15.080 --> 31:19.640\nAnd so I was like very, very shy and introverted. And then they suddenly met me and I was like,\n\n31:19.640 --> 31:23.880\nyou know, more outgoing and like talkative and stuff. And so I think I was weird. Where\n\n31:23.880 --> 31:32.080\ndid that, that extreme shyness come from? Like, can you trace that back? Um, well, it came\n\n31:32.080 --> 31:38.400\nfrom how I thought I looked at, that's how it came, which was weird. Did you ever ask\n\n31:38.400 --> 31:50.760\nyour mom if you were handsome? Uh, no, I did. How old were you to tell me how old? Yeah,\n\n31:50.760 --> 32:00.160\nI want to know what room of the house you're in. Yeah, set the scene. Interior. I was in\n\n32:00.160 --> 32:04.240\nmy living room. And I want you to word it exactly as you were in it. I was in my living\n\n32:04.240 --> 32:14.080\nroom and I, I think it was 14 or 15. And I asked my mom, that's funny that one detail\n\n32:14.080 --> 32:23.400\ncould make a story go from funny to sad. You guys thought I was 23. You thought I was some\n\n32:23.400 --> 32:31.760\nkind of loser? I got it. I know, I know. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I learned to drive\n\n32:31.760 --> 32:41.000\na car soon, but tell me, am I handsome? I asked my mom if I was handsome. Would you, if you\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:45.520\nhad to go back and sort of pinpoint when your relationship with your mom got weird?\n\n32:45.520 --> 32:59.480\nDid you ask her to rate you from zero to 10? Wait, so she, she, in my mind, she's, in my\n\n32:59.480 --> 33:03.320\nmind, she's like in the kitchen, like, like, like, like putting a sandwich in a bag. She's\n\n33:03.320 --> 33:09.160\nhaving a normal day. She doesn't know what's going to happen. She didn't buy a chicken\n\n33:09.160 --> 33:15.880\nto this ride. And all I do is get pregnant at 22. A five foot ten gentleman walks into\n\n33:15.880 --> 33:24.440\nthe kitchen. A Ralph Macchio felt hat, yin-yang on the sleeve of his frosted denim jacket.\n\n33:24.440 --> 33:32.760\nMom, am I good looking? What happened? Is that what you want? What'd she say? She, she,\n\n33:32.760 --> 33:42.920\nshe laughed. Which anyone would. Well, as the audience did just now. Right. Yeah, I mean,\n\n33:42.920 --> 33:49.120\nlike, that's the thing. I'm realizing I, I'm the weird one. That's, that's a tough, that's\n\n33:49.120 --> 33:54.560\na tough. What in there? I was steeple to chase. What is, what did her face do? And then what\n\n33:54.560 --> 34:01.680\ndid her mouth say? She, she immediately made it clear that that was one of the worst questions\n\n34:01.680 --> 34:07.760\nyou, you can ever ask a mother. And it was like, I don't know. You're fine. Like she\n\n34:07.760 --> 34:12.520\njust tried to get through it. You know how they say everyone like in mother's eyes, even\n\n34:12.520 --> 34:18.360\nthrough the mother's eyes, she's like, you're fine. What had happened that day, Dan, that\n\n34:18.360 --> 34:25.040\nled you to that question? I don't know. I assume it was some girl in high school that\n\n34:25.040 --> 34:29.000\nwas, I don't know, that was. Were you going to like go? Inexplicably not responding to\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:37.600\nmy obsessive compulsive notes that I was giving her. Sir, I said circle one. Yeah. Why haven't\n\n34:37.600 --> 34:43.960\nyou circled one? Was the plan to go back? Maybe it's the shape of my face. Hey, mom,\n\n34:43.960 --> 34:52.000\nwas the plan to go back to her armed with your mom's response as a reputable. I asked\n\n34:52.000 --> 35:00.440\nmy mother. It seems you are mistaken. I believe you. I believe you. I believe you. I believe\n\n35:00.440 --> 35:08.240\nyou. I believe you. Guess what, Tracy? Someone just told me I look like David Duchovny. I have\n\n35:08.240 --> 35:15.600\na list of references. I think you might want to look over. Yeah. Oh, no. I don't believe\n\n35:15.600 --> 35:21.400\nme. I, this will shock you at the age of 15 when I asked my mom if I was good looking.\n\n35:21.400 --> 35:25.760\nI didn't know what I was doing. I had no idea where it was going to go from there. She said\n\n35:25.760 --> 35:32.120\nyou're fine. Yeah. I didn't walk away from that conversation feeling handsome. And that's\n\n35:32.120 --> 35:38.760\nnot on her. That's not a mom's job. No. Like you said, she just got pregnant before she\n\n35:38.760 --> 35:44.760\nwas born. She didn't sign up for you. All right, buddy. I imagine it like, try not to\n\n35:44.760 --> 35:50.880\nsmoke pot. Take it easy on the skateboards. I just had sex that one time and now you're\n\n35:50.880 --> 35:57.880\nin my kitchen being weird. Yeah. This is not fair to me. I need a government subsidy if\n\n35:57.880 --> 36:06.080\nI'm going to be teaching this activity. Yeah, you're real hot stud. Take your shirt off.\n\n36:06.080 --> 36:11.760\nHere's your hot pockets. Get the fuck to school and get out of my house. Jesus Christ, you're\n\n36:11.760 --> 36:21.200\n15. You're jerking off. You're shooting cum everywhere. I think no one should be talking\n\n36:21.200 --> 36:29.280\nto you about anything. Get the fuck out of here. Thank God for video games. Get the fuck\n\n36:29.280 --> 36:36.360\nout of my house. You're a weird, fucking weird, scrawny Gary Busey looking. I imagine you\n\n36:36.360 --> 36:41.720\ngoing back to playing video games and asking Mega Man the same question. Am I good looking?\n\n36:41.720 --> 36:59.280\nYes. Let's get more of our friends out. Oh, brother. Let's bring out my fiance and Matt\n\n36:59.280 --> 37:23.800\nGourley at the same time. There's no way to quit. No. We're trying to find more chairs.\n\n37:23.800 --> 37:34.560\nKumail, he'll get another mic. If I know Kumail, I'm really drunken. Sorry. What do\n\n37:34.560 --> 37:42.240\nyou guys bring to the table? What do you want? These are just two other people that woke\n\n37:42.240 --> 37:49.040\nup too early. Matt Gourley, before Erin, by the way, has a marvelous outfit on that she\n\n37:49.040 --> 37:57.760\ncobbled together. Looks like a million bucks. Matt, this is just a trip through your girlfriend's\n\n37:57.760 --> 38:06.320\ncloset if I'm not mistaken. It's five minutes into my girlfriend's wardrobe. Erin, how many\n\n38:06.320 --> 38:12.640\nmen implied that they would like to have non-consexual wool sex with you while you're walking\n\n38:12.640 --> 38:23.720\non a circular dirt road around a bunch of vans? I just leave the fare to go to Rape Vanfield.\n\n38:23.720 --> 38:31.240\nThat's what they're going to say. It's Rape Vanfield. One of the actual booths is just\n\n38:31.240 --> 38:37.800\na Rape van. It really is. I don't know what the protocol for a guy is. If you're walking\n\n38:37.800 --> 38:43.680\nwith your girlfriend down a dirt road and everyone's dressed like Toucan Sam and Bernie\n\n38:43.680 --> 38:48.560\nRubble and whatever the fuck, everyone's like, oh, we're having a good time. If there's just\n\n38:48.560 --> 38:56.280\na guy at a glass-blowing stand, if he goes like, glass-blowing, oh, hello, my lady. Looks\n\n38:56.280 --> 39:03.240\nlike you've got two glass bulbs that I'd like to blow on, like the nipples of those glass\n\n39:03.240 --> 39:09.440\nbulbs. You're supposed to just keep walking, right? That doesn't make me Willie Lohman\n\n39:09.440 --> 39:15.120\nor anything. You stab him. You stab him. Am I supposed to stop and go like, hey, fuck\n\n39:15.120 --> 39:22.160\nface? What's up? Yeah. I'm Adam Sandler. I don't think any of those things were specific\n\n39:22.160 --> 39:28.840\nto me, but there was a point where there was a nuts salesman or a ball salesman that's\n\n39:28.840 --> 39:34.200\nlike, how am I eating my nuts? Dan and I were joking about this very thing, and I said,\n\n39:34.200 --> 39:37.400\nI just want to go up to him and say, yeah, I'm going to fucking eat your nuts. I'm just\n\n39:37.400 --> 39:42.240\ntaking my hands. I just want to squeeze your little baby nuts. Just take them. You want\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:49.000\nme to squeeze your nuts? Does that feel good? Am I your mommy? I'm going on and on, and\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:55.360\nDan said, Aaron, you're in a forest of children. We had walked, she was doing that, Ben. She's\n\n39:55.360 --> 40:00.960\nlike, what if I said that? We were walking there. There was like 18 children. And between\n\n40:00.960 --> 40:08.120\nthem, their collective age wasn't to 30. There was like half a dozen children. Mommy, why\n\n40:08.120 --> 40:13.200\ndoes that, why does that woman want to squeeze that man's testicle? There was this guy at\n\n40:13.200 --> 40:18.800\nthe Mead Hutch or wherever we were. And he had, he was selling this special deal where\n\n40:18.800 --> 40:23.560\nhe had these like, like, kooche ball sponges full of cold water and he would put them on\n\n40:23.560 --> 40:29.240\nthe backs of women to cool them down. He was selling this, mind you. And then the girl\n\n40:29.240 --> 40:32.680\nthat had it done, her boyfriend was right next to him and then he put it on her chin\n\n40:32.680 --> 40:38.440\nand he goes, look familiar. What? To the boyfriend. Wait, meaning that the sponge is like balls?\n\n40:38.440 --> 40:42.360\nYeah, because they were ball shaped. Oh, there was someone with a mister who was like, get\n\n40:42.360 --> 40:46.360\nit all over your face. That's what you're, you stare and check, you know, like, you kind\n\n40:46.360 --> 40:51.640\nof, you kind of fade away. It doesn't hold up to the fucking cancel cold bear standard.\n\n40:51.640 --> 40:57.280\nLike, like, if you go in there with the slightest ounce of fucking, if your Geiger counter is\n\n40:57.280 --> 41:03.960\nlike, it won't last five seconds. Everyone beyond those gates is like, oh, my balls and\n\n41:03.960 --> 41:10.440\nmy dick. You look like a fucking dick heartache. Wow, right, my dick on you. Like in the Renaissance.\n\n41:10.440 --> 41:14.440\nI will say to their credit, all those men that are saying all those things are very respectful\n\n41:14.440 --> 41:22.600\nand bad. That was such a dumb joke. That was such a dumb joke. Hey, real quick. A couple\n\n41:22.600 --> 41:28.200\nof days ago, I was watching, I had Conan DVR and I was playing the commercials, which is\n\n41:28.200 --> 41:33.360\nsomething you don't usually, you don't usually see commercials. And I saw a promo. It sounds\n\n41:33.360 --> 41:41.240\nlike the dumbest. The worst. So there was a promo for a new segment where they said,\n\n41:41.240 --> 41:46.600\nprom's proposals, an epidemic. And then it cut to like a clip of these kids proposing\n\n41:46.600 --> 41:50.920\nto their girlfriends at prom. And they're like too much too soon. And I remember thinking,\n\n41:50.920 --> 41:54.960\nlike, oh, that's so silly. Like that seems like a, I don't know, let the kids propose\n\n41:54.960 --> 42:01.880\nprom. Totally unrelated from that. I just met someone backstage named Luke. Will Luke\n\n42:01.880 --> 42:09.400\ncome on stage? Luke, all right. Unrelated. All right. Unrelated. Luke. Real quick. What\n\n42:09.400 --> 42:20.920\nare you doing for prom? You want to go with me? Yeah. You go with that. Is he proposing?\n\n42:20.920 --> 42:36.880\nHe just said not at all what I expected. I hope that was okay. Wait, I'm really confused\n\n42:36.880 --> 42:46.200\nright now. Are you guys in high school? Yeah, it was an actual thing. You just asked this\n\n42:46.200 --> 42:51.440\ngirl to the prom. Yeah. And she said yes. Oh, I thought you were saying, I know I was\n\n42:51.440 --> 42:55.480\nhere, but I have a lot of questions, Luke. You watched it happen. By the way, she could\n\n42:55.480 --> 42:59.880\nnot say no. I thought you were saying, I thought you were saying, Aaron, that there are people\n\n42:59.880 --> 43:04.040\nthat are kids that are proposing at prom to for marriage. Well, he's got another thing\n\n43:04.040 --> 43:10.240\nin his pocket that she's gonna see at prom. I thought that maybe that intro would qualify\n\n43:10.240 --> 43:15.200\nit in a way is to not embarrass Luke, but maybe it embarrassed him. No, no, no, Luke\n\n43:15.200 --> 43:23.560\nis cool. Luke's not the one who's embarrassed. Can I do it again? Can I do it again? Half\n\n43:23.560 --> 43:28.080\nthe audience just said, no, you cannot do that. Am I the only one here that thought you\n\n43:28.080 --> 43:33.120\nwere saying a story about how kids are proposing marriage at prom? Yeah. Okay. So I thought\n\n43:33.120 --> 43:37.440\nit was a 18 year old reception. That is what she was saying. You were. No, no, no, no.\n\n43:37.440 --> 43:43.360\nThey were talking about how kids are having very elaborate prom asking. Oh, they're turning\n\n43:43.360 --> 43:48.800\nit into... He's got his name written on your hand. I came up before and asked me if I could\n\n43:48.800 --> 43:55.480\nget him in. Luke, what's the girl's name? This is Haley. Hello, Haley. Are you happy\n\n43:55.480 --> 44:06.920\nabout this prom proposal? Okay. Let's take that again with more sincerity. And action.\n\n44:06.920 --> 44:14.560\nAre you guys friends? Yeah, we know each other. Yeah. So I know you know each other, but...\n\n44:14.560 --> 44:19.280\nThey're like this. Luke, how could I have done that better? What were you hoping for?\n\n44:19.280 --> 44:28.480\nI did great. You did everything I expected you would do. Why is that so creepy? You did\n\n44:28.480 --> 44:34.880\neverything I expected. He just used you as a ploy to do what you do. And he's like she'll\n\n44:34.880 --> 44:40.800\ndo it bad and then we can make fun of her and that's how we'll fall in love. The dot\n\n44:40.800 --> 44:44.640\nI'm not connecting is they're not high school kids. They are high school kids. Oh, they are.\n\n44:44.640 --> 44:53.680\nShe's asking her to go to prom. Prom proposals. It wasn't a marriage proposal? She's asking\n\n44:53.680 --> 45:07.760\nher to go to prom? Yes. God forbid that go wrong. Ken, where were you? In the Renaissance?\n\n45:07.760 --> 45:16.000\nWhat happened? Yeah, but you guys are just friends. We've been friends. Luke and Hailey.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:20.400\nThey know each other from history. American friends or French friends?\n\n45:20.400 --> 45:26.680\nLuke and Hailey. So you're friends. You want to go prom with each other or you at least\n\n45:26.680 --> 45:32.240\nwanted Hailey to go with you, Luke. This is a culture of things that's happening where\n\n45:32.240 --> 45:37.600\nkids are doing more and more elaborate proposals. Are we living in a world now where you come\n\n45:37.600 --> 45:43.120\nto a podcast and do that? Are your friends also doing that sort of thing? Yeah, they're\n\n45:43.120 --> 45:51.160\na different podcast. There's a guy at Douglas movies right now. Yeah, you couldn't have worked\n\n45:51.160 --> 45:59.120\nup a flash. Hailey. They tried to get WTF but he's booked out for a while. Hailey, do\n\n45:59.120 --> 46:04.680\ngirls ask guys out in the same way? Yeah, what's the Sadie Hawkins protocol? Do girls\n\n46:04.680 --> 46:10.160\nalso initiate or is it only guys initiating? No, nothing for the girls. They're guys initiate?\n\n46:10.160 --> 46:15.440\nBut you could, right? I mean, there's nothing precluding you from that. You'd be spit on.\n\n46:15.440 --> 46:19.840\nYou'd be spit on? What? If a girl asked a guy, would you go to the prom with me? The\n\n46:19.840 --> 46:28.040\nguy would spit on them? She's saying you're putting yourself, as much as you're putting\n\n46:28.040 --> 46:33.400\nyourself out there, a guy asking a girl to prom. It's way more.\n\n46:33.400 --> 46:39.680\nYeah, we haven't progressed to this point yet. Luke, be honest, Luke. What percentage\n\n46:39.680 --> 46:43.680\nwould you say that you thought that was a done deal? Like she was going to say yes?\n\n46:43.680 --> 46:54.680\nUm, well... 50-50? 80? Be careful, Luke. Yeah, I had that shit in the bag. We're really\n\n46:54.680 --> 46:58.880\ngood friends. She doesn't go to my school but she used to go to my school. You know,\n\n46:58.880 --> 47:03.640\nI feel like she... Was she expelled for a... For going to too many proms? She was the\n\n47:03.640 --> 47:09.720\nHester Prynne of their high school. Big pee on her chest. She did ask a guy to prom?\n\n47:09.720 --> 47:13.800\nOh yeah, she got spat on. That's why she left. Are you kidding me? What is happening?\n\n47:13.800 --> 47:18.560\nIt's a really bad set of 200. No, no. This is true. Luke, don't try with us. You guys\n\n47:18.560 --> 47:25.320\nwhat, 17, 18 hold you? I'm 18. You're 18? Mm-hmm. And? Mm-hmm. Okay. Really, you're\n\n47:25.320 --> 47:32.000\n18? You're 18? As far as we know, yes. Luke, when you asked your mom if you were physically\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:37.120\nattractive, when you were nervous about today, what did she say? No offense, I think Luke\n\n47:37.120 --> 47:42.120\nis the kind of guy that has the kind of looks where he knows the answer already. We all\n\n47:42.120 --> 47:51.520\ndo. Yeah, Luke's mom is responding with fine. She's opening with fine. I just came from\n\n47:51.520 --> 47:57.680\na Dusty Love Festival. He wanted to prove that he could ask a girl to prom in any way.\n\n47:57.680 --> 48:02.600\nHe's just flaunting it. Yeah. He's like, I could poop will you go to prom with me on\n\n48:02.600 --> 48:09.080\na plate? She'll still say yes. I'm going to take her to a show and bear as the fuck out\n\n48:09.080 --> 48:18.720\nof her. I'm fucking Luke, man. I feel a little used by Luke a little bit. Well, I'm jealous.\n\n48:18.720 --> 48:24.400\nThere was nothing, there was no amount of flowers I could give to a girl that would make\n\n48:24.400 --> 48:37.120\nher do anything. Spencer, what kind of high school romantic path did you forge? I went\n\n48:37.120 --> 48:48.160\nto high school. Did you do it in high school? I went to high school. Did you get any action?\n\n48:48.160 --> 48:55.160\nI went to high school. Did you attend a prom or? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I had friends that\n\n48:55.160 --> 49:01.480\nwere girls. It's not hard to, you know, hey, I mean, they're incredibly lovely people.\n\n49:01.480 --> 49:09.880\nYeah. Women, you know, you know, women, they love, they love dressing themselves up. Right\n\n49:09.880 --> 49:20.160\nup book, my friend. Proms? Yeah. Only Spencer could get away with saying that. Yeah. Tim\n\n49:20.160 --> 49:27.880\nAllen said that again. Oh, Spencer being delightful. Did you have a, did you have a high school\n\n49:27.880 --> 49:43.040\nsweetheart? No, I'm just dodging all these questions for no fucking reason. It's not\n\n49:43.040 --> 49:48.960\nthat far. Talking about myself, things I do and all my relationships. There was a girl\n\n49:48.960 --> 49:53.040\nin high school. I mean, there's tons of girls in high school. Like it was half the student\n\n49:53.040 --> 50:03.040\nbody. I remember like they're, they're a big, they're a big prom proposals. I'm gonna keep\n\n50:03.040 --> 50:07.600\non saying it until it's a real thing. Did you go to, did you go to any of the functions?\n\n50:07.600 --> 50:12.400\nDid you go to the dances? I went to, in high school, there actually weren't like, for what\n\n50:12.400 --> 50:16.320\nwe did, middle school had a lot of dances and then high school basically only had like\n\n50:16.320 --> 50:21.920\nhomecoming and prom. So I, I, I didn't go to homecoming because those were just like\n\n50:21.920 --> 50:26.560\na glorified football game. Um, I mean, there was a dance, but no one even went to that.\n\n50:26.560 --> 50:35.120\nIt was just part of the football game. Everybody went. No. Nerd. I was at the football game\n\n50:35.120 --> 50:39.360\npart, but like there's like an auditorium. No one was in it. Like there was, like there's\n\n50:39.360 --> 50:43.480\nliterally a dance that people weren't attending because they were watching football. I'm not\n\n50:43.480 --> 50:52.640\ngoing to defend football school. Spencer went to football school. That's where he learned\n\n50:52.640 --> 50:58.080\nhis, uh, what is it? The wolf kicking dance. Oh yeah. Yeah. In the morning, they'd have\n\n50:58.080 --> 51:04.760\nto call coyotes out of the field. Yeah. We need, there's a job for 10 men. No, just send\n\n51:04.760 --> 51:11.280\nSpencer. I mean, this is, that's like dramatized, but I was like that guy. Like when there's\n\n51:11.280 --> 51:16.160\nweird stuff, people would be like, Hey, Spencer, can you climb onto that roof and you know,\n\n51:16.160 --> 51:24.160\nI eat that bug for me. I need it. I need someone to eat this bug. Did you really eat bugs?\n\n51:24.160 --> 51:35.240\nNot in high school. I mean, people eat sushi. They're water bugs. Yeah. Food's weird, man.\n\n51:35.240 --> 51:39.840\nI mean, well, people actually, people actually eat bugs like as a normal thing. It's normal\n\n51:39.840 --> 51:45.440\nto them, I guess, right? Sure. Yeah. I should have went with that first. Sushi's a weird\n\n51:45.440 --> 51:50.000\nleap. I think we're fishing weird too. I don't need anything that has a non standard number\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:57.880\nof legs. So like zero or four is okay. No legs, fish, fuck off. Eight legs. What about\n\n51:57.880 --> 52:03.000\noysters or clams? I don't know. What about amputee livestock? How many? If it's two,\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:05.800\nhow would you know? If it's two legs, then it's fine. But I mean, you've probably eaten\n\n52:05.800 --> 52:13.520\nthree legged hamburgers in the past. Yeah, but they were born with four legs. What about\n\n52:13.520 --> 52:20.800\nlike milk fed three legged veal? I don't do veal, bro. They're about lobsters. No lobsters.\n\n52:20.800 --> 52:25.920\nBecause of their non standard amount of legs. Well, they look, they look like giant bugs.\n\n52:25.920 --> 52:31.240\nLike they are giant bugs. Yeah. Who doesn't have exoskeleton? Bugs have exoskeleton. So\n\n52:31.240 --> 52:36.360\nyou won't eat lobster? No. By the way, I got to say the term amputee burgers has never\n\n52:36.360 --> 52:41.280\nbeen said before. And Spencer again, blazing trills. No, I don't eat lobster. I don't\n\n52:41.280 --> 52:45.320\neat any seafood. And I don't. It's not like a moral thing. I'm just kind of creeped out\n\n52:45.320 --> 52:51.800\nby it. You don't like, cause the, cause the legs. Yeah, that's part of it. Too many legs,\n\n52:51.800 --> 52:57.800\ntoo few legs. No, thank you. Have you ever had good octopus? No, it's got like eight\n\n52:57.800 --> 53:02.520\nlegs. Yeah. That's defined by his legs. Sea turtles. I'm telling you, that's some good\n\n53:02.520 --> 53:08.320\nshit, bro. Octopus is good shit. Octopus is good. Is it springy? Yeah, it is. It's rubbery.\n\n53:08.320 --> 53:15.280\nYeah. But when it's good, it's like, it's a salty bubble gum. It's kind of, it says\n\n53:15.280 --> 53:21.120\nit, when it's bad, bad octopus, bad octopus has like a rubbery skin on the outside of\n\n53:21.120 --> 53:28.040\nit. I have an issue with this. You and I have been dating for three years and we've gone\n\n53:28.040 --> 53:31.240\nout to several places where they have octopus. And every time you get out, you're like, ah,\n\n53:31.240 --> 53:35.960\nnot the good stuff. I don't believe you anymore. Like, I know, ordering octopus and you're\n\n53:35.960 --> 53:40.320\nthis octopus expert, but I think maybe you were drunk one time and you had octopus. And\n\n53:40.320 --> 53:44.200\nyou're like, I'm the best. And then every other time I've been in the shirt. And it\n\n53:44.200 --> 53:49.200\nwas like meatloaf. He just thought it was good. Yeah. We've been to very fine restaurants\n\n53:49.200 --> 53:52.280\nwhere he's like, no, not the same as blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n53:52.280 --> 53:56.560\nI heard a rumor that a certain percentage of calamari is served that is like cow and\n\n53:56.560 --> 54:03.640\nit's like pig, pig butt. Pig butts a little. Who cares? I've heard that. Then guess what?\n\n54:03.640 --> 54:15.200\nPig butts delicious. Nine out of 10 pig anuses are fucking delicious. Because I heard that\n\n54:15.200 --> 54:22.120\nstory in NPR. That's a real thing. Yeah. I mean, it's not. Yeah. All right. Pig. Yeah.\n\n54:22.120 --> 54:29.600\nSome of it's pig anus. It's good. All right. All right. It's time for our next segment.\n\n54:29.600 --> 54:37.840\nWhat time is it? Nine or three. Oh shit. Yeah. There's a lot of people out here tonight.\n\n54:37.840 --> 54:50.520\nWe started doing the show again. I'm a little I'm a I may be a little drunk and also a little\n\n54:50.520 --> 54:57.720\nbit high. But how did you get high? I didn't see you smoking. Shut up. It doesn't. We're\n\n54:57.720 --> 55:02.920\non the same bus. It smelled like like Willie Nelson's bus. Okay. And it's just a sheet\n\n55:02.920 --> 55:07.800\nof plywood with four wheels and there was some joints. What bus were you on? I was on the\n\n55:07.800 --> 55:14.120\nbus paying attention. How did you not get high? I don't know. All right. Anyways, sure. It\n\n55:14.120 --> 55:22.400\ndoesn't matter. I'm 41. I need to grow up. I need to be a better person. This is all\n\n55:22.400 --> 55:32.120\nvery irresponsible. These people paid $10. They came here in record numbers tonight.\n\n55:32.120 --> 55:43.400\nI would like to start a new religion just just to do it. Because I just finished listening\n\n55:43.400 --> 55:52.000\nto Going Clear, the book about Scientology. Is it what's the perspective? Is it like it's\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:58.520\nlike starting a religion is like a fucking gangbusters fucking financial jackpot like\n\n55:58.520 --> 56:06.600\nit's but also like helps a lot of people. No, for real, like I'm not kidding. Like here's\n\n56:06.600 --> 56:10.640\nthe thing going into it, like you think of Scientology have like all these weird like\n\n56:10.640 --> 56:16.400\nkind of voodoo, you know, you heard about it and you have like these weird urban legends\n\n56:16.400 --> 56:22.200\nthat you've heard about it. Yeah, there's fucking crazy people are in charge and all\n\n56:22.200 --> 56:28.440\nthis stuff. But like listening to that book, like the 600 page book, the story of the thing,\n\n56:28.440 --> 56:33.480\nwhat emerges is the same thing that emerges when you watch Book of Mormon, which we just\n\n56:33.480 --> 56:39.560\nsaw like people people make too much fun of new modern religions. Like it's like they're\n\n56:39.560 --> 56:44.920\nfucking new. Like, of course, they're going to say that. Yeah, Jesus has a toothbrush for\n\n56:44.920 --> 56:51.080\na hat. Of course, they think they have nothing else to do. They're fucking like they're out\n\n56:51.080 --> 56:55.360\nin the they're out in the wind, man. It's a new religion. Yeah, their only fault is\n\n56:55.360 --> 57:00.360\nthat they're so new that they can talk about stuff that like they have the concept of aliens.\n\n57:00.360 --> 57:09.360\nSo now aliens are part of it. Yeah. And then everyone's like, wow, think about that. Scientology\n\n57:09.360 --> 57:16.440\nis a pretty good racket. Like, let's fuck it. Those motherfuckers like by the way, shit\n\n57:16.440 --> 57:22.200\ngoing on like the money changed hands. And the fucking IRS went toe to toe with them\n\n57:22.200 --> 57:30.240\nand they fucking beat them. They beat the government. That's a good religion. Any religion\n\n57:30.240 --> 57:36.400\nthat beats the fucking shit out of the government. Holy shit. What I love is when you get really\n\n57:36.400 --> 57:45.240\nworked up, it looks like your parrot is nodding along. Yeah, that's right. That's a good religion.\n\n57:45.240 --> 57:54.200\nThose fuckers like sat in a room with the IRS at one point. The IRS was like, like,\n\n57:54.200 --> 57:59.640\nwe don't know what to do anymore. You've bankrupted our fucking legal department. And Scientology\n\n57:59.640 --> 58:05.240\nwas like, yeah, we're at our knees to truce ceasefire. They fucking like made a they made\n\n58:05.240 --> 58:11.320\na fucking agreement with the best. What's what's what are the some of the tenants of\n\n58:11.320 --> 58:16.720\nyour new religion. Okay, well, here's the thing. Okay, so here's the thing. Okay, forget\n\n58:16.720 --> 58:22.480\nthat money making stuff. He just mentioned. I swear to God, that's not to start a religion.\n\n58:22.480 --> 58:29.160\nBest part of our new religion. The Elron Hubbard of it doesn't give a fuck. Like, I don't,\n\n58:29.160 --> 58:34.080\nI don't, I don't, I don't, I have no money to make. I don't want to, I don't, you just\n\n58:34.080 --> 58:40.600\nset the opposite. No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to make any money. Oh, there. Okay.\n\n58:40.600 --> 58:47.040\nOh, sorry. Oh, you have to pee. Sorry. That's synchronized pee. There's a stress test in\n\n58:47.040 --> 58:54.240\nthe bathroom. There's two cans. You can't flush it unless you hold the cans. Is a pee\n\n58:54.240 --> 58:59.760\nmeter in there? No, I, it did seem like for two people that had to pee, like they were\n\n58:59.760 --> 59:04.600\nvery like, no, I have to. Oh, my God, I felt like they were Scientologists. Yeah, they're\n\n59:04.600 --> 59:12.640\ncalling Scientology right now, which is fine. Because I mean, I, anyways, I read the book.\n\n59:12.640 --> 59:18.760\nA lot of people like benefit from any religion that you start. You don't have to actually\n\n59:18.760 --> 59:23.920\nrob anybody blind. You don't have to do anything. I was like, like, Dianetics when Elron Hubbard\n\n59:23.920 --> 59:28.280\nwrote Dianetics, it was kind of an open source kind of thing. You should also say that like,\n\n59:28.280 --> 59:32.880\nwhen you were listening and reading to that movie, that movie, that book, that your, your\n\n59:32.880 --> 59:36.760\nreaction every moment of it was like, Oh my God, this is fucking crazy. These people are\n\n59:36.760 --> 59:41.760\nmistreating these other people. Like that's your, like, but, but you were also like, Oh,\n\n59:41.760 --> 59:49.160\nyou, Oh God, I could make my own. That's, that's possible. But like your reaction to Scientology\n\n59:49.160 --> 59:55.440\nas a religion isn't like, Oh God, this is great. This is doing so much good for people.\n\n59:55.440 --> 59:59.920\nAny religion does great for people. There's a, if you can call it a religion, it's doing\n\n59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.440\ngood for people. There's no such thing really. The only, the only thing that hurts people\n\n01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:10.760\nis like a weird is government. It's, it's, it's, it's people. It's when you tell people,\n\n01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:17.720\nyou have to go into a fucking a double wide trailer and sit in there with no air conditioning\n\n01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.800\nand do these things. That's, that's not religion. That's fucking government.\n\n01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.680\nDid you change your mind since reading this book? What are you talking about? What do you\n\n01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.360\nmean? I don't know. I don't want to sell you out. I'm saying like, like when you, if you,\n\n01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.040\nif you say to people, I have a way, I have a philosophy, I have a way for you to connect\n\n01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.160\nwith the unknown of the universe, there's no way that can hurt anybody. That's not true.\n\n01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.040\nYeah, I could. What do you mean? All you have to do is give me all your money and go shoot\n\n01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.120\nup this building and then you'll get in the habit. But that's government. That's, that's\n\n01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:52.680\nwhat, what? That could be when, when you tell people what to do, then you're, that's not\n\n01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.320\nreligion. That is religion. Religion tells you what to do.\n\n01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:03.320\nSo then you think Scientology is government. So you want to make your own government or\n\n01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.200\nyou want to make your own religion that's not Scientology.\n\n01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.800\nNo, you could make a religion that didn't have anything to do. You wouldn't never have\n\n01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.160\nto tell anybody what to do.\n\n01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.160\nWell then what would people do?\n\n01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.160\nWell then stop comparing it to Scientology.\n\n01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.920\nSo, so you, you wouldn't respect a religion unless it fucking branched over into politics\n\n01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920\nand government?\n\n01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.720\nNo, no, no, but you're saying that like, that if you tell people what to do, it's government\n\n01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.320\nand Scientology does tell people what to do. So then I think it's government.\n\n01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.440\nForget, okay. Forget Scientology. Because,\n\n01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.240\nBut I mean, all religions tell people how to act.\n\n01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.240\nYeah.\n\n01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240\nWhat I'm saying is,\n\n01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.240\nIt's a huge part of it.\n\n01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.240\nWhat I, what I read in that book is like, like,\n\n01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.240\nEven your parents disagreeing with you.\n\n01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.240\nHe's shaking his head.\n\n01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.640\nThat's the first time he shook his head the whole time.\n\n01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:54.000\nWhich by the way, it's physically impossible for it to do. Must be religion.\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:02.560\nWe tend to politicize religion in a way that makes you say, okay, Mormonism, Scientology,\n\n01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.760\nJehovah's Witness, like, we, we, we weigh them on this scale.\n\n01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.600\nBut don't you think they politicize their own religion?\n\n01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.640\nBut, but we're too predisposed to do that.\n\n01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.160\nI have a quick, quick question. And this is not to counter anything. I'm curious.\n\n01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:22.920\nSo I have a family member who's involved in the Christian religion and she really\n\n01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.360\nGet her out. Get her out.\n\n01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.000\nSo she espouses this belief that she believes she's taught where the Lord will provide and\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.240\nwill take care of it and has been in two unhappy marriages and won't divorce for that reason.\n\n01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.040\nAnd that, there's nothing political about that.\n\n01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.360\nIs that, how would you answer to that?\n\n01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:48.160\nWell, I didn't, I didn't, I'm too drunk and high to have heard all of that, but.\n\n01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.640\nWhat I'm trying to say is that.\n\n01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.000\nNow that the parrot just cried.\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.720\nI didn't actually think anything I said would be that controversial. I'm pleased that it\n\n01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.560\nis. I'm glad I got that response.\n\n01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.840\nIt's unintentional because truly whatever I'm, whatever, what I'm trying to say, it\n\n01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.080\nshouldn't really be that controversial. What I, all I'm trying to say is that there's\n\n01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:16.160\na component of every religion that just atones the individual consumer with the unknown and\n\n01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.920\ncosts nothing and doesn't demand anything else.\n\n01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.880\nBut that's not at all what Scientology is about as far as I think, as far as I think.\n\n01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.640\nBut we're talking about, but, but, but when you, but you, you're rooting for Scientology\n\n01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.640\nbecause they beat the government.\n\n01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.640\nI'm not.\n\n01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.640\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.640\nThat was a different thing.\n\n01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.040\nThey also feed up on people's pocketbooks and make them rob from their families and friends\n\n01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.840\nto pay for the un-fucking-known results of whatever they're fucking doing. Like I, I\n\n01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.280\nknow people that went through it and they got a lot of good out of it.\n\n01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.440\nThey actually, there's a lot about Scientology. It's clean living and like, like how\n\n01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.240\nChristianity is the same and they're doing it on the surface of like, that's fine.\n\n01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.880\nEvery religion is about clean living. Every religion is about looking within yourself,\n\n01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:58.160\nfiguring out what you're ashamed of and, and laying it out there and like coming clean.\n\n01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.480\nAnd there are people within every religion, every, even the ones that we call cults, there\n\n01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.800\nare people that are, that belong to those organizations who get benefit out of it, who are just in\n\n01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:14.760\nthe middle of the bell curve, who are just like, oh, I, I walked into this thing and\n\n01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.560\na guy told me, put on this red hat and you're part of red hat-ism. And red hat-ism means\n\n01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.720\nthat you, you flap a hat up and down and then you go like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I used\n\n01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.200\nto think that I was a bad person for jerking off, but now I don't feel that way anymore.\n\n01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:38.920\nLike, like, good religion, like a street hot dog, like, ah, you guys really miss something.\n\n01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:49.640\nYeah, catch them up. There are, there are ordinary people who derive good results. Sure,\n\n01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.680\nthere are. But don't get me very good. Every single religion that you would ever make fun\n\n01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.960\nof. I know, there's a positive side to every religion and that, you know, it gives you\n\n01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.800\nsomething to believe in. And they actually, they're the ones that are keeping the things\n\n01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:05.720\ngoing. Sure. When we hear the crazy stories about magic underwear or super-duper hats\n\n01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:11.240\nor like, like they paid this money to this political fund or whatever, we, we weigh these\n\n01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:18.120\nreligions on a triple beam scale. So all I'm saying is, okay, so if that's the problem,\n\n01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:24.480\nthen what if you started a religion that didn't have any of that? If I could promise you,\n\n01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:31.000\nyou know, fuck Buddhism, lady in the front rows at Buddhism, no. I hope that's the title\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.720\nof this episode. There's no, there's no, there's no, because there's not enough back\n\n01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:45.120\nend. They didn't beat the IRS. It's not, it's Buddhism. It's too, there's too much Richard\n\n01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.680\nGeer involved in it. It's too, it's, it's, you have a long way to go to explain your\n\n01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:55.520\nlove of religion and also the, the clear line you draw where it has to be a profit-based\n\n01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.720\nstuff. I'm going to, it's not, there's not going to be a profit. I'm going to, I swear,\n\n01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:06.200\nI know you've heard this before, but I swear I won't make any of you kill anybody. I don't\n\n01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:16.560\nbelieve, I don't believe. Least of all yourselves. I swear to God this time. I know it seems,\n\n01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:22.360\nI know it seems like, like, oh, he's going to, he comes in with one of these guys with\n\n01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:27.240\na religion. This time I swear you won't have to kill anybody.\n\n01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:37.920\nFather Harmon. Father Harmon, I, I saw, I saw your flyer at Froyo and I, God, I, I just\n\n01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:42.160\nmoved to Los Angeles and I moved here with my husband and my daughter and I came home\n\n01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.720\nand there was a note from him saying that I was an unfit mother and they've, they've\n\n01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.800\nleft me. I, I can't afford to pay my rent and I don't know who to turn to. I know that\n\n01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:58.040\nI need something in my life. I saw on your flyer that you offer, you're not going to\n\n01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.520\ntell me what to do, but you're going to make me feel good, but also I owe you money and\n\n01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:05.240\nI just wanted to know. You don't owe me any money. No money.\n\n01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.200\nI just, how do I, what do I, what do I do? How do I do?\n\n01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:13.760\nDo you play bass? Because the first thing, we have a rock band, do we?\n\n01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:19.760\nYeah, I play, I play a little bass. Our band is called Pillars of Fire and we\n\n01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:25.600\nare meeting. That's the first thing. We just need to put it, to put together a band.\n\n01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.160\nThe first problem, I, I, I, I, I might deal. The first problem with your religion is that\n\n01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.120\nthe band doesn't have a bass player.\n\n01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.560\nUh, have you heard of the Rolling Stones? Yeah.\n\n01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:46.240\nHave you heard of Christianity? Thank you. Both of them needed bass players. I'm, I'm\n\n01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.520\na little drunk. I'm just saying, here's what I'm saying.\n\n01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:55.080\nI, I, I just got a contact drunk off of that story.\n\n01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.800\nI think people listening at home just got drunk. I agree with you because I think people\n\n01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:04.880\nof our, in our demographics seem to dismiss religion offhandedly and without giving it\n\n01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:09.760\nany sort of thought. All religion, the concept of religion, the concept of religion, because\n\n01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.560\nevery single religion, I think it gives people a lot of stuff, important stuff. I agree with\n\n01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.560\nyou on that.\n\n01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.560\nThat's the only thing that has never existed. What, what, what is your essence of how, like\n\n01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.600\nwhat is the secret that you're giving or the, the comfort that you're giving?\n\n01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.680\nOpen source religion. It's like a first open source.\n\n01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.560\nSo it's like a Wikipedia of religion. You can just add to it. No one's ever, I'm out\n\n01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.000\nas soon as I fanged it, uh, is that the, uh, found.\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.200\nSo what if somebody comes in and goes, I'm going to start taking some money, like people\n\n01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.200\nwill abuse it.\n\n01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.200\nNo, no, they can't do that. How?\n\n01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.120\nIf, if anybody makes money off of it, then it's not a religion.\n\n01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.120\nThat's a government.\n\n01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.520\nIs there a theology to it there?\n\n01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.800\nYes. Uh, in the beginning, uh, there was a band without a bass player.\n\n01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:54.800\nI, I, it seemed like there needed to be more religion and I made one. No, I don't know.\n\n01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.080\nI'll figure that out later.\n\n01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.440\nI, it's not, it also sounds to me, uh, and look, I, I, I have the sneaking suspicion\n\n01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.600\nyou haven't really thought this through that one, but it sounds to me that perhaps you\n\n01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.320\nkind of fancy yourself the leader of this religion.\n\n01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.440\nNope. I swear to God. I swear to God.\n\n01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440\nWhat God?\n\n01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.360\nWhat's your, what's your theology?\n\n01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.240\nUh, what is God and you're in this new religion?\n\n01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.000\nHe spit, spit ball it.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.560\nI, I don't want spoilers. It's an open source religion.\n\n01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.560\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.120\nUh, that means Tyler in the front, uh, he can, he can, he makes it.\n\n01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:39.560\nI think the slogan, I think the slogan, the first religion with spoilers is a new religion.\n\n01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:40.560\nThat's where you would know me.\n\n01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.560\nWell, Christianity is the first one with spoilers.\n\n01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.960\nNo, but I don't know, he comes back in his religion. He like, he, he rolls it out.\n\n01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.160\nYou know how they back into, okay. Hey, yeah. Okay. All right. Okay.\n\n01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.120\nThis is, this is the beginning of a weird period of your life, I think.\n\n01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.120\nFuckin' A man. I'm 41.\n\n01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.520\nThis is your first step to becoming a Scientologist.\n\n01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.720\nAlso, look how you're dressed and you're saying this.\n\n01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:12.560\nDo you think, do you think there was a, a really ship shaped screenplay in place before\n\n01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.600\nthey greenlit the Grinch that stole Christmas with Jim Carrey?\n\n01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:22.480\nOr do you think they've camera tested some yellow contacts and they didn't know what\n\n01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.480\nthe fuck they were doing?\n\n01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480\nYeah, but they stole Christmas.\n\n01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.920\nBest case scenario, your religion is as good as the Grinch who stole Christmas.\n\n01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.920\nWith Jim Carrey.\n\n01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.920\nWith Jim Carrey.\n\n01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.920\nWith Jim Carrey.\n\n01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.760\nYou can, you can back into a project. You can say, this is our goal.\n\n01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.680\nYou just want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas of religions?\n\n01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680\nNo.\n\n01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.000\nThat's what you're shooting for?\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.680\nI would rather be fast, furious, seven, whatever number you thought done yet and one of the\n\n01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.680\nactors died.\n\n01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.680\nYou can back into a number.\n\n01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:58.240\nSo Dan, if, if the Grinch who stole Christmas by Dr. Seuss is to the movie, the Grinch who\n\n01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.480\nstole Christmas with Jim Carrey, what is the source material?\n\n01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:07.120\nLike what is the, like if this is a religion you're backing into, like is there a, a thing?\n\n01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.120\nJust a light spent feeling.\n\n01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:18.120\nAnd I know, I know that makes me sound like a prophet and I don't, I'm, I swear to God.\n\n01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.000\nWe don't think it makes you sound like a prophet.\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.760\nI promise.\n\n01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760\nYou have my word.\n\n01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760\nThe O-F-I-T.\n\n01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.640\nWe get this thing up and running.\n\n01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.400\nI am out.\n\n01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.000\nI promise I'm not a prophet.\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nWhat is going on?\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nWhat is going on?\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nI want to smoke what you had, man.\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nIt was a fucking one.\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nYou guys seem like you're taking this more seriously than I am.\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nCan we eat black?\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nNo.\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nThat pattern is whispering.\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nAt what point you started, you started wagging your finger at us and got really, really\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nupset.\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.600\nYou want to do something terrible to people.\n\n01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.600\nNo.\n\n01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.600\nI want, I want to.\n\n01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.600\nIt's like the point where you disappeared into a sooth shack today and you came out\n\n01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600\nchanging.\n\n01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600\nYeah.\n\n01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.400\nYou walked like an inch off the ground.\n\n01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.400\nAll right.\n\n01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.400\nWell, for real.\n\n01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.400\nAll right.\n\n01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.400\nSeriously.\n\n01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.400\nAll right.\n\n01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:18.720\nJust think for a second about your fears about what happens after you die and just imagine\n\n01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:26.600\nfor one moment that I knew he's not a prophet.\n\n01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600\nHe's not a prophet.\n\n01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600\nI swear to God, I'm not a prophet.\n\n01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.600\nHe's just a guy with a plastic parrot on his shoulder.\n\n01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.600\nI'm saying hypothetically, if I knew, I knew, I knew.\n\n01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.600\nMy biggest fear is that you know.\n\n01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.600\nYeah, I don't want you to know.\n\n01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:47.600\nIf I did, then couldn't everybody, couldn't you just take us out of benign?\n\n01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.600\nHow many, what's your, what's the average salary of the people in this audience here?\n\n01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.600\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\n01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.600\nI'm trying to alienate you.\n\n01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.600\nWhat kind of question is this?\n\n01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.600\nWhat if we put it into building a compound?\n\n01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:07.600\nEverybody's like, oh, I'm the big bad guy.\n\n01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.600\nJust think about it.\n\n01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.600\nYou fucking, you parasites.\n\n01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.600\nAre you inferior?\n\n01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.600\nThey're definitely in that scenario.\n\n01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.600\nIf you guys can't see what I'm seeing, then maybe, maybe you should leave.\n\n01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.600\nThere's definitely a moment where someone's assigned to feed your parrot.\n\n01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.600\nSpeak to the people there.\n\n01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:41.600\nJust think about what your soul wants.\n\n01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.600\nDan, Dan, I'm a, I'm a plumber.\n\n01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.600\nI make $10,000 a year.\n\n01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600\nWell, you should make 20.\n\n01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.600\nNo, Dan!\n\n01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.600\nTake her for your wife.\n\n01:13:53.600 --> 01:14:02.600\nI am the parrot Gabriel fallen from heaven.\n\n01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.600\nJust think about everything that you've ever wanted in your life.\n\n01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.600\nAnd now imagine having twice as much.\n\n01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.600\nAnd then now ask yourself why you don't have it.\n\n01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.600\nAnd get mad.\n\n01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:22.600\nI want you to get mad with me about you not having twice as much as you want.\n\n01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:30.600\nYou are allowed to have twice as much as you think you should have.\n\n01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:36.600\nI just want to help you have more.\n\n01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.600\nIt's not fucking, it's not rocket science.\n\n01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.600\nAnd it's not a cult.\n\n01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.600\nIt's not religion.\n\n01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.600\nAnd I'm not a prophet.\n\n01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.600\nI'm not doing anything to you.\n\n01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.600\nYou don't have to do anything I say ever.\n\n01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:58.600\nYou just have to wake up!\n\n01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:07.600\nYou just broke the mic stand of apathy.\n\n01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.600\nWe'll work on it.\n\n01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.600\nWell, it's an open source religion.\n\n01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.600\nIt's open source.\n\n01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.600\nYou're going to feed into it.\n\n01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.600\nWhat's it called?\n\n01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.600\nIt's called nothing, motherfucker.\n\n01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.600\nIt's called fuck you.\n\n01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.600\nIt's called...\n\n01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.600\nIt's called harm...\n\n01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.600\nHarmonology.\n\n01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.600\nFuck.\n\n01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.600\nIt's a working title, working title.\n\n01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.600\nIt's called harmonology.\n\n01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.600\nI just made that up.\n\n01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.600\nI just made it up.\n\n01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600\nIt's called harm.\n\n01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.600\nIt just fucking came out.\n\n01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.600\nIt just came out.\n\n01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.600\nHarmonology.\n\n01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.600\nI made it up.\n\n01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.600\nThis would have been such a fun time to bring up Luke.\n\n01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.600\nAll right, so usually at this time in our show,\n\n01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:57.600\nwe play judges and dragons, but I refused.\n\n01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.600\nYeah, I was not allowed to leave.\n\n01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:06.600\nI told Spencer he wasn't allowed to go and work on D&D,\n\n01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.600\nso he just had to come up and sit here dressed like...\n\n01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.600\nI've been writing holy writings for you behind the scenes.\n\n01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.600\nBut I told him that I would DM for him.\n\n01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.600\nYou could come up here and I'll DM for you.\n\n01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.600\nWhatever anybody wants, I'll do anything.\n\n01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.600\nI like the sound of that.\n\n01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.600\nAll right, so Dan, you want to go to the table?\n\n01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600\nYou want to switch?\n\n01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.600\nYeah, what time is it?\n\n01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.600\n9.25.\n\n01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600\nOkay, that's a good time.\n\n01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.600\nOh shit, I really broke this.\n\n01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600\nYou broke the mic, Stan.\n\n01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.600\nOh fuck.\n\n01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.600\nAll right, I'll pay for that.\n\n01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.600\nBut you'll pay for it.\n\n01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.600\nAll right, with your prayers.\n\n01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.600\nBecause it's not a cult.\n\n01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.600\nBy the way, don't say that anymore.\n\n01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.600\nDon't say if you're starting a cult that it's not a cult.\n\n01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.600\nOh, we don't need it.\n\n01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.600\nAll right, hold on.\n\n01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.600\nAll right, I'm going to...\n\n01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.600\nOkay, all right, thank you.\n\n01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.600\nWhat the people at home missed was that\n\n01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.600\nDan reached for a bottle of vodka\n\n01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.600\nand then Aaron gave him a bottle of water instead.\n\n01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.600\nHere's your...\n\n01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.600\nThank you.\n\n01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.600\nAll right, Dan, I'll give you some music\n\n01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.600\nand you'll just freestyle an intro.\n\n01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.600\nAre we continuing our own...\n\n01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.600\nNo, this is a new campaign.\n\n01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.600\nEverything is new.\n\n01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.600\nEverything is not canon, right?\n\n01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.600\nThis is not canon?\n\n01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.600\nThis is a new campaign.\n\n01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.600\nSide quest?\n\n01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.600\nThis is a new...\n\n01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.600\nIt's an elf's world?\n\n01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.600\nThis is a new RPG I've developed.\n\n01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.600\nIt's called This World.\n\n01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.600\nOkay, let's do it.\n\n01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.600\nHarmon...\n\n01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.600\nGreat. Sounds great, Dan.\n\n01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.600\nDan, are you ready to roll?\n\n01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:04.600\nYou guys are all playing yourselves, okay?\n\n01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.600\nAll of your stats are...\n\n01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.600\nBut I'll tell you where you are.\n\n01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.600\nWe're not making up characters, we're us.\n\n01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.600\nI'm Jeff, Camille, Camille.\n\n01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.600\nBut I need dice. I don't have any dice.\n\n01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.600\nYou have to pretend.\n\n01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.600\nHit the table and see it.\n\n01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.600\nWho has dice?\n\n01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.600\nOne of our comedians has dice,\n\n01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.600\nwhich surprises almost nobody, which is great.\n\n01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.600\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.600\nDylan has dice.
