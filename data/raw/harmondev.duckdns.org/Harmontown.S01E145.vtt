It would be ridiculous to put that much effort and aesthetic like appeal into something that was that was also just an obstruction like a civic disobedience.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nThat's the case.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:11.000\nThat might just be an aesthetic thing where they don't want their facade of their home to be sullied by.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:14.000\nLike I've already given this person the benefit of the doubt.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nThey might have cancer.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nYes, obviously they thought it looked good.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nIf only there was a way to find out if they were a douchebag.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:31.000\nIf only there was some other dot that where you could draw a line.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:41.000\nWe learn in geometry that a single point in space could be the center of anything but it's not until there's another dot there that you can go douchebag.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:56.000\nWhat is three feet from their wooden garbage cubby in their sea of zen gravel that is different from everyone else who just has Los Angeles distributed grass?\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:03.000\nA little, this is where I wish in the future we'll have, I could be like Johnny Carson, I could throw up a feed.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:10.000\nI took a photo but we'd be excluding you guys and only including these assholes who pay money for feed.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:17.000\nBut they pay twice as much as you do each week, you guys pay $5 a month.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nCan we not put a photo in after we're done tonight and put this in for us?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nI'll try to remember to put it on my Instagram or something but I'm just going to describe it to you.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:31.000\nSo it's like this little decoration, it's a little two-dimensional decoration that was store bought.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:43.000\nLike it's plastic and it's an image about this big, I'm holding up my hands, it's eight inches, at least I hope.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nI hope that's what eight inches is.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\nTired of worrying about it.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:58.000\nI don't know if my first hand is at the base or at the taint but it's fucking about eight inches.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:02.000\nI can't stand it anymore, I'm 42, I give up.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:06.000\nWhat was your ideal penis length be if I was a genie in a line?\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nThis is not the time for that.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.000\nEight inches, everyone says eight inches, I don't know what eight inches is, I don't know what that means.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nI don't know if mine's four inches, I don't know if it's two, I don't know if it's...\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:22.000\nI know it's not ten.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:28.000\nOkay, so back to the story.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:44.000\nSo it's this small little plastic, two-dimensional, it's just a flat thing, it's not a sculpture, it's like a plastic, almost like a day glow plastic.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:47.000\nLike if it was nighttime you might imagine that it would glow in the dark.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:53.000\nI probably wouldn't but I'm saying imagine that kind of plastic, something glow in the dark frisbee would be made out of.\n\n06:53.000 --> 07:06.000\nSo it's just cheap plastic but bought in some store and it's an outline of a dog squatting to poop.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:13.000\nAnd underneath the dog squatting and it's got a little post so you can stick it somewhere.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:20.000\nSo this was made by some asshole and put on a rack for assholes at an asshole store.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:26.000\nAnd this asshole bought it and it's designed to do this, to stick in an area.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:31.000\nAnd so it's a dog pooping and underneath the dog it says, no!\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:41.000\nTranslation, yes, the city of Los Angeles has seen fit to gather together and implement leash laws and doggy-do laws.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nSo what's good for the goose is not good for the gander.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:50.000\nMy area outside my home is so fucking special that in spite of the fact that you have to walk around with a pile of plastic bags\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:55.000\nand that if you don't have your dog on a leash the police can come and yell at you and give you a ticket.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:59.000\nWe have seen to this as a state and city of animal lovers.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:08.000\nBut in spite of all of that, this person would like you, if your dog decides to start relieving itself near their beautiful home,\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:15.000\nyou just yank that little fucker down to the next fuckface's house and let him shit in the inferior person's lawn.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:19.000\nBecause they don't want shit ever touching their zen gravel.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nNo! Not here!\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nBecause there's not signs everywhere.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nWe don't live in a world where there's no laws so you have to put a sign if you don't.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:34.000\nOh, I'm sorry, do you not like dog shit? We love it! We love it! We all love dog shit!\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:40.000\nSo we love dog shit?\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:45.000\nI love dog shit is what you're saying to me.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:52.000\nBy exclusion, I have a sign over my head with a dog shitting on it that says yes!\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nI love dog shit!\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:00.000\nIt's your special because your garbage is in a fucking log cabin.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:08.000\nYou can't wait to get enough money to get in a helicopter and get the fuck away from who!\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:13.000\nYou're gonna live with giraffes? They shit everywhere!\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:18.000\nYou live in King's Landing! This is as sophisticated as it gets, motherfucker!\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:25.000\nYour garbage is on the curb! There's dog poop everywhere!\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:32.000\nFor the five seconds before the owner is legally compelled to scoop it up into a fucking hot bag\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nand put it into their silk line pocket.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:40.000\nJerry Brackheimer has to clean up as his assistant probably does.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:44.000\nWe are conscientious about this.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:51.000\nCan we ask our very talented and creative Harmontown audience to make you an equal plastic sign\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:59.000\nwhere a picture of you and Aaron with a dog pooping into your mouth and says yes!\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:04.000\nI just want to make one that says maybe!\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nYou never know!\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:10.000\nBecause the alternative is I'm gonna scar my dog's memory.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nDogs only do three things.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:19.000\nWe just finished successfully Aaron, just successfully potting training our new grief dog.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:24.000\nIt's a really hard process and you're so excited the day your dog,\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:28.000\nthis little puppy goes out the doggy door and he goes, you watch him and he's like,\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nthere he goes, there he goes, it's a big boy!\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nHe knows to make it outside.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:40.000\nThe idea that I'd be taking a walk with my dog and he would stop in that forbidden zone\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:47.000\nand that I would be like, well, that this person would have me feel bad that my dog chose there\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\ninstead of eight feet away.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nWhat a bad person.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:56.000\nThey made that garbage hutch for bad reasons.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:01.000\nThey probably, I'll tell you, now I'm comfortable saying because of that little dog sign,\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:07.000\nthe reason for the garbage hutch is because they see the skexie that come and pick through the garbage.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nThey don't like those people.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nWhat's that guy doing down there?\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nThat guy's trying not to panhandle.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:17.000\nThat guy's picking through your shit and pulling out aluminum cans from,\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nand they're like, I don't know, what's he doing down there?\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:29.000\nLet's build a force field around our garbage!\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:35.000\nProtect the garbage!\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nProtect the garbage!\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:41.000\nThey're going to get the garbage!\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nI told you, remember my neighbor?\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:48.000\nWe called him Ethnics because he actually turned out to be kind of a fun guy.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nIt was Ethnics with an X at the end.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nWe decided it was Ethnics.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nI'm sure I've told this story, but he would...\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nWe haven't talked about Ethnics in a good long time.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:03.000\nI had a light bulb outside my apartment door and it was always off.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:12.000\nI was like, what the fuck's with the light bulb?\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:25.000\nI unscrew it at night because when the light is on, the children next door play.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:28.000\nI'm not making that up.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:32.000\nHe said, when the light is on, the children play.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:36.000\nI like to steal the sunlight.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:40.000\nBecause sunlight brings the children joy.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:46.000\nHe was called Ethnics because he referred to the people that weren't white in the neighborhood as the Ethnics.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nBut he was kind of Ethnic himself, no?\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nHe was certainly like...\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nHe had some swath to it.\n\n12:53.000 --> 13:01.000\nIf whiteness was his idol, he was a naughty boy.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nThat brings the racist out in me.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:08.000\nWhen racist people are proud of their race, I'm like, well, you know.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nOkay.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:18.000\nAlright, buddy.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nAnyways, I was trying to turn on my thing.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nI got really fired up about that.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nAll I wrote was a doggie nose sign.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nI didn't know it was that mad.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:35.000\nI would love to go, and I also hate to go, inside their home because you know there would be lots of rules.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nMan.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\nThere would be lots of post-it notes for the housekeeper and stuff like that.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\nHave you been to passiveaggressivenotes.com?\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nIs that still a thing, passiveaggressivenotes?\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nI like the sound of it.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:49.000\nIt's a total rabbit hole.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nBecause it's just...\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:56.000\nEvery time at the office or an apartment building, people that leave...\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nI've been one of these people, I think we all have as part of the appeal of it.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:06.000\nThis grody part of you that at one time in your life, at some point you've left a weird long note to strangers.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nOr a roommate.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:14.000\nAnd you're just in a weird time in your life where you haven't learned shame yet, are you?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:18.000\nSometimes you just see these notes.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:26.000\nWhen you remove the clothes from the dryer, make sure the lint trap is clean, and we don't have your lint getting into our lint.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nIt's just like this diatribe?\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nAnd it's just so much intensity.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nI got a note on my car one time.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:36.000\nIt wasn't my best parking job of all time, but it was the best I could do.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:43.000\nI'm a firm believer that I'll get out of my car and look, and if I can use less space, I'll back it up to the very edge of the curb.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nI use all the space I can.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:50.000\nOne time I did, and I got a note that was clearly a copy.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nThis person had a stack of those notes.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:57.000\nIt was a form letter to a gentleman or a madam.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:01.000\nThat person just goes around doing that.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nAnd I kind of dig it.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\nI want better parking.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:12.000\nI want people to use the space, but also don't have a fucking glove box full of...\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:23.000\nThe idea that what's standing between you and happiness is other people is something that all of the assholes that never have to interact with you because they paid enough money to not have to,\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nthey're laughing all the way to the bank.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nWell, you and I are sitting there going like,\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:33.000\num, could you please put your glove shoe where the right shoe goes because otherwise the thing won't go across the divider and it's very irritating.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\nI was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nThey've got us trained to police ourselves.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:42.000\nI have a guy, I don't know where he lives.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:50.000\nI do know that about two years ago, maybe more, I just kept hearing, it's strange hours of the night and the day,\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\ndistant clarinet noodling.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nI thought, okay, somebody's got a clarinet.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nThey're learning.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nMaybe there's a kid taking clarinet lessons.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:10.000\nBut it was kind of chlesmary, like kind of fiddler on the roofie.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:15.000\nAnd you could never fucking figure it out.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nAnd then you could hear it moving.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nOkay, somebody's walking the streets.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nIt's fucking 3 a.m.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:24.000\nI would turn all the lights out and look, but there's not enough street light on my street.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:28.000\nAnd I would see a figure, like a Sasquatch going by.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:35.000\nAnd I could see a huddled, like just a silhouette going by.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:42.000\nSo now what he's done, he's taken up in a red SUV and he parks on my street every three days,\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:46.000\nwhich I take to mean he has other streets he goes to.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:51.000\nHe's scattering that out and spreading it out.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:57.000\nAnd I've always heard it and like just all of a sudden there'd be a...\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:00.000\nAnd he parks right behind my office window at my place.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nAnd I heard a jogger come to the street and go,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nhere bro, play clarinet a little.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nThere was some guy who went to his window.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nA jogger came to his window.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:11.000\nHe just sits in the car and I think my guess is he has a wife or a roommate or something like that.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nHe's an older guy with gray hair.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:17.000\nAlso the clarinet has awesome, like Stephen Tyler ribbons hanging off it.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nWait, now he's not a silhouette.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nNo, no, no, I've caught him in the daylight.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nI've seen him in the daylight.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nBut I tried to get the phone out and get footage, but he just evaporates.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nHe's a mystical being.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:30.000\nAnd now he sits across the street from my place and I can see him from my window,\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:33.000\nbut there's just enough reflection off the glass today.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nI can't get an image of him.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:38.000\nWhat if it turned out to be old you?\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nWhat if you took a picture and it was like there was a reflection\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nand you took it to a detective and he's like,\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nenhance, enhance, enhance.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:53.000\nAnd it was like fucking you with like long gray hair.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:58.000\nAnd the clarinet had like futuristic, like microchips on it or something.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:02.000\nHe's certainly that mythological.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nSo I have these new neighbors.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nThey're from England.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:13.000\nShe's like, do you frequently hear clarinet playing or am I going mad?\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:16.000\nI'm like, no, like look across the street in the red SUV.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nIt's so good.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:21.000\nI don't want him to go away, but there's a jogger came up and completely just gave him shit.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nI think he lives nearby.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nI think he's pretending.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nThis guy was like a jockey kind of guy.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nI think he pretended to go jogging.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nI think he lives right there.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:34.000\nAnd then like went way around and jogged up to him.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:39.000\nI live way across town, but weird playing clarinet all the time.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nI wanted to go shoot that guy.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nYeah.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nI lived in my first one bedroom apartment in Hollywood.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:51.000\nThe guy right next to me was like, I'm not exaggerating.\n\n18:51.000 --> 19:00.000\nHe was morbidly obese like by the legal definitions because you would have like, there was a van that would come pick him up whenever I had to go eat.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:06.000\nOr teach physics.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nI don't want to get all PJ O'Rourke about it.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:14.000\nI'm not going to assume he was on the dole.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:21.000\nBut it seemed to me because for a year I listened to him and he was an amazing voice.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nHe was like an opera singer.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:26.000\nAnd every once in a while he'd have somebody over that would obviously have fallen for some kind of singing lesson thing.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nSo he was like teaching people to sing.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nHe was an amazing voice.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:34.000\nHe would sing opera at the top of his lungs.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nAnd I was like, oh, this is like a Robert Altman film.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nThere's an opera singer next door to me.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:44.000\nI would tune it out and every once in a while he would yell at the handicapped van because they were late.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nHe had this rage-a-haulism thing.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:50.000\nHe was not a perfect guy to live next door.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:54.000\nBut at least let's say a year went by that I lived in that place.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nI was like, oh, that guy does that.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:00.000\nHe was singing like South Pacific and stuff.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:05.000\nHe'd just hear weird snatches of South Pacific or West Side Story or something.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:09.000\nA really good voice. I think it might have been different if he wasn't like a good singer.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:16.000\nAnd then one day just like from upstairs in the six-unit building and just like after like 20 minutes of him.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:23.000\nAfter a year of this and then like all of a sudden upstairs you just hear, all right?\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:26.000\nShut up, you fat bastard!\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:32.000\nIt was like it was a Scottish guy which distracts you because it's the Mike Myers reference.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:37.000\nBut I remember the guys on the fat bastard and he had a Scottish accent and lived upstairs.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nAnd then the guy just immediately went silent and I never heard him again.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nAnd I was like, yeah.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:49.000\nIt was like, well, he is a fat bastard and I guess he's, but like, so here's my, I just want to say this about that.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:54.000\nSo like, okay, so like, you live in an apartment building.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nIt's like, guess what? You live with other people.\n\n20:56.000 --> 21:02.000\nThey clomp, clomp, clomp on the Tuesday night she does this and the Wednesday night he vacuums.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:06.000\nAnd this guy is a serial killer or this guy sniffs your laundry.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nIt's like, it's called living with other people.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:13.000\nIt's like, it's a thing that they have done to us as part of a class system.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:17.000\nWhen you're poor you share property with other people that you don't even own.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:25.000\nSo what would be a really dangerous thing to happen in that case is everybody getting along.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nBut they call them apartments.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nThink about it.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:40.000\nAnd everyone just sits there for 30 years of their life going, like trying to act like their goal is to turn their life into like, like Hugh Hefner's life.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:44.000\nEven though they're still living in a fucking building that they share with a bunch of poor people.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nIt's like, because we're so trained to hate each other for being poor.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\nSo we go like, what do you do?\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:50.000\nYou know, when you put your chalk up bars on the thing or something like this is your neighbor.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:53.000\nThis is like your closer person than your family.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:56.000\nLike you, like buy a house motherfucker.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nLike, which is what we all want to do.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:04.000\nWe all can't wait to like get behind some big gate with a heart to heart logo on it and just like sit up there and fucking like.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:09.000\nAnd that's when you go insane and you end up like abducting women and keeping them prisoner and like.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:12.000\nBuilding cedar enclosures for your trash cans.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:15.000\nThe truth is that this is life.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nI mean the guy that's stomping above you, that's it.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:20.000\nThis is as much, that's it.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:24.000\nThis is your family. This is your life.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nAll right.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:28.000\nBut I'm not saying you have to love it.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:34.000\nI'm just saying like by the time you don't have it anymore, you're going to be powerless against it.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:40.000\nYou're going to be powerless against anything that actually makes you unhappy, which is the fucking landlord who's collecting your rent.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nHe lives by himself.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nAll right.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nI just wanted to make one point.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:47.000\nThis is the special get off my lawn episode of Harmontown.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:53.000\nAaron and I were talking about dicks on the way over here and because there's a guy in England who's drawing dicks next to potholes.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:58.000\nAnd then they're calling him wanksy because and then.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:06.000\nBut then the potholes get filled because in England, like, I guess, like a penis on the street is like, they're like, oh, they fill up the pothole.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nSo like in England that works.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:15.000\nI don't know if it will work in LA, but and I was saying like, well, in LA, you'd probably have to at least, at least it would have to be like a swastika made of dicks.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:18.000\nOr vice versa.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:22.000\nAnd Aaron said, why don't you ever see a swastika made of dicks?\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:33.000\nAnd I said, I guess because you're usually in two different moods when it really, they really are far removed.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nIt's like the doodling and this, you know, anything's a dick.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:43.000\nAnd then there's that urge to, you know, like assemble the Rhineland and conquer all of humanity.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:46.000\nYou're just never in the same mood at the same time.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nHitler wasn't like, I love dicks.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:56.000\nI'm almost certain if you Google right now swastika made of dicks or dicks made of swastikas or whatever, there's images of that.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nOr just dick swastika.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nYes, of course.\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nThere'll be like 500 of them.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nIt was just, I just thought we were both very funny in the car right over here.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nThat's all.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nAll right.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nSo is our friend here?\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nDid he ever pop by?\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nDo you have any of our friends here?\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:15.000\nWell, Curtis said he was coming tonight is why I'm asking.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nOkay.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nDo we have Curtis in the house?\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nNo, Curtis.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nSorry, everybody.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nHe usually pops by around nine.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nAll right.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nDelights deferred.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.000\nOkay.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:36.000\nWell, I'm wearing my colors for my wife's basketball team tonight.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:43.000\nThe Lee says, which is designed by where is Oh, Hannah is not the she's usually she's in the front row.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:48.000\nHannah, Hannah Nance are longtime Armenian and brilliant graphic designer design these shirts.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.000\nAnd she's also doing the illustration for Emily Gordon's book.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nSo I'm just putting a string around my finger.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nWe should have Emily Gordon on the show.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nWe should.\n\n24:56.000 --> 25:00.000\nWe are wasting like somebody that should have been on the show a long time ago.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nI think she'd be fast.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:09.000\nI think she's almost a victim of like how close she is to the because it was literally her idea for me to do the podcast.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:12.000\nLike, like she she suggested it.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:17.000\nIt's like so whenever I see her in the email, she's always just going like, do you have any names for the guest list that I just like think of?\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:20.000\nBut I'm never thinking like, Oh, Emily Gordon would be an amazing.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nWhy don't we just say next week?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nLet's have her on.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nWe're going to be in Portland, right?\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nI think next week we're in Portland.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nMaybe she will be too.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nWe'll see.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nWell, Steve Levy, are you here?\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nPut it on.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nPut Emily Gordon on your list.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:35.000\nPut put Andy kindler on your list.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\nPJ or work.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:41.000\nI'm going to start doing like a regular podcast having Steve Levy.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nAndy kindler.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nI fucking love and Andy kindler is a funny.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:45.000\nWho knows Andy kindler.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:46.000\nHoly fuck.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:52.000\nI I've one of the funniest days of my life because that guy's so bloody fucking funny.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nI said he for some reason he likes the Lakers or used to.\n\n25:55.000 --> 26:00.000\nI sat next to him at his girlfriend's apartment up in the valley like many, many years ago.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:05.000\nAnd he what I watched him watch a Laker game and it was the funniest thing I've ever seen\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:09.000\nin my life because he's a stand up comic who's just giving the Lakers shit.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nHe's tremendously funny.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:16.000\nHe's a he's a he's a he's a he's an LA treasure as funnier than any.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:20.000\nAnd if you see him do stand up, he's like he's I saw him do show in time.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:23.000\nHe was going to what's the aspen work.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:27.000\nThe big thing there were the comics going like I guess was aspen, right?\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:31.000\nIn the old days when there was a thing called a holding deals and development deals for actors.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:34.000\nThat's all gone away unless you're like Steve Buscemi or bigger.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:38.000\nLike they used to give like up and coming comics, you know, $500,000 to go.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:39.000\nDon't go to ABC.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:42.000\nYou you work for CBS and we're going to put you on a show.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nAnd if we don't, you still get half a million dollars.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:51.000\nSo the big back when every comic was getting shows like your Ray Romano's and Drew Carey's and stuff like that.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:55.000\nAnd then way after that, there was he was doing a show at Igby's, which is a comedy club.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nI think that's gone now on the west side.\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:00.000\nAnd they told him, do your set.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:01.000\nDo not riff.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:02.000\nDo not go off script.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:08.000\nJust it's all the top brass, all the big companies and networks are going to be at your show.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nAnd you're going to go to ask me just do your thing.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:14.000\nAnd he made a reference that someone goes like, what's that?\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:17.000\nSomeone just yelled out what like didn't get the reference.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:24.000\nAnd he never got back to his material and absolutely crucified the entire audience.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:30.000\nBecause they were west side tight asses and didn't fucking dig it and right wing and he fucking just laid it on him.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:33.000\nAnd then he goes like, forget momentum.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nForget my forget forward progress.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:42.000\nMadam, anytime you don't understand anything I say, please or anybody just just just just just pipe in and ask me what that means.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nI'd hate to see you at a Dennis Miller concert.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:48.000\nAnd then he did 40 minutes on he hates Dennis Miller.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:53.000\nAnd the crowd was it was abject silence, except for the seven comics in the back of the room.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nWe're losing our minds.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:59.000\nI mean, he's really, you know, you hear the phrase comics, comic.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:06.000\nI mean, he really is like, like, like for somehow I don't know if you'd be offended by by me saying this.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:07.000\nHe jokes about it all the time.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:14.000\nBut like, like, I think it's notable about his career that I put heavy air quotes around the word success.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:22.000\nVery heavy air quotes, because that's the point of his existence that's proven out is like, but you would say at a glance, success eludes him.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.000\nLike, like, like as in he hasn't had a shitty sitcom yet.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:32.000\nHe hasn't he hasn't like he hasn't embarrassed himself grappling for an attempt to be one of those household names.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:35.000\nHe just I don't know if it's because of that's why I want to talk to him.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nI don't know if that's if that's his own choice.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nI don't know if he's if he sabotages himself.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:50.000\nI don't know if unconsciously that's nobility or if there's or if it's just happy coincidence that he's I don't know if he's like if it never if that opportunity never comes to him.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:56.000\nIf Andy had his way, he would be, you know, on TV and in movies get like guaranteed.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:59.000\nBut like, like, he's just he's so funny.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:05.000\nHe would do a thing about the just for laughs of Montreal, where he would do a giant giant show called the State of the Industry Address.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nAnd he would just talk about what's being picked up and what's not.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nAnd it's fucking.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nI just I think there's always this interest.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:16.000\nI'm always talking about like, I hate this like institutionalized comedy console, but comedy is very popular now.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:27.000\nSo it's like, and I'm sorry, I'm going to slit my own throat by saying sometimes when I see ads for Jimmy Fallon with a with a with a with a politician is going to come out and play tug of war with him.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:30.000\nLike, I'm just like, this isn't this isn't comedy's role in the world.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nThis is not what we're supposed to be doing.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nHow do I even know what we're doing is funny anymore.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:44.000\nIf the idea is hosted by people such as Andy kindler and Jeremy Kramer and Greg Proops and comedy should always be separate from from success.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nIt should always be separate from politics.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nIt should always be profane.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:57.000\nIt should always be the other thing that should because otherwise you cannot guarantee that it's funny and you that as funny as it could be.\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:00.000\nAnd you cannot like it's I don't know.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:03.000\nIt's like I'm always like ranting about this behind closed doors.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:13.000\nI feel like it's actually like career suicide for me to like, you know, I can't I can't even fully like talk about it because I would say so much shit that it would just people already don't like me.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:17.000\nBut I just like I just think like comedy doesn't have to be dark and it doesn't have to be toxic.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nIt doesn't have to be hateful.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:22.000\nBut it has to be it has to be suspicious of authority.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nIt has to hate everything that's popular.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:29.000\nIt cannot just come out and say this popular things coming out.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:33.000\nBut what if this popular thing played peekaboo with me peekaboo?\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nThat can't be comedy.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nThat cannot be comedy.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:41.000\nThere's no way that that just doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:48.000\nAnd so and I think I feel like Andy kind of represents like the intersection of those roads where you get some investigation done because he is truly funny.\n\n30:48.000 --> 31:01.000\nAnd it seems like the reason all comics love him and like always kind of trust him and fear him and and why he's never able like like he never shoots up and rings the dumbbell.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:10.000\nYou know, like at the carnival where it's like Andy kindler in the WB's just talking about daddy's like like it never gets to that point.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:19.000\nI have a feeling it's because he's too like whether it's it's genetic or unconscious or by choice he's too he's too committed to being funny.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nAnd it won't allow for that.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nLike you couldn't put Bill Hicks in this.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:27.000\nThere's not a drawer that he goes right into like on TV and stuff like that.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nBut I oversold him.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:31.000\nSo now I'll come on the show and I'll be like he's just going to yell at you guys for being young.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nThat's what I do too.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:35.000\nThere was an amazing show like many many many years ago.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:40.000\nThere was all the the the indie comics like mostly San Francisco people.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nIt was called Hacks Hacks Hacks.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:52.000\nAnd they all everyone came up and did their favorite hack style of comedy like Dave Anthony came out as the as the as the fat comic who only talked about fatty was like he stuffed his shirt.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nHis name was Joey sandwiches.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:59.000\nAnd the immortal and wonderful and passed away sadly.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:02.000\nWarren Thomas is one of the greatest comics of all time.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:06.000\nHe did the hack death comedy jam comic and it was fucking magical.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:10.000\nAnd Andy kindler did the most abstruse one and I think it stole the whole show.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:14.000\nHe was the the the logic comic like the comics to do.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nAnd I won't say names.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:16.000\nThere's people that still do this.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nIt's my least favorite kind of stand up work.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nThere's a guy.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:21.000\nThere's a woman.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:29.000\nIt lives on my block and every time I get in my car and she's she smells like piss and she knocks on my window and I say to her mom.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:32.000\nThat kind of thing when they turn the tables kind of at the end.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:37.000\nSo he would he had fake he had like Janeane Garofalo in the audience like planted as a heckler.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nYou suck.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nAnd he goes Madam Madam.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:47.000\nI don't come down to where you work and knock the painting off the easel when you're creating a delicate masterpiece.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:50.000\nIt was only for comments.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:54.000\nGod damn it was funny.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:57.000\nThere was a woman lives in my house.\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:07.000\nShe raised my my my siblings and I and she she fed us and she put us through college and one day I said to her mom.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:13.000\nAnd that and that was in the living room.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nOnly for comics.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:18.000\nEverybody was shitting their pants.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:19.000\nI worship Andy kindler.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:20.000\nWe have to have him on the show.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:21.000\nYeah.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nYeah.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nWe'll have a month.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:30.000\nHe's also always he's on Twitter and he's you wouldn't think this about him but not an atheist like and he's always getting yelled at by atheists.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:40.000\nAnd so sometimes I'll like I'll like I'll like jump in like because he's getting like he's like he's like getting drawn into some like like like a weird thing with like atheist kids who are like you're smart.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:47.000\nYou shouldn't believe in God and all this stuff and like like like I don't know he's getting these dumb fights with dumb people.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:55.000\nAll right.\n\n33:55.000 --> 34:12.000\nRing ting tingling to some sort of exotic animal background.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:19.000\nThat was the first time that guy ever laughed in his life.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:23.000\nHe never he's like Sam the Eagle at work.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:26.000\nHe's like I said do you have those files.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:29.000\nI don't know but I got a dildo and he's like put that away.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nYou're fired.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:36.000\nAnd then he's just like walking around and he's just like no I don't see the humor of this.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:40.000\nThere's a fire hydrant that's painted red white and blue for Fourth of July.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nThat's vandalism.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:56.000\nI'm calling the police and then he came here tonight and it was something about the frequencies.\n\n34:56.000 --> 35:04.000\nAnd now he's going to go home and like rip off his tie and dump Angelica Houston who's playing his wife.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:09.000\nWhose father owns his company so it's OK.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:24.000\nI mean a male hero in a movie to like lead to like be free and like leave is like like wife is always has to be like her father owns the company so that he's not like a bad bad guy.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:28.000\nAnd by the way we're not shaming that laugh we're celebrating how awesome that was.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:35.000\nOf course I mean I everyone should laugh that that that heartily careful.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:38.000\nWe used to think rules were that simple.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:43.000\nIf we find out someone's doing a fake laugh in here that's just I mean what about that one guy.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:44.000\nWhere is he.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.000\nThat wasn't a fake.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:46.000\nRight there.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nYou said you said the fake laugh.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nNo no I'm saying it's not fake.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:55.000\nHis true laugh like one week was like the bane of everyone's.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:58.000\nHe got he got a little too high and he was just like a laugh.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:01.000\nI love people that snort and snortful.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nI like that laugh.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:04.000\nI heard a snort earlier.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:05.000\nSomebody out there does it.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\nWho does it.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:07.000\nWas it you.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:10.000\nNo I wasn't pointing at you.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nWell let's she hasn't been here in a couple weeks.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:13.000\nThat's bringing out my other half.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:14.000\nErin McGathy.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:23.000\nErin McGathy.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:35.720\nThank you for having me. Thanks for wearing my basketball team's t-shirt.\n\n36:35.720 --> 36:43.560\nHow's it going playing basketball? Can you guess our record? We've played three\n\n36:43.560 --> 36:50.720\ngames. You won all the games. I know the record so I won't guess. We are three for\n\n36:50.720 --> 36:59.000\nthree in spirit and in kindness and we have a mascot we're the only team in\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:05.760\nthe league that has a mascot but we have not won a game. Look up Willie Roberts\n\n37:05.760 --> 37:11.800\nhe plays teamwork the unicorn and it's really good. I'm having a difficult time\n\n37:11.800 --> 37:15.680\nbecause you're supposed what could be more supportable than your wife playing a\n\n37:15.680 --> 37:21.560\nlocal sports league. How many games have you been to Dan? I haven't been to any of\n\n37:21.560 --> 37:27.600\nthem but she comes home from practice and it's like so not only am I not\n\n37:27.600 --> 37:31.840\nI'm not supportive enough but now she's coming in like sweating and the headband\n\n37:31.840 --> 37:37.040\nand the shoes. I punch a wall when I walk in. And then it's like as always you\n\n37:37.040 --> 37:39.880\nknow there's a couple Minecraft jokes because I'm always playing Minecraft so\n\n37:39.880 --> 37:43.080\nit's like well now you have to step back and look at yourself you're just a\n\n37:43.080 --> 37:50.800\nchock. I don't know if that's fair. You're not just like the wife laying\n\n37:50.800 --> 37:56.240\nand wait for me to get you know like like love you you're like this\n\n37:56.240 --> 38:00.240\nlady coming home and going like yeah I got a three-pointer the fuck why don't\n\n38:00.240 --> 38:08.000\nyou pick some more. You're strong enough to hug me. Yeah. You're still sitting there\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:19.640\nplaying that game bro. That game's not gonna get you laid. Is there pussy in that game? Can you craft a pussy?\n\n38:19.640 --> 38:34.520\nI mean I believe I said can you craft a deck but it's fine. I didn't mention\n\n38:34.520 --> 38:40.120\nyou were talking about the trash bin cubbies and you explained my\n\n38:40.120 --> 38:46.520\ntheory. My shame and I don't think I mentioned this I saw that sign and I\n\n38:46.520 --> 38:54.160\njust kept it quiet because I was like oh no they're bad people. I'm stubborn and I\n\n38:54.160 --> 38:56.680\ndon't want to lose that argument but I saw that and I was like hopefully you\n\n38:56.680 --> 39:01.320\nnever see that. But obviously those are shitty people. I mean why was it an\n\n39:01.320 --> 39:06.480\nargument? Like these guys are bad guys. Because it has to be aggressive about the\n\n39:06.480 --> 39:14.640\nMinecraft thing. That's what it is. That's what it comes down to. You didn't want to lose an opportunity to say some people craft things in real life.\n\n39:14.640 --> 39:19.760\nAnd then I would have been like yeah these kinds of people. Because I have this\n\n39:19.760 --> 39:30.080\naching womb that wants you to build things merrily. Like in it? I don't know. Or around it.\n\n39:30.080 --> 39:36.840\nI mean I'm joking but I'm joking but I love the reaction that I got. You want him\n\n39:36.840 --> 39:43.720\nto craft maybe a baby? Yeah make a baby in me. Make a crib around me.\n\n39:43.720 --> 39:50.240\nMake a you show me. We're in trouble. I don't think either of us knows what we're\n\n39:50.240 --> 39:57.640\ndoing. I would not let anything I cared about sleep and anything you made in\n\n39:57.640 --> 40:04.160\nreal life. No but I'm saying like we're supposed to build a crib around you.\n\n40:04.160 --> 40:10.440\nWe can't get out to raise our child. I just want to do it. Like I'm excited\n\n40:10.440 --> 40:15.720\nbecause like the door on the back door could be smaller right? To let the\n\n40:15.720 --> 40:24.840\nbaby go out and like. Yeah that's how it'll work. But yeah the leases, basketball,\n\n40:24.840 --> 40:31.480\nTuesdays. What was it? What's the big? Because Kate my ex-girlfriend is on the\n\n40:31.480 --> 40:35.240\nteam. She's great. Her nickname is Squirrel. We all have animal nicknames\n\n40:35.240 --> 40:39.800\nbecause there's a whole mythology about our team. We're from a land of magical\n\n40:39.800 --> 40:48.320\nanimals that lived peacefully for a very long time. Until one day our our core\n\n40:48.320 --> 40:54.080\nanimal this unicorn was kidnapped by a dark force. And we were told we would\n\n40:54.080 --> 40:58.120\nnot get this unicorn back until we could prove that we could live with\n\n40:58.120 --> 41:06.080\ncompassion and sensitivity and teamwork as a women's basketball team.\n\n41:09.480 --> 41:15.440\nThat's true. So there's a lot more at stake for us and so far we will never\n\n41:15.440 --> 41:20.600\nget our unicorn back because we are over 30. And Erica, a perfect cynical tee-up\n\n41:20.600 --> 41:23.800\nfor me to say. It sounds like the other teams were practicing their zones. Well\n\n41:23.800 --> 41:31.240\nliterally the other team is doing that while I had a stump that we were\n\n41:31.240 --> 41:38.440\npassing around and smelling. How many do you do people show up to watch the\n\n41:38.440 --> 41:42.720\ngames? Do you have a lot of followers? Yeah I mean it's hard to say who's a\n\n41:42.720 --> 41:49.480\nsupporter and who's just taking a break from their game. When's your next game?\n\n41:49.480 --> 41:53.880\nWe should all go. You all should go. All of your games are always on Tuesday\n\n41:53.880 --> 41:58.360\nnights right? They're always on Tuesday nights. I will post an Instagram of our\n\n41:58.360 --> 42:03.680\nschedule. Our next game is in North Hollywood and I believe at 9 o'clock\n\n42:03.680 --> 42:09.520\nand we're playing a team that I don't know loves Hitler I can't remember. There are\n\n42:09.520 --> 42:12.720\nsome funny team names. One of them is the Princess Layups. Yeah there's the\n\n42:12.720 --> 42:19.160\nPrincess Layups. That's very good. Yeah there's the cream of dulce babes. There's\n\n42:19.160 --> 42:28.480\nthe badunka dunks. The LA Nail Clippers is very good. They're all amazing\n\n42:28.480 --> 42:31.960\nteam. It's a great it's a it's really it's really fun. It's a really fun thing\n\n42:31.960 --> 42:35.960\nto be a part of like all these all these women who like haven't played sports\n\n42:35.960 --> 42:42.800\nbefore. The free throw-ups. They're all super thin so you should see them.\n\n42:42.800 --> 42:48.880\nI'm doing great except I was I don't know if I\n\n42:48.880 --> 42:52.720\ntold you this I was taken out of most of the game that we played on Tuesday\n\n42:52.720 --> 43:02.440\nbecause I hit a girl on the face twice. Why are you cheering that? The same\n\n43:02.440 --> 43:07.040\ngirl twice. I hit in the face and she was so gracious. Was there a\n\n43:07.040 --> 43:12.240\nsubconscious rage against this girl? No. No it was coincidental. I mean my limbs\n\n43:12.240 --> 43:15.640\nare like I don't know if anybody feels connected to their arms but to me it's\n\n43:15.640 --> 43:24.280\nlike well I tied some kites to my torso and they'll do what they will. So is it\n\n43:24.280 --> 43:30.360\nyou were kicked out for fouling out? My coach my coach who I co-host a podcast\n\n43:30.360 --> 43:35.440\nwith human conversation new podcast so I thought he was we were we recorded a\n\n43:35.440 --> 43:40.840\npodcast earlier in the day Wayne Fetterman and I was a little testy towards\n\n43:40.840 --> 43:45.080\nhim during the podcast so I thought he was taking that out on me because it\n\n43:45.080 --> 43:49.240\nhappened twice where he said to the bench all right everybody in except Aaron\n\n43:49.240 --> 43:54.600\ntwice he said that where I was like wait really? Is it before you started\n\n43:54.600 --> 43:59.600\nassaulting women in the face? No no no this is this is after because he explained\n\n43:59.600 --> 44:03.120\nto me later like no no no they're great at free throws because every time you\n\n44:03.120 --> 44:10.440\nhit somebody there's a consequence. That is a life lesson. Yeah it's not just that\n\n44:10.440 --> 44:15.480\nit hurts them it's that they can parlay it into points. Finally that's how to get\n\n44:15.480 --> 44:20.320\nthrough to you. And I didn't I didn't mean to do it obviously maybe not\n\n44:20.320 --> 44:24.440\nobviously but I didn't mean to do it so he was keeping me out of the game so I\n\n44:24.440 --> 44:30.480\ndidn't ruin the game for us by hitting people. You struck a nerve when you\n\n44:30.480 --> 44:38.880\ntalked about your limbs like and your lack of control over them I just I guys\n\n44:38.880 --> 44:47.680\neverybody just let's all leave. I married this woman that I I just like I I I I\n\n44:47.680 --> 44:57.400\njust... It's gonna be about hand jobs. I know that like like I just like you're so\n\n44:57.400 --> 45:12.240\nlike...

great gift for her would be like a table saw but not like I like I\n\n45:45.200 --> 45:48.800\nsometimes think like like oh I you know there's like that space under the where\n\n45:48.800 --> 45:52.600\nthe firewood is there's a little workshop the guy that used to own the the house\n\n45:52.600 --> 45:56.440\nbefore that he used to make airplanes down there it's like oh Erin can have a\n\n45:56.440 --> 46:01.280\nlittle wood shop or she could make bird feeders but I won't I can't do it I can't\n\n46:01.280 --> 46:05.640\nI can't I just I live in terror that she's even the even the

like was made of snake I think it was\n\n01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:33.440\nPython wow I think that's really a weird new direction for fights to go with a\n\n01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:40.040\nBurger King dude is coming out behind me wait for the actual Burger King I mean\n\n01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:53.440\nno one's the actual Burger King I made it 42 years\n\n01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:01.120\nsorry sweetie that's alright it's I you know on one hand I had I had the magic\n\n01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:07.240\nbut on the other hand I was obeying a lot of laws that didn't make sense a lot\n\n01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.280\nof which were super unfair to women I like that that whole regime is like don't\n\n01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.560\ngive unto a woman the patties that would have more cheese for for a man and\n\n01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.920\nsire the seed under the extra onions it's a lot of cryptic Aramaic shit what\n\n01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.600\nthey the the actual Burger King guy like it was a promotion you know the\n\n01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.320\ncommercial with a guy has the mask on yeah he's in bed with your wife all the\n\n01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.240\nsudden I just never scared everybody's of death and he's got that weird smiling\n\n01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:38.040\nvisage the Burger King character like the modern ironic I had like Jack in a\n\n01:11:38.040 -->

most\n\n01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.440\nuniversally unlikable human beings so Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Kimmel is the coke to\n\n01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.720\nBurger King's Pepsi like he was like on the other side yeah so there's just like\n\n01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.320\ntwo boxers with two corporate sponsors one of which is here's I would like to\n\n01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.000\nlive in this universe because Floyd Floyd Mayweather is notoriously a\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.720\nterrible person well come on he beat his wife give him a break\n\n01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:13.240\ngive him a break it takes a lot of balls I forget he said about some some\n\n01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.800\ncomic I forget it was someone I follow on Twitter who are mostly comedians said\n\n01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.160\nrooting for Floyd Mayweather is like rooting for Rocky if he was fighting\n\n01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:29.440\nAdrian I don't know who wrote that but that was very funny so I would like to\n\n01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.960\nlive in a world where Jimmy Kimmel goes hey many pack you like you came on my\n\n01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.640\nshow on time it'd be pretty funny if I was dressed like Randy MC and come out\n\n01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.200\nbehind you and he was like oh you know get the gold chain because it was right\n\n01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:43.200\nI feel like that was

01:13:01.440\nif everybody understands this I can I can fuck off but but what is the purpose\n\n01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.120\nof this like what is that just like oh punch the other person until they like\n\n01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:11.840\nwhy why was but why was it such a big deal like what was that what is the\n\n01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.680\nbecause it seemed like this was like a big like culturally important normally\n\n01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.600\nwhen boxers are announced they come out and the and they have an entourage with\n\n01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.720\nthem they're they're trained but why are they fighting each other so one is for\n\n01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.600\n180 million other one or like what a hundred million they were they made a\n\n01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.920\nhundred and eighty million dollars to fight a guy that he knew he was just on\n\n01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.880\nthe fight than other stuff he made he made about boxing in general are

totally fuck off but I mean like\n\n01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.240\nthis big fight where I see on Drew Barrymore's Instagram she's like it's\n\n01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:51.600\nfight nine I'm like true what why are we that's I think that's just for these\n\n01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.240\nbig events if you live long enough you'll see that happen every eight years I\n\n01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.560\nthink eight years okay so it's like eight years so what has to happen for this to\n\n01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.360\nbe like these guys are their promoters are both getting very rich or they're\n\n01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.280\nprobably have the same promoters boxers number one and then okay just famous\n\n01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.240\nboxers and they're like oh who do we want to get people to buy tickets\n\n01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.760\nfor how about the two most famous guys we can think of these pay-per-view the\n\n01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.520\nmoney is like beyond anything I'm not even sure why I guess because you can't\n\n01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:25.920\ndo pay-per-view football because in I guess what it is is that the sports\n\n01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.840\nleagues they have this whole tournament thing set up so whereas boxing two guys\n\n01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:36.920\nbeating each other up you can arrange one event I ask us half jokingly does it\n\n01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:43.600\nmake you hard I know I've never wait do you play sports now though I mean it's\n\n01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.320\njust sports no but there's sports and then there's like it's just no but with\n\n01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.600\nlike sports you don't say like ah we got okay we don't have to kill O'Neill as a\n\n01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.600\nperson who doesn't give a shit about any easy question I mean the one the one of\n\n01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:03.640\nthe few that makes sense in big air quotes is like okay let's fucking like\n\n01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:10.080\nwhoa who are we kidding let's say let's stop shooting each other looks the\n\n01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.880\nthe weird way that guys can be mean to each other the whole hierarchy that we\n\n01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.680\nlive under like like the idea of two of them getting into a ring and literally\n\n01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.880\nbeing told one of you leaves the other one doesn't yeah there's padding\n\n01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.520\neverywhere and all this stuff and there's all these rules but it's like like I\n\n01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.720\ndon't watch boxing I don't watch any sports but if I but but like what the\n\n01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.600\nfuck's the difference between that and the football it's like that you just spread\n\n01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.600\nit out into team play and stuff but what do you mean this is what this is what\n\n01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.680\nguys are always thinking that's like I'm gonna punch your face I'm gonna punch\n\n01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.720\nyour face I'm gonna punch your face oh my god Dan you're getting hard right now\n\n01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:56.280\nI can see oh I mean yeah I think I think I think I think I mean I remember\n\n01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.640\nbeing a kid and two kids getting in a fight and it's always like I know it's\n\n01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.160\nalways what's in the air this is like something that has to be paid attention\n\n01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.520\nto though is like like the idea is like everyone's supposed to be scared of\n\n01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.720\ngetting beaten up everyone's supposed to be scared of a like a fist hitting you\n\n01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:17.400\nin the face that's what that's what guys live under it's like oh I'm a maybe\n\n01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.280\nI'll beat you up maybe I'll beat you up like it's always like unspoken and in\n\n01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:35.520\nthe air these fights just feel like Coliseum stuff but I believe less in\n\n01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.960\nthe science when Jimmy Kimmel is wearing a hotdog on his head that's the problem\n\n01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.840\nwith the business of boxing as opposed to the sport of boxing that what we saw\n\n01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:50.760\nlast night was right in its execution was I guess both in a way they're\n\n01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:55.800\nwe saw the we saw the execution of the business of boxing the way that played\n\n01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.720\nout all the way through all the way around but in it those guys actually\n\n01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:03.560\nhad the choreographs sort of what they were doing to make that pay off it was\n\n01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:07.520\nreally really odd how in the sixth or seventh round the announcers all\n\n01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.640\nuniformly started criticizing Pacquiao for not fighting as much as he would\n\n01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.600\nhave even though Mayweather never came out and tried to attack him Mayweather\n\n01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.080\nran away the entire fight that whole thing was really I mean I'll believe\n\n01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:24.560\nwell I don't know I think that in that outcome that they had everybody wins in\n\n01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.840\nother words Pacquiao whether Pacquiao where as we have seen we have seen the\n\n01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.760\nbusiness model fail when somebody comes out and does arguably what the what the\n\n01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.200\ngreatest boxer in the world should do Mike Dyson would just go literally and\n\n01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:43.760\nlike the other guy just goes down and it's over and everyone goes yeah I want\n\n01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:49.600\nmy money back I guess yeah they do yeah they do so I would believe you and then\n\n01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.600\nthis way sort of Mayweather you if you have if Mayweather had lost that fight\n\n01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:57.360\neverybody who hates him which is almost everybody would have pulled him down and\n\n01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.360\nsaid well no he's never gonna be amongst the greatest fighters in the world now\n\n01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.720\nthat question is still in the air because he won that fight if he wins one\n\n01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.400\nmore he says if he wins one more fight he will tie the the greatest record Jake\n\n01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.560\nLamada's record of 49 and 0 and if he does that he's gonna Lamada fight the\n\n01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:14.640\nbest fought some of the best fighters available in the world Mayweather had\n\n01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.680\nnothing to pick from and when he did have somebody to fight and you want to\n\n01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:21.600\nknow why this was so hyped in such a big deal for five to six years Mayweather\n\n01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.720\nrefused to fight him for weird reasons like he opposed not enough burger came\n\n01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.800\nopposed he opposed the type of blood testing because he claimed that he was\n\n01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.080\nafraid of having a needle stuck in his arse of weird shit like this he did and\n\n01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.920\nhe made every excuse he could to avoid fighting Pacquiao until now when they're\n\n01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.880\nboth five years past the time when they should have one thing's for sure I went\n\n01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:44.440\nout you asked like does it get you hard what it does is it creates a sea of\n\n01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.600\nviolence and there's some statistic of the amount of domestic violence that\n\n01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:53.240\nhappens after major boxing bouts and Super Bowls and stuff yeah I went out\n\n01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.720\nafterwards to the drawing room and it was just there was just a general free\n\n01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:03.480\nsong of just violence in the air not like there was fight starting but\n\n01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.880\neverybody was talking about when I was a kid I'm fucking boom like I got a\n\n01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.720\nbuck I everyone's telling stories I would fucking boom um is that what you\n\n01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.320\nsaid I don't I just said a bunch of gibberish in a row yeah but I like that\n\n01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.320\nI would fucking boom them but there was a I it's like I gotta get out of here\n\n01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:26.400\nbecause it was just generally like kind of a weird like hostile testosterone I'm\n\n01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:33.880\nprobably wrong but I feel like I could I could beat Floyd Murray whether I mean\n\n01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:39.600\nI let's let's all get on the same page I obviously all organized sports\n\n01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:46.360\nespecially including gladiatorial combat between two guys who undoubtedly would\n\n01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:51.280\ninspire in a normal world like everyone else's like fealty behind like a\n\n01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.520\npossibly subversive army like like all of this shit is exercises in pacifying\n\n01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:05.000\njingoism you you get the people that you hear in bars that are just like like\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.480\nthose guys that's all White House burning energy just going down the drain\n\n01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:18.200\ndown the drain into fucking Toys R Us just down into diaper diaper funds\n\n01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:25.360\nall those guys are like biologically meant to be the guys carrying the\n\n01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.320\nspears at the fronts of like armies that are still settling who gets to sow\n\n01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.200\ntheir seed across the planet now we have this empire where we're all sitting\n\n01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.440\nor sucking on pacifiers how are we gonna keep these people from from like\n\n01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:47.840\ngoing like look I'm not smart I don't get Mr. Show fuck this I've never seen\n\n01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:53.720\nbetter off dead I look like like like those guys are fucking either in\n\n01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.840\nprison or they're or they're working on Wall Street and you give them the\n\n01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.880\noccasional basketball game so that they can pound the table and the hot wings\n\n01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.600\ncan fly in the air only energy that they'd otherwise used to maybe storm the\n\n01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.640\ncastle or just be like hanging out in an alley what else would they do with that\n\n01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:15.280\nenergy politically they have nothing to do but like conspire it's like you\n\n01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.960\norganize sports especially when it's two fucking hulking dudes who are like like\n\n01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.840\nwhat's what do you what do you respect more than a guy that can beat up another\n\n01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.640\nguy and then to turn them into property to turn them into the lowest of the low\n\n01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.320\nwhile shining the spotlight on them and collecting money that scatters to the\n\n01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.960\nfloor around them as their blood flows they're beating each other and they're\n\n01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:42.440\nfucking like they live you're getting me hard then I don't want to belittle the\n\n01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.280\nart of beating the shit out of anybody but what you said I mean I know I mean\n\n01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.080\nlike I think it's like you're asking like like like well like I don't know I\n\n01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:54.320\nguess I know your part of me wanted you to know yeah I know this is fucking\n\n01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:58.280\nstupid no but like I understand I'm not I'm not saying I don't understand like\n\n01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:03.600\nthe art of I mean it doesn't matter but I I took boxing for a while a lot of you\n\n01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:10.680\ndon't know see my instructor is

sport is important\n\n01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.960\nwhat I was wondering was why this fight in particular was important and to more\n\n01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:47.400\nto explain every every every decade there's like a pay-per-view event like\n\n01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.960\nyeah that's that's what it is whatever Jew Barrymore does always yeah always\n\n01:22:52.960 -->

play some shadow run\n\n01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:44.800\neverybody okay I you saw a splendid moment from our audience speaking of\n\n01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.120\nsport there's a guy wearing a Mets shirt here and not not you Dave Kline\n\n01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:54.920\nthere's a guy wearing a Mets shirt what's your name Tim he's wearing a Mets shirt\n\n01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.000\nand we said do you want to play some shadow run and he put both fists in the\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.840\nair yes like that's our sports right that's a shadow run is ours is our is\n\n01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:13.240\nour gladiatorial arena yeah but I would argue that we're better than athletic\n\n01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:21.160\npeople I think that but isn't the whole point of playing like a like a role\n\n01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.520\nplaying game that you get in this fake combat is kind of exercising that same\n\n01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:29.200\nthe same we should all present pretend that we have either a Jimmy Kimmel or a\n\n01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:34.320\nBurger King man behind us I've got Bieber behind me all the way just in\n\n01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.040\nBieber I have just like a really big flashlight behind me that's what I'm\n\n01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:44.240\nimagining I'm really disappointed in the Burger King for backing Mayweather\n\n01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:51.600\nthat's fucked up like I thought a lot better of him man well seriously I\n\n01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:58.080\nthink here's only about spectacle yeah spectacle is money it's true there\n\n01:26:58.080 -->

like\n\n01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:09.960\nwell I should have seen that fight that should have been that should have been\n\n01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.040\nan undercard like whoever they did like the other like lesser fighters were\n\n01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.760\nbefore that the main event there should have been a guy dressed up like Ronald\n\n01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.440\nMcDonald the guy

--> 01:30:12.680\nfighter named layman Brewster who was a heavyweight champion for like defended\n\n01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.960\nit like two or three times I went there one time with Sam and watched them train\n\n01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:20.000\nFreddy's there and it was like Francois Botha who's like I think was called the\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.400\nwhite buffalo I remember him he was in the ring training and the sound they\n\n01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.520\nmade when they're just sparring the guy would block a punch and they hit each\n\n01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:31.280\nother in the arms and these guys were they were like fucking 250 pounds are\n\n01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.240\nlifting each other up off the ground and moving them a foot and the sound it\n\n01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.320\nmakes it so horrifying and Freddie Roach his younger brother who had just got\n\n01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.600\nout of jail I believe he was like he's like Jeff get in the ring put some gloves\n\n01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:45.280\non go in there go in there get in there like to steal Chris Rock's joke I said\n\n01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:53.200\nif I get in that ring down 9-1 fucking horrifying like it's really the god damn\n\n01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:57.760\nand I'm gonna derail things now the the Mike Tyson documentary did you watch it\n\n01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:01.640\nyeah I as with the Frank Snatcher documentary it's again it's like okay\n\n01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:07.520\nwait I'm not gonna say this like Mike Tyson like like he hit women and like\n\n01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:28.600\na terrible guy too but however but the other the insane personal side of like\n\n01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:34.720\nof like like like I don't know just like like the the the just listening to him\n\n01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.800\ntalk so like he's in a documentary so there's always that point where someone\n\n01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.640\ncries if it's a good documentary the book is like early on it's like and then\n\n01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:48.040\nas I that was that point and then the first guy beat the shit out he's like\n\n01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:51.560\nstarted crying because it was like he he didn't like he didn't want to ever beat\n\n01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:56.160\nthe shit out of anyone but like fucking did nobody did that's it all feel it all\n\n01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:00.080\nfeel so tragic and no one beats their wives because they're an adjusted great\n\n01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.720\nperson but he had like this he had like this mentor who was like discipline of\n\n01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.720\nstuff I don't know it was like it was just like you're watching the documentary\n\n01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.120\nyou go god damn it can you just can you just not hit women so that everyone can\n\n01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:15.600\nlike recognize you as this amazing hero because it's like you can't stop this\n\n01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:19.360\nlike bells ringing by the way everyone have Sean penny tight Madonna to a\n\n01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.560\nchair and fucking torture her for two days like fuck you\n\n01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:31.840\nbut it's not it's not just it's not just the fucking barbarians that sorry\n\n01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:35.480\nwe're gonna play shadow run but then this happened that's the thing that's\n\n01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:39.760\nawful about it because there is a sport behind boxing obviously it's a sport\n\n01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:46.080\nand it's it's it's a very sophisticated thing but also the people that are in it\n\n01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.920\ndon't tend to be the most adjusted non-abusey type people yeah where are you\n\n01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:55.320\ngonna pull them from Harvard happen to them there's a reason why they hit\n\n01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.720\npeople so hard it's pretty amazing when you can pull someone from out of the\n\n01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.600\nout of that environment and discipline them enough to because like it just it\n\n01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:08.240\nseems like there's so many rules to beating the shit out of another man who\n\n01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:13.960\nwho has also learned how to beat the shit out of another man like that you have\n\n01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:18.160\nto like you wouldn't you wouldn't imagine any of these people getting into the\n\n01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:24.160\nring as being people who were capable of like like showing up at 6 a.m. for like a\n\n01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:28.240\npractice or something but obviously they have more discipline than than anybody\n\n01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.840\nwhich is like man I've never worked hard for anything like I always imagine the\n\n01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:37.800\nguys that beat people up as being the laziest people in the world but but some\n\n01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:41.720\npeople hang on a second you know I'm trying to remember his name now that he\n\n01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:48.920\nwas the world heavyweight champion in the in the 20s where works hard McGinnon\n\n01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:54.560\nhang on this guy arrow punch and stuff this guy I don't remember his name I\n\n01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:58.160\nalways blank on his name but he was an interesting guy he was the world heavyweight\n\n01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.560\nchampion and he was a Shakespearean scholar at the same time he was somebody\n\n01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.880\nwho I have a book at home which is a collection of the complete works of\n\n01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:15.400\nShakespeare and it was signed
