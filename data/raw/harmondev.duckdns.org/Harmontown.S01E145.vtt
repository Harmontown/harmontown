00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Did I hear a youp?

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
Please tell me I heard a youp.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
From Hollywood, California.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Seltdown Comics Harvest Town.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
And now, look at that.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
And I can't be but you.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Thank you.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Don't know how to smile.

00:49.000 --> 01:09.000
So there is a neighbor on my block who has a beautiful like varnished wood enclosure for their garbage cans with like little special locks on it.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
And it's like all like beautifully like it's like this beautiful wood thing.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
And I get a bad feeling about that.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I feel like you're probably a bad person.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Like I don't know.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Something tells me you're a bad person.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
And this is where he keeps his garbage containers before he allows them to be put out in the street.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
No, no, no.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
This is when they're on the well like off the just off the curb.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
There's this big like garbage can hutch.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
You know, some people do this.

01:42.000 --> 01:53.000
Like I don't, you know, and so I walk past it and I go, you know, maybe he maybe his big fear is homeless people benefiting.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
I don't know.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Or raccoons or something.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Or Aaron who can see the brighter side of some things.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Like I was walking past it with her and I said something shitty about it.

02:02.000 --> 02:11.000
And she says like, well, maybe the dad of that family like loves his kids and wanted to show him like woodworking or something.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
It's always everything Aaron says to me is always like a subtle bar about how much Minecraft I'm playing.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
I don't even know if she thinks about it.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Those donuts look good.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, they look real.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
They're not made of pixels.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
They're probably great.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
She doesn't even know she's doing it anymore.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
But anyway, so and I was chasing by that.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I was like, you know what?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
She's right.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Why am I so toxic?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Who knows what the backstory is?

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
This could be this could be that could be a cancer bin like like a cancer project of some kind.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
If someone could have cancer and they made it for out of their cancer.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I don't know.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
No idea.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
There could be a movie about it was starring Will Smith called like three garbage cans.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
You know, the tagline is like there's a there's a bin for your recycling.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
There's a bin for your compost.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
There's no bin for where you go when when you got no hope.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Do you have a working title for that movie?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
That's three.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
It's three bins.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I don't know.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
It doesn't matter.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
It's so so.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
But I haven't told Aaron this yet.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
I am right and she is wrong because I was walking past it again today.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
So here's the wooden enclosure with the bins in it.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
So and then like the whole thing is like,

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
Hang on, describe this for me is that it's the whole thing closed off to the street or is it open that a trash truck can come in with a little robotic arm?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Okay, so their relationship with the city.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
I don't know how this works because I don't know if the person like goes out there at the beginning of the day with like a key and like have at it fellas.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
I have no idea.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Do they do they take them out on trash day?

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Let's assume that let's assume this is a pretty orderly person.

03:55.000 --> 04:04.000
I'm not. It would be ridiculous to put that much effort and aesthetic like appeal into something that was that was also just an obstruction like a civic disobedience.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
That's the case.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
That might just be an aesthetic thing where they don't want their facade of their home to be sullied by.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Like I've already given this person the benefit of the doubt.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
They might have cancer.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes, obviously they thought it looked good.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
If only there was a way to find out if they were a douchebag.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
If only there was some other dot that where you could draw a line.

04:31.000 --> 04:41.000
We learn in geometry that a single point in space could be the center of anything but it's not until there's another dot there that you can go douchebag.

04:41.000 --> 04:56.000
What is three feet from their wooden garbage cubby in their sea of zen gravel that is different from everyone else who just has Los Angeles distributed grass?

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
A little, this is where I wish in the future we'll have, I could be like Johnny Carson, I could throw up a feed.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
I took a photo but we'd be excluding you guys and only including these assholes who pay money for feed.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
But they pay twice as much as you do each week, you guys pay $5 a month.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Can we not put a photo in after we're done tonight and put this in for us?

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I'll try to remember to put it on my Instagram or something but I'm just going to describe it to you.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
So it's like this little decoration, it's a little two-dimensional decoration that was store bought.

05:31.000 --> 05:43.000
Like it's plastic and it's an image about this big, I'm holding up my hands, it's eight inches, at least I hope.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
I hope that's what eight inches is.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Tired of worrying about it.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't know if my first hand is at the base or at the taint but it's fucking about eight inches.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
I can't stand it anymore, I'm 42, I give up.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
What was your ideal penis length be if I was a genie in a line?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
This is not the time for that.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Eight inches, everyone says eight inches, I don't know what eight inches is, I don't know what that means.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
I don't know if mine's four inches, I don't know if it's two, I don't know if it's...

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
I know it's not ten.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
Okay, so back to the story.

06:28.000 --> 06:44.000
So it's this small little plastic, two-dimensional, it's just a flat thing, it's not a sculpture, it's like a plastic, almost like a day glow plastic.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Like if it was nighttime you might imagine that it would glow in the dark.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
I probably wouldn't but I'm saying imagine that kind of plastic, something glow in the dark frisbee would be made out of.

06:53.000 --> 07:06.000
So it's just cheap plastic but bought in some store and it's an outline of a dog squatting to poop.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
And underneath the dog squatting and it's got a little post so you can stick it somewhere.

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
So this was made by some asshole and put on a rack for assholes at an asshole store.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
And this asshole bought it and it's designed to do this, to stick in an area.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
And so it's a dog pooping and underneath the dog it says, no!

07:31.000 --> 07:41.000
Translation, yes, the city of Los Angeles has seen fit to gather together and implement leash laws and doggy-do laws.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
So what's good for the goose is not good for the gander.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
My area outside my home is so fucking special that in spite of the fact that you have to walk around with a pile of plastic bags

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
and that if you don't have your dog on a leash the police can come and yell at you and give you a ticket.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
We have seen to this as a state and city of animal lovers.

07:59.000 --> 08:08.000
But in spite of all of that, this person would like you, if your dog decides to start relieving itself near their beautiful home,

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
you just yank that little fucker down to the next fuckface's house and let him shit in the inferior person's lawn.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Because they don't want shit ever touching their zen gravel.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
No! Not here!

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Because there's not signs everywhere.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
We don't live in a world where there's no laws so you have to put a sign if you don't.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Oh, I'm sorry, do you not like dog shit? We love it! We love it! We all love dog shit!

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
So we love dog shit?

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
I love dog shit is what you're saying to me.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
By exclusion, I have a sign over my head with a dog shitting on it that says yes!

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I love dog shit!

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
It's your special because your garbage is in a fucking log cabin.

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
You can't wait to get enough money to get in a helicopter and get the fuck away from who!

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
You're gonna live with giraffes? They shit everywhere!

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
You live in King's Landing! This is as sophisticated as it gets, motherfucker!

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
Your garbage is on the curb! There's dog poop everywhere!

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
For the five seconds before the owner is legally compelled to scoop it up into a fucking hot bag

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
and put it into their silk line pocket.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Jerry Brackheimer has to clean up as his assistant probably does.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
We are conscientious about this.

09:44.000 --> 09:51.000
Can we ask our very talented and creative Harmontown audience to make you an equal plastic sign

09:51.000 --> 09:59.000
where a picture of you and Aaron with a dog pooping into your mouth and says yes!

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
I just want to make one that says maybe!

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
You never know!

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Because the alternative is I'm gonna scar my dog's memory.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Dogs only do three things.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
We just finished successfully Aaron, just successfully potting training our new grief dog.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
It's a really hard process and you're so excited the day your dog,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
this little puppy goes out the doggy door and he goes, you watch him and he's like,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
there he goes, there he goes, it's a big boy!

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
He knows to make it outside.

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
The idea that I'd be taking a walk with my dog and he would stop in that forbidden zone

10:40.000 --> 10:47.000
and that I would be like, well, that this person would have me feel bad that my dog chose there

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
instead of eight feet away.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
What a bad person.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
They made that garbage hutch for bad reasons.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
They probably, I'll tell you, now I'm comfortable saying because of that little dog sign,

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
the reason for the garbage hutch is because they see the skexie that come and pick through the garbage.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
They don't like those people.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
What's that guy doing down there?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
That guy's trying not to panhandle.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
That guy's picking through your shit and pulling out aluminum cans from,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
and they're like, I don't know, what's he doing down there?

11:20.000 --> 11:29.000
Let's build a force field around our garbage!

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
Protect the garbage!

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Protect the garbage!

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
They're going to get the garbage!

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I told you, remember my neighbor?

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
We called him Ethnics because he actually turned out to be kind of a fun guy.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
It was Ethnics with an X at the end.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
We decided it was Ethnics.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm sure I've told this story, but he would...

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
We haven't talked about Ethnics in a good long time.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
I had a light bulb outside my apartment door and it was always off.

12:03.000 --> 12:12.000
I was like, what the fuck's with the light bulb?

12:12.000 --> 12:25.000
I unscrew it at night because when the light is on, the children next door play.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
I'm not making that up.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
He said, when the light is on, the children play.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
I like to steal the sunlight.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Because sunlight brings the children joy.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
He was called Ethnics because he referred to the people that weren't white in the neighborhood as the Ethnics.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
But he was kind of Ethnic himself, no?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
He was certainly like...

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
He had some swath to it.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
If whiteness was his idol, he was a naughty boy.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
That brings the racist out in me.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
When racist people are proud of their race, I'm like, well, you know.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Okay.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
Alright, buddy.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Anyways, I was trying to turn on my thing.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I got really fired up about that.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
All I wrote was a doggie nose sign.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I didn't know it was that mad.

13:28.000 --> 13:35.000
I would love to go, and I also hate to go, inside their home because you know there would be lots of rules.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Man.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
There would be lots of post-it notes for the housekeeper and stuff like that.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Have you been to passiveaggressivenotes.com?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Is that still a thing, passiveaggressivenotes?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I like the sound of it.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
It's a total rabbit hole.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Because it's just...

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
Every time at the office or an apartment building, people that leave...

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
I've been one of these people, I think we all have as part of the appeal of it.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
This grody part of you that at one time in your life, at some point you've left a weird long note to strangers.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Or a roommate.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
And you're just in a weird time in your life where you haven't learned shame yet, are you?

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Sometimes you just see these notes.

14:18.000 --> 14:26.000
When you remove the clothes from the dryer, make sure the lint trap is clean, and we don't have your lint getting into our lint.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It's just like this diatribe?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And it's just so much intensity.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I got a note on my car one time.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
It wasn't my best parking job of all time, but it was the best I could do.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
I'm a firm believer that I'll get out of my car and look, and if I can use less space, I'll back it up to the very edge of the curb.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I use all the space I can.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
One time I did, and I got a note that was clearly a copy.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
This person had a stack of those notes.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
It was a form letter to a gentleman or a madam.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
That person just goes around doing that.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And I kind of dig it.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
I want better parking.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
I want people to use the space, but also don't have a fucking glove box full of...

15:12.000 --> 15:23.000
The idea that what's standing between you and happiness is other people is something that all of the assholes that never have to interact with you because they paid enough money to not have to,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
they're laughing all the way to the bank.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Well, you and I are sitting there going like,

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
um, could you please put your glove shoe where the right shoe goes because otherwise the thing won't go across the divider and it's very irritating.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
They've got us trained to police ourselves.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I have a guy, I don't know where he lives.

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
I do know that about two years ago, maybe more, I just kept hearing, it's strange hours of the night and the day,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
distant clarinet noodling.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
I thought, okay, somebody's got a clarinet.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
They're learning.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Maybe there's a kid taking clarinet lessons.

16:00.000 --> 16:10.000
But it was kind of chlesmary, like kind of fiddler on the roofie.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
And you could never fucking figure it out.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And then you could hear it moving.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Okay, somebody's walking the streets.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
It's fucking 3 a.m.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
I would turn all the lights out and look, but there's not enough street light on my street.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
And I would see a figure, like a Sasquatch going by.

16:28.000 --> 16:35.000
And I could see a huddled, like just a silhouette going by.

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
So now what he's done, he's taken up in a red SUV and he parks on my street every three days,

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
which I take to mean he has other streets he goes to.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
He's scattering that out and spreading it out.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
And I've always heard it and like just all of a sudden there'd be a...

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
And he parks right behind my office window at my place.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
And I heard a jogger come to the street and go,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
here bro, play clarinet a little.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
There was some guy who went to his window.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
A jogger came to his window.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
He just sits in the car and I think my guess is he has a wife or a roommate or something like that.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
He's an older guy with gray hair.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Also the clarinet has awesome, like Stephen Tyler ribbons hanging off it.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Wait, now he's not a silhouette.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
No, no, no, I've caught him in the daylight.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I've seen him in the daylight.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
But I tried to get the phone out and get footage, but he just evaporates.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
He's a mystical being.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
And now he sits across the street from my place and I can see him from my window,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
but there's just enough reflection off the glass today.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I can't get an image of him.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
What if it turned out to be old you?

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
What if you took a picture and it was like there was a reflection

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
and you took it to a detective and he's like,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
enhance, enhance, enhance.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
And it was like fucking you with like long gray hair.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
And the clarinet had like futuristic, like microchips on it or something.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
He's certainly that mythological.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
So I have these new neighbors.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
They're from England.

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
She's like, do you frequently hear clarinet playing or am I going mad?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
I'm like, no, like look across the street in the red SUV.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
It's so good.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
I don't want him to go away, but there's a jogger came up and completely just gave him shit.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I think he lives nearby.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
I think he's pretending.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
This guy was like a jockey kind of guy.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I think he pretended to go jogging.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I think he lives right there.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
And then like went way around and jogged up to him.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
I live way across town, but weird playing clarinet all the time.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I wanted to go shoot that guy.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Yeah.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
I lived in my first one bedroom apartment in Hollywood.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
The guy right next to me was like, I'm not exaggerating.

18:51.000 --> 19:00.000
He was morbidly obese like by the legal definitions because you would have like, there was a van that would come pick him up whenever I had to go eat.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
Or teach physics.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I don't want to get all PJ O'Rourke about it.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
I'm not going to assume he was on the dole.

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
But it seemed to me because for a year I listened to him and he was an amazing voice.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
He was like an opera singer.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
And every once in a while he'd have somebody over that would obviously have fallen for some kind of singing lesson thing.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
So he was like teaching people to sing.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
He was an amazing voice.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
He would sing opera at the top of his lungs.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And I was like, oh, this is like a Robert Altman film.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
There's an opera singer next door to me.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
I would tune it out and every once in a while he would yell at the handicapped van because they were late.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
He had this rage-a-haulism thing.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
He was not a perfect guy to live next door.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
But at least let's say a year went by that I lived in that place.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I was like, oh, that guy does that.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
He was singing like South Pacific and stuff.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
He'd just hear weird snatches of South Pacific or West Side Story or something.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
A really good voice. I think it might have been different if he wasn't like a good singer.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
And then one day just like from upstairs in the six-unit building and just like after like 20 minutes of him.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
After a year of this and then like all of a sudden upstairs you just hear, all right?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Shut up, you fat bastard!

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
It was like it was a Scottish guy which distracts you because it's the Mike Myers reference.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
But I remember the guys on the fat bastard and he had a Scottish accent and lived upstairs.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
And then the guy just immediately went silent and I never heard him again.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And I was like, yeah.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
It was like, well, he is a fat bastard and I guess he's, but like, so here's my, I just want to say this about that.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
So like, okay, so like, you live in an apartment building.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
It's like, guess what? You live with other people.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
They clomp, clomp, clomp on the Tuesday night she does this and the Wednesday night he vacuums.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
And this guy is a serial killer or this guy sniffs your laundry.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
It's like, it's called living with other people.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
It's like, it's a thing that they have done to us as part of a class system.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
When you're poor you share property with other people that you don't even own.

21:17.000 --> 21:25.000
So what would be a really dangerous thing to happen in that case is everybody getting along.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
But they call them apartments.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Think about it.

21:31.000 --> 21:40.000
And everyone just sits there for 30 years of their life going, like trying to act like their goal is to turn their life into like, like Hugh Hefner's life.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Even though they're still living in a fucking building that they share with a bunch of poor people.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
It's like, because we're so trained to hate each other for being poor.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
So we go like, what do you do?

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
You know, when you put your chalk up bars on the thing or something like this is your neighbor.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
This is like your closer person than your family.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Like you, like buy a house motherfucker.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Like, which is what we all want to do.

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
We all can't wait to like get behind some big gate with a heart to heart logo on it and just like sit up there and fucking like.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
And that's when you go insane and you end up like abducting women and keeping them prisoner and like.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Building cedar enclosures for your trash cans.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
The truth is that this is life.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I mean the guy that's stomping above you, that's it.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
This is as much, that's it.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
This is your family. This is your life.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
All right.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
But I'm not saying you have to love it.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
I'm just saying like by the time you don't have it anymore, you're going to be powerless against it.

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
You're going to be powerless against anything that actually makes you unhappy, which is the fucking landlord who's collecting your rent.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
He lives by himself.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
All right.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
I just wanted to make one point.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
This is the special get off my lawn episode of Harmontown.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
Aaron and I were talking about dicks on the way over here and because there's a guy in England who's drawing dicks next to potholes.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
And then they're calling him wanksy because and then.

22:58.000 --> 23:06.000
But then the potholes get filled because in England, like, I guess, like a penis on the street is like, they're like, oh, they fill up the pothole.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
So like in England that works.

23:07.000 --> 23:15.000
I don't know if it will work in LA, but and I was saying like, well, in LA, you'd probably have to at least, at least it would have to be like a swastika made of dicks.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Or vice versa.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
And Aaron said, why don't you ever see a swastika made of dicks?

23:22.000 --> 23:33.000
And I said, I guess because you're usually in two different moods when it really, they really are far removed.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
It's like the doodling and this, you know, anything's a dick.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.000
And then there's that urge to, you know, like assemble the Rhineland and conquer all of humanity.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
You're just never in the same mood at the same time.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Hitler wasn't like, I love dicks.

23:48.000 --> 23:56.000
I'm almost certain if you Google right now swastika made of dicks or dicks made of swastikas or whatever, there's images of that.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Or just dick swastika.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Yes, of course.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
There'll be like 500 of them.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
It was just, I just thought we were both very funny in the car right over here.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
That's all.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
All right.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
So is our friend here?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Did he ever pop by?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Do you have any of our friends here?

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
Well, Curtis said he was coming tonight is why I'm asking.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Okay.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Do we have Curtis in the house?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
No, Curtis.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Sorry, everybody.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
He usually pops by around nine.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
All right.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Delights deferred.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Okay.

24:27.000 --> 24:36.000
Well, I'm wearing my colors for my wife's basketball team tonight.

24:36.000 --> 24:43.000
The Lee says, which is designed by where is Oh, Hannah is not the she's usually she's in the front row.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
Hannah, Hannah Nance are longtime Armenian and brilliant graphic designer design these shirts.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
And she's also doing the illustration for Emily Gordon's book.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
So I'm just putting a string around my finger.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
We should have Emily Gordon on the show.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
We should.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
We are wasting like somebody that should have been on the show a long time ago.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I think she'd be fast.

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
I think she's almost a victim of like how close she is to the because it was literally her idea for me to do the podcast.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
Like, like she she suggested it.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
It's like so whenever I see her in the email, she's always just going like, do you have any names for the guest list that I just like think of?

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
But I'm never thinking like, Oh, Emily Gordon would be an amazing.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Why don't we just say next week?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Let's have her on.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
We're going to be in Portland, right?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
I think next week we're in Portland.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Maybe she will be too.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
We'll see.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Well, Steve Levy, are you here?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Put it on.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Put Emily Gordon on your list.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
Put put Andy kindler on your list.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
PJ or work.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
I'm going to start doing like a regular podcast having Steve Levy.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Andy kindler.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I fucking love and Andy kindler is a funny.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Who knows Andy kindler.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Holy fuck.

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
I I've one of the funniest days of my life because that guy's so bloody fucking funny.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
I said he for some reason he likes the Lakers or used to.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
I sat next to him at his girlfriend's apartment up in the valley like many, many years ago.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
And he what I watched him watch a Laker game and it was the funniest thing I've ever seen

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
in my life because he's a stand up comic who's just giving the Lakers shit.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
He's tremendously funny.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
He's a he's a he's a he's a he's an LA treasure as funnier than any.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
And if you see him do stand up, he's like he's I saw him do show in time.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
He was going to what's the aspen work.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
The big thing there were the comics going like I guess was aspen, right?

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
In the old days when there was a thing called a holding deals and development deals for actors.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
That's all gone away unless you're like Steve Buscemi or bigger.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
Like they used to give like up and coming comics, you know, $500,000 to go.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Don't go to ABC.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
You you work for CBS and we're going to put you on a show.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And if we don't, you still get half a million dollars.

26:44.000 --> 26:51.000
So the big back when every comic was getting shows like your Ray Romano's and Drew Carey's and stuff like that.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
And then way after that, there was he was doing a show at Igby's, which is a comedy club.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
I think that's gone now on the west side.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
And they told him, do your set.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Do not riff.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Do not go off script.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
Just it's all the top brass, all the big companies and networks are going to be at your show.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And you're going to go to ask me just do your thing.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
And he made a reference that someone goes like, what's that?

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Someone just yelled out what like didn't get the reference.

27:17.000 --> 27:24.000
And he never got back to his material and absolutely crucified the entire audience.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
Because they were west side tight asses and didn't fucking dig it and right wing and he fucking just laid it on him.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
And then he goes like, forget momentum.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Forget my forget forward progress.

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
Madam, anytime you don't understand anything I say, please or anybody just just just just just pipe in and ask me what that means.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I'd hate to see you at a Dennis Miller concert.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
And then he did 40 minutes on he hates Dennis Miller.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
And the crowd was it was abject silence, except for the seven comics in the back of the room.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
We're losing our minds.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
I mean, he's really, you know, you hear the phrase comics, comic.

27:59.000 --> 28:06.000
I mean, he really is like, like, like for somehow I don't know if you'd be offended by by me saying this.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
He jokes about it all the time.

28:07.000 --> 28:14.000
But like, like, I think it's notable about his career that I put heavy air quotes around the word success.

28:14.000 --> 28:22.000
Very heavy air quotes, because that's the point of his existence that's proven out is like, but you would say at a glance, success eludes him.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Like, like, like as in he hasn't had a shitty sitcom yet.

28:25.000 --> 28:32.000
He hasn't he hasn't like he hasn't embarrassed himself grappling for an attempt to be one of those household names.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
He just I don't know if it's because of that's why I want to talk to him.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I don't know if that's if that's his own choice.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I don't know if he's if he sabotages himself.

28:39.000 --> 28:50.000
I don't know if unconsciously that's nobility or if there's or if it's just happy coincidence that he's I don't know if he's like if it never if that opportunity never comes to him.

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
If Andy had his way, he would be, you know, on TV and in movies get like guaranteed.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
But like, like, he's just he's so funny.

28:59.000 --> 29:05.000
He would do a thing about the just for laughs of Montreal, where he would do a giant giant show called the State of the Industry Address.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
And he would just talk about what's being picked up and what's not.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
And it's fucking.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I just I think there's always this interest.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
I'm always talking about like, I hate this like institutionalized comedy console, but comedy is very popular now.

29:16.000 --> 29:27.000
So it's like, and I'm sorry, I'm going to slit my own throat by saying sometimes when I see ads for Jimmy Fallon with a with a with a with a politician is going to come out and play tug of war with him.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
Like, I'm just like, this isn't this isn't comedy's role in the world.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
This is not what we're supposed to be doing.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
How do I even know what we're doing is funny anymore.

29:34.000 --> 29:44.000
If the idea is hosted by people such as Andy kindler and Jeremy Kramer and Greg Proops and comedy should always be separate from from success.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
It should always be separate from politics.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
It should always be profane.

29:48.000 --> 29:57.000
It should always be the other thing that should because otherwise you cannot guarantee that it's funny and you that as funny as it could be.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
And you cannot like it's I don't know.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
It's like I'm always like ranting about this behind closed doors.

30:03.000 --> 30:13.000
I feel like it's actually like career suicide for me to like, you know, I can't I can't even fully like talk about it because I would say so much shit that it would just people already don't like me.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
But I just like I just think like comedy doesn't have to be dark and it doesn't have to be toxic.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
It doesn't have to be hateful.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
But it has to be it has to be suspicious of authority.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
It has to hate everything that's popular.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
It cannot just come out and say this popular things coming out.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
But what if this popular thing played peekaboo with me peekaboo?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
That can't be comedy.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
That cannot be comedy.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
There's no way that that just doesn't make any sense to me.

30:41.000 --> 30:48.000
And so and I think I feel like Andy kind of represents like the intersection of those roads where you get some investigation done because he is truly funny.

30:48.000 --> 31:01.000
And it seems like the reason all comics love him and like always kind of trust him and fear him and and why he's never able like like he never shoots up and rings the dumbbell.

31:01.000 --> 31:10.000
You know, like at the carnival where it's like Andy kindler in the WB's just talking about daddy's like like it never gets to that point.

31:10.000 --> 31:19.000
I have a feeling it's because he's too like whether it's it's genetic or unconscious or by choice he's too he's too committed to being funny.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
And it won't allow for that.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Like you couldn't put Bill Hicks in this.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
There's not a drawer that he goes right into like on TV and stuff like that.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
But I oversold him.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
So now I'll come on the show and I'll be like he's just going to yell at you guys for being young.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
That's what I do too.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
There was an amazing show like many many many years ago.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
There was all the the the indie comics like mostly San Francisco people.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
It was called Hacks Hacks Hacks.

31:42.000 --> 31:52.000
And they all everyone came up and did their favorite hack style of comedy like Dave Anthony came out as the as the as the fat comic who only talked about fatty was like he stuffed his shirt.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
His name was Joey sandwiches.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
And the immortal and wonderful and passed away sadly.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Warren Thomas is one of the greatest comics of all time.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
He did the hack death comedy jam comic and it was fucking magical.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
And Andy kindler did the most abstruse one and I think it stole the whole show.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
He was the the the logic comic like the comics to do.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
And I won't say names.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
There's people that still do this.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It's my least favorite kind of stand up work.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
There's a guy.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
There's a woman.

32:21.000 --> 32:29.000
It lives on my block and every time I get in my car and she's she smells like piss and she knocks on my window and I say to her mom.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
That kind of thing when they turn the tables kind of at the end.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
So he would he had fake he had like Janeane Garofalo in the audience like planted as a heckler.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
You suck.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
And he goes Madam Madam.

32:40.000 --> 32:47.000
I don't come down to where you work and knock the painting off the easel when you're creating a delicate masterpiece.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
It was only for comments.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
God damn it was funny.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
There was a woman lives in my house.

32:57.000 --> 33:07.000
She raised my my my siblings and I and she she fed us and she put us through college and one day I said to her mom.

33:07.000 --> 33:13.000
And that and that was in the living room.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Only for comics.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Everybody was shitting their pants.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
I worship Andy kindler.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
We have to have him on the show.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Yeah.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
We'll have a month.

33:23.000 --> 33:30.000
He's also always he's on Twitter and he's you wouldn't think this about him but not an atheist like and he's always getting yelled at by atheists.

33:30.000 --> 33:40.000
And so sometimes I'll like I'll like I'll like jump in like because he's getting like he's like he's like getting drawn into some like like like a weird thing with like atheist kids who are like you're smart.

33:40.000 --> 33:47.000
You shouldn't believe in God and all this stuff and like like like I don't know he's getting these dumb fights with dumb people.

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
All right.

33:55.000 --> 34:12.000
Ring ting tingling to some sort of exotic animal background.

34:12.000 --> 34:19.000
That was the first time that guy ever laughed in his life.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
He never he's like Sam the Eagle at work.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
He's like I said do you have those files.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
I don't know but I got a dildo and he's like put that away.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
You're fired.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
And then he's just like walking around and he's just like no I don't see the humor of this.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
There's a fire hydrant that's painted red white and blue for Fourth of July.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
That's vandalism.

34:42.000 --> 34:56.000
I'm calling the police and then he came here tonight and it was something about the frequencies.

34:56.000 --> 35:04.000
And now he's going to go home and like rip off his tie and dump Angelica Houston who's playing his wife.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
Whose father owns his company so it's OK.

35:09.000 --> 35:24.000
I mean a male hero in a movie to like lead to like be free and like leave is like like wife is always has to be like her father owns the company so that he's not like a bad bad guy.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
And by the way we're not shaming that laugh we're celebrating how awesome that was.

35:28.000 --> 35:35.000
Of course I mean I everyone should laugh that that that heartily careful.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
We used to think rules were that simple.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
If we find out someone's doing a fake laugh in here that's just I mean what about that one guy.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Where is he.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
That wasn't a fake.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Right there.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
You said you said the fake laugh.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
No no I'm saying it's not fake.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
His true laugh like one week was like the bane of everyone's.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
He got he got a little too high and he was just like a laugh.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
I love people that snort and snortful.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I like that laugh.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
I heard a snort earlier.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Somebody out there does it.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Who does it.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Was it you.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
No I wasn't pointing at you.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Well let's she hasn't been here in a couple weeks.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
That's bringing out my other half.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Erin McGathy.

36:14.000 --> 36:23.000
Erin McGathy.

36:23.000 --> 36:35.720
Thank you for having me. Thanks for wearing my basketball team's t-shirt.

36:35.720 --> 36:43.560
How's it going playing basketball? Can you guess our record? We've played three

36:43.560 --> 36:50.720
games. You won all the games. I know the record so I won't guess. We are three for

36:50.720 --> 36:59.000
three in spirit and in kindness and we have a mascot we're the only team in

36:59.000 --> 37:05.760
the league that has a mascot but we have not won a game. Look up Willie Roberts

37:05.760 --> 37:11.800
he plays teamwork the unicorn and it's really good. I'm having a difficult time

37:11.800 --> 37:15.680
because you're supposed what could be more supportable than your wife playing a

37:15.680 --> 37:21.560
local sports league. How many games have you been to Dan? I haven't been to any of

37:21.560 --> 37:27.600
them but she comes home from practice and it's like so not only am I not

37:27.600 --> 37:31.840
I'm not supportive enough but now she's coming in like sweating and the headband

37:31.840 --> 37:37.040
and the shoes. I punch a wall when I walk in. And then it's like as always you

37:37.040 --> 37:39.880
know there's a couple Minecraft jokes because I'm always playing Minecraft so

37:39.880 --> 37:43.080
it's like well now you have to step back and look at yourself you're just a

37:43.080 --> 37:50.800
chock. I don't know if that's fair. You're not just like the wife laying

37:50.800 --> 37:56.240
and wait for me to get you know like like love you you're like this

37:56.240 --> 38:00.240
lady coming home and going like yeah I got a three-pointer the fuck why don't

38:00.240 --> 38:08.000
you pick some more. You're strong enough to hug me. Yeah. You're still sitting there

38:08.000 --> 38:19.640
playing that game bro. That game's not gonna get you laid. Is there pussy in that game? Can you craft a pussy?

38:19.640 --> 38:34.520
I mean I believe I said can you craft a deck but it's fine. I didn't mention

38:34.520 --> 38:40.120
you were talking about the trash bin cubbies and you explained my

38:40.120 --> 38:46.520
theory. My shame and I don't think I mentioned this I saw that sign and I

38:46.520 --> 38:54.160
just kept it quiet because I was like oh no they're bad people. I'm stubborn and I

38:54.160 --> 38:56.680
don't want to lose that argument but I saw that and I was like hopefully you

38:56.680 --> 39:01.320
never see that. But obviously those are shitty people. I mean why was it an

39:01.320 --> 39:06.480
argument? Like these guys are bad guys. Because it has to be aggressive about the

39:06.480 --> 39:14.640
Minecraft thing. That's what it is. That's what it comes down to. You didn't want to lose an opportunity to say some people craft things in real life.

39:14.640 --> 39:19.760
And then I would have been like yeah these kinds of people. Because I have this

39:19.760 --> 39:30.080
aching womb that wants you to build things merrily. Like in it? I don't know. Or around it.

39:30.080 --> 39:36.840
I mean I'm joking but I'm joking but I love the reaction that I got. You want him

39:36.840 --> 39:43.720
to craft maybe a baby? Yeah make a baby in me. Make a crib around me.

39:43.720 --> 39:50.240
Make a you show me. We're in trouble. I don't think either of us knows what we're

39:50.240 --> 39:57.640
doing. I would not let anything I cared about sleep and anything you made in

39:57.640 --> 40:04.160
real life. No but I'm saying like we're supposed to build a crib around you.

40:04.160 --> 40:10.440
We can't get out to raise our child. I just want to do it. Like I'm excited

40:10.440 --> 40:15.720
because like the door on the back door could be smaller right? To let the

40:15.720 --> 40:24.840
baby go out and like. Yeah that's how it'll work. But yeah the leases, basketball,

40:24.840 --> 40:31.480
Tuesdays. What was it? What's the big? Because Kate my ex-girlfriend is on the

40:31.480 --> 40:35.240
team. She's great. Her nickname is Squirrel. We all have animal nicknames

40:35.240 --> 40:39.800
because there's a whole mythology about our team. We're from a land of magical

40:39.800 --> 40:48.320
animals that lived peacefully for a very long time. Until one day our our core

40:48.320 --> 40:54.080
animal this unicorn was kidnapped by a dark force. And we were told we would

40:54.080 --> 40:58.120
not get this unicorn back until we could prove that we could live with

40:58.120 --> 41:06.080
compassion and sensitivity and teamwork as a women's basketball team.

41:09.480 --> 41:15.440
That's true. So there's a lot more at stake for us and so far we will never

41:15.440 --> 41:20.600
get our unicorn back because we are over 30. And Erica, a perfect cynical tee-up

41:20.600 --> 41:23.800
for me to say. It sounds like the other teams were practicing their zones. Well

41:23.800 --> 41:31.240
literally the other team is doing that while I had a stump that we were

41:31.240 --> 41:38.440
passing around and smelling. How many do you do people show up to watch the

41:38.440 --> 41:42.720
games? Do you have a lot of followers? Yeah I mean it's hard to say who's a

41:42.720 --> 41:49.480
supporter and who's just taking a break from their game. When's your next game?

41:49.480 --> 41:53.880
We should all go. You all should go. All of your games are always on Tuesday

41:53.880 --> 41:58.360
nights right? They're always on Tuesday nights. I will post an Instagram of our

41:58.360 --> 42:03.680
schedule. Our next game is in North Hollywood and I believe at 9 o'clock

42:03.680 --> 42:09.520
and we're playing a team that I don't know loves Hitler I can't remember. There are

42:09.520 --> 42:12.720
some funny team names. One of them is the Princess Layups. Yeah there's the

42:12.720 --> 42:19.160
Princess Layups. That's very good. Yeah there's the cream of dulce babes. There's

42:19.160 --> 42:28.480
the badunka dunks. The LA Nail Clippers is very good. They're all amazing

42:28.480 --> 42:31.960
team. It's a great it's a it's really it's really fun. It's a really fun thing

42:31.960 --> 42:35.960
to be a part of like all these all these women who like haven't played sports

42:35.960 --> 42:42.800
before. The free throw-ups. They're all super thin so you should see them.

42:42.800 --> 42:48.880
I'm doing great except I was I don't know if I

42:48.880 --> 42:52.720
told you this I was taken out of most of the game that we played on Tuesday

42:52.720 --> 43:02.440
because I hit a girl on the face twice. Why are you cheering that? The same

43:02.440 --> 43:07.040
girl twice. I hit in the face and she was so gracious. Was there a

43:07.040 --> 43:12.240
subconscious rage against this girl? No. No it was coincidental. I mean my limbs

43:12.240 --> 43:15.640
are like I don't know if anybody feels connected to their arms but to me it's

43:15.640 --> 43:24.280
like well I tied some kites to my torso and they'll do what they will. So is it

43:24.280 --> 43:30.360
you were kicked out for fouling out? My coach my coach who I co-host a podcast

43:30.360 --> 43:35.440
with human conversation new podcast so I thought he was we were we recorded a

43:35.440 --> 43:40.840
podcast earlier in the day Wayne Fetterman and I was a little testy towards

43:40.840 --> 43:45.080
him during the podcast so I thought he was taking that out on me because it

43:45.080 --> 43:49.240
happened twice where he said to the bench all right everybody in except Aaron

43:49.240 --> 43:54.600
twice he said that where I was like wait really? Is it before you started

43:54.600 --> 43:59.600
assaulting women in the face? No no no this is this is after because he explained

43:59.600 --> 44:03.120
to me later like no no no they're great at free throws because every time you

44:03.120 --> 44:10.440
hit somebody there's a consequence. That is a life lesson. Yeah it's not just that

44:10.440 --> 44:15.480
it hurts them it's that they can parlay it into points. Finally that's how to get

44:15.480 --> 44:20.320
through to you. And I didn't I didn't mean to do it obviously maybe not

44:20.320 --> 44:24.440
obviously but I didn't mean to do it so he was keeping me out of the game so I

44:24.440 --> 44:30.480
didn't ruin the game for us by hitting people. You struck a nerve when you

44:30.480 --> 44:38.880
talked about your limbs like and your lack of control over them I just I guys

44:38.880 --> 44:47.680
everybody just let's all leave. I married this woman that I I just like I I I I

44:47.680 --> 44:57.400
just... It's gonna be about hand jobs. I know that like like I just like you're so

44:57.400 --> 45:12.240
like... Majestic beautiful graceful. You're so prone to being a magical organic

45:12.240 --> 45:20.400
acts of... What's the word you're looking for Dan? You're you're not allowed to call

45:20.400 --> 45:33.360
women clumsy it's not a... You're like I'm so like I'm so scared like I just

45:33.360 --> 45:38.760
like like because she's really handy and crafty and like loves making things and

45:38.760 --> 45:45.200
like like a great gift for her would be like a table saw but not like I like I

45:45.200 --> 45:48.800
sometimes think like like oh I you know there's like that space under the where

45:48.800 --> 45:52.600
the firewood is there's a little workshop the guy that used to own the the house

45:52.600 --> 45:56.440
before that he used to make airplanes down there it's like oh Erin can have a

45:56.440 --> 46:01.280
little wood shop or she could make bird feeders but I won't I can't do it I can't

46:01.280 --> 46:05.640
I can't I just I live in terror that she's even the even the even the even

46:05.640 --> 46:11.280
the just a regular cabinet door or a just a just a normal day alive like I

46:11.280 --> 46:15.800
just I just live I just I just it's just because I told you about hanging out at

46:15.800 --> 46:19.800
the window to hang the bird feeder it's always it's non-stop you're always like

46:19.800 --> 46:32.000
falling and like like I just like I just so like if I like I if I if I if I if I

46:32.000 --> 46:38.080
just can't I can't say the words out loud it's okay every finger off like I'm

46:38.080 --> 46:46.320
gonna like I'm like I like I I I and I'm not there and then I'm like I kind of

46:46.320 --> 46:56.520
here's the thing every man in my life has had this exact same speech I mean

46:56.520 --> 47:00.960
it's not a joy that makes me feel better you say I mean from my dad to my brother

47:00.960 --> 47:10.600
to ex ex lovers to princes I have heard this speech I do think statistically I

47:10.600 --> 47:16.360
will lose a finger at some point I think like I mean I have to but but hopefully

47:16.360 --> 47:20.440
it won't be until later and when it happens I'll put it on ice and I'll

47:20.440 --> 47:24.200
make it like an afterthought and you'll one day I'll be cutting a cake and you

47:24.200 --> 47:33.960
be like whoa for and I'll say yes I'm about a year ago I was I was making a

47:33.960 --> 47:39.840
bird feeder too quickly no I'll be careful Dan I'll be careful what was the

47:39.840 --> 47:46.400
the scare with a bird feeder oh I I mean the problem is like the combination of

47:46.400 --> 47:57.320
my clutsiness with my impatience and I I thought it wise to hang out of our he

47:57.320 --> 48:06.120
was so upset about that I wanted to hang a bird feeder on a tree that was kind of

48:06.120 --> 48:12.280
near the second-story window and I so it's so I I almost fell out of the window

48:12.280 --> 48:16.480
was the thing I was like holding on to it with like one foot so I could hang a

48:16.480 --> 48:22.080
shit that she tells me about like I'm telling you like like like like shit

48:22.080 --> 48:29.200
when we were first going out like like I was it was like okay like I I'm not this

48:29.200 --> 48:37.080
is the one like I'm not trading it like for anything it's an it like I'm

48:37.080 --> 48:43.920
exhausted but like like you're like you know like you never did it again but

48:43.920 --> 48:47.280
then like there was a time it came home and like the oven was on and I was like

48:47.280 --> 48:51.160
you left the oven on and I I'm like I I just I didn't know that I had this like

48:51.160 --> 48:55.920
thing in me there I'm like oh god she's gonna die she's gonna die but I but I

48:55.920 --> 49:03.680
have like I mean I when I was when I was your age I I was I was like live in my

49:03.680 --> 49:07.840
doors were open windows were open and it was just in a sea of semen and junk mail

49:07.840 --> 49:13.600
and I just I was on the Atkins died so I would like try to charboil burgers one

49:13.600 --> 49:17.560
day I came home I woke up to the smell of burning kitchen and the kitchen wasn't

49:17.560 --> 49:22.440
fire and I put it out and fuck it so if anybody had loved me at that point they'd

49:22.440 --> 49:27.280
be very concerned I promise you'll never find me in a sea of semen and junk

49:27.280 --> 49:36.720
mail don't don't is that a challenge physical challenge physical challenge

49:36.720 --> 50:01.080
so oh hey our friend is here Curtis Armstrong

50:01.080 --> 50:04.240
you're a little you were under the weather last week I was under the

50:04.240 --> 50:11.600
weather nothing would have kept me away other than that I hope that we still

50:11.600 --> 50:15.520
communicate through direct messages on Twitter we haven't graduated you know we

50:15.520 --> 50:21.440
want to take this slowly but I really great about it is I came in here to

50:21.440 --> 50:26.800
publicize one time to publicize King of the Nerds that's why I came here right

50:26.800 --> 50:30.880
initially and then you asked me to come back which I thought was really polite

50:30.880 --> 50:36.400
and and and so I thought I would come back and and then the next thing I knew

50:36.400 --> 50:46.600
it was like I wanted to be here all the time never never leave us Curtis I don't

50:46.600 --> 50:52.160
want to be presumptuous and again overstep the bounds of courtesy or

50:52.160 --> 50:55.840
whatever Dan and I knew each other what do we meet Harmon 94 something like that

50:55.840 --> 51:03.280
at a comedy sports festival in Milwaukee and we must have been two years old and

51:03.280 --> 51:08.440
then you and Schrab and Peter Alberts came to LA and we would threaten to be

51:08.440 --> 51:12.240
friends we would always say we should hang out and we should always talk and

51:12.240 --> 51:14.360
we'd see each other once in a while and we'd always said we're gonna hang out

51:14.360 --> 51:17.320
we're gonna be friends it took us four years or more I mean I don't know it took

51:17.320 --> 51:21.600
a long time let's not let's not only communicate through direct messages on

51:21.600 --> 51:25.400
Twitter no you're right and and it's but I mean it is really a funny thing

51:25.400 --> 51:30.400
because you know I don't want to sound fulsome or anything but the truth is

51:30.400 --> 51:35.320
you've got something which is really nice to come to at the end of a week to

51:35.320 --> 51:39.160
come here and have all these people not a lot of people feel that way so if you

51:39.160 --> 51:44.560
feel that way it's been it's been enjoyable for me so I'm glad to be back

51:44.560 --> 51:49.040
and all that I'm leaving again but I'm where you go back tonight I'm going to

51:49.040 --> 51:52.560

51:59.760 --> 52:08.080
be pissed I just saw still Alice with Julianne more yeah she plays like a

52:08.080 --> 52:12.360
linguistics I know yeah I thought of your daughter I know I know I also thought

52:12.360 --> 52:19.080
of your daughter when I was the phrase thought of your daughter it's cheese you

52:19.080 --> 52:26.360
know but it's like I was gonna ask has she seen that movie at which when I

52:26.360 --> 52:29.800
realized I become my grandmother yeah I don't know what do I get has she took

52:29.800 --> 52:35.520
does she know anybody in that movie yeah all of those yeah the linguistics people

52:35.520 --> 52:39.760
hang out no she hasn't my daughter's studying linguistics that's why we're

52:39.760 --> 52:43.480
talking about that yeah but Julia more has a thing of the first act when she

52:43.480 --> 52:48.600
they're establishing her as a linguist she's giving a speech where she kind of

52:48.600 --> 52:53.160
like covers in a cursory fashion some of that shit that we were talking about

52:53.160 --> 52:55.280
when we first talked about your daughter when I was babbling about

52:55.280 --> 52:58.560
linguistic I know the fact that human beings have like this weird like we

52:58.560 --> 53:02.280
don't we don't we don't speak as a matter of learning it from other people yeah

53:02.280 --> 53:06.760
but but and she touches on that stuff but her character have you guys seen that

53:06.760 --> 53:12.840
movie still house really interesting as it's brutal she saw it there's one

53:12.840 --> 53:21.000
person a plot for enthusiastic like I don't know if I like well whatever

53:21.000 --> 53:25.440
why don't we get it on an alley I mean it's just I mean it's an interesting it's

53:25.440 --> 53:30.280
an interesting thing and and I've I have learned about linguistics as a result of

53:30.280 --> 53:34.240
my daughter I don't even know where she came from I mean this was not where I

53:34.240 --> 53:38.560
thought she was going and then suddenly when a man loves a woman man puts the

53:38.560 --> 53:45.040
penis in the vagina oh yes I know that's that's not linguistics that's

53:45.040 --> 53:52.240
where your daughter came from oh that yes right is your wife do you ever

53:52.240 --> 53:55.480
where has your wife ever had a serious injury you've been with her for all

53:55.480 --> 54:04.240
these she ever had a serious injury like as you ever cut off her finger or a

54:04.240 --> 54:10.840
broken a leg or I don't think so about my health you okay why you have you been

54:10.840 --> 54:17.200
having problems I just got here so I missed I missed what was going on I am

54:17.200 --> 54:22.520
I am naturally clumsy but also tenacious with my handiwork she's very

54:22.520 --> 54:30.280
stubborn and impulsive and she'll decide like I think this hat should be on top

54:30.280 --> 54:38.400
of it that pile of razor blades like it doesn't she never she doesn't like stop

54:38.400 --> 54:42.200
like I thought like like remember when we were in that gay bar and like it was

54:42.200 --> 54:50.080
clear it was so you talking to me yes yes there's this there's this there's

54:50.080 --> 55:01.240
this they don't I have an announcement there was this bar and Hyperion it's close

55:01.240 --> 55:05.960
the act bar I know that place yeah I know that they've got a piano in there and

55:05.960 --> 55:11.240
it's one of those you're talking with the the oh yeah not act bar it was on

55:11.240 --> 55:14.680
Hyperion you should be called the other side which is this great old gay piano

55:14.680 --> 55:19.160
bar now it's called Hyperion public but it was a fantastic place where mostly

55:19.160 --> 55:24.320
like you know like kind of show-fokie gay guys and some women will go in there

55:24.320 --> 55:35.480
and sing show tunes and it's an unrelated satanic

55:35.480 --> 56:01.600
I what do you say I'm so sorry sorry young lady that was horrifying by the

56:01.600 --> 56:09.760
way ma'am can you say can you say pizza with extra pepperoni

56:10.600 --> 56:17.640
oh no where you from I love your accent Switzerland well I'm good and up and I

56:17.640 --> 56:23.960
don't know you say it but I how do you say welcome you're coming

56:23.960 --> 56:34.800
okay say it's been 11 in your most ominous Swiss accent what what would you

56:34.800 --> 56:44.800
call what would you call your accent shitty all right but we were right about

56:44.800 --> 56:51.240
Switzerland right yeah all right so Dan and I are in a gay bar I mean this is

56:51.240 --> 56:55.320
just tea and shit I'm just saying like here's the thing like we're at this like

56:55.320 --> 56:58.680
like like it was a it was a great place it's change ownership now but it was

56:58.680 --> 57:03.320
like it was a great place to drink piano like like you know if you've been in

57:03.320 --> 57:06.160
one of these bars we're like like it's like the gay guys go and they like they

57:06.160 --> 57:12.360
sing it's not karaoke like they got to know their shit they're like competitive

57:12.360 --> 57:15.920
with each other and it's like super supportive and very fun and a lot of

57:15.920 --> 57:18.480
people were really bummed out when it closed down because it was a great place

57:18.480 --> 57:22.560
and it's not a place where you got and I've I've fallen for it like you know

57:22.560 --> 57:26.560
you should go up and sing father figure by George Michael it's like you go up

57:26.560 --> 57:29.640
of like no just like do you have the sheet music I'll pull it up on my phone

57:29.640 --> 57:36.960
and they're like okay do-do-do and I'll be your father figure like yeah sit down

57:36.960 --> 57:42.840
it's not karaoke it's like it's a different thing and so you have to know

57:42.840 --> 57:46.240
the key it's there with Aaron and I had been through that experience and we were

57:46.240 --> 57:49.440
having a good time we're expecting and Aaron's like I'm gonna say I want to sing

57:49.440 --> 57:53.000
another thing and I'm like I'm just letting you know it doesn't work that

57:53.000 --> 57:56.800
way it's never gonna work that way it doesn't work that way it doesn't work

57:56.800 --> 58:01.360
that way it'll be terrible you can't work that way it won't happen that way

58:01.360 --> 58:04.240
it would can't work that way it's like I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it anyway and

58:04.240 --> 58:08.040
and then she just did it anyway I'm tired and then you went up and you try you

58:08.040 --> 58:13.920
sang a dream a little dream it was all horrible it was terrible but I

58:13.920 --> 58:18.360
loved you ten times more but at the moment I was like I'm gonna I'm gonna

58:18.360 --> 58:22.840
love this person for the rest of my life but she like I can't control her she's

58:22.840 --> 58:28.220
good just like it's just like that feeling that terror like our couples

58:28.220 --> 58:33.960
therapists like like like like we're so fucked up like like like like we have to

58:33.960 --> 58:38.280
like like I have to hold her hand and like on the couch like it's called

58:38.280 --> 58:42.840
Sensei one like just like just just hold her hand it's like an exercise like

58:42.840 --> 58:47.000
Dan just focus on holding her hand and I like hold her hand and she's like what

58:47.000 --> 58:50.880
are you thinking about I just burst into tears I'm just like I was thinking I

58:50.880 --> 58:56.520
because what I'm thinking is one of us is gonna die first is what this means

58:56.520 --> 59:03.280
one of us is gonna die first and it's either gonna be her or me which is even

59:03.280 --> 59:05.640
worse

59:05.640 --> 59:16.080
I just like when you when you when you when you real when you're in love when

59:16.080 --> 59:21.240
you like when you love someone like like like that is that is what the meaning

59:21.240 --> 59:25.720
of that whole Campbellian journey is in my mind is it's like like the myth like

59:25.720 --> 59:31.000
you oh you think you own life you think that you you're a native of it like so

59:31.000 --> 59:36.200
you've conjoined with another person well that guess what that means the price

59:36.200 --> 59:40.400
now gets paid and they just like these anxieties just rise up in me I just like

59:40.400 --> 59:44.960
I can't stop thinking of these like these like you just like me coming home

59:44.960 --> 59:48.200
and you're like on the floor and there's like a stump where your hand was and

59:48.200 --> 59:56.520
there's like a half-finished bird feeder and you're like I'm not kidding I'm

59:56.520 --> 01:00:08.800
not kidding I'm just what do you understand what I'm saying I I mean I

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.560
don't want to even go into what you're talking about because it'll get so much

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.840
darker when I talk about it I mean it I do completely understand it I've been

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.840
going through that for a while because then there's the romantic that yeah sure

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.480
there's a romantic notion of oh it's hilarious that's like Game of Thrones

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.240
someone's hands cut off I'm like a child I'm like a child conjuring these things

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.320
up there are the weeds of guess what life is God cutting off more than your hand

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:40.240
piece by piece until the fucking last crouton he pops in his mouth and goes I

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:52.800
give this shitty planet four stars your pain was delicious I loved every drop of

01:00:52.800 --> 01:01:01.000
your little baby fingers of your cancer I love your war and genocide oh I need a

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:15.280
second I don't want to mess up my star shirt I'm God I'm an asexual food

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:23.160
critic for the center of the cosmos that's what God is he's like a

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:33.440
terrible terrible food critic yeah but a great t-shirt dad I promise I will be I

lay it out that's easy as quick as I gotta know my notes or the notes I got a

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:18.480
really complicated okay and a complicated confusing note on my door

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.600
yesterday and a giant piece of purple paper and like written in Sharpie and

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:29.720
it was hey I'm gonna watch the fight the Manny Pacquiao Floyd Mayweather fight

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.600
and it's gonna be we're gonna be in the garage area signed Terry I don't know

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:40.600
fucking Terry I don't know who Terry is do you know the garage I think come on

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:45.800
by stop by will you welcome come one come all bring what it be a BYOB I think

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.120
that what that was it was a neighbor saying you now don't have the right to

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.040
complain about my noisy party exactly what it was I thought what that was is

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:59.240
like aliens like that's the equivalent of duck calls like like aliens that don't

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.000
know our language they're just like they're imitating certain words and

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.480
they're just like leaving a trail of notes like that to like an alien lair

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.880
where they just gobble people up so they don't know what they're saying they're

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.480
just like free beer they just like they're like amalgamating with their

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:23.240
alien technology free beer Skittles Tony's it's like the equivalent because

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.960
when you're going when you're going when we're going duck hunting you see those

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:33.560
guys like what are they saying like to a duck like most of the time to a duck

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:43.400
they're like Larry Skittles dirt fuck fuck fuck enemy enemy Skittles and so the

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:48.800
ducks are like I think that's probably a hunter but then everyone's around they

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:55.600
kind of nail it they're like oh it's Amy oh it's Amy oh it's Amy Amy's over

01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:01.240
there she sounds good have you guys ever partied with Larry Skittles or Amy the

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.580
duck it's a lot of fun what's it do with this fight

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.520
did you ever see that Gary Larson cartoon where the god damn fight I don't

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:17.040
talk about Gary Larson cartoon because I'm terrible terrible my favorite far

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:23.120
sides okay it's just it's just like it's too it's too muggers and then there's

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.840
like this guy who's like it's not a guy it's like this like reptile like like

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.880
monster with a trench coat on and its tail is coming out the bottom of its

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.120
trench coat and it's and it has like this Halloween mask of a human face over

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:40.600
over it and a hat on and it's like clearly like a foreboding terrible monster

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:51.040
and the caption is yes I would like a knuckle sandwich that's great cuz just

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.000
like in that fleeting moment like just one image and one caption you're like

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.320
this is awesome like yeah all right when I'm not a big boxing fan I don't really

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:04.440
care but a friend of mine had a party just fun to go watch a big thing it's a

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:12.640
big Terry I did not go to Terry's I was I'm almost certain if I show up at

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.600
whoever Terry's also it didn't say where the fucking place was it didn't say it

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:21.400
just a Terry I the that person knows I don't know who they are that's just

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.880
saying if you hear noise fuck you I left a note when Wanny Pacquiao came out

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.000
behind him was Jimmy Kimmel dressed like Run DMC for some reason and he was

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.200
behind him like when they come out with the entourage they're coming out behind

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.160
him is Jimmy Kimmel is being very good at finding his camera and so he's behind

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.720
Manny Pacquiao I'm like I don't know what that is was was Manny Pacquiao on the

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:47.840
Jimmy Kimmel show a lot I don't know we're all in Jimmy Kimmel show at any

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.520
given time the cynical part of me said okay that maybe the whatever network he's

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.960
on Viacom whatever the fucking thing like they're they have a big stake in

01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.560
this or that's just Jimmy Kimmel being hilarious that thought that idea goes

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.520
out the window when Mayweather comes out and I'm not fucking with you if you

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:09.520
haven't seen this the fucking Burger King guy the scary the king with the fucking

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:16.080
horrifying Burger King mask and he's walking up behind Floyd Mayweather Burger

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:22.880
King and also Floyd Mayweather was dressed like a Persian prostitute from

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.880
the 90s he had some weird and Python like was made of snake I think it was

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:33.440
Python wow I think that's really a weird new direction for fights to go with a

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:40.040
Burger King dude is coming out behind me wait for the actual Burger King I mean

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:53.440
no one's the actual Burger King I made it 42 years

01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:01.120
sorry sweetie that's alright it's I you know on one hand I had I had the magic

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:07.240
but on the other hand I was obeying a lot of laws that didn't make sense a lot

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.280
of which were super unfair to women I like that that whole regime is like don't

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.560
give unto a woman the patties that would have more cheese for for a man and

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.920
sire the seed under the extra onions it's a lot of cryptic Aramaic shit what

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.600
they the the actual Burger King guy like it was a promotion you know the

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.320
commercial with a guy has the mask on yeah he's in bed with your wife all the

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.240
sudden I just never scared everybody's of death and he's got that weird smiling

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:38.040
visage the Burger King character like the modern ironic I had like Jack in a

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.600
box kind of a kind of a roguish kind of charming smile on his face he was he was

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.800
walking out behind Floyd money Mayweather who is one of the most

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.440
universally unlikable human beings so Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Kimmel is the coke to

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.720
Burger King's Pepsi like he was like on the other side yeah so there's just like

01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.320
two boxers with two corporate sponsors one of which is here's I would like to

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.000
live in this universe because Floyd Floyd Mayweather is notoriously a

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.720
terrible person well come on he beat his wife give him a break

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:13.240
give him a break it takes a lot of balls I forget he said about some some

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.800
comic I forget it was someone I follow on Twitter who are mostly comedians said

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.160
rooting for Floyd Mayweather is like rooting for Rocky if he was fighting

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:29.440
Adrian I don't know who wrote that but that was very funny so I would like to

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.960
live in a world where Jimmy Kimmel goes hey many pack you like you came on my

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.640
show on time it'd be pretty funny if I was dressed like Randy MC and come out

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.200
behind you and he was like oh you know get the gold chain because it was right

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:43.200
I feel like that was because and he was there also last night behind Mayweather

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.400
Bieber walks out oh Justin Bieber Justin Bieber was there as well

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.640
and I feel like that was I feel like that was there might have been Kimmel

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.320
saying hey man who do you have behind you let me be the guy behind I hope so

01:12:54.320 --> 01:13:01.440
if everybody understands this I can I can fuck off but but what is the purpose

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.120
of this like what is that just like oh punch the other person until they like

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:11.840
why why was but why was it such a big deal like what was that what is the

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.680
because it seemed like this was like a big like culturally important normally

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.600
when boxers are announced they come out and the and they have an entourage with

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.720
them they're they're trained but why are they fighting each other so one is for

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.600
180 million other one or like what a hundred million they were they made a

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.920
hundred and eighty million dollars to fight a guy that he knew he was just on

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.880
the fight than other stuff he made he made about boxing in general are you

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.440
saying that yeah well I don't I mean I'm not I'm asking less about boxing in

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.320
general this this sport and like I said I can totally fuck off but I mean like

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.240
this big fight where I see on Drew Barrymore's Instagram she's like it's

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:51.600
fight nine I'm like true what why are we that's I think that's just for these

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.240
big events if you live long enough you'll see that happen every eight years I

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.560
think eight years okay so it's like eight years so what has to happen for this to

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.360
be like these guys are their promoters are both getting very rich or they're

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.280
probably have the same promoters boxers number one and then okay just famous

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.240
boxers and they're like oh who do we want to get people to buy tickets

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.760
for how about the two most famous guys we can think of these pay-per-view the

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.520
money is like beyond anything I'm not even sure why I guess because you can't

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:25.920
do pay-per-view football because in I guess what it is is that the sports

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.840
leagues they have this whole tournament thing set up so whereas boxing two guys

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:36.920
beating each other up you can arrange one event I ask us half jokingly does it

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:43.600
make you hard I know I've never wait do you play sports now though I mean it's

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.320
just sports no but there's sports and then there's like it's just no but with

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.600
like sports you don't say like ah we got okay we don't have to kill O'Neill as a

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.600
person who doesn't give a shit about any easy question I mean the one the one of

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:03.640
the few that makes sense in big air quotes is like okay let's fucking like

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:10.080
whoa who are we kidding let's say let's stop shooting each other looks the

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.880
the weird way that guys can be mean to each other the whole hierarchy that we

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.680
live under like like the idea of two of them getting into a ring and literally

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.880
being told one of you leaves the other one doesn't yeah there's padding

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.520
everywhere and all this stuff and there's all these rules but it's like like I

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.720
don't watch boxing I don't watch any sports but if I but but like what the

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.600
fuck's the difference between that and the football it's like that you just spread

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.600
it out into team play and stuff but what do you mean this is what this is what

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.680
guys are always thinking that's like I'm gonna punch your face I'm gonna punch

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.720
your face I'm gonna punch your face oh my god Dan you're getting hard right now

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:56.280
I can see oh I mean yeah I think I think I think I think I mean I remember

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.640
being a kid and two kids getting in a fight and it's always like I know it's

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.160
always what's in the air this is like something that has to be paid attention

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.520
to though is like like the idea is like everyone's supposed to be scared of

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.720
getting beaten up everyone's supposed to be scared of a like a fist hitting you

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:17.400
in the face that's what that's what guys live under it's like oh I'm a maybe

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.280
I'll beat you up maybe I'll beat you up like it's always like unspoken and in

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:35.520
the air these fights just feel like Coliseum stuff but I believe less in

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.960
the science when Jimmy Kimmel is wearing a hotdog on his head that's the problem

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.840
with the business of boxing as opposed to the sport of boxing that what we saw

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:50.760
last night was right in its execution was I guess both in a way they're

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:55.800
we saw the we saw the execution of the business of boxing the way that played

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.720
out all the way through all the way around but in it those guys actually

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:03.560
had the choreographs sort of what they were doing to make that pay off it was

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:07.520
really really odd how in the sixth or seventh round the announcers all

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.640
uniformly started criticizing Pacquiao for not fighting as much as he would

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.600
have even though Mayweather never came out and tried to attack him Mayweather

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.080
ran away the entire fight that whole thing was really I mean I'll believe

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:24.560
well I don't know I think that in that outcome that they had everybody wins in

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.840
other words Pacquiao whether Pacquiao where as we have seen we have seen the

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.760
business model fail when somebody comes out and does arguably what the what the

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.200
greatest boxer in the world should do Mike Dyson would just go literally and

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:43.760
like the other guy just goes down and it's over and everyone goes yeah I want

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:49.600
my money back I guess yeah they do yeah they do so I would believe you and then

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.600
this way sort of Mayweather you if you have if Mayweather had lost that fight

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:57.360
everybody who hates him which is almost everybody would have pulled him down and

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.360
said well no he's never gonna be amongst the greatest fighters in the world now

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.720
that question is still in the air because he won that fight if he wins one

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.400
more he says if he wins one more fight he will tie the the greatest record Jake

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.560
Lamada's record of 49 and 0 and if he does that he's gonna Lamada fight the

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:14.640
best fought some of the best fighters available in the world Mayweather had

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.680
nothing to pick from and when he did have somebody to fight and you want to

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:21.600
know why this was so hyped in such a big deal for five to six years Mayweather

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.720
refused to fight him for weird reasons like he opposed not enough burger came

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.800
opposed he opposed the type of blood testing because he claimed that he was

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.080
afraid of having a needle stuck in his arse of weird shit like this he did and

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.920
he made every excuse he could to avoid fighting Pacquiao until now when they're

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.880
both five years past the time when they should have one thing's for sure I went

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:44.440
out you asked like does it get you hard what it does is it creates a sea of

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.600
violence and there's some statistic of the amount of domestic violence that

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:53.240
happens after major boxing bouts and Super Bowls and stuff yeah I went out

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.720
afterwards to the drawing room and it was just there was just a general free

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:03.480
song of just violence in the air not like there was fight starting but

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.880
everybody was talking about when I was a kid I'm fucking boom like I got a

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.720
buck I everyone's telling stories I would fucking boom um is that what you

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.320
said I don't I just said a bunch of gibberish in a row yeah but I like that

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.320
I would fucking boom them but there was a I it's like I gotta get out of here

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:26.400
because it was just generally like kind of a weird like hostile testosterone I'm

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:33.880
probably wrong but I feel like I could I could beat Floyd Murray whether I mean

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:39.600
I let's let's all get on the same page I obviously all organized sports

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:46.360
especially including gladiatorial combat between two guys who undoubtedly would

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:51.280
inspire in a normal world like everyone else's like fealty behind like a

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.520
possibly subversive army like like all of this shit is exercises in pacifying

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:05.000
jingoism you you get the people that you hear in bars that are just like like

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.480
those guys that's all White House burning energy just going down the drain

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:18.200
down the drain into fucking Toys R Us just down into diaper diaper funds

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:25.360
all those guys are like biologically meant to be the guys carrying the

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.320
spears at the fronts of like armies that are still settling who gets to sow

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.200
their seed across the planet now we have this empire where we're all sitting

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.440
or sucking on pacifiers how are we gonna keep these people from from like

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:47.840
going like look I'm not smart I don't get Mr. Show fuck this I've never seen

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:53.720
better off dead I look like like like those guys are fucking either in

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.840
prison or they're or they're working on Wall Street and you give them the

01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.880
occasional basketball game so that they can pound the table and the hot wings

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.600
can fly in the air only energy that they'd otherwise used to maybe storm the

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.640
castle or just be like hanging out in an alley what else would they do with that

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:15.280
energy politically they have nothing to do but like conspire it's like you

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.960
organize sports especially when it's two fucking hulking dudes who are like like

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.840
what's what do you what do you respect more than a guy that can beat up another

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.640
guy and then to turn them into property to turn them into the lowest of the low

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.320
while shining the spotlight on them and collecting money that scatters to the

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.960
floor around them as their blood flows they're beating each other and they're

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:42.440
fucking like they live you're getting me hard then I don't want to belittle the

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.280
art of beating the shit out of anybody but what you said I mean I know I mean

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.080
like I think it's like you're asking like like like well like I don't know I

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:54.320
guess I know your part of me wanted you to know yeah I know this is fucking

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:58.280
stupid no but like I understand I'm not I'm not saying I don't understand like

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:03.600
the art of I mean it doesn't matter but I I took boxing for a while a lot of you

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:10.680
don't know see my instructor is here and he's like I remember when they called

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:19.040
me red and I did um I did it after high school and I did it right before I met

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:26.200
you in Atlanta the boxing and hip got kick kick kick boxing kick boxing and I

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:31.320
did a I held my ears and I did a whole thing well then you know then you know

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.240
why boxing's neat all right next topic no but I mean yeah and I'm well yeah we're

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.800
moving on and no I'm not no I'm not saying I understand why the sport is important

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.960
what I was wondering was why this fight in particular was important and to more

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:47.400
to explain every every every decade there's like a pay-per-view event like

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.960
yeah that's that's what it is whatever Jew Barrymore does always yeah always

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:57.280
disappointing to see my friend whatever but I mean like all my friends are jocks

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:03.160
cares everyone loves sports the sports are great suck my dick all right but

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.480
didn't you say that you want to get your reason I should do a thing and you

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.360
watch the Super Bowl and you dug it like you got of course if you sit me down and

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:13.480

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:39.080
you're hanging out with your friend Terry right now I'm I'm hosting a show

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:43.540
called lucha bathroom downtown first that already happens I can't go this

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:46.960
Tuesday because I'm speaking in a writers panel at UTA with the creator of

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:56.040
blackish because some people consider me a writer fleet what some people think

01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:13.680
that I slam dunk pieces of paper what would some say you punch three holes in

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:26.600
the paper it's good but we only use two for the brads just you know that's a big

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:32.280
question on the writers boards why not three brads have them by them two brads

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:37.280
yeah why the third one is don't use the third brad do you still use Brad yeah

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:45.880
do you ever try an optimum length when you're when you're choosing Brad then

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:55.120
like you have a certain kind of I find that for dramas I use a magnum and then

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:58.280
for comedies like you don't want to you don't understand the feeling that you

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.760
wish the script is longer so you use a micro there's no there's no way that

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:10.080
could have paid off Curtis Curtis is gonna go home tonight is gonna be like

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:18.200
you know what honey I don't I don't think I'm going back I don't like it I

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:29.600
spoke too soon I'm glad I kept communicating through Twitter just last

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:32.720
night it was the tipping point I was like we didn't play enough Shadow Run

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.880
all right let's we should get to it right should we play some shadow run

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:44.800
everybody okay I you saw a splendid moment from our audience speaking of

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.120
sport there's a guy wearing a Mets shirt here and not not you Dave Kline

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:54.920
there's a guy wearing a Mets shirt what's your name Tim he's wearing a Mets shirt

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.000
and we said do you want to play some shadow run and he put both fists in the

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.840
air yes like that's our sports right that's a shadow run is ours is our is

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:13.240
our gladiatorial arena yeah but I would argue that we're better than athletic

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:21.160
people I think that but isn't the whole point of playing like a like a role

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.520
playing game that you get in this fake combat is kind of exercising that same

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:29.200
the same we should all present pretend that we have either a Jimmy Kimmel or a

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:34.320
Burger King man behind us I've got Bieber behind me all the way just in

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.040
Bieber I have just like a really big flashlight behind me that's what I'm

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:44.240
imagining I'm really disappointed in the Burger King for backing Mayweather

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:51.600
that's fucked up like I thought a lot better of him man well seriously I

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:58.080
think here's only about spectacle yeah spectacle is money it's true there

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.680
would have been how insane would that have been of McDonald's and just back

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.960
the other guy that would be with a hamburger like you said that I'm like

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:09.960
well I should have seen that fight that should have been that should have been

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.040
an undercard like whoever they did like the other like lesser fighters were

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.760
before that the main event there should have been a guy dressed up like Ronald

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.440
McDonald the guy dressed like the Burger King like that's good

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:27.520
advertising Colonel Sanders versus Wendy I'd watch it and Burger King has the

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:33.640
whopper as in the whopper as in they hate your wife right there has to be a

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:38.720
moment in a boardroom at McDonald's when they someone says to them and you

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.280
can't tell me that they're not aware of this so that this doesn't happen that's

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:48.080
so big that they there has to be a moment when someone says to them Burger King is

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:54.840
is sponsoring Mayweather Maryweather what's his name Mayweather man he would

01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:01.520
hit me for implying his name had a marry in it would the the so what do you guys

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.840
think and then someone on someone on the McDonald's board of directors has to

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:09.520
say like now I don't think we should do that and then someone someone else goes

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:15.360
like well why not and then he someone has to go because it's too futuristic it's

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:21.800
too off the nose it's Logan's run it's insane it's like what there's gonna be a

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:27.680
burger burger guys fighting no but we'll make so much money yeah but it'll be the

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:34.520
end of the world it has to be Burger King versus Jimmy Kimmel so that we have

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:39.560
to keep eating burgers I think this if it just comes down to like burger guy

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.400
versus burger guy everyone's gonna finally find out that we're living in a

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:49.800
fictional universe and there won't be any reason to not run out into the street

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:54.480
and just start flipping over cars as they'll finally see it there'll be a

01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:00.240
black guy with one fast-food logo on his head and another guy that they'll be

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.960
beating each other up and the fast-food logos will be blinking and there'll be

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:09.720
burgers on the sides of the screen going up and down and and something

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:15.440
will snap in even the most indoctrinated fucking thug and and and the

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:23.320
and and we'll be done for what color is the other guy I am sorry yeah yeah how

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:30.040
come I gotta be black I assume both guys are black but hey I didn't want to

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:34.200
derail the conversation by saying they were our both guys black no Manny Pacquiao

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:40.640
Filipino well that's why it's fucking a big match Jesus why didn't you say so

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:46.640
wait so now you're on that point because there's a race war going on

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.080
Manny Pacquiao had that documentary maybe that has something to do with it what's

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:56.640
that I guess well Manny Pacquiao had that documentary but I guess that's there's

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:59.960
a resounding track yo trains right down the street like three blocks yeah Freddie

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:04.640
Roach I went up there one time as our dearly departed friend Sam Simon used

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:08.680
to manage the Crater of Simpsons and all bunch of stuff he managed a heavyweight

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.680
fighter named layman Brewster who was a heavyweight champion for like defended

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.960
it like two or three times I went there one time with Sam and watched them train

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:20.000
Freddy's there and it was like Francois Botha who's like I think was called the

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.400
white buffalo I remember him he was in the ring training and the sound they

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.520
made when they're just sparring the guy would block a punch and they hit each

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:31.280
other in the arms and these guys were they were like fucking 250 pounds are

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.240
lifting each other up off the ground and moving them a foot and the sound it

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.320
makes it so horrifying and Freddie Roach his younger brother who had just got

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.600
out of jail I believe he was like he's like Jeff get in the ring put some gloves

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:45.280
on go in there go in there get in there like to steal Chris Rock's joke I said

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:53.200
if I get in that ring down 9-1 fucking horrifying like it's really the god damn

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:57.760
and I'm gonna derail things now the the Mike Tyson documentary did you watch it

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:01.640
yeah I as with the Frank Snatcher documentary it's again it's like okay

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:07.520
wait I'm not gonna say this like Mike Tyson like like he hit women and like

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:28.600
a terrible guy too but however but the other the insane personal side of like

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:34.720
of like like like I don't know just like like the the the just listening to him

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.800
talk so like he's in a documentary so there's always that point where someone

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.640
cries if it's a good documentary the book is like early on it's like and then

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:48.040
as I that was that point and then the first guy beat the shit out he's like

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:51.560
started crying because it was like he he didn't like he didn't want to ever beat

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:56.160
the shit out of anyone but like fucking did nobody did that's it all feel it all

01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:00.080
feel so tragic and no one beats their wives because they're an adjusted great

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.720
person but he had like this he had like this mentor who was like discipline of

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.720
stuff I don't know it was like it was just like you're watching the documentary

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.120
you go god damn it can you just can you just not hit women so that everyone can

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:15.600
like recognize you as this amazing hero because it's like you can't stop this

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:19.360
like bells ringing by the way everyone have Sean penny tight Madonna to a

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.560
chair and fucking torture her for two days like fuck you

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:31.840
but it's not it's not just it's not just the fucking barbarians that sorry

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:35.480
we're gonna play shadow run but then this happened that's the thing that's

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:39.760
awful about it because there is a sport behind boxing obviously it's a sport

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:46.080
and it's it's it's a very sophisticated thing but also the people that are in it

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.920
don't tend to be the most adjusted non-abusey type people yeah where are you

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:55.320
gonna pull them from Harvard happen to them there's a reason why they hit

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.720
people so hard it's pretty amazing when you can pull someone from out of the

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.600
out of that environment and discipline them enough to because like it just it

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:08.240
seems like there's so many rules to beating the shit out of another man who

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:13.960
who has also learned how to beat the shit out of another man like that you have

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:18.160
to like you wouldn't you wouldn't imagine any of these people getting into the

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:24.160
ring as being people who were capable of like like showing up at 6 a.m. for like a

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:28.240
practice or something but obviously they have more discipline than than anybody

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.840
which is like man I've never worked hard for anything like I always imagine the

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:37.800
guys that beat people up as being the laziest people in the world but but some

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:41.720
people hang on a second you know I'm trying to remember his name now that he

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:48.920
was the world heavyweight champion in the in the 20s where works hard McGinnon

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:54.560
hang on this guy arrow punch and stuff this guy I don't remember his name I

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:58.160
always blank on his name but he was an interesting guy he was the world heavyweight

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.560
champion and he was a Shakespearean scholar at the same time he was somebody

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.880
who I have a book at home which is a collection of the complete works of

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:15.400
Shakespeare and it was signed by this guy and then the student who owned the

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:21.720
book made a note in it that so-and-so I can't remember his fucking name the

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.120
heavyweight champion of the world and you'd know his name immediately if I

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:32.440
could remember it which I can't talked to professors such and such as class on

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:39.200
the Bard in you know on that on this date so this guy was the I mean at the

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:42.600
time the heavyweight champion of the world could also be a Shakespearean

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:49.200
scholar well let's let's all let's all let's all aspire to those days again

her accent yep we talked on the phone this is how she sounds last time on

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:37.600
shadow rush last time on shadow run shantytown we opened with the gang

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:41.920
inside their van with the rescued youngster jelly dervish and tied up

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:47.440
Arturo Spaguli well discussing the successful mission Eve took the shadow

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.800
out of shadow run and revealed too much information about dervish while Arturo

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.560
was assertively listening nightblade stayed with Arturo in the van while

01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:00.400
the rest of the gang went inside Hank's last stand and came across a saucy

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:05.240
stranger in a magenta suit with a bow slung over his shoulder mercy attempted

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:10.080
to and failed to learn his identity so she gave up and left to take a shit the

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.200
gang received thanks and a payment from the Ryan dervish fellow and as well as a

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:19.040
bonus of the shoes off the poor Italians feet meanwhile in the van

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.280
Spaguli mentioned tonight blade that their gang has compromised their

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:27.960
anonymity with the security footage and the burger tyrant implying a hit could

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:32.640
follow Jim discussed the risk of rewarding shadow runs and the reason

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.560
why good men rationalize why they do bad things and in this world that is a

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:44.840
prison Spaguli is just a pedophile what will the gang's next mission be will

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:49.320
this flamboyant stranger reveal his identity and will Spaguli take his

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:55.200
revenge find out now on shadow run

01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:11.600
I missed one week and none of that sounds familiar to me one week and all

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.640
of those characters showed up Curtis we basically we accomplished one shadow run

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:19.240
we accomplished one mission so we're kind of like starting from scratch like

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:24.360
if you had been here you'd be like I've been here three weeks and we've we're

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:29.320
still in the car getting comfortable I was getting comfortable all of this is

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.240
new to me now what do I do I didn't even hear doctor friend mentioned you were

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:36.480
there when you didn't do much at all you were there when we went back of the

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:41.240
place yeah yeah that was the last so basically like in between there there

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:44.840
was an episode where we I don't think we did much as you were out of town you did

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:48.480
it out of town right there was that all we've done is that we've taken the kid

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:56.880
back to his dad and okay I'm in the car with the mob the mob okay yeah yeah yeah

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.600
yeah and we're in a bar and right now that there is a interesting new character

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:04.160
that we don't know anything about who's wearing a magenta and blue suits and it

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.640
has a bow and arrow kind of situation on him okay so he seems to be like

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.240
somebody we might want to investigate okay sorry so I just couldn't believe we

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:18.840
moved that far ahead we didn't really go that far okay it seemed like it so I walk

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:23.440
up to the bar and get near the fellow in the magenta suit Spencer all right

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:31.680
he's drinking a glass of water quietly I say what's your name oh you know I

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.960
don't give that out too easily okay I'm the same way I like your style and I walk

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:49.760
away that happens meanwhile in the car I think Jim nightblade was just climaxing

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:55.360
in an epic rant it wasn't it wasn't my choice to cliff break oh I remember I

01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:02.640
remember so so anyway he by himself that's how I he's with me I'm a gangster

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:13.200
I'm tied up that's how it is shit shit man well I think I understand if you want

not good you're gonna forget this happened and nothing's ever gonna happen

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:44.720

robot-like arm reflexes are so reflexive he doesn't even have time to breathe

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:16.680

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:49.200
went on it and it's done okay what have you done hodogard knows the answer to

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:55.400
this and all other details in between he rolls his eyes then activates his mind

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.600
probe and directs it toward the young man who's sitting with the magenta suit

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:01.760
to see if there's some sort of information that he can draw from him

01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.520
all right you start doing then the man starts screaming in agony he leaps to his

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:10.440
feet and pulls his bow and starts pointing it wildly you're getting you're

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:16.720
getting flashes of pain and and darkness and loneliness and grim work being done

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.680
I jump up and using my charisma and composure I say to the man who's wildly

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:29.760
pointing his bow hey hey what are you drinking he goes ah I'm being mind probed

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:34.960
and it hurts like hell this is the worst I'm gonna start and he starts

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:40.280
losing calm down he starts losing arrows every which way I stopped the mind probe

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:45.840
all right three arrows bury themselves in the ceiling it seems that the mind

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:52.520
probe at a through off his aim or maybe he's a poor aim I saddle up next to him

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.480
know I don't know what you're talking about so you said look I'm the first

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:26.160
one to agree that on the technological side we're not that savvy so this guy

01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:29.720
over there at the bar is that the guy you're talking about yeah that's him

01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:41.360
friend of mine he knew cool Dennis and we can trust this guy yeah using the

01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:45.120
power to analyze truth I analyze what the hell that was that just came out of

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:52.120

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:58.800
hired murderers and criminals trust is I mean I don't know it's a it's a it's a

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:02.880
perilous concept in this kind of world so do you have a job for us and if you

security footage he could do that I mean yeah we look to be truth be told we

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:27.960

Baldwin we're talking about research in that department something along those

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:11.120
lines we don't know exactly what the research is but we know it's valuable

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:18.080
