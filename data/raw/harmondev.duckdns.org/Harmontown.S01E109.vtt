{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:25.000\nHello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:36.000\nPlease welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:42.000\nThank you.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:48.000\nWelcome back from Comic-Con, thank you for coming back so early.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:52.000\nHow many of you guys went to Comic-Con on this weekend?\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:56.000\nNot so many, okay, they're still out there.\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:06.000\nIt's a weird year, I was just talking to Kamel in the back room and it's the first year when they did the Montreal Comedy Festival at the same time as Comic-Con,\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:14.000\nwhich means that Montreal must have just been like really jockey road comics and nothing else.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:17.000\nIt must have been a pretty uptight environment, right?\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:22.000\nYou're saying that Montreal draws, or that either one of those draws from the other side of the country?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:28.000\nI think that that Venn Diagram's cleavage is prodigious.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:32.000\nYou know, comedy people and whatever, I don't know.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:39.000\nPeople go there to promote shit, new TV shows and stuff, whatever, it's not worth discussing.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:44.000\nJust for a laugh though, isn't that kind of on the decline? It seems like it's lesser and lesser over here.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:52.000\nOh, you hear that Montreal? It's time for a new country to have a recession.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:55.000\nI don't know, I've only been there once.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:59.000\nIt just seems like you hear less and less about just for laughs or jeepolis or whatever.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:02.000\nWell, you know, they try not to take it too seriously.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:08.000\nIt's right in the name. They never asked for it to be a big deal.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:12.000\nI think that people that organize it take it very seriously.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:15.000\nSo you're saying they're the lying when they say just for laughs?\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:18.000\nI think there's a little bit of deception there.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:23.000\nYeah, right. I mean, yeah, Comic-Con's not really about comics, I guess there's a lie in every name.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nSnickers, what are you doing? You're eating it, not laughing at it.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.000\nIt's not packed with peanuts, it doesn't satisfy.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:36.000\nGE doesn't bring anything to life, they make landmines.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:38.000\nAnd light bulbs?\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:41.000\nYeah, a couple light bulbs.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:45.000\nSo anyways, looking at my Evernote thing, Bob,\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:51.000\nI want to promote this feral audio thing that we're doing August 5th, 9 p.m. at NerdMelt.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nHere comes a bunch of facts. I'm not a great pitchman.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:59.000\nBut it's hosted by me and Aaron, it's going to be here at NerdMelt.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:03.000\nWe're recording a, we're doing a live recording of a comedy album.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nI hope I don't need any material.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:09.000\nIt's hosted by myself and my lovely betrothed Erin McGathy.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:13.000\nThere will be appearances by Duncan Tressel, Steve Agee, Brody Stevens,\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nand tons of people who have been here on Harmontown,\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:18.000\nwho also happen to be part of the Feral Audio Network.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:22.000\nSo come to that. That's August 5th.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nAugust 5th. What day of the week is it August 5th?\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:25.000\nThat's a Wednesday.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:26.000\nA Wednesday?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nTuesday.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:28.000\nI discussed it.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nWell, no matter what, it's prime going out time.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:34.000\nJust get on your minx stole and pop on down here.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nWednesday or Tuesday, August 5th, 9 p.m.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:41.000\nBring a, bring a glass of warm milk and the kids.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:45.000\nDan, right now promise that you're going to prepare some great material for the people.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nI'll probably do 10 minutes on the dentist.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nAll right. Animal Corner.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nAnimal Corner.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nGive a spiel for Animal Corner.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:09.000\nAnimal Corner. All the news that's fit to paw about our furry friends.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nHere's the host of Animal Corner.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.000\nThe cat's meow.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:21.000\nDan Furman.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nAll right.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:29.000\nNo relation to Mark Furman, the racist detective.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:33.000\nOkay. We're just a cousin, but I am a fan of animals.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:34.000\nI do not.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:38.000\nThere should be a book series called Mark Furman, racist detective.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nAll right. Animal Corner.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nSo I talked last week about my dog.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nMy dog, we are in the age now of animals can watch TV with us.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nErin came home tonight.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nShe missed Harvey and she was like, I'm going to watch TV with him.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nShe found a new movie franchise with these little buddies.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nYou know about these guys?\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:01.000\nThey're little puppies that get into adventures.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nThey're little buddies franchise.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:05.000\nThey go to space.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nSometimes they're superheroes, something like that.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:08.000\nAm I getting the name right?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:11.000\nAll right. I'm 50.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nFucking Harvey loves this shit.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nSo this is getting weird.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nIs this programming for dogs?\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nWell, it would appear to be.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nI think it also seems to be written by them.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nBut it's like, Harvey goes nuts.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:31.000\nThe thing that drives him the most crazy is if you tape him on a phone,\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nput it on the TV, he goes crazy.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nBut he also loves anything.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:40.000\nWe put on animated Garfield trailer.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:44.000\nGarfield movie and he was going nuts about the cats dancing around.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nReally?\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nYeah. And he does it not for everything.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nYou put up footage of John Ritter.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nHe goes, okay.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nDoes he have food?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nI don't care.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nAnd then any animal comes on the screen.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nHe goes crazy.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nWhich John Ritter footage did you put up?\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:00.000\nSkin deep.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nSkin deep.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:02.000\nThe condom fight.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:03.000\nYou don't like it?\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:04.000\nCondom lightsaber fight.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nThat's not dog programming.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nNo. You would think they would.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nYeah, whatever.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.000\nBut even the dogs can be dressed like superheroes or in space outfits.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nThere were dog puppies on the moon floating around in space outfits.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nAnd Harvey was going crazy.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nThey got to the moon before harm intended.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nYeah.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:26.000\nI mean, that's more noteworthy.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nIt's just a movie.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nFirst of all, they didn't actually get to the moon.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nOkay.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:35.000\nAnd also it's just weird that the dog is like looking at the narrative and he, you know,\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nhe recognizes that it's puppies in the space suits.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nI mean, I barely can tell they're puppies.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nHow would you describe Harvey's reaction to these dogs?\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nHe just barks.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nHe barks at them and then he tries to look around the other side of the wall to see where\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nthis window is looking on these four animals.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nWe can't figure out if he's enjoying it or if it's torture.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:53.000\nHis tail's wagging the whole time.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:54.000\nWe'll just go with that.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nBut he barks and sometimes he whines a little bit.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nThat's what makes him feel a little bad.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nSorry, I'm burping.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nAll right.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nThat's half of Animal Corner.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nAs you know, Animal Corner is a multi-story segment.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:10.000\nNext item.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nI'm sad that we're only halfway through it.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nThat means we only have half left.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nRogaine kills cats.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nNo.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nThe active ingredient, monoxidil.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nI finally have a reason.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nI can just go bald in peace.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nWait, have you been using Rogaine?\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.000\nWell, I bought some.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nI got some online.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nAnd did you kill a cat?\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:37.000\nNo, but our friend Mike Chilean was at Comic-Con and he told me through tears that he didn't\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nknow this and who would know this?\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nThey don't put it on the box.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:45.000\nIt's just a picture of a bald guy crying and then a picture.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nThe picture next to it isn't a dead cat.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nIt's a guy with hair giving a thumbs up.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:55.000\nThey should put a cat in the background dying.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nDid Mike Chilean kill a cat?\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nYeah.\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nHe did?\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nYeah.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nDid he leave it out?\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:02.000\nNo.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nThe cats don't.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nIt's not like milk.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:05.000\nIt's so dangerous.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nIt's really toxic to cats.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\nThey can't metabolize.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nA cat could be near your hair with Rogaine on it.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nYeah.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nThey could lick it, inhale it.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:17.000\nEven if they smell it at all, they could have a huge toxic reaction and die.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nWhat?\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:23.000\nWhen Axial is originally being researched as a hypertension treatment, it's a blood pressure\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nmedication.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nSo babies can have a really bad reaction to it too.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nSo you have to be careful.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nWho's sniffing your pillowcase?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nWho's licking your half insides?\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:39.000\nOriginally it was researched as that?\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nYeah.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nThen they found out it made hair grow sometimes.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nThat's terrible.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nIf you make something up, we're going to release your tension.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nAlso, maybe hair will shoot out of your skin.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.000\nAlso, a cat might explode.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:52.000\nYeah.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:53.000\nSo that's it.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nNow I can just say, well, I tried to have hair.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nYou have hair?\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.000\nI have plenty of hair.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nI got hair for people to go around.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nIf everybody needs hair, come see me after the show.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nWait.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.000\nI'm surprised that you are a person that tried monoxidil.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.000\nYou seem like a kind of laissez-faire when it comes to hair.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:12.000\nYeah.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nI don't...\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nLaissez-hair, they call it.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nI don't believe...\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nMy definition, and this is a little hard.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:25.000\nOf course, it's like to define this line, but my line is dishonesty.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:26.000\nI think if you...\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:31.000\nAnd anyone that's listening who does anything that they keep a secret for your own personal\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\ngroup, whatever.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nI'm not judging you.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nThat's not at all.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:39.000\nI'm saying my personal definition that would make me unhappy.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:43.000\nThe line that I could never cross is where I was keeping something a secret.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:49.000\nIf I had something on my head, I was like, oh man, I can't even tell anybody anything.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nThat's where I can't go.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:55.000\nBut lots of people can and need to do that, and that's great for them.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nSo I thought, oh, Rogaine, I don't know.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:03.000\nIt's been around for decades, and maybe it's just standard.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:06.000\nBecause I'm a little thin on top, and I just thought maybe if it's preventative, I'll put\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\na little topical mousse on there.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nIt's just like...\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nThey give you a little can of mousse.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:16.000\nSo I tried it a couple times, but the really cool thing about Rogaine is that it puts in\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:19.000\nyour hand the power to be lazy.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:23.000\nThat's the important thing, because I think the big issue with men losing their hair,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:28.000\nI think it's just anything about getting older, slowly melting.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nIt's just about control.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nIt's just something that you didn't choose to happen on that schedule, and it doesn't\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:37.000\nreally matter when it happens or what's happening.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:40.000\nIt just makes you feel powerless.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:45.000\nBut if you can buy a product that's like, I choose to take control of this.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nI don't even think it matters if it works.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nBecause for me, I bought it, and I used it twice, and I stopped using it.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nThank God for my cat, it turns out.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nReally?\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nYeah, because I was like, look at me.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nI don't fucking shower.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:01.000\nThere's a million things I don't do to make myself look attractive.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:06.000\nI threw in the towel a long time ago, and it's nice to have a towel to throw in,\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nlike a can of Rogaine.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nAm I going to bother with this procedure?\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nNo.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nAnd then I'm like, yeah, I choose to be bald.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nHow many cats have died?\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nIs there proof?\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nSix.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:21.000\nI was just looking it up beforehand, because I didn't want to be libelous or irresponsible,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:25.000\nbecause you know Harmontown is the epicenter of journalistic integrity.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:29.000\nWe have never said a single inaccurate thing.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:34.000\nWhether we're talking about the Muppets or Israel, we always get everything right,\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:39.000\nand everyone's always very happy with our reporting.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nBy the way, which do you think is more controversial?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:42.000\nThe Muppets or Israel?\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nBe real.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nI would say the Muppets.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:50.000\nYeah, I bet you'd get in faster hot water talking shit about the Muppets at a party\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:54.000\nthan being critical of Israeli foreign policy.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:59.000\nI bet you'd get a 50-50 chance, which is going to get you like a social black eye first.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.000\nAll right, anyway, just think about it.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nGet off my ass.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nSome of those movies are shitty.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nJust make nine more.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nLet's make nine more Muppet movies.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:10.000\nI think we've almost got it.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:11.000\nBut aren't they always kind of good?\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nI haven't seen one since Muppets Take Manhattan,\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nbut aren't they always kind of enjoyable?\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nI'm a little sick of it.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nI'm a little sick of it.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nOh, Muppet Treasure Island's a goodie.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nThat's a fucking goodie.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:24.000\nIt's Erin's favorite, and she's got a relationship with it, and I can't say anything bad about it.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nShe's not here tonight.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nI'm just tired of the Muppets.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nBut if you're going to be the Muppets, at least do Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:34.000\nLet's take a good property where the story is already intact.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nI think that I would agree with Erin.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nErin would agree with you that, yes, that was their biggest success.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nIt's just taking existing stories.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nI like the Muppets because they hired Charles Groton a lot.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nThere was lots of Charles Groton, and the crowd goes silent.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nCharles Groton.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:50.000\nBefore the face work.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nAll right, so Rogan kills your cat's animals.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nAre the cats verifiably killed because of Rogan?\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nIs this an actual news item?\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nI didn't do a ton of research, but I saw...\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nYou're going just on Mike Chilling's murder of his own...\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:09.000\nThe Poison Control Center, I think it said somewhere, had six cases of cats having terrible reactions to it.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nBut they can just sniff your hair.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:12.000\nAnyways, it's over.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nSo if I go bald, it's for humanitarian reasons.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nIs that the end of Animal Corner?\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nThat's the end of Animal Corner.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:31.000\nYeah, I yelled at Channing Tatum through a closing elevator at Comic-Con.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nI just was doing that.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:37.000\nThis is a stolen bit that I got from one of the New York Comedy Sports guys.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nThe loading dock elevator door was closing backstage at Comic-Con.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nThat's where you're going to see the famous people.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:49.000\nIt's like, because everyone's back there, it's like the tunnel that connects all of the panels.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nSo you're just...\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:59.000\nJosh Whedon's getting flushed down the same toilet as Stan Lee and fucking Black Widow and whoever's doing anything.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nSo you see him...\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nI was dressed as a bird the whole time.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:08.000\nAnd then I saw Channing Tatum in a loading dock elevator, and the doors started to close.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:16.000\nAnd just as they almost finished closing, I did a little elevator bit I learned from our friends in New York Comedy Sports.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nI ran towards the door, panicked, and said,\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nSoylent, greatest people!\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nJust anything really is just...\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:31.000\nElevator doors closing, like what would make you worry if you just had heard it?\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nYou're assuming Channing Tatum knows that film?\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nIs that a safe assumption? Do we know Channing Tatum?\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nIt's not why I did it.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nI did it so I could tell these people.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:46.000\nI was like, I bet Channing Tatum is laughing his film-loving ass off right now.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nDid you get a reaction?\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:52.000\nNo, you don't get... you eschew the reaction.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:55.000\nThere's no final moment when he's going up and he looks down and he goes,\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nOh my God, I'll never see you again.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nIt's a blind joke.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:04.000\nI throw it, not a blind joke for blind fans, it's a blind, blindly offered joke.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nDo you have a blind joke? Like for actual blind people?\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:14.000\nThis blind guy just walks into a wall and the bartender says,\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:22.000\nHey, look out!\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nSorry, blind people.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:31.000\nI called you blind people and not Jeffrey, Suzanne,\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:35.000\nYou're human beings without sight.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:39.000\nYou don't need to be dehumanized like that, so you're not blind people.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nIt's weird.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:46.000\nIf you were blind, you wouldn't mind being called a blind person, would you?\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nWell, I'm really strong of character.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:53.000\nI'm not one of these weak blind people.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nI'll say, when you lose one of your senses, you become weaker of character.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nI don't know if you've heard that...\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nHe's talking to you, Jeffrey and Suzanne.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nYou weak blind people.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:08.000\nYour other senses gain strength, but your character in general weakens.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nYou become a worse person.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nWould you rather be deaf or blind if you had to pick?\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:17.000\nI think I... well, I don't want to be willy-nilly about that.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nI think I would rather be blind.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.000\nReally? You'd rather lose sight than hearing?\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:26.000\nYeah, and I know humans are 90% visual creatures.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:29.000\nWe're these primates that need to see the function,\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:33.000\nbut psychologically, we really need to be connected to each other.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:38.000\nDeaf communities, they're very...\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:51.000\nIt's much more passionate, because being deaf is a really divisive experience.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:56.000\nIt puts a bigger wall between you and the person next to you than being blind.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nIf you're blind, you have this impairment,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nand you can handle it however you want to,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nbut you can still hear and talk to the people around you.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:08.000\nDeafness, especially before the internet, was like a really, really...\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nIt really just isolates you.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nHuman beings can't be isolated. It makes them feel terrible.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:16.000\nAnyway, so I assume I wouldn't be able to suffer that very well.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nI need to be able to talk to people.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nI can't do this job blind. I'm not saying...\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nIf you're listening, God, do not make me blind to prove that it's hard.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nI'm not questioning how hard it is.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:30.000\nI just think that I could do a lot of the things that I enjoy doing blind.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:33.000\nThen I would finally...\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nOh, because you're the guy that hates sunsets and bridges and shit.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nAnd also, I'm always forgetting, if you're blind...\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nThis sounds like I'm doing blind jokes or something.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nI'm not really doing that.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nI'm just thinking in my head, like, if you're blind,\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:48.000\nthen everyone at every party you go to,\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nthey have to come up and go,\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:54.000\nhey, Dan, it's me, Suzanne Johnson,\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:58.000\nwhich is something that people don't do because I can allegedly see,\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\neven though I can't recognize their fucking face.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nI never remember anybody.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:06.000\nSo, again, God, don't take this seriously in a Twilight Zone way,\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nbut it might be kind of a lucky break for me to be blind.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:14.000\nBecause you already suffer from face blindness and other kinds of blindness.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:18.000\nIt would make the things that make me a prick a lot more excusable.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:21.000\nI would rather lose my hearing than my sight,\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nbecause I'm a more visual guy.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nI would rather see things and hear them.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nYeah.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nAnd I'm talking straight to God.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:36.000\nGod, I fucking dare you.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nStrike me blind.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:41.000\nI was backstage in an event where Channing Tatum, again...\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nAgain?\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nYeah.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nI was sad that that story had only one accent.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nPlease tell me there's more accents to that story.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nI was near Jamie Lannister.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nOh, shoot!\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nWhatever his name is.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nThat hunk of sex.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nAnd Aaron and I saw him.\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:00.000\nI really hope Aaron doesn't mind me telling the story.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nShe's not here. She won't listen to me.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nAaron saw him and she said,\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nJamie Lannister's over there and I was like, whoa, holy shit.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nAnd then we were like, wow, that's fucking Jamie Lannister.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nIt's really weird to see him.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:15.000\nAnd then Aaron said, man, he looks good.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:19.000\nAnd I was like, you know, there's a level of truth to that\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nthat supersedes jealousy.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:24.000\nI was like, yeah, he does look really good.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nAnd this is Aaron just expressing how good he looked.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nI don't want to get her...\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nI don't know if she'd be mad at me telling this.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nShe says, yeah, he's standing next to Channing Tatum\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:37.000\nmaking him look like a big bag of puke.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nChanning Tatum's eyes are too close together.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nI don't like that fucking guy.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:47.000\nJamie Lannister is fucking sexy as fuck.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:50.000\nWhen I first saw Game of Thrones, I was like,\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:54.000\nthat guy, he's almost like exhilaratingly good looking.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:58.000\nThat guy could kick my 10-year-old kid out a window anytime.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:04.000\nAnytime? He could fuck my sister.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nI'd watch him fuck his sister.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:13.000\nI would let him fuck my sister with my chopped-off hand.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:22.000\nI'd take his chopped-off hand to a movie.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:25.000\nA Channing Tatum movie and just make fun of it.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nWho's this ugliest piece of shit?\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:30.000\nLooks like a fucking pumpkin.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:35.000\nI just think Aaron should be able to choose which celebrity\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\ngoes on record as calling a bag of puke.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nIt's not her.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nLook, look, anybody standing next to Jamie Lannister\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nis in deep trouble.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nLike, I don't care how good looking you are.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nYou're in deep shit if you're standing next to certain people.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nThat guy, he's so good looking that he shouldn't be that good an actor.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nHe also is a good actor.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nLike, that's fucking terrifying.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nYeah, you know, he's like Spanish or something?\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nWhat is he?\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nHe's Israeli. I have no idea.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nDid you know he's a muppet?\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nWhat is he?\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nDanish.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nNorwegian.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nHe's Norwegian.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:06.000\nSwedish. Well, that's close enough.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nHe's across the fjord.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nYeah, he's a hunk.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nHe's good.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nWhat a character arc, too.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nYou fucking hated that guy and now you fucking root for him?\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nIt's so funny to watch Game of Thrones\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nother than every once in a while just purposefully remember\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:23.000\nthat the story started with this guy murdering a child\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nbecause he saw him fucking his sister.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nAnd you're just like, ah, let's go.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nDon't get him, Superman.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:34.000\nYou're looking. You can do no wrong.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:42.000\nIt's like, oh, I hope his sword lessons go good today.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nIt's a good show.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nIt's a good show.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nI just started watching Deadwood again.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nI let enough time pass.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nWhen I first watched Deadwood, I don't know about you guys.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nMaybe it's not for everybody, but I watched it.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nWe used to watch it at my place, your place.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nWe'd have little Deadwood parties.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:02.000\nBut I instantly thought, I wonder how many years has to go by\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:05.000\nfor me to watch this again and enjoy it again.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nThe answer is no.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:09.000\nI'm now watching it again and couldn't be happier about it.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nGod damn that show.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nI'm kind of ready for a wire rewatch.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:19.000\nI'll rewatch wire with you any time, man.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:23.000\nWill you rewatch it with me and Jamie Lannister's hand?\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:28.000\nIf you call my dick the Kingslayer.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nJust for no reason.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nThose are my criteria.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:37.000\nWell, let's bring out Game of Thrones and society expert,\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nKumail Nanjiani.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:53.000\nI brought you out as soon as I could just to get into the shade.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nDid they say the AC was repaired in this place?\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nOh, is that not on?\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nI think we could...\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nI think that's probably...\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nIt's on?\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nI feel like Satchmo.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:07.000\nMaybe I'm just gaining Satchmo?\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nLouis Armstrong?\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nAre you going to carry around a little talent?\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:15.000\nI need like a rag.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nBecause that is what he was most known for.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nThe rag.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:22.000\nWell, I know he played the horn or something,\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:25.000\nbut you're like Satchmo without the historical context\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:29.000\nand the musical ability.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nBy the way, I looked it up.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:34.000\nMinoxidil, which is the ingredient in Rogaine,\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:37.000\nis very, very poisonous to cats.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nYeah.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nBut only six cases have been reported.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nFour of those died.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:45.000\nBut then so many people probably don't report it, like Chileans.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nBecause cats die.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nI think if a cat dies and you also are going bald,\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nyou don't connect those dots.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:54.000\nYou're like, now I've only got one problem.\n\n23:54.000 --> 24:00.000\nAlso, there was a couple of those people\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:04.000\nwho are actually putting Rogaine on their cats.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:07.000\nLike because their cat has a bald patch or something.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nIs that true?\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nThat's what I read online.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nOh, I read that too.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nThat's crazy.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nCan I say one...\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nOkay, no, let's...\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nNo, say it.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nSay it.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nOkay, so this goes back to a little while ago,\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:20.000\nwe had a heated discussion about...\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nand I don't want to bring up like source subjects,\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:25.000\nI thought it was interesting about how we treat people\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nwho try to talk to us in public differently.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:30.000\nYou want to engage and I don't.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nLike at the airport or something.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nYou're like, hey, what's your vibe?\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nAnd I'm like, hey, fuck off.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:41.000\nNobody wants to be confronted when you're not ready for it.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:42.000\nRight.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nNo, but I mean just like engage in conversation.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nAnd I said, usually when I'm on a plane,\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nI'll ignore the people trying to talk to me.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nOn a plane, fuck everybody.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:54.000\nI want to pretend that I absolute object\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nfor graveyard silence on a plane.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nLast week, I was flying back from Atlanta\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nand I sit down and an old lady's going to sit next to me\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nand I help her with her bag.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nAnd I put the bag up and she says,\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:08.000\nand I'm thinking about what's your approach.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nAnd she says, I'm sorry, it's really heavy.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nYou don't want to know what's in there.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nNow you do.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nNo, I do.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nYou want to know, I don't want to know.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nBecause it's probably a human head.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:25.000\nWell, luckily she needs no prompting.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.000\nShe tells me, she's like, it's six pounds of strudel.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nIt's for my son.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nSo now.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nNow I don't want to know anything.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nNow I'm at a crossroads.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nAm I going to engage her?\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nOr am I just going to sit silently?\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:40.000\nAnd because you were so passionate about it,\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nI was like, all right, I'll try this.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:45.000\nAnd I said, huh, might have to fight your son for it.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:46.000\nThat's what I said.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nOK.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nThat's not how I would have approached it.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nWell, this is what happened.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nThis is how I got fucked.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nI have to fight your son for it.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nAnd she goes, good luck.\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nHe's six three.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nHe's an architect.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:04.000\nAnd that's when I knew I was fucked.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nBecause she was giving out information\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:09.000\nthat had nothing to do with what we were talking about.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nShe just wanted to.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nHe could build a labyrinth around you.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:16.000\nI do need to build a labyrinth around.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:19.000\nThey should have to fight minotaurs or whatever.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\nAnd then she talked to me the entire time.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:22.000\nShe said the phrase.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:25.000\nAnd when she said, my son's an architect,\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:30.000\nI loudly kind of said fuck because I knew I was fucked.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:33.000\nAnd she twice used the phrase,\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:36.000\nwell, you know the kind of people\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nthat the black community holds up as heroes.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:42.000\nAnd in my head, I was just strangling Jeff.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:45.000\nYou're out there.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nJeff, you're out there talking to these fucking people.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:53.000\nYou're out there fucking feeding gremlins after midnight.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:56.000\nAnd they go out attacking Phoebe Kates.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nPhoebe Kates did nothing.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nI'm Phoebe Kates.\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.000\nWhy?\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nYou did it wrong.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:01.000\nYou did it wrong.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:02.000\nYou got her wet.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nYou don't get him wet.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nYou didn't see her.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nShe hasn't been wet in a while.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:11.000\nI don't mean get her wet like Horny.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nShe was in her 70s.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:16.000\nIt's been a while.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:19.000\nPart of the art of talking to the stranger\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nis knowing when to and how to engage.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nWell, I didn't.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nI just...\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nYou can't just go willy nilly and talk about strudel\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nand fight her sons.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nI want to fight her sons.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nShe had every right to come back with six foot two\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:32.000\nand architect.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:35.000\nAnd then just so much and I would just look at\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:38.000\nlooking straight and I could just see her like looking at me\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nlike as soon as he looks at me.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nI've got another thing ready to go.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nIf you're in a play with somebody who's a chatterbox\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nand you want them to stop talking, here's what you do.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:47.000\nYou look at them.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:50.000\nI can't be racist to them because that's just going to spur her on.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:51.000\nYeah.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nYou're part of the black community.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:56.000\nLook at them and go shush.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:57.000\nBut it was a smile.\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:00.000\nYou go shushy, shushy pie.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nOh, give me a break.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nIf you ever shush another adult,\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nif you put your finger up to your mouth,\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:10.000\nthey go shush, they fucking shut up.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nI'm shooting.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nNobody keeps talking.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:15.000\nMaria?\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:16.000\nMaria?\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:17.000\nShush.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nYeah.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nWell, you could also call her a content.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:20.000\nShe'd shut up.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:22.000\nGo around doing it.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:23.000\nYou could pull out a gun.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:24.000\nNo.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\nYeah.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:26.000\nNo.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nYou could say something more racist than her to the point where\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nshe thought you were a little extreme.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nIf you're on a plan to go, look, you say, look,\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nI need to take a nap.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nI want to read my book.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:38.000\nShut the fuck up.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:39.000\nShut the fuck up.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nI was on a plane one time when there was an old guy.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:44.000\nI mean, when I say old, I'll put him at 68.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nThat's my guess on this guy.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nHe was one or two rows behind me.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:50.000\nAnd he was talking to another guy at the top of his fucking lungs.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nAnd I got the feeling that he was probably a little bit hard of hearing\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nbecause he was yelling.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nAnd so the other guy was yelling to him because I think that guy\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nthought he was hard of hearing too.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:01.000\nSo another two guys just for a five-hour flight from New York to LA,\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\njust, well, you know another thing about fishing.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nI got down, I love to go fishing.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nAnd like everyone else is fucking sleeping because it's 9 a.m.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:13.000\nand I just stood up and looked at him and just gave the finger to the lips\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nand went shush.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:18.000\nAnd it was fucking boneyard silence after that\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:23.000\nbecause I'm 6'2 and I'm an architect.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nYou can't just talk to everybody.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:26.000\nThat's a real dick move.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nNo, it's a fucking plane.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nThere's people, everybody else was bummed out.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:33.000\nAlso, no joke, and this is not me grandizing my situation.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:37.000\nPeople came up to me during and after the flight on the plane\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:40.000\nand then at the baggage claim and came up and said, thank you.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nYou should have been shush.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nAnd I said, yeah, shush.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nAnd I said, I'll fight your son.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nYou'll fight, you'll fight your son for strudel.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nI was doing a bet.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nShe loved it.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nYou can't just tap a hornet's nest.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:55.000\nI know.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nYou don't rub the lantern, man.\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:04.000\nAre we just saying that some of us are good at talking to people?\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nYeah.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:09.000\nAnd some of us are bad at it, so we don't want to do it.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:13.000\nWe also talked about, and you're talking about that show\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:17.000\nseveral Harmontowns ago, Camille, where you were saying that you,\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:22.000\nI think you were doing a bit where you were saying that you're not gregarious,\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nbut you are a very gregarious person.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:27.000\nYeah, but I don't like to talk to people I don't know.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nI'm fairly friendly.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nUnder any circumstances, you're never curious about a stranger\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:35.000\nor strike up a conversation with a person next to you?\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:39.000\nNever once have I initiated a conversation with a stranger.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:40.000\nI'm pretty sure.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nSo you tried it because of me and you fucking...\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:45.000\nAnd look what happened.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:50.000\nThe kinds of people that the black community holds up as heroes.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nYou're a curious guy.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:57.000\nI was in Nashville recently last week where I wasn't here the last time in town\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nand we had a cab driver, it was an Uber.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nI'll talk to cab drivers.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nYeah, because that's a stranger.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nYeah, I will talk to them.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nAnd I was in the front seat and everyone else in the back seat\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:10.000\nand he was kind of an oddball and he was a guy that...\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nI think he gave me a business card.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:17.000\nHe is a guy that is absolutely certain that global warming is not happening\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:20.000\nand he's a filmmaker and also an Uber driver.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:23.000\nSo he's an Uber driver.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:27.000\nWell, look, lots of filmmakers are Uber drivers, potentially.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:30.000\nYeah, that's what... I saw Spielberg the other day.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nHe drove into the business.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nHe was just a privilege.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:39.000\nI would rather watch a movie by a guy that used to be an Uber driver or still is.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nBut he was saying like, well, you know,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:48.000\n80% of scientists are emphatically agree that global warming is not happening.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nAnd I said, is that right?\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:55.000\nI said, I've heard people say that 90-something percent of scientists agree that it is.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nHe goes, no, that's what Al Gore wants you to believe.\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:00.000\nAnd my movie is called An Inconvenient Lie.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:03.000\nAh, yes, he flipped it.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:08.000\nWhy shouldn't he call it a convenient lie?\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nMaybe...\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:13.000\nA convenient truth.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nI don't know.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nHe's between shots right now because, you know, the weather is shitty.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nHe can't shoot anything.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:22.000\nSo he's driving his Uber around the air conditioning on.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nBut he's saying like, he's like, no.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nI said, but aren't like...\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\nAnd I was not going to try to like...\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:30.000\nI don't have enough information to shout him down about that.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:31.000\nBut I said, but aren't like...\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:34.000\nIsn't there like satellite imagery of ice shelves falling off\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:38.000\nand isn't that kind of proof that that's an unprecedented kind of unstoppable rate?\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nAnd he goes, no, no.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nHe goes, that's an absolute lie.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nAnd he was very level-headed about it.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:47.000\nHe said, every time an Antarctic ice shelf falls off,\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:50.000\none grows in the Arctic Ocean.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nHuh?\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:55.000\nThat is very inspiring.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nAnd I was like, for real?\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:00.000\nHe goes like, nature has a balance.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:03.000\nAnd when one falls off, it creates another ice shelf.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:06.000\nLike I was like, give me your email address\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:09.000\nthat I have to see this movie.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nI want to premiere that movie about the guy that is certain\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:15.000\nthat humans not only don't have an impact on the environment,\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nthey couldn't.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nHas he been making it already?\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:20.000\nOr he wants to make it?\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:23.000\nI got the feeling that this is almost like it's done.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nThey're in post on this.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:25.000\nOh, yeah?\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nHuh, yeah.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nI want to see it.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nI want to see it, too.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:29.000\nYeah, I really want to see it.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:30.000\nBut if you didn't talk to strangers,\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nyou would never know that there's a guy that is certain\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:36.000\nthat scientists all agree that humans are having no impact on the environment.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nI'm sure there are guys like that out there.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nI just don't want to really talk to them.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:43.000\nBut if they make a movie, I'll watch it.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nThen how would you know about it?\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:46.000\nAbout the movie?\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:51.000\nI'm friends with you.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.000\nYou're our emissary.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nGo out and collect the nuggets.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:58.000\nI find it hard to believe that you could be sitting next to people\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:02.000\nat an airport or anywhere and not lean over and talk to people.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:06.000\nYou're such a garrulous, friendly guy.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nI don't talk to people at airports.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:09.000\nBullshit, you must.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:10.000\nI don't.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nNot at airports, but at a restaurant, a bar,\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nyou don't ever look over and say,\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:16.000\nhey, you just never strike up conversation?\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:17.000\nNo.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nEver.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nNo.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nMaybe that's why...\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nI'm not a stand-up.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:25.000\nI've never been moved to write jokes, go up on stage and do that.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nMaybe that's like a...\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nI get it all out.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:31.000\nTo be a stand-up maybe is a thing like...\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nOh, you're getting it out and,\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\noh, okay, so if you didn't talk to people, maybe you...\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.000\nI'd be funnier.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nNo, you'd be doing stand-up.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:39.000\nI don't know.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:45.000\nWell, I would like to get a Comic-Con report from the king of Comic-Con\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\n2014, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nHey, guys.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nHey.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nHey.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:04.000\nWhoa.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:05.000\nHey, Spencer, how you doing, man?\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:06.000\nThat was good.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:10.000\nI thought that vocal was someone yelling at me.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nWhat vocal?\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nThe vocal in that song that was playing.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nThe song is called Loudmouth by Ray Kondo.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nIt sure was.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nComic-Con.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:22.000\nYeah, what happened?\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:23.000\nGive us the scoop.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nUh, my feet hurt.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nDid you enjoy yourself?\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:28.000\nYeah.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nGive me a...\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nWhat was your highlight?\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.000\nIs there a highlight?\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nI got to play Super Smash Brothers.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nThe new one is Mega Man.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:39.000\nThat's all I've ever wanted to do with my entire life.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nIt was great.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:42.000\nIt was great.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nThe convention was packed, packed more than ever.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:48.000\nAnd there was more than ever sign saying you couldn't do stuff.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nAnd more than ever, people telling you what to do.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nAnd it was kind of a bummer.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\nAnd where I remember there used to be booths where it's all like,\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\noh, get a free USB drive.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nHere, have a free sticker.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nNow it's like, win a raffle to get a sticker.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:05.000\nAnd it's just, like, it's getting cheapened.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:08.000\nThere was a new development this year that was just,\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:11.000\nif I hadn't crossed a threshold in my head where I was like,\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:15.000\nlook, I'm just another rich douche here promoting things.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:19.000\nI'm not going to look at myself as one of the nerds anymore.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.000\nI'm looking at myself as an exploiter of nerds.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nI've got two shows I'm promoting here.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nI'm getting driven around in SUVs.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nLet's be real.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:32.000\nMy experience at Comic-Con, if it's good, is great for me\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nand not for anyone else in particular.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:40.000\nIt was one thing that I let get to me as a nerd of old,\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:45.000\nwhich was just like, now they just station these guys\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:50.000\nwho I couldn't describe any way else other than to just call them gym teacher types.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:54.000\nBecause, I mean, I don't know who else goes into security at a convention center.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:59.000\nAnd they're peppered every 30 feet throughout the convention center\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:04.000\nand they're literally just yelling at a sea of nerds,\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nkeep it moving.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:09.000\nAnd they do it indiscriminately when people are moving,\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:13.000\nwhen there's heavy traffic areas, when there's no people in a mile.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:16.000\nSo we already know you can't sit on the floor at Comic-Con,\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:19.000\nwhich used to be, this is my big thing that I always had a problem with.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:23.000\nI went to SuperCon in Miami, I went to New York, Comic-Con.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:27.000\nYou can still see what is a beautiful thing to me,\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:31.000\nwhich is this is our people, this is the way we pray.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:34.000\nWe buy a bunch of shit with our enormously disposable income\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nbecause no one's dating us.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:40.000\nWe consume the fuck out of stuff.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:44.000\nAnd when we get exhausted from buying your shit,\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:48.000\nwe plop our fatasses down on the carpet against the nearest stretch of wall\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:52.000\nand we look through it until we can get a bit of strength\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nto take another surge through this stuff\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:58.000\nand we're dressed like the monopoly guy and pirates and spider people.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:01.000\nAnd it used to be, and then I was like,\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nokay, you can't sit on the floor anymore.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:07.000\nOkay, well yeah, that's because Bruce Willis' PR team's coming through\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:10.000\nand now I'm part of that problem too, so I dropped that.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nI dropped that passion.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nIf you want to sit on the floor, go to New York.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:17.000\nBut keep it moving, keep it moving.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nI can't fucking move.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:22.000\nI'm doing too much money for me to move.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nThat's fucking crazy. Keep it moving.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:27.000\nThat's exactly what a gym teacher says.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:31.000\nIn that vein, a lot of the traffic signals were shut down\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:35.000\nand they had traffic enforcement directing traffic and stuff.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nAnd I always thought it was pretty weird\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:40.000\nbecause they call them traffic enforcement officers,\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:43.000\nbut they're really more like traffic naggers.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:46.000\nThey just tell you what to do and if you don't, they're like,\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:49.000\ndoh! And then just everyone continues doing it,\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nlike what they're going to do.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nThey don't actually stop people. They never sight anyone.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:56.000\nThere's like five people at the same intersection.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nYou think one of them can go tackle someone.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nLike, it wouldn't be that hard.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nThey're not really enforcing anything.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:06.000\nYeah, I saw a lot of mob rule happening at the crosswalks,\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nwhich is kind of a nice thing.\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:12.000\nPeople just crawling under the cross arms on the railroad track.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:16.000\nWell, did you see that accident that happened and this family of deaf people\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\ngot beat up by nerds at Comic-Con?\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:19.000\nWhat?\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:20.000\nThis happened yesterday.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:21.000\nSo there was a...\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:22.000\nAn accident?\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:23.000\nThere was a...\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nDamn deaf people.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nSo you chose wisely.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nBut they were driving a car,\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:38.000\nwhich would be significantly more challenging if you were blind.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:41.000\nSo they were waiting at a crosswalk\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nand it was the zombie run was happening.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:46.000\nSo this guy had little kids who couldn't hear.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:51.000\nThen suddenly, people in amazing like zombie outfits keep coming by\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nand these kids start freaking out.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.000\nIt's taking a long time.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nSo he starts like nudging his car forward\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nbecause there's no rule.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nAnd they started attacking the car\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nand breaking the windshield and stuff.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:03.000\nWhat?\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:04.000\nYeah.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:07.000\nAnd then so he like tried to get away and hit an old lady.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:08.000\nWhy was an old lady there?\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:09.000\nI don't know, but she broke her arm\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nand nobody died, but...\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:12.000\nOh man.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:13.000\nBut I saw it.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nIt's funny because I was over at a pizza place\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nwatching like that procession go by\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:20.000\nand then it kept being interrupted by all these emergency vehicles\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nand that's what that was.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nYeah.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:24.000\nThey were going to attend to that.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nBut it was funny because you see this parade\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nand then it gets like pushed off into the sidewalk\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nand then they keep going like nothing happened.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:31.000\nI became part of that.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nI was kind of bummed out about it.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nIt seemed like all of the...\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:40.000\nThere's just a sea of what I perceived as San Diego natives\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nwho are all eating at restaurants\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nwith their cameras out watching\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:47.000\nreally extra slow nerds walk by them.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:50.000\nAnd I was like part of this fucking parade.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nI'm like this is the worst.\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:55.000\nI'm hungry, not for human flesh.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:58.000\nI'm going to meet people.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nBut I couldn't...\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:03.000\nYou can't like knock over a stroller with a zombie baby in it\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:06.000\nand I'll blow them by.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nI do love going though, even with all that.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nYou see when the people are dressed up and stuff.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:11.000\nIt's very exciting.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nThere's still a lot of passionate people around\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nand they're getting yelled at by gym teachers.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nBut they're still there.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:18.000\nI had a great time.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:21.000\nI mean again, as I say, big asterisk at the top of all this.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:24.000\nI've become some strange protected elitist astronaut.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:29.000\nI land at Comic-Con and I'm handled now.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:32.000\nI'm escorted to the place I need to be.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:35.000\nParts of the convention center that nobody gets to see.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nLike behind the thing.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:40.000\nI get to see Channing Tatum in an elevator and do bits.\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nSo for me, everything was seamless.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:46.000\nAnd every single person I'm meeting is someone who is moved\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:50.000\nto speak to me because they so admire me.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:53.000\nSo it's like my experience is like...\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:56.000\nIt's insanely biased.\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\nBut I was a really great Comic-Con.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:01.000\nDo you think you could sit down and someone wouldn't tell you to keep it moving?\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:02.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:03.000\nWell, there was a moment.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nLike after I finished the adult swim signing, it was kind of weird.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:10.000\nLike I was sort of like, I was fat, old guy, my gray stringing hair.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:14.000\nAnd I had had like Vodka delivered to me while I was signing stuff\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nby Justin's assistant.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:19.000\nTomorrow, thank you, tomorrow.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:22.000\nAnd I was done with the signing and it was like,\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:27.000\nno one cared that I had a glass of Vodka on the rocks at the signing table.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:30.000\nAnd so, and then when it was over, I just kind of wandered off with it.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:33.000\nSo for a moment there, I was kind of just strolling through the exhibit hall\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nwith this cocktail in my hand.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:38.000\nAnd I did kind of feel like the king of something.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:42.000\nBecause there was no, nobody was telling me, you're not allowed to do that.\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:44.000\nAnd it's like, of course you can't have like glassware.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:45.000\nYeah.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nBut it was filled with booze.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:50.000\nI was like, I felt like Dean Martin or something.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nI don't know if I, last year this happened,\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:56.000\nI don't know if I talked about it here, but women have like a different experience\n\n42:56.000 --> 43:00.000\nthat women like get groped and stuff, that happens, I was walking with Emily.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:01.000\nA Comic-Con?\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:02.000\nYeah.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nWell, there was a new thing there this year.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:08.000\nI mean, it's not a new thing, a new awareness of it.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nWhat's the Twitter handle?\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nCosplay is not consent.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nWell, Cosplay is not consent is the slogan.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nThere's a Twitter, there's a Twitter account.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nIs it really a thing?\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nCosplay is not consent.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:19.000\nNo, it's not.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:20.000\nYes, all women.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:25.000\nBut women like dress up in cosplay and guys think it's okay to treat them like,\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.000\nyou know.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:27.000\nLike cartoons.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nLike cartoons, yeah.\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:30.000\nWell, not that.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nWell, they objectify them.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.000\nLike not people, yeah.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:37.000\nIf a girl's dressed as poison ivy, then obviously it's okay to just run up to her\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nand go like, hey, how are you?\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:42.000\nOr let me get a picture without actually engaging them like a human being\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nbecause they're dressed as poison ivy.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nBut you said that they're actually being handled and groped.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nThere's reports of that.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:51.000\nYeah, well, last year I was walking and it was me and Emily who were walking.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:58.000\nAnd Emily was like, this guy keeps, like, she felt, she's some guy like sort of,\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:01.000\nwas like really close to her.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:04.000\nHis crotch on her, like weird, yeah.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:08.000\nSo I looked back expecting like a huge crowd, but it was just me and Emily\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nand then one guy behind her.\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:13.000\nAnd no one else around, just the three of us walking\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:16.000\nand I was like, what the fuck, dude?\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:17.000\nYeah.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nJust mounting her as you're walking around?\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:23.000\nWell, I mean, it was Jamie Lannister, so he was fine with it.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:27.000\nNo, it was like me and her and just like one dude behind it.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:31.000\nWhen I looked, he went away, but we just expected like to be a huge crowd\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nand people getting pushed around.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:36.000\nBut is it Geeks for Consent?\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:44.000\nYeah, that was the Twitter thing I was looking at in the limo ride home\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:48.000\nfrom my privileged flying saucer that I hover over.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nYeah, Geeks for Consent.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:54.000\nIt's a small group of people from what I've been able to gather\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nfrom reading their updates and things.\n\n44:56.000 --> 45:02.000\nWhat it is, is that San Diego Comic-Con, as an official PR perspective,\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:05.000\nthey don't want to create the idea that this is a problem,\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:10.000\nso they'd rather just wait until something terrible, whatever their position is.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:14.000\nAnd that's what this group is running up against.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:18.000\nThey're saying, can we just add, can we make the one formal step\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:28.000\nof adding official, thorough anti-harassment language to the Comic-Con guidelines?\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:32.000\nWhat constitutes it and how it'll be dealt with and all that stuff?\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:35.000\nI think they have like one sentence in there that's like, don't harass people.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:39.000\nIs it for all women or just for women that choose to dress up in cosplay outfits?\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:45.000\nI would guess all women, I wouldn't think you'd have to dress up as Sailor Moon to not be sexually harassed.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nYou know what I mean? I bet it would be all women.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nI think it's just all human beings.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:52.000\nI think as with anywhere, you're allowed to feel safe.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:57.000\nIf you choose to dress up as a character, you're not necessarily saying to strangers\n\n45:57.000 --> 46:01.000\nthat they have an elevated level of permission with you in a social context.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:05.000\nThey're just saying, that makes perfect sense to me.\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:15.000\nAll this group is asking, can you please add that language to the big long list of warnings\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:19.000\nabout don't wear your Google glasses when you watch the next Hugh Jackman movie at the panel.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nThey're very thorough about that.\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nWhat will happen to you in anti-piracy and stuff?\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:28.000\nNot so thorough about just letting somebody know, don't run up to Sailor Moon,\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:34.000\nthrow your hand around her waist, take a selfie, talk to her like she's Sailor Moon.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:39.000\nIt's a person and yeah, that's it.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:44.000\nI thought that was interesting as our world keeps changing under our feet.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:47.000\nSpencer, did you have a low light of the Comic-Con?\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:52.000\nYeah, I'm like to shame Hasbro Incorporated.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:56.000\nIt's high time, man.\n\n46:56.000 --> 47:01.000\nYeah, they had this situation where they had a booth that was like a store,\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:05.000\nlike many other stores in the Comic-Con situation,\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:09.000\nbut this booth was special because in order to get the privilege of lining up\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:12.000\nin the ridiculously long line to buy the merch,\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:19.000\nyou had to get these tickets elsewhere at a completely different place like at 6 in the morning.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:24.000\nAnd that's before the Comic-Con even opens.\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:28.000\nSo it's like get to Comic-Con three hours before they open so you could get a ticket\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:31.000\nso you could stand in line to buy this shit and it was a bummer.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nWhat were you planning to buy from Hasbro?\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:37.000\nPromotional magic cart stuff because Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast,\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nso they own magic and stuff.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nIt's a bummer.\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:46.000\nBut on a highlight related note, I got to go to a weird magic event hosted by Geek and Sundry\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:53.000\nand I got to play magic with just some new players, but also this guy, shit.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:57.000\nI think his name was Doug Byer, but he's a magic executive guy and I got to see one of them.\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nDid they know who you were?\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nNo, no, no. It was cool.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:04.000\nDid you have any reflected celebrity from being a...\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:08.000\nYeah, I mean, there was probably about 40 people that stopped me and talked to me\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:11.000\nfrom Harmontown or from TV. It was cool.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:14.000\nI bet a lot of other dudes with funny tails and big beers also got stopped.\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nI bet they did.\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:19.000\nWe saw you yesterday, no you didn't.\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:22.000\nThere was about three or four people that were like, did I see you?\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nAnd then I was like, I don't know, did you?\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:27.000\nAnd then they're like, I don't know. And I was like, do you watch TV?\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:31.000\nAnd they're like, no. I was like, well, a lot of people just generally look like this,\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:35.000\nlike with a crazy beard and long hair and glasses and fat.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nThey thought you were a Hammurabi.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:42.000\nYeah. I mean, I have a coat.\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:48.000\nI hope I'm not speaking out of term and telling the Justin story, even the elevator.\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:55.000\nJustin Roiland, the co-creator of Rick and Morty was really drunk and he got into an elevator\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:59.000\nand he goes through a curtain.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nHe's a great drunk.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:05.000\nIt's great near quotes, you know what I'm saying? He's a big drunk.\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:11.000\nAnd there was a guy in the elevator that was, I think, in a wheelchair.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nI'm hearing this story third hand.\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:19.000\nAnd he, Justin was just being big and gregarious and stuff.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:22.000\nAnd he kind of, he was sort of like putting a hand on the guy's shoulder and saying,\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nyou know, yeah, isn't that right?\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nOr whatever, kind of like inviting everyone to the party in the elevator,\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:32.000\nkind of like, let's all hang out in the elevator right now and be friends and look at how drunk I am.\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:38.000\nAnd at the third time, the guy said, look, you're really invading my space right now.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:39.000\nI'm very uncomfortable.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nAnd Justin was like, oh, shit, sorry.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:43.000\nHe got really quiet.\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:51.000\nAnd then he said, he said, listen, I don't know if you're like a fan of Adventure Time or like that.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:54.000\nAnd the guy kind of laughed and said, I know who you are.\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:59.000\nOh!\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:02.000\nOh, shit.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:05.000\nPack a snap.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nPack a snap.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nWow.\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nThat could not have gone any worse.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:15.000\nThat elevator just became a crater.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nYes.\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:20.000\nI wouldn't let Jamie Lannister touch me this much.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nWow.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nI saw an old friend of ours.\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:27.000\nWe haven't had him on the show in a while at Comic-Con.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nAnd he's looking and feeling great.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:33.000\nSo I told him to come down and I give us a little update because it seems like it's all good news.\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:36.000\nLet's welcome back Seek Donnelly.\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:47.000\nThank you.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nWe all remember this guy.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:54.000\nMultiple aneurysm survivor who the last time we saw you.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:55.000\nWe're snuggling.\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:56.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nYou're kind of invading Camille's personal space.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:02.000\nHey, I know who you are.\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:06.000\nWhen I was at Comic-Con, I pressed my junk against people.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nAnd then when they turned around and go, what are you doing?\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:11.000\nYou go, I survived multiple aneurysms.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:12.000\nI have earned this.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nI played that card, yeah.\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:19.000\nThe last time we talked to you, it was very sobering and, I mean, not technically for me,\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:28.000\nbut emotionally sobering declaration on your part that you had been going to these doctors\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:34.000\nand studying you and in the same course, treating you while they studied you,\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:39.000\nyou know, putting coils up your legs and stuff I can't even imagine.\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:43.000\nAll I know is Rogaine could kill my cat, so I've got it bad.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:50.000\nAnd you were told them, let's knock it off because there was a little bit of time that you weren't on the treatments\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:56.000\nand then you felt more creative and you were like, I mean, the way that you had put it,\n\n51:56.000 --> 52:01.000\nor at least the way I've seen articles written about it is that even if it's a crass way of saying it,\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:08.000\nyou're like, I want to be creative even if it kills me because you're recognizing that you're not getting this treatment anymore\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:12.000\nand it's sort of like a roll of the dice with whatever's going on in your brain and you,\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:16.000\nbut the effects of the treatment were kind of neutering you creatively.\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nAm I getting any of this wrong?\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nNo, that's all exactly what was going on.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:25.000\nSo you came out here last time and said, all right, no more treatments and off I go\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:28.000\nand I'm going to go draw stuff and be productive and come what may.\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:31.000\nAnd so now you can, now you give us the update.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:35.000\nWell, yeah, so I mean, my energy level's been up.\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:39.000\nI've been having fewer incidents as far as like blackouts and seizures.\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:43.000\nI still have some, but they're few and far between basically.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:47.000\nI seem to be thinking a lot more.\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:52.000\nI'm solving like, because a lot of things I do is like I buy puzzles and solve puzzles\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:55.000\nand like to help, you know, my brain still sponge.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:56.000\nIt's absorbing.\n\n52:56.000 --> 53:00.000\nI build transformers and, you know, and model kits and everything like that.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:03.000\nSo I love doing all that stuff and it keeps the creative juices going.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nNow I've found that I can't stop.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nI'm getting very little sleep.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:12.000\nI'm probably sleeping like three hours a night maybe and I can't shut my brain down\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:19.000\nand it's just, it's nonstop going and productive like I'm doing a lot.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:23.000\nNow a lot more than I did before I had an aneurysm at one time.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:28.000\nAnd there are effects that it's having on me, but they're again so far,\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:33.000\nfew and far between that I'm, I don't know, I seem to be what I've always wanted to be,\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:36.000\nwhich is a little super human lately.\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nIs it a worry that you're not sleeping enough?\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:41.000\nLike would you like to be able to shut that down a little bit?\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:42.000\nYeah, I would love to.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:43.000\nWe, we tried a couple of things.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:46.000\nI actually, a couple, I think it was about a month ago.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:49.000\nI had sleep deprivation because I was up for a couple of days and then,\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:53.000\nand then after that I got, you know, some, some stuff to knock me out.\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:57.000\nAnd then since then I've been, I'll get three hours of sleep at night and then\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nsometimes I'll take an hour nap in the middle of the day.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:02.000\nBut my energy level, like we just did Comic Con last year.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:05.000\nI think I sat two days out because I was sick.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:08.000\nThis year I, it could have gone three more days.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:09.000\nReally?\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:10.000\nYeah.\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:11.000\nThat's great.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:12.000\nWhat about like loud noises and stuff?\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nI thought you like, like when you're in big crowds and people are getting kind of loud.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:17.000\nYeah, I used to walk around with headsets on at cons and I would listen to like\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:20.000\nwater flowing and it would drown everything out.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:23.000\nNow the noise sounds like water flowing.\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:28.000\nSo even all the yelling and the screaming and the body odor and the everything.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:31.000\nDo your doctors have any, do they weigh in on that?\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:34.000\nWell, I only have the one neurologist now and he's not,\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:39.000\nhe never gave me advice and stuff on that level.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nIt was always the other, the guinea pig doctors.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:44.000\nIs there anything for them to learn off of this?\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nIf I still went to them, maybe.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:47.000\nReally?\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:48.000\nYeah.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\nWhat's your doctor's take on everything?\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:53.000\nI mean, he's kind of a pothead.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:56.000\nSo he's like, yeah, transformers.\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nHe prescribed transformers.\n\n54:58.000 --> 54:59.000\nMore transformers.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:02.000\nI would take three Doritos and call me in the morning.\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:07.000\nDo the other doctors try and contact you like an ex-girlfriend or something?\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nHey, how are we doing?\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nAre you still, you know, with the brain?\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nDo you just get coffee?\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:14.000\nNo.\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nNo, I don't, we don't, they don't reach out to me.\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:17.000\nWell, that's fantastic.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nWhat are you up to creatively?\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:23.000\nWell, I'm working on the book I mentioned that you guys all helped me fund on Kickstarter,\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:27.000\nAlain Vitao, which is me doing all the different art styles.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:31.000\nI just recently choreographed a dance for the book.\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:34.000\nBasically, I'm trying to find out what kind of artist I am.\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nSo every page in the book is a different type of art.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:43.000\nExpressionism, surrealism, sculpting, painting, singing, choreography, filmmaking.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:46.000\nSo it's a very trans-media book.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:47.000\nSo I've been working on that.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:51.000\nAnd then I actually premiered my new comic at Comic-Con called Mono Man.\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:54.000\nWell, I was looking at it.\n\n55:54.000 --> 56:00.000\nHow was your visual memory still where it was?\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:01.000\nIs that coming back for you, C?\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:02.000\nFor you guys.\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:03.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:04.000\nYeah, my visual memory.\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nSo I've been having more dreams.\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nI can remember them.\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:15.000\nAnd I've actually, at Comic-Con, I drew four people came out to me and commissioned me to do sketches for them.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:18.000\nAnd only two of them I actually had to look at pictures for.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nI actually drew Spider-Man without even looking at them.\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nI liked seeing a picture of them.\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:25.000\nI was able to know enough in my head to draw Spider-Man.\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:33.000\nSo I would say, again, it's finally getting past that sponge level and I'm learning.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:40.000\nYeah, I don't want to go, I mean, I'm going to go out on a limb here, but you know, you ran into me the other day at Comic-Con, you know.\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nAnd you were with a guy who didn't know me, right?\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nSo did you recognize me?\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:45.000\nYes.\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:46.000\nYeah, which didn't happen in the past.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:47.000\nLike at all, right?\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:48.000\nI mean, sometimes.\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:49.000\nBut that's crazy.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:54.000\nYeah, the way I found you this time, I wouldn't have been able to before.\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:57.000\nWe were just walking by and I looked over and I go, oh, there's Spencer.\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:58.000\nYeah.\n\n56:58.000 --> 56:59.000\nI'm going to go say hi to him.\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:00.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:03.000\nSame with Dan.\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nI mean, same with you.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:06.000\nOh yeah, me.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:12.000\nYeah, when I saw you at the signing and stuff and I saw Dustin too, I just, it's starting to like, I don't know, things are sticking.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:16.000\nWhen I see you, I always get the impression that you recognize me and see me and know who I am.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:19.000\nWell, yeah, because a lot of times what I do is I get things down.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nI know you're tall and I know you wear a suit.\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:22.000\nAnd if I see you at Meltdown.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:27.000\nThat does narrow most of the people we hang out with don't fit that.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:32.000\nYeah, so if I'm in Meltdown and I see that, I'm pretty much like, or if I'm at a bar and I see that, I like, you know.\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:35.000\nAnd then also hearing includes you in too, right?\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:36.000\nYeah.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:37.000\nYeah, hearing.\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:38.000\nWhen you say hi.\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.000\nHow do you recognize me, Sikh?\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:41.000\nYour speech pattern.\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nOh, nice.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:46.000\nNice side step, bro.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:51.000\nWe all know what you really do.\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:55.000\nWe're going to expunge racism from aneurysm survivors.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:58.000\nWe've got a new strategy about this.\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:05.000\nWe figured out it's too deeply rooted in society and we're going to start with Sikh and make sure he's not racist.\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:08.000\nThis is all your art in here?\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nNo, I'm actually the writer of this book.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:13.000\nSo like I said before, I think I told you about it.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nIt's really hard for me to find a job.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:20.000\nA lot of people don't want to hire a guy who has memory problems because they're like, hey, did you do that thing yesterday?\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nAnd I go, what thing?\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:23.000\nAnd then it doesn't get done.\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:27.000\nSo I have a really great boss who is actually here in the audience.\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:28.000\nI brought him with me.\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:32.000\nHis name is Omar Spahi and he started a comic company called OSSM Comics.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:38.000\nAnd he hired me as an editor and chief for him, which is what I always wanted to do with comics would be an editor.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:43.000\nAnd then he was crazy enough to say, hey, do you want to write one of these comics that we're publishing?\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:44.000\nSo I did.\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nI'm a big, you know, like you, a Joseph Campbell fan.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:49.000\nI wanted to do something I just straight up called it monomyth.\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:53.000\nIt's called a spade a spade and it's the story of Lucifer and Michael in reverse.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:59.000\nSo actually Lucifer tells Adam and Eve not to eat the apple and Michael is the angel that falls from heaven.\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:03.000\nSo it's like a what if earth book because I'm a big Marvel what if fan.\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:09.000\nAnd it's got a Nerdist.com did a great review on it and a lot of, you know, got a lot of press NPR.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:16.000\nSomeone was really nice at NPR and did an interview with me about this and Elan Vitao and soul star.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nSo yeah, it's definitely got a lot of controversy.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:23.000\nWe had, you know, the religious protest protesters outside Comic Con.\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:24.000\nI love those guys.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nI made a friend with one of them actually.\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:27.000\nOh yeah.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:28.000\nYeah.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:29.000\nYeah, I recorded a video of him.\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:30.000\nHe donated to soul star.\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:31.000\nSo you're not all bad.\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:32.000\nThose guys are so odd.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:33.000\nI don't know.\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:44.000\nIt's like, if you walk by, if you hang out there long enough, there's going to be somebody of equally confusing, equally confusing conviction that starts to yell at them and argue with them.\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:47.000\nAnd it's like, I don't know what's at stake for either way.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:48.000\nYeah.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:55.000\nBut it's like a guy saying like, you know, why should Jesus have, why should you need more superpowers than Jesus gave you?\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:56.000\nLike just some doubt.\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:57.000\nIt's like, come on.\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:58.000\nWhat are you taught?\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nNo one's coming to this convention because they don't want Jesus to be loved.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nIt's not a convention.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nThey're hating Jesus because Superman gets blind.\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nHow come God can't fuck where it came from?\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nHave you ever been in there?\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nHave you ever read a comic book?\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nYou know what the best origin story was?\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nI've got a sequel for you.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nReboot this.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nChristopher Nolan.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nIt's really weird.\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nThere was a guy who just sat up with a, he had a lawn chair and a boom box.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nHe was just blaring what sounded to me like it was just a bad recording of his church's like rock band or something.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nHe just thought he could bathe people in positive energy.\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nHe didn't regard it as noise pollution at all.\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nIt's just like, it's already loud here and insufferable and he's just blaring garbage at people.\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nIt's just garbled garbage on a cassette tape.\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nNow I feel bad because he was blaring the song I wrote for Alain Vitao.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nYou're right, Christian Rock music now.\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nThat's my thing, man.\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nWhat if you found out that was your art?\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nThat would glow.\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nFuck.\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nGood news, bad news.\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nWhat if you made us all start loving Christian Rock?\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nThat became a new thing.\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nThen I would be the Antichrist, probably.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nSure, the Antichrist, I mean, you're not a responseer.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nHe was just talking about this.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nAccording to all reports and revelations, the Antichrist, you know,\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nhis big point of efficacy is going to be that everybody really likes him a lot\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nbecause he's like really kind of nice and charming.\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nYeah, and people might think he's like the Messiah, I think, if I read right.\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nSo it's just like, well, whatever one looks like the next Jesus, that's get him.\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nAnd wait for some shithead that's badmouthing him, too.\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nAnd then give that guy your everlasting faith.\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nThat's quite a problem when you realize it, yeah.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nThat is true. That's really funny.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nThat's why Jesus doesn't want to come back.\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nHe's like, they're going to get me again.\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nHow do you jump into this double dutch?\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nRed hot peppers, shit.\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nDo you remember when we were saying that listening to like heavy metal music backwards\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nhad like satanic messages in it or whatever?\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nI just thought it's funny that like Satan is up there, like these are the fucking people.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nThis is what they're doing. They're like sitting around smoking pot, listening to music backwards.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nLike they're not like the best, most productive members of society.\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nWhen I was a little kid...\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nTheir websites are terrible.\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nWhen I was a little kid, there was the D&D report.\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nNews was talking about people that played this thing called Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nAnd they were playing it in my town when I was a little kid in Tustin in Orange County.\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nThere were these big sewers that you could go hang out in if you were a teenager.\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nA good turtle?\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000\nYeah, if you were a martial artist turtle.\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nWhich I am.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nBut there were reports that there were ritual slangs and there was no...\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nWell, that's how the West Memphis 3 thing happened.\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nThat all came from that kind of fear.\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nYeah, it was the Dallas Egbert III, whatever his name was.\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000\nIt was the kid that went missing from the UCLA.\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nNow I'm just spreading rumors.\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nThis was the 80s. There was a kid that went missing.\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nDallas Egbert III?\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nHis name was Dallas Egbert Jr. or something like that.\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000\nThere was a book. It's called The Dungeon Master.\n\n01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nIt was published in the 80s by this guy, William Deere, who was a private investigator.\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nDallas Egbert... something like that.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nThe third, which means someone else's name.\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nDallas Egbert IV.\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nThis is a good enough name.\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nIf it ain't broke.\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nHe was a kid that went missing from a college campus.\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nHe was like one of those worms or archetypes.\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nHe was there. He was at college way early because he was a genius.\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nAnd because he was a genius, he was also kind of, you know...\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nHe had wanderlust and rebellion and boredom and stuff, and he just disappeared one day.\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nAnd because it was like at the apex of this, what is this judges and dragons thing?\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nAll of this urban legend started emanating out of this kid's disappearance.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nIt was like, you know, they played Dungeons and Dragons in the steam tunnels underneath the college's campus.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nAnd he was the one with people that was doing this.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nAnd that's why he's disappeared.\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nAnd the whole book is written by this private investigator who specialized in cult deprogramming,\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nwhich was the most recent fad, and now is hopping aboard this one.\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nSo this book is about him hot on the trail of this kid who's disappeared while playing D&D.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nSo he goes and climbs trees and spies on hobbit clubs.\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nLike the Tolkien Society meets in the woods, and he climbs a tree and eavesdrops on them.\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nHe goes into a hobby store and pays the clerk 50 bucks on the slides,\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nand says, hey, can you give me a game of Dungeons and Dragons?\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nAnd he plays in a hotel room, Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nSo Dungeons and Dragons characterizes as like he loses his consciousness and he wakes up on the hotel rooms empty.\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nLike he's just writing all this stuff.\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nAnd then the kid comes back after a couple of days and says, no, I figured out I was gay and I loved heroin.\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nI'm a genius. I got bored.\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nOh, D&D? Yeah, I played that too.\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nThe book literally ends with the kid calling the detective and going, I hear you looking for me.\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nI like that he still wrote the book.\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nThe story must be told.\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nAnd part of it was the note he left didn't match his handwriting and that was always a big like missing puzzle piece.\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nSo he meets the kid in the diner and goes like, but what about the note?\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nAnd he's like, oh yeah, let me show you. And he wrote it with his left hand.\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nWhy'd you do that? Because I thought I would fuck with people.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nBecause I wrote a book.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nI'm a gay heroin addict genius.\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nYeah, I'm bored. I'm bored. The society is run by people like you.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nYour book needed an ending. I'm trying to help.\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nYeah, you're welcome. You're welcome on behalf of everyone in the Manson family,\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nbut you're welcome on behalf of every teenager whose parents got scared that they were into something bad.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nYou're welcome all of you fucking dumb assholes.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nI got bored. I'm smart. It's hard to be smart.\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nI wonder what heroin is like. It seems great.\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nI bet it's the best.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nIt's gotta be fucking wonderful.\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nIt's gotta be better than sex, which is currently the best thing.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nWell, it's gotta be better than a can of Pringles, because I had one of those on the show.\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nSome people call me Pringles, but I never really found out why.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nI don't really have a... I've been singing it all day.\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nSometimes Pringles just fucking comes into my mind.\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nAlso, I was singing Chicken Noodle Dick all day.\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nChicken Noodle Dick, I think, is a good song, and people don't really recognize how good that song is.\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nIt's a good song.\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nSome of the bonus footage is you can actually see us coming up with Chicken Noodle Dick on the bus.\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nThat was my one note with the movie, is that we didn't see the origin of Chicken Noodle Dick.\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nAlso, do they show you trying everything in the bus with that aspirin dick?\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nYou put peanut butter on my dick, and then not peanut butter on my dick.\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nThat sounded weird. Not with, like, a knife.\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nA jar of peanut butter.\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nYeah, I put it on by hand.\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nI brought a Cocker Spaniel and a flashlight and a bottle of aspirin.\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nI don't think... Yeah, whatever.\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nIt's a bonus footage. Check it out.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nLet's thank Sieg for coming by.\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nThank you. Thanks for coming with me.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nIs there anything to plug Sieg?\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nHey, how about the Harmontown prints I made?\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nI'll be here Wednesday selling them and Monomyth here at the store at Meltdown.\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nWednesday night.\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nThank you, Sieg.\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nCan I talk about the Rob Schrab thing?\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nIt's time for our society section.\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nRob Schrab continues his fucking campaign of terror on Twitter.\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nExplain it for people that don't know.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nOkay, so this is what it is. This is what it is.\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nFor instance, someone will tweet something and he will ask them the most off.\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nSo, like, yesterday, a couple days ago, Nathan Fielder, who's very funny,\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nwrote you a tweet, a link, and said, this is a sketch from my show,\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nand he responded, is there a link?\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nWell, that's the level of humor we're dealing with, but it's relentless.\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nIt is relentless.\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nHe's committed to being an obtuse weirdo.\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nSo, like, today, Steve Agee tweeted, who wants a Panasonic DVX100B?\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nAnd Rob Schrab responded, how many B is it?\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nIt's called Schrabbing, and kids around the world are doing it.\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nAnd kids love it.\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nThey call it Schrabbing.\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nThis is another one.\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nSo, I did a really stupid joke, but this is not what the story is about.\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nI just found this just scrolling through the story.\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nI made a stupid joke.\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nIt was late night, and I just said, I just combined two comedians,\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nlike Zach Altonakis and Jack Black, and I said, like, my favorite mashup comedian\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nis Zach Black, or something stupid.\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nIt's not a funny thing.\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nAnd then I...\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nYeah, Jack Altonakis.\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nRob Schrab responds, what are some others?\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nI like...\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000\nThis is what...\n\n01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nThat's an opportunity for a great tweet premise.\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nLook at this.\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nI want 900 of these.\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nI like Jonah Robin Williams.\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nBill Cosby Top.\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000\nBobcat DeGeneres.\n\n01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nWait, these are yours?\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nNo, these are Schrabbs.\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nBobcat DeGeneres.\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nThey don't make sense.\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nHe's just doing random shit.\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nRed Fox Hicks, and then he starts hashtagging it,\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nCamelsbit.\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nThis is my favorite one.\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nCedric the Cherry Seinfeld.\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nCedric the Cherry Seinfeld.\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nHe's the Andy Warhol of tweets.\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nHe really is.\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nHe's drawing a picture of a soup can.\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nSo I tweeted.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nI started...\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nI started rewatching the X-Files, and I do a podcast\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nabout the X-Files on the Feral Network.\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nListen to it.\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nI've heard people connected with the show\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000\ntweeting at me every now and then nobody baked.\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nBut like, you know, periphery.\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nSo this guy who writes the new X-Files comic book\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000\ntweeted at me, he was like, hey, have you read it?\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000\nHis name is Joe Harris.\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nI was like, no, I haven't.\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nI've heard amazing things.\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nRob Schrabbs responds to me, him, and the publisher.\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nWait, does that mean that he's following all of you two?\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nI bet.\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nNo, it's just he's checking your timeline.\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nHe's just checking, and like...\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nHe does it all.\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nHe puts the work in.\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nHe really does.\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nI mean, if you look at his timeline,\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nit's so much work goes into it.\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nSo many disparate targets.\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nLike, he's going after everybody.\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nHe has office hours for this thing.\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nSo I responded, no, I haven't read it.\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nSounds awesome.\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nRob Schrabbs responds to everybody,\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nI heard a cow once.\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nSo I got really angry.\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nIs Rob having a stroke?\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nIs he all right?\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nI heard it's awesome.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000\nI heard a cow once.\n\n01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000\nGreat.\n\n01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nI can't wait for your office hours to be over.\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nSo I got really angry, and I just tweeted.\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nI said, if this tweet gets 200 retweets,\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nI'll block Rob Schrabbs.\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nYeah.\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000\nAnd then it got so many.\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000\nAnd then, obviously, I didn't block him.\n\n01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000\nHe's like, it's not 200, it's 277,\n\n01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nso you still have to be friends with me.\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nSee?\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nSo then this happened.\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nThe next thing, this is the one I wanted to tell you guys,\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nthis is one Dan and I...\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nSo this is how you got into it.\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nYou tweeted that\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nRick and Morty was coming out\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000\non Blu-ray,\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nand he responded on what format?\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000\nFair question.\n\n01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nSo this is what happened.\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nSo then I tweeted...\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nOh, you tweeted. No, I tweeted\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nsomething stupid.\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nI said, it doesn't matter.\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nIt's about Captain America\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nand how he's black and someday won't matter.\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nIt's not a funny tweet. It's one of my, you know,\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nsocial justice tweets.\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nThat's part of my brand.\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nI said something about that, then Dan Hart...\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nYou said, look, whites have a talent for noticing race.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nWe can use it to advance or destroy society,\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nbut if we drop it, then we're out of work.\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nVery funny, very funny.\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nSelf-deprecating, weight-loathing tweet.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nIt's great, and it's me and you talking.\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000\nYes. It's two intellectuals.\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nWe're kind of a daily show level\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nsocial commentary.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nA lot going on.\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nRob Schrupp jumps in with\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000\nI Can Draw.\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000\nThis is his dream, by the way,\n\n01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nis you recounting all this.\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000\nThis is where all the laughter...\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nHe's going to be listening to this,\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000\nand it's like...\n\n01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nI think because he isn't\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nabstractist kind of\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000\nin general,\n\n01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000\nI think he has created\n\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000\na movement here.\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nHe's going through some kind of metamorphosis.\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nHe was at Comic-Con.\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nI came to the Starburns booth, and he was sitting there\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nwith all these old Skud comics\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000\njust to sell them and sign them,\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nand he kept making these comments as people would come up\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000\nand they would go, I really like community.\n\n01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nI'm so glad you got six seasons,\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000\nand then Rob would just go,\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000\nyeah, look who's nose tried.\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nHe was just chiming in\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nwith old...\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nAnd then I was like,\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nman, does anybody have a napkin?\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nBecause I was eating a pretzel with mustard on it,\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000\nand he handed me a copy\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000\nof Skud number one.\n\n01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000\nI was like, here you go.\n\n01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nI was like, what's going on?\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000\nHe's doing this bit where he's like...\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000\nI think he's having...\n\n01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000\nthe transcendence like that Johnny Depp movie.\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000\nYeah, he's crossing over.\n\n01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nHe's crossing over.\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000\nHe came there with a box of comic books.\n\n01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000\nRob doesn't need money.\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000\nEverybody needs money,\n\n01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nbut Rob didn't think he was going to...\n\n01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000\nWhy is he sitting at that table\n\n01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nwith the comic books?\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000\nHe was doing a character.\n\n01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000\nHe's like, we're performance artists now.\n\n01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000\nSo he responded with,\n\n01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000\nRob Schwab just\n\n01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000\ntexted me\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nright now.\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000\nHe's fucking in here.\n\n01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000\nIs he here?\n\n01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000\nHe's inside the building.\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nHe texted me, what's my name on Twitter?\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000\nWhat does that even mean?\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000\nIt's the dumbest question of all.\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000\nHe topped himself.\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000\nThis is like the beginning of Scream.\n\n01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000\nThis is horrifying.\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000\nSomebody must be texting him\n\n01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nand I don't even know him.\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000\nI approve of his humor\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000\n100%.\n\n01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000\nI always enjoy it.\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000\nIt's always perfect.\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nHe used to get mad at me\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000\nfor doing what he called repeat-rooting\n\n01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000\nwhere I would do a bit over and over again.\n\n01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nRob, nice parking and I would keep doing a bit.\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000\nHe's now just doing repeat-rooting.\n\n01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000\nHe just repeat-rooting.\n\n01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nSo he responded with, I can draw\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000\nand Dan responded with hashtag\n\n01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000\nso could Hitler.\n\n01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nAnd we're both,\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nwhich by the way is my favorite hashtag.\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000\nIt trended in Argentina.\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nWell, that was just because\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nof all the World Cup tweets.\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nBoy, these guys can really score a goal.\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nSo, you said that\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nand we were both like smarting from\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000\njust a couple days of just intense stuff.\n\n01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000\nSo then I said\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nthe trains aren't running on time.\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nRob's watched though.\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nSo in a way, Hitler was better than Schrab.\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000\nYou said,\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nwell for one thing, when Goebbels posted propaganda\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nHitler didn't write,\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000\nwhat country is this promoting\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nunderneath it?\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000\nAnd then I said,\n\n01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000\nI said, and when Hitler heard the phrase\n\n01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000\nfinal solution, he wasn't like,\n\n01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nhow many solutions will there be after this one?\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nSo yeah, in a lot of ways,\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nHitler and Schrab.\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nAnd then the next thing he did,\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nhe didn't respond to any of those,\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nand that's where the fucking\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nBill Cosby, Robert Foxx thing happened.\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nAnd I was like, all right, you win.\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nI am never.\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nIs there a way that we can,\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nyou can't subvert what he's doing,\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nbecause the whole thing is subversion,\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nhe comes underneath you.\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000\nIs there a way that this audience right here\n\n01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nthat we can attack Rob Schrab on Twitter and do something?\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000\nPeople are already,\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nthey can't post his tweets or to his comments.\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000\nYeah, he can't post a picture of his dog without\n\n01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nthere being 150.\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nWhat kind of animal is this?\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nThat's just him spreading.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000\nIt's like a virus.\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nI guess the way to do it is to,\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nthe way to subvert him is to co-opt it\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000\nand make it bigger than him.\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nWe should post a standout site.\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000\nWe should call it someone else though.\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nCredit it with someone else.\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000\nWe call it coomailing.\n\n01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000\nWe say that you created it.\n\n01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000\nWe all go after like Cameron Diaz.\n\n01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000\nWe all say that it's your bit.\n\n01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nWhere should we post it?\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nWhere should we post it?\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nI think we should post it.\n\n01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nThis is a sad family.\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000\nAdam Goldberg just got excited and the crowd got\n\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000\nvery bummed out about it.\n\n01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000\nWe should make a huge banner that says\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000\nhey Rob Schrab, where do you live?\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000\nAnd put it like outside his house.\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000\nNo.\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nHow about this?\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nEvery time, just hashtag his phone number.\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000\nOh yeah, that's it.\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nHis home phone.\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nHis cell phone.\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000\nThat's not a thing.\n\n01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nFinal solution.\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nHe's a monster\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000\nand there is no way to defeat him.\n\n01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nHe's a bad person but he's created\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nan art movement.\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000\nHe's like a situation.\n\n01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nI feel like it's spread by this point.\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000\nIt's like\n\n01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nI feel like there's a kid somewhere doing that\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nunderneath a high school friends Instagram\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nwithout any connection to us at all.\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000\nPeople are just going like\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nThere's more.\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000\nThis is what he was doing two days ago.\n\n01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nThis is what he's doing.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000\nWait, he's live testing you right now?\n\n01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nNo, no, no. This is what I found.\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nHe said two days ago,\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nI'll be signing,\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nI'll be signing,\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000\nI'll be taking the booth blah blah blah.\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nNot 391.7 Saturday at 11AM.\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nHashtag SDCC 2014,\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nHashtag SCUD TDA.\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nSomeone said\n\n01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nwill you be at the booth there today at all Rob Schrab?\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nAnd Rob responded\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nI'll be signing slash selling rare SCUD merch\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000\nand original art.\n\n01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000\nHe didn't get the joke.\n\n01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000\nNo, he did.\n\n01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nI said that, I didn't bury the lead.\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nNo, multiple people have responded\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.760\nwith that exact thing and he has copied and pasted the same thing in every\n\n01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:14.480\nresponse. He says the same thing. The hunters become hunted. But then he's become the hunter again.\n\n01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:22.560\nI think he's having a nervous breakdown. He Instagrammed a picture of himself\n\n01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:28.120\nheading home from the con and said like I'm leaving the convention because I'm\n\n01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.560\nhaving such because it was so much fun or something. It was kind of a sad emo\n\n01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.880\nkind of picture of him and I don't know how to seriously to take that. Did he have\n\n01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:41.240\na good time? I don't know. Does he love this new role he's playing? I don't know.\n\n01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.520\nI think he just misses Kate. I think Kate's doing something. He said I'm leaving\n\n01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:49.760\nearly because I miss my wife and dog. He's worthless without Kate and the\n\n01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.360\ndog. If you see him out alone, he cannot wait to get back to that little dog. Oh\n\n01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.520\nyeah, he doesn't like to be like out and about really. Why do you leave\n\n01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:14.920\nearly? That might be the first. All right, I want to bring up a new\n\n01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:22.000\nperson. A new person. Should we slant female? I say definitely. Because we've had\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.440\ntestosterone. There's too many boys on stage right now. We need somebody to play\n\n01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:32.840\nErin McGathy's character in D&D. Do we have any anybody vaguely girly that\n\n01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:37.840\nwants to do it? Oh, we got a hand over here. All right.\n\n01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:52.960\nNot that I see gender. What is your name? Stephanie. Hello Stephanie. Welcome to the\n\n01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.640\nstage. Stephanie or Stephanie? Stephanie, sorry. Stephanie. You didn't go to the\n\n01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:03.880\nconvention? I did not, no. Work? No, it's just kind of expensive. Yeah, they get so\n\n01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:10.120\nhard to get this. And a fucking glass of water over there. I'm sorry I'm so\n\n01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:14.440\nprofane all of a sudden. Shit, excuse me. Fuck, fuck, fuck. We have one garland\n\n01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:23.240\nstadium. Fuck, fuck, fuck, poison ivy. Fuck, grab your ass. What was the\n\n01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:29.360\nexample? Your buffet. $26 for a hotel buffet. $26. You couldn't get water for\n\n01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:35.320\nlike under $3. I hate San Diego. San Diego's a bad place. Oh, it was more hotels\n\n01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.760\nthan anything else really. And hotels are always bad. I thought San Diego was\n\n01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:45.200\nlovely. Never been to Balboa Park. Yeah, but not the downtown in San Diego's\n\n01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:51.000\nwould have a problem. It's really walkable. You can't get up. It's not a... It's so walkable.\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:00.400\nIs it walkable? It is. It's walkable. It's so fucking contagious. Stephanie, where are you from?\n\n01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.440\nI live in LA. Are you born and raised here? No, I am from a small town in the\n\n01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:12.840\ndesert. Which desert? Mojave? Mojave, yes. Ridgecrest, California. Anybody? Nope.\n\n01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:18.640\nIt seems like you're being pursued by a gang or something. You can't get too many details.\n\n01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:24.760\nNo one's from there. Is that out in the desert? No, no, no. Is it? There's a place\n\n01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:30.520\nwith a very similar name to that. That's definitely out in the desert. She just said it from the Mojave desert.\n\n01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:36.200\nNo, sorry, guys. My friend moved out there. He was my best friend. Now we're all in\n\n01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:42.280\nSchrab Alert right now. I was busting out character sheets, guys. Sorry.\n\n01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:47.520\nStephanie, what were you doing? I was busting out character sheets, you guys.\n\n01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.120\nGod, no. Don't let it proliferate. Stephanie, you fled the desert. Now you live in Los Angeles?\n\n01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.760\nYes. And what do you do out here? I'm a web designer. Really? Yes. Fantastic. What websites have you worked on?\n\n01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:05.760\nI used to be a web designer. Oh, nothing good right now. That's what I did.\n\n01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:11.680\nI used to design it. Yeah, it's tough. How do you know when you're finished?\n\n01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:17.120\nYou're never done. Did you go to school for that? I went to school for art, so I have a fine arts degree.\n\n01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:24.560\nAlso, your web pages look pretty. You're more, less programming, more, like, vibe.\n\n01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:32.920\nI mean, vibe and brand is important, but also, like, the efficiency of the website.\n\n01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:39.520\nRight. How does it work? I want to be more of a product designer, but right now I'm just kind of doing the visual design.\n\n01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.680\nProduct designer? Product is in, like, the entire website, the functionality.\n\n01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.240\nOkay. You know, really taking the count of users. Yeah, you're just starting, though.\n\n01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.720\nYeah, I'm kind of starting. Do you believe in God? No.\n\n01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.520\nWell, then nobody's going to help you. I can tell.\n\n01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:01.400\nIt's a bummer. Because, you know, if God wanted us to be on the web,\n\n01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:08.320\nhe would have put mouse cords in our hands. He would have had.com as a button on the keyboard.\n\n01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.600\nYeah. Yeah. Gotta keep typing that shit out all the time.\n\n01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.440\nYou hold control and press O. Fuck you, Adam.\n\n01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:22.040\nWait, okay, no, I'm sorry. You do what? You hold control and press O.\n\n01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:27.240\nControl O? Control enter. Is that a control enter? We're all strong.\n\n01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:33.880\nIs that Mac or PC? Control enter is.com? It's not true. Control enter. Yeah.\n\n01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.880\nFor real? Mac or PC? I don't. I use a PC, but it's probably not.\n\n01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:43.160\nOf course you use a PC. Well, then that's... What does that mean? You're a bad person.\n\n01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:46.120\nYeah. Control O? Control enter.\n\n01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:53.480\nControl enter, I'm sorry. What's control O? Probably open. Open? I think I'll never learn\n\n01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.640\nall the little hot key things that you can do. I think... I watched you type, Dan, one time\n\n01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.160\non the computer. You type and stuff, and you have all these little special commands that\n\n01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:05.240\nyou're making the cursor just duck and dive all over the thing. It was very exciting.\n\n01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.640\nI learned everything I know from watching Swordfish.\n\n01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:13.000\nIs that why you have two computers and you take your shirt off all the time?\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.800\nYeah. It doesn't look as cool, but I always say... There's actually... What's the website?\n\n01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.560\nEveryone should experience this. It's pretty fun. You guys probably already knew about it\n\n01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:28.120\nfrom years ago. It's called Hacker... Hacker... I don't know. Hacker Typer?\n\n01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.960\nHacker Typer. Hacker Typer. Google around about it. It's just a website where it waits for\n\n01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.760\nkeystrokes and then it just generates. So you can just sit here and type on your keyboard and it looks\n\n01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:47.800\nlike you're a super hacker. Oh yeah. It's really cool. Does it have like cubes aligning? That's\n\n01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:52.200\nwhat we thought... No, no, no. It's just code. It's just code. That's how it is on Silicon Valley.\n\n01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.560\nWe just type random shit and it like pops the lights. Yeah. It's really fun. It's like going\n\n01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:03.240\nto a Western saloon set and breaking a bottle over your head. It's just a magical thing that\n\n01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:11.160\nyou get to do. It's pretty cool. I did it for like 20 minutes. But you can do it for real. I'm not a\n\n01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:16.440\nhacker. No, but you could... I can't type. You program. You do HTML? I do HTML, yeah. Do you do\n\n01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:25.160\nPHP? A little bit. JavaScript? Do you use smarty templates? No. I haven't designed a web page since\n\n01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:31.880\n1999. Is that a real thing? Smarty templates were awesome back in my day. Do you use MS\n\n01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:41.880\nprint shop? I don't. Do you use Mario Paint? All right, Spencer, distribute our character sheets\n\n01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.280\nif you would. All right. I would. So Stephanie, you're going to play the role of Malran Sedona.\n\n01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.120\nAre you familiar with that? A little bit. A little bit. Now, I did not listen to the last\n\n01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:56.120\nepisode. So what happened as Spencer... I haven't listened to it. We wisely did a side mission\n\n01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:02.280\nbecause we had Duncan up here. So all he wanted to do is cut off Kumail's nipples. Duncan wanted\n\n01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:10.200\nto assassinate Kumail's character so much. His is a different culture. He cut my nipples? I have\n\n01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:15.960\nsome theories. We did like a side... It was like a what if Marvel comic. Is that canon? Are my nipples\n\n01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:24.520\nstill there? Who knows? It felt like a one-off. We were playing ourselves and we just ran out\n\n01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:29.240\ninto traffic and we were like flipping cars over. Spencer not met a gaming or side barring,\n\n01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:35.240\nbut my cactus card from the cactus bunch, we never found out about, right? Well... Did I ever\n\n01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:42.600\nfind out about it? You found out... What? It's a card. It's a card, but what does it entitle me to?\n\n01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.240\nWho knows? I guess you didn't find out. And also, I have a strange painted stick\n\n01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:55.160\nthat we don't know about. You sure do, man. Okay. Okay. Stephanie, are you ready to join us on what\n\n01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.520\nthreatens to be the greatest D&D in podcast history? Sure. All right. Yeah, don't worry about that\n\n01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:06.680\ncheat so much. It's like a jumping off point. I'll just drink a lot and then ignore it completely.\n\n01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:17.800\nThat's a... She's drinking water. I'm drinking water. I'm also only 18. I can't even drink. That's a lie. That's a lie.\n\n01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:25.800\nYou're 18? No, I'm 25. Oh, god damn it. That was really bad joke. All right. We're all going to jail.\n\n01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:36.360\nSpencer, take us away. Last time on Harmon Town, our heroes were shitting in the purple caverns.\n\n01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:43.320\nAfter a wild goose chase by Tylenol with Codeine, they found and destroyed three magical gem\n\n01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:49.640\ncreatures, then went through a crack. It was in that crack that the gang encountered a black dragon,\n\n01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:55.480\nand after great discussion and harassment, our heroes woke the dragon, but luckily ran away\n\n01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:01.000\nbefore it could attack. Leave in the cave and blinking in the sunlight, Sharpie saw a shape\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:07.320\non the horizon, a great black airship. It was one of Admiral Darkstar's vessels. The airship\n\n01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:13.160\ncrashed into the canyon walls, ejecting flaming goblins across the wreckage site, and after\n\n01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.760\nslaughtering two of the flaming passengers, Sharpie bagged the last one in his bag of holding.\n\n01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:23.720\nExamining the flaming vessel for loot, Quark discovered a crystalline disc, and realizing\n\n01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:30.440\nits nature, used the unit to power on the robot baby. But would the robot be peace-loving or\n\n01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:36.920\nbuilt for war? Could our heroes navigate their way out of the purple canyons? Are bags of holding\n\n01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:44.280\nfireproof? Where was Tylenol with Codeine? Find out on this next episode of an all-new Harmon\n\n01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:54.280\nTalent Time episode.\n\n01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:59.080\nSo we have a flaming goblin in the bag of holding right here. I mean, who knows? That's what I said,\n\n01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:03.640\nI think. It's in the bag of holding, right? Sure. And the robot baby's awake. Oh, yeah.\n\n01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:10.040\nSeeing, yeah, you find yourself in the purple caverns. The robot baby is slowly but surely\n\n01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:16.280\npowering itself on. As you look, you feel arcane energies coalescing in the air around you,\n\n01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:22.760\nand as your threads of light seem to be streaming from the ground in air converging upon the baby,\n\n01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:28.520\nit activates its eyes glow bright blue and all the energy absorbs inside of its metal shell\n\n01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:33.080\nwith a twinkle. It gets up onto its feet and looks around, and it's like,\n\n01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:43.640\nunit active, diagnostic complete, logic core damaged. Hello. Swipe to unlock.\n\n01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:54.040\nI swipe the baby. Hello. You guys aren't gnomes. I'm a gnome. You guys are a gnome.\n\n01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:02.840\nBut you guys aren't. I'm confused. You're just a baby. What's your name, little fella?\n\n01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:11.480\nLogic damaged. That's a strange name. What? What's your name? Logic damaged.\n\n01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:17.320\nWell, I have to give him a name. His name is Logic damaged. Logic damaged. What?\n\n01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:23.400\nYour name is Logic damaged. Oh, my name is Logic damaged.\n\n01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:29.880\nWhat is your prime directive? Prime directive.\n\n01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:36.440\nMy prime directive unlocked the secret gate of Logic damaged.\n\n01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:43.080\nResting place of Logic damaged. What are you guys doing?\n\n01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:50.920\nThat's a good question. I feel like that's important information. We're just kind of like,\n\n01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:55.560\nwe kind of roam from town to town, generally kill people, forget to loot them. We're kind of\n\n01:32:55.560 --> 01:33:01.160\nfaggabonds. We set things on fire mostly. I don't really, I guess that's fine.\n\n01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:08.520\nWe stole you. Oh, these are all normal things? Yeah, totally normal. Very admirable traits.\n\n01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:16.840\nCan I call you a Lodgy? Whatever you want. Listen, Lodgy, how do we restore your logic,\n\n01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:23.880\nthe part of the syntax, the code that doesn't compute? I don't know. I don't know how I'm put\n\n01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:31.400\ntogether. Well, can we talk about the location that you're supposed to go to to find the resting\n\n01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:36.360\nplace of the thing that you don't remember? I don't know where it is or what it is. Who has\n\n01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:45.480\nLogic Arcana? What? Of us. Because he's spoken like Arcane Logic or Arcane Knowledge Arcana.\n\n01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:51.560\nArcane energy is coming off of it. It's true. Knowledge of Arcana. That'll teach you of its\n\n01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:55.720\nmagical nature, perhaps. I don't have it. I have a sticky that says Robot Plans.\n\n01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:03.560\nYeah, Robot Plans. Oh. Could we look at the Robot Plans? Or is that Plans we make? Is there\n\n01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:09.560\nsome code we can hack? You look at it. You see some various words, but you can't read it, I guess,\n\n01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:14.680\nbecause it's there maybe in Gnomish. I take the Robot Plans and read it. All right. Most,\n\n01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:18.440\nyou can't read a lot of these words, too, because they're weird jargon. But a couple places, you\n\n01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:24.920\nsee a couple of areas by the forehead that say Logic. Those are the words you can make out.\n\n01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:32.120\nOn the baby's forehead? On the Plans. Oh, it's like a drawing of the baby. Yeah, the Robot Baby\n\n01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:40.760\nPlans. I examine the baby's forehead. It looks normal, I guess. I do have knowledge of Arcana,\n\n01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:47.880\nlike a 13 skill bonus. I mean, that doesn't, we don't care, do we? Well, it mostly is about\n\n01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:55.320\nmagic. So if you're questioning, like, oh, wow, what kind of magic animated this guy? Yeah. I mean,\n\n01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:04.120\nany insights there? What's it, plus 13? Yeah. You determine that it's, you know, a golem. It's\n\n01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:09.080\nnot any other type of automata. It's definitely a golem, which means it's infused with some sort\n\n01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:16.280\nof living soul. Is that a Jewish thing? Well, yeah, actually, I mean, technically speaking, yeah,\n\n01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:22.120\nJewish. So it's like a Jewish baby? It's like a Jewish muppet. We should probably circumcise it,\n\n01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:29.480\nright? It doesn't, we've been over this, it doesn't have a penis. Oh, so somebody already fucked that\n\n01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:41.400\nup. Is it a lady? Is it a baby? It doesn't seem to have a gender, really. Your location that\n\n01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:48.840\nyou're supposed to go to, were you supposed to go to it with others? I don't know. Was it on this\n\n01:35:48.840 --> 01:36:00.040\nplane of reality? Yep. So it's a geographic location? Yep. And you, but you don't know where it is? Yep.\n\n01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:06.520\nWould you, would you, would you know if you got closer to it? I don't really know. Probably.\n\n01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:14.040\nMaybe. I don't know. Maybe not. No. Well, are you, are you programmed with a map that, that,\n\n01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.920\nthat tells you where to go or are you programmed with a sensor that like, like makes you sense when\n\n01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:25.720\nyou get closer to this place? I don't think either of those things really. Have you been awake before?\n\n01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:32.280\nIs this your first time awake? No, I have not, sir. Hey, I like this guy.\n\n01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:42.120\nHow many of you are there? I don't know. I'm of me. Are you programmed for battle?\n\n01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:50.600\nI don't, what? No, what? Can you hurt people? Maybe. How would you do that? We should test\n\n01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:57.720\nit self-defense by trying to kick it and see what it does. So, okay, well, what do you want to do?\n\n01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.440\nWell, I'm not doing that. Can I try it? I'm a gnome. I'm not kicking this baby.\n\n01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:09.000\nI'm going to try and kick the baby just to see, just to see if it's a fighting baby. I think this\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.360\nis a bad idea, but I, maybe it's a fighting baby and this is how we find out. Okay. All right.\n\n01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:25.560\nHey, uh, uh, Lodgy, uh, and then I, I kick you. What's your strength here?\n\n01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:34.520\nI don't kick at full strength. Okay. 13 plus one. All right. Well, uh, you kick it and it just falls\n\n01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:43.640\nover. Jesus Christ. Oh my God. Jesus. I scoop it up in my arms and start crying. Oh my God.\n\n01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:51.160\nIt's not a fighting baby. Jesus. Not a battle baby. This is normal, right? Yep. Please forget\n\n01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:55.480\nabout this. Lodgy, Lodgy, this is not normal. I take it down to a river and then there's all\n\n01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:01.560\nkinds of flashbacks of what my dad did to me and I'm freaking the fuck out and I'm just like crying\n\n01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:07.720\nand like rocking back and forth. Um, it's called stimming what I'm doing. What, what about this,\n\n01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:11.960\nthis Admiral Darkstar vessel that crashed into the, uh, the caverns? It's on fire.\n\n01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.720\nAnd so all the goblins came out of that and we, we killed a couple. Yeah. Well, Tylenol with\n\n01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:23.240\nCodeine, um, he stomped on one and he killed the other one. And we have one in the bag of holding.\n\n01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:28.920\nYeah. And it's on fire. Uh, what? He was on fire when we put him in there. The goblin was on fire.\n\n01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.400\nYeah. Right. Somebody take this baby. I give it to a court. Can I have the baby? I'm going to give\n\n01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:39.480\nit to the gnome. No, you keep kicking the baby. I just kicked the baby once. You kick one baby.\n\n01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:46.120\nMulraine, wait. Mulraine, go ahead. Baby cause I'm a woman. Okay. So it's my duty. Is that sexist?\n\n01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:53.320\nIf I give it to him, it's racist. What is it if he give it to me? A fucking practical danger.\n\n01:38:53.320 --> 01:39:01.240\nAn actual measured, scientifically proven danger. Let's give it to Mulraine. Mulraine holds the baby.\n\n01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:05.640\nAll right. I give it to Mulraine, but, and I'm going to pull this goblin out of the bag of holding.\n\n01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:13.320\nAll right. It's time to get enhanced about our interrogation. Okay. All right. Jack Bauer business.\n\n01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:23.800\nOh. Bored some water. Has the lamp been invented yet? Yeah. Yeah. Wait, which kind of lamp?\n\n01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:31.960\nOne with a dimmer switch? No. I mean, we have enough weapons, enhanced interrogation is not\n\n01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:39.800\ngoing to be a problem. All right. All right. So as you pull them out of your hand, it burns,\n\n01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:49.640\nyou know, because the goblin's on fire. Ow. Is it still on fire? Yeah. Yeah. You take\n\n01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:56.200\nSchrabbing? No. I just, my characters thought you reached it. I take my water skin and douse\n\n01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:06.920\nthe goblin. Well, Sharpie takes five fire damage and you smell the smells of burning wood and\n\n01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:13.640\nfibrous items coming from inside the bag of holding. Ah, fuck. What does that mean? I put my\n\n01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:18.760\nhead and hand into the bag of holding. No, no. I got to put out the fire. Okay. Well, I take my\n\n01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:23.560\nwater. Hey, I have a weird theory. Maybe it's a fire putting out baby. Let's toss in.\n\n01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:31.960\nYou guys are, it could be a, give you lady, give the baby to the gnome. No, you just lost your\n\n01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:39.400\nbaby privileges. I take the baby, I take the baby and protect the baby. He could be a fireman\n\n01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:46.440\nbaby. He's a robot baby. And we tried to kick it and we succeeded. Listen, and I feel terrible\n\n01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:51.880\nabout it. These, these are the, the imprinting moments of a robot baby's wife. It's learning.\n\n01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:59.320\nIt doesn't know its name. Now its name is Robert Loggia. It's not Robert Loggia. So could we tell\n\n01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:05.160\nhim that he fights fires? Well, not if, not if he's not good at it. I, I take the baby, I said,\n\n01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:10.840\nbaby, we got to, we got to, we got to fire a situation. Oh, great. No, bad. That's bad. You\n\n01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:16.120\njust said, you earlier said that that was completely normal to do to towns and cities. Oh, no. Okay,\n\n01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:24.280\nyeah, look. Oh, no. What are we doing to this baby's mind? This is like three men and a baby.\n\n01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:32.040\nUm, I said, do you have any firefighting skills, baby? How do you fight the fire? I don't, I'm\n\n01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:37.720\nasking you. Clearly doesn't. Okay. Sharpie, you're going to put your, you're going to look into the\n\n01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:43.160\nbag. I'm going in the bag with my, and I'm going to cast Ray of Frost on any existing fire. All\n\n01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:48.040\nright, you put out any existing fire and the rest of the smoke puts a, you know, comes out, but\n\n01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:55.320\nbring a frost. Some of your used to be popular. Some of your items is not like a kind of a low\n\n01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.320\nlevel spell, but that turned out pretty good. Yeah. But it gives a job done. What got lost?\n\n01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.320\nSome of your items are damaged. Which, which ones? I don't know. Nice to your sheet.\n\n01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:10.360\nWell, I already crossed everything off. I think. Oh, so, so you, everything that was in the bag\n\n01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:16.120\nof holding caught fire and now it's all bullshit. I put a burning goblin in her bag of holding.\n\n01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.160\nWas the goblin alive? I wasn't, I don't remember. Well, as it happens, everything flammable was\n\n01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:26.200\nnot in the bag of holding. It was in a backpack. Okay, good. So there's a, there's a, maybe some\n\n01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:31.800\nburning happening in the inside of the bag that's, you know, maybe there's some bag leaks.\n\n01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:39.240\nGreat. Nothing you can see inside the bag. It's all dark. Get that goblin out, Sharpie. He's\n\n01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:44.360\nalready out. He's out, but he's still on fire, right? Yep. He's still on fire. It's like magic\n\n01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:50.440\nfire. He's like a trick birthday candle this guy. Oh, he's a flaming goblin, like by trade.\n\n01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:56.600\nHe's not just on fire by accident. I mean, whether or not you decide that he's a flaming\n\n01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:03.560\ngoblin by birth or by cultural choice is very controversial. So tread lightly.\n\n01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:13.640\nI prefer to think that he was born this way. That makes it better for you. Oh, yeah. Okay.\n\n01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.880\nWhat do you want to look at it as like a perverse lifestyle?\n\n01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:25.560\nI thought we were talking about a different parallel and now I realize it's gay people. Yeah.\n\n01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:33.320\nWhat did you think I was doing? Black people? Really? I prefer to think black people were born\n\n01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:44.520\nin black. I do. I also would like, but the traits, the specific traits. Anyway, this is us. We're\n\n01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:55.080\ngetting into a real bag of holding over here. I asked the goblin, what was it going on in the\n\n01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:06.200\nAdmiral Darkstar's ship? Oh, what? Did you talk like this too? Hello, goblin. I hope my sword\n\n01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:11.160\nat like in a threatening manner towards his neck. I go, I go, what's what's your story,\n\n01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.720\ncocksucker? You didn't choose to be a cocksucker.\n\n01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:23.560\nThere's nothing wrong with that. I've been watching a lot of Deadwood,\n\n01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:33.160\neverything's gonna be a cocksucker. My name is Justin. Justin. Justin. State your purpose,\n\n01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:40.440\nJustin. I'm a member of the BuzzFace Raiders. The BuzzFace Raiders. Yeah. Our gang is tough,\n\n01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:50.920\nloving goblins. Tough loving. We love tough. Well, you're gonna love sword in your stomach.\n\n01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:55.400\nIf you don't tell me what Admiral Darkstar is up to right now. I don't know who that is,\n\n01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:59.480\nwhat you're talking about. Did you just come off a vessel from Admiral Darkstar? I came off of a\n\n01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:08.360\nflaming ship. It wasn't flaming earlier. The ship bore his mark. Quote unquote, cocksucker.\n\n01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:17.400\nOur brethren liberated the vessel for ourselves. Oh, interesting. We couldn't drive it.\n\n01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:22.200\nOh, so you didn't get shot down. You guys are just bad at flying vessels?\n\n01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:30.920\nWe're not terrible. Looks like you are terrible. I think that maybe there just weren't enough of us.\n\n01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:36.280\nWhere did you get the vessel from? We stole it from the air city. If there wasn't enough of you,\n\n01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:43.000\ncan we all hop on and drive it? Oh, it's all wrecked up, I think. I can't fix it. I'm a pirate.\n\n01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.280\nDo you think the baby could fix it? Maybe it's a ship fixing baby. Maybe it's a ship fixing baby.\n\n01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:53.240\nThat's the purpose of this baby. I put the baby down on the ground and I go,\n\n01:45:53.240 --> 01:46:01.160\nbaby, I grabbed the baby. No. You're not a fit parent. I want to show you guys that I'm a good\n\n01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:06.920\nparent. I'm not going to do anything bad to the baby. I'm sorry I kicked the baby. And I'm not,\n\n01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:12.280\nthis is me showing I love the baby. Okay. And I'm going to be good to the baby. I give you one more\n\n01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.680\nchance with this baby. Oh, I'm good with the baby. All right. So I have the baby. Right. Yeah.\n\n01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.680\nAll right. I want to ask the goblin one question. All right. Where did you get the disk that\n\n01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:30.680\nactivated this baby? That was on the ship. Oh, where did you get the ship? We stole it from the\n\n01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:38.600\nair city. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean to Schrab you. How can we get to the air city? You'd have to fly\n\n01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:46.520\nthere. No, that makes sense. How damaged is the ship? Is it totally unflyable now? Is it\n\n01:46:46.520 --> 01:47:01.720\nall Hindenburg? Too soon? Too late, I think. Too late. Don't kill me. I'm on fire. Do you want us\n\n01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:07.240\nto put you out? Are you comfortable being on fire? If I recall correctly, you tried that multiple\n\n01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:14.600\ntimes. So you're good. I'm on fire, but I can't do anything about it. Are you always on fire?\n\n01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:20.920\nThis is I was not always on fire. We should. Is there more? Do you have no more radio frost?\n\n01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:27.720\nI have my armlet of winter, my armulets. And I go, I'm a little winter. Put this goblin out.\n\n01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:34.280\nCold air streams towards him. And it doesn't put him out. Jesus Christ. I mean, it's,\n\n01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:41.160\nthe guy's, he's fine. Fire. He seems okay. Hey, uh, you know, people go through changes and that's\n\n01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:49.960\npart of it. Do you think that this fire is not going out because of the propulsion system of\n\n01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:57.960\nyour stolen zeppelin? I know. I don't think so. We got hit by lightning, flaming lightning. Oh,\n\n01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:04.520\nit's like a magic fire. You're like cursed or something. Sure. It's like a fire curse. I take\n\n01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:09.800\nthe baby and go examine the wreckage. No, I don't give you the baby. I hold on to the baby. Ask me\n\n01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:16.360\nif you want the baby. Ask me if you want the baby. Christopher, would you accompany me while holding\n\n01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.280\nthe baby and go look at the wreckage of the ship? Because it seems to be that maybe there's,\n\n01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.680\nthis baby has some sort of connection to it. I would love to. Okay. Wasn't that easy?\n\n01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:32.440\nYou're really on edge right now. I just, I'm, I feel bad about, I, I feel bad about kicking\n\n01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:38.360\nwith it. We, we, we probably want to get to this air city, right? Let's go to look at the thing.\n\n01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.400\nI don't know. Do you want to just go everywhere that gets mentioned\n\n01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:51.240\nin a movie? Yeah. Yes. Yes, I do. And here's why Sharpie. Here's why I do want to go everywhere\n\n01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:56.120\nthat's mentioned because we've, we've been to a lot of places. We were, we were in an, in Finifish.\n\n01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:00.920\nWe have been to the like nether worlds, the shadow planes. We've been all over the place.\n\n01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:06.760\nAnd what do we have the show for it? Nothing. Right. We are, I don't want to be wandering the\n\n01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:11.560\nearth or the planes and the realms for the rest of my life. I want to, I'd like to have a little\n\n01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:15.800\nmoney. I'd like to, I'd like to, you know, maybe we'll open a shop one day that sells cigarettes\n\n01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:21.160\nand, and just be a happy gnome. But right now, like we're not getting anything done. I feel\n\n01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:25.880\nlike now we're hitting our stride. And I feel like right now what we do is we follow our nose\n\n01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:31.800\nand we go, we say yes to the universe right now and we loot every fucking person we see.\n\n01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:38.840\nWait, you want to go to the air city to rob it? What? Yes. Yes. Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.\n\n01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:45.240\nBecause look, are we good or are we bad? We've killed a lot of people for no reason. Hey, hey,\n\n01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:51.800\nyou kick baby. No, I'm saying when we earmuffs, baby, now you could talk about the shit we've\n\n01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:59.400\ndone. Now you're protecting the baby. Yeah, it's a baby. Okay. I'm just saying, I think we have a\n\n01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:05.640\nmoral compass right now that we're pretty good about knowing good from evil. But I do say that\n\n01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:12.040\nwhat we've gained over these travels is an ability to ascertain and use that sword to cut through\n\n01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:20.600\nthe bullshit of morality, of good and evil. And I think it's time to start making that money.\n\n01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:27.080\nI feel exactly the opposite way. I mean, I feel like we have been directionless in all of our\n\n01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.480\nadventures. Well, maybe we should just part company then. Like maybe like what are we doing? Listen,\n\n01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.440\nI think, should we all just say fuck it? I mean, okay, how about this? Let's all go home. Where's\n\n01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:42.360\nyour home? I can't remember. Yeah, I don't even I don't I can't remember my phone number where I\n\n01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:47.640\nlive. I don't know what the fuck. I don't know how to like taxi. There's no taxi. We can't go. I do\n\n01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:53.400\nneed to get back home to my father. Yep. Back at the but the Buttsalot. Where is that? Where is the\n\n01:50:53.400 --> 01:51:01.320\nButtsalot tribe? How do we get there in Buttsalotia? How do we get to Buttsalotia? Butz expanse. Where\n\n01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:05.800\nwhere's the butz expanse? Well, I mean, you took some portals. You don't know exactly your\n\n01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:10.200\ngeographic location. I'm saying that we're we're adrift right now. Yeah, but you know what? Now\n\n01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:16.920\nwe have a new anchor. We have a baby. We don't know what's going on. And we don't know. But we\n\n01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:21.560\nwant to give this baby the best life possible. I agree with you. I agree. We've done a lot of wrong.\n\n01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:26.200\nBut now I agree. Right. Christopher with you. Christopher. I agree with you. But we have to\n\n01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:29.960\ngive this baby a life. What sort of life are we going to give them? We're gonna do the right thing.\n\n01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:35.000\nNo more looting. No more killing things. I say enough. Are you saying that we're not if we get\n\n01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.520\nconfronted by bad guys, we're not going to kill them? Listen, it's self defense. Sure. But we're\n\n01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:43.720\nnot going to set red shops on fire because we don't like their prices. I'm not saying I'm not\n\n01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:48.360\nsaying that we're murderers. We go out and there's wantonly killing people. I'm saying that when\n\n01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:53.480\nthe crisis presents itself, yeah, and we have to use violence, we take care of ours. And we loot\n\n01:51:53.480 --> 01:52:00.840\nthe motherfuckers. I mean, I don't like the L word. Here's what I would say. All right, the disc,\n\n01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:05.800\nthe disc that got put into the baby came from the ship. The ship came from the city. The disc\n\n01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:10.680\nhas the information on it. The information is damaged. The disc has something to do with some\n\n01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.480\nwaking place, arresting place, some place of the treasure, the thing the baby's programmed to go.\n\n01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.320\nI have, I think we follow that instinct. We go to this city, we find out who made the disc.\n\n01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:25.560\nAnd it's not, it's not just us saying, yes, everything is mentioned, we go do. I'm saying that\n\n01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:30.600\nby this point, we have to follow our noses. You just gotta stop robbing and raping and\n\n01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:35.880\nwe're not going. We don't, we've never raped. No, I've raped, I've raped. Okay, look. Don't\n\n01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:40.840\nsay the rape word. Old habits die hard. I might rape anything that comes up by.\n\n01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:45.800\nUsually an animal of some sort. Usually a furry creature. Okay, could you just give us like\n\n01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:51.240\nfive before you can go do it so we can not have the baby see you fucking a deer or whatever?\n\n01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:54.840\nI say, because we have a baby with us, I'm going to be on my best behavior,\n\n01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:59.720\nbut we do have to go find Sky City. Okay. All right, we go to the air city to find out where the,\n\n01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:05.240\nwhere the, where the disc got made so we can find out, let this baby fulfill its destiny and make\n\n01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:12.680\nus rich. Yes. How are we going to air city? How? Yeah. We go to ground town, which has gotta have\n\n01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:17.000\na way to get to air city. Otherwise, how would they get there? Yeah, you gotta take a step back\n\n01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:23.960\nto move two steps forward. Is there a place called the ground town? Who are you asking, I guess?\n\n01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:33.400\nIs there a place? I asked the goblin, like where, when you go get to air city, where do you go\n\n01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:39.480\nfirst? How did you get there? We flew there. Yeah. Where do you get the shit that you fly there? Arrow\n\n01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:48.920\nHawks? Arrow Hawks? You fish them out of the sky. What are they? They're all around us. What are\n\n01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:55.960\nthey? They're Hawks. Arrow Hawks. I look up, I examine the sky for Arrow Hawks. You don't see\n\n01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:05.400\nany. Shit. Avenger. Seer. What? See, that's how I think how Animorphs noted Falcon Cries.\n\n01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:16.840\nAvenger, look for Arrow Hawks. Seer. It does. It looks around. It doesn't, it doesn't see any.\n\n01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:22.280\nAre they around in this area or do they habitat a different part of the world? Where I'm from,\n\n01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:28.280\nthey're all around. Where are you from? The hills. Okay, well, how far are the hills? Well,\n\n01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:35.320\nwe flew there. I don't, I don't know. Feels like we need to go to the hills to get an Arrow Hawk\n\n01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:42.200\nto fly to air city. Let's, let's run to the hills. Are those the, do we see hills? You do.\n\n01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:49.480\nNot those ones though. Not those, not those. All right. Okay. What do you say? He said,\n\n01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:53.720\nnot those. The hills where you can see are not the hills that he means. Where did it,\n\n01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.520\nGoblin, do you know how to find an Arrow Hawk? Oh, you know, you find me an Arrow Hawk nest.\n\n01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:06.440\nWhere would you find an Arrow Hawk nest? The tops of the hills. Lead us there. I don't know. We flew\n\n01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:16.280\nhere. It's different down here. I can't see where wet. I want to kill myself. Goblins have\n\n01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:19.560\na lot to tell. Adventure can't accomplish this. Adventure can't find the highest. He's flying\n\n01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:24.040\naround. He's not seeing anything. They're not native to these parts. Airships go fast and far, man.\n\n01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:31.080\nShit. Maybe they're on all the hills. So maybe these hills will have Arrow Hawks on them.\n\n01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:37.720\nI mean, I'm not saying it's amazing logic. Anybody in the crowd have any ideas?\n\n01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:42.600\nI don't think he can fly.\n\n01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:54.760\nYeah. Tylenol with codeines there, by the way, guys. Oh, hello. Kalu Kalei. I have been hither\n\n01:55:54.760 --> 01:56:04.520\nand yon and yon and hither. I was just hanging out with the Jabberwock on Emerald Hills.\n\n01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.720\nTylenol. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've been neglecting you right now. Do you know how to find an Arrow\n\n01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:20.280\nHawk? Oh, yes. Yes. I know many Arrow Hawks in my travels. Take us to one. I will. And now away.\n\n01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:25.960\nAway. He grasps his Emerald of Shadowworlding and phases out of existence.\n\n01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.680\nHe left? Yeah. I feel like that's pretty in character for him.\n\n01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.400\nThat fucking guy. Is he coming back? Hey. We don't swear in front of the...\n\n01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:50.040\nOkay. Don't swear in front of the kick, baby. Okay. New rule, we don't bring up the K word.\n\n01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:57.000\nNew rule? Yeah. New rule. Can we just let that be? Avenger. Return to my arm. Seer.\n\n01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:05.880\nWhere are the most hills? North. I say we go north. Let's go north.\n\n01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:09.000\nNorth. Wait, where are the hills of specific color? Where are you from, Goblin?\n\n01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:15.000\nThey're just... No, they're the same color as this one. Okay. All right. Sorry.\n\n01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:21.240\nHey, no, no, no. Music swells as we walk... We walk north. Time passes.\n\n01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:31.320\nYou see, you see, far off a small village in a signpost that says Rosebook, a tiny little village.\n\n01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:38.120\nPlease don't pillage. Yeah. Can we take this sign seriously? Can we practice? Practice,\n\n01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:43.640\nright? Yes. No. We're in town. We're not... We don't... They're lucky. Look, we never pillaged\n\n01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.360\nshit. We broke his Job's turkey, man. We don't have any fucking money. I don't know what that\n\n01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:55.400\nmeans. I don't like it. We destroy everything we touch. But we don't pillage. We just destroy.\n\n01:57:55.400 --> 01:58:04.200\nOkay. We won't anymore. Pillage implies gain. All right. Let's go and be nice. Okay. We're\n\n01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:12.040\ngoing to the village. We walk into Rosebook. It's slain. Yeah. You walk into Rosebook and be prepared\n\n01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:30.520\nto face all the things it has to offer. It's 10-0-5. No, he wasn't. Cliff Hanger! There we go.\n\n01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:37.080\nLet's thank Stephanie, everybody, for helping us out. Good luck with your web design.\n\n01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:46.040\nLet's also thank Seek Donnelly. Good luck with Mono Myth. Kumail Nanjiani. You can see him on\n\n01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:54.520\nthe Meltdown Show on Comedy Central. Silicon Valley, of course. Spencer Crittenden. The Dungeon\n\n01:58:54.520 --> 01:59:03.480\nMaster with the mostest. I'm Jeff Davis. Your mayor is Dan Harmon. Thank you. I would say,\n\n01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:08.360\nof all cliffhangers, that has to be the most tantalizing. I think we really left the audience\n\n01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:33.480\non the edge of a cliffhanger. Good night all. Drive safely. Or drive fast and take chances.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.001s"],"str_size":[166891]}
