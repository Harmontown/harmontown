Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Thank you.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Welcome back from Comic-Con, thank you for coming back so early.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
How many of you guys went to Comic-Con on this weekend?

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Not so many, okay, they're still out there.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
It's a weird year, I was just talking to Kamel in the back room and it's the first year when they did the Montreal Comedy Festival at the same time as Comic-Con,

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
which means that Montreal must have just been like really jockey road comics and nothing else.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
It must have been a pretty uptight environment, right?

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
You're saying that Montreal draws, or that either one of those draws from the other side of the country?

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
I think that that Venn Diagram's cleavage is prodigious.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
You know, comedy people and whatever, I don't know.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
People go there to promote shit, new TV shows and stuff, whatever, it's not worth discussing.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Just for a laugh though, isn't that kind of on the decline? It seems like it's lesser and lesser over here.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
Oh, you hear that Montreal? It's time for a new country to have a recession.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I don't know, I've only been there once.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
It just seems like you hear less and less about just for laughs or jeepolis or whatever.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Well, you know, they try not to take it too seriously.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
It's right in the name. They never asked for it to be a big deal.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I think that people that organize it take it very seriously.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
So you're saying they're the lying when they say just for laughs?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I think there's a little bit of deception there.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah, right. I mean, yeah, Comic-Con's not really about comics, I guess there's a lie in every name.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Snickers, what are you doing? You're eating it, not laughing at it.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
It's not packed with peanuts, it doesn't satisfy.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
GE doesn't bring anything to life, they make landmines.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
And light bulbs?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, a couple light bulbs.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
So anyways, looking at my Evernote thing, Bob,

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
I want to promote this feral audio thing that we're doing August 5th, 9 p.m. at NerdMelt.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Here comes a bunch of facts. I'm not a great pitchman.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
But it's hosted by me and Aaron, it's going to be here at NerdMelt.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
We're recording a, we're doing a live recording of a comedy album.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I hope I don't need any material.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
It's hosted by myself and my lovely betrothed Erin McGathy.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
There will be appearances by Duncan Tressel, Steve Agee, Brody Stevens,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
and tons of people who have been here on Harmontown,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
who also happen to be part of the Feral Audio Network.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
So come to that. That's August 5th.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
August 5th. What day of the week is it August 5th?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
That's a Wednesday.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
A Wednesday?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Tuesday.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
I discussed it.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Well, no matter what, it's prime going out time.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Just get on your minx stole and pop on down here.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Wednesday or Tuesday, August 5th, 9 p.m.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Bring a, bring a glass of warm milk and the kids.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Dan, right now promise that you're going to prepare some great material for the people.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I'll probably do 10 minutes on the dentist.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
All right. Animal Corner.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Animal Corner.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Give a spiel for Animal Corner.

04:00.000 --> 04:09.000
Animal Corner. All the news that's fit to paw about our furry friends.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Here's the host of Animal Corner.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
The cat's meow.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Dan Furman.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
All right.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
No relation to Mark Furman, the racist detective.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Okay. We're just a cousin, but I am a fan of animals.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I do not.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
There should be a book series called Mark Furman, racist detective.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
All right. Animal Corner.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
So I talked last week about my dog.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
My dog, we are in the age now of animals can watch TV with us.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Erin came home tonight.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
She missed Harvey and she was like, I'm going to watch TV with him.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
She found a new movie franchise with these little buddies.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
You know about these guys?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
They're little puppies that get into adventures.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
They're little buddies franchise.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
They go to space.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Sometimes they're superheroes, something like that.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Am I getting the name right?

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
All right. I'm 50.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Fucking Harvey loves this shit.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
So this is getting weird.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Is this programming for dogs?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Well, it would appear to be.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I think it also seems to be written by them.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
But it's like, Harvey goes nuts.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
The thing that drives him the most crazy is if you tape him on a phone,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
put it on the TV, he goes crazy.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
But he also loves anything.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
We put on animated Garfield trailer.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Garfield movie and he was going nuts about the cats dancing around.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Really?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Yeah. And he does it not for everything.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
You put up footage of John Ritter.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
He goes, okay.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Does he have food?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't care.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And then any animal comes on the screen.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
He goes crazy.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Which John Ritter footage did you put up?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Skin deep.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Skin deep.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
The condom fight.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
You don't like it?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Condom lightsaber fight.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
That's not dog programming.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
No. You would think they would.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah, whatever.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
But even the dogs can be dressed like superheroes or in space outfits.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
There were dog puppies on the moon floating around in space outfits.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And Harvey was going crazy.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
They got to the moon before harm intended.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
I mean, that's more noteworthy.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
It's just a movie.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
First of all, they didn't actually get to the moon.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Okay.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
And also it's just weird that the dog is like looking at the narrative and he, you know,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
he recognizes that it's puppies in the space suits.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I mean, I barely can tell they're puppies.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
How would you describe Harvey's reaction to these dogs?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
He just barks.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
He barks at them and then he tries to look around the other side of the wall to see where

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
this window is looking on these four animals.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
We can't figure out if he's enjoying it or if it's torture.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
His tail's wagging the whole time.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
We'll just go with that.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
But he barks and sometimes he whines a little bit.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
That's what makes him feel a little bad.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Sorry, I'm burping.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
All right.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
That's half of Animal Corner.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
As you know, Animal Corner is a multi-story segment.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Next item.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm sad that we're only halfway through it.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
That means we only have half left.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Rogaine kills cats.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
No.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
The active ingredient, monoxidil.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
I finally have a reason.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I can just go bald in peace.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Wait, have you been using Rogaine?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, I bought some.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I got some online.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And did you kill a cat?

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
No, but our friend Mike Chilean was at Comic-Con and he told me through tears that he didn't

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
know this and who would know this?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
They don't put it on the box.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
It's just a picture of a bald guy crying and then a picture.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
The picture next to it isn't a dead cat.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
It's a guy with hair giving a thumbs up.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
They should put a cat in the background dying.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Did Mike Chilean kill a cat?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
He did?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Did he leave it out?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
No.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
The cats don't.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
It's not like milk.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
It's so dangerous.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It's really toxic to cats.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
They can't metabolize.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
A cat could be near your hair with Rogaine on it.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
They could lick it, inhale it.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Even if they smell it at all, they could have a huge toxic reaction and die.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
What?

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
When Axial is originally being researched as a hypertension treatment, it's a blood pressure

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
medication.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
So babies can have a really bad reaction to it too.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
So you have to be careful.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Who's sniffing your pillowcase?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Who's licking your half insides?

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
Originally it was researched as that?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Then they found out it made hair grow sometimes.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
That's terrible.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
If you make something up, we're going to release your tension.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Also, maybe hair will shoot out of your skin.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Also, a cat might explode.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
So that's it.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Now I can just say, well, I tried to have hair.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
You have hair?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
I have plenty of hair.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I got hair for people to go around.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
If everybody needs hair, come see me after the show.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Wait.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
I'm surprised that you are a person that tried monoxidil.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
You seem like a kind of laissez-faire when it comes to hair.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I don't...

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Laissez-hair, they call it.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
I don't believe...

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
My definition, and this is a little hard.

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
Of course, it's like to define this line, but my line is dishonesty.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
I think if you...

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
And anyone that's listening who does anything that they keep a secret for your own personal

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
group, whatever.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I'm not judging you.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
That's not at all.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
I'm saying my personal definition that would make me unhappy.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
The line that I could never cross is where I was keeping something a secret.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
If I had something on my head, I was like, oh man, I can't even tell anybody anything.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
That's where I can't go.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
But lots of people can and need to do that, and that's great for them.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
So I thought, oh, Rogaine, I don't know.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
It's been around for decades, and maybe it's just standard.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Because I'm a little thin on top, and I just thought maybe if it's preventative, I'll put

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
a little topical mousse on there.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
It's just like...

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
They give you a little can of mousse.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
So I tried it a couple times, but the really cool thing about Rogaine is that it puts in

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
your hand the power to be lazy.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
That's the important thing, because I think the big issue with men losing their hair,

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
I think it's just anything about getting older, slowly melting.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
It's just about control.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
It's just something that you didn't choose to happen on that schedule, and it doesn't

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
really matter when it happens or what's happening.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
It just makes you feel powerless.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
But if you can buy a product that's like, I choose to take control of this.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I don't even think it matters if it works.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Because for me, I bought it, and I used it twice, and I stopped using it.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Thank God for my cat, it turns out.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Really?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah, because I was like, look at me.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I don't fucking shower.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
There's a million things I don't do to make myself look attractive.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
I threw in the towel a long time ago, and it's nice to have a towel to throw in,

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
like a can of Rogaine.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Am I going to bother with this procedure?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
No.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
And then I'm like, yeah, I choose to be bald.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
How many cats have died?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Is there proof?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Six.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
I was just looking it up beforehand, because I didn't want to be libelous or irresponsible,

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
because you know Harmontown is the epicenter of journalistic integrity.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
We have never said a single inaccurate thing.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
Whether we're talking about the Muppets or Israel, we always get everything right,

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
and everyone's always very happy with our reporting.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
By the way, which do you think is more controversial?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
The Muppets or Israel?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Be real.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I would say the Muppets.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah, I bet you'd get in faster hot water talking shit about the Muppets at a party

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
than being critical of Israeli foreign policy.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
I bet you'd get a 50-50 chance, which is going to get you like a social black eye first.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
All right, anyway, just think about it.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Get off my ass.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Some of those movies are shitty.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Just make nine more.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Let's make nine more Muppet movies.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
I think we've almost got it.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
But aren't they always kind of good?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I haven't seen one since Muppets Take Manhattan,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
but aren't they always kind of enjoyable?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I'm a little sick of it.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I'm a little sick of it.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Oh, Muppet Treasure Island's a goodie.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
That's a fucking goodie.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
It's Erin's favorite, and she's got a relationship with it, and I can't say anything bad about it.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
She's not here tonight.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I'm just tired of the Muppets.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
But if you're going to be the Muppets, at least do Robert Louis Stevenson.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Let's take a good property where the story is already intact.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I think that I would agree with Erin.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Erin would agree with you that, yes, that was their biggest success.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
It's just taking existing stories.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I like the Muppets because they hired Charles Groton a lot.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
There was lots of Charles Groton, and the crowd goes silent.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Charles Groton.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Before the face work.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
All right, so Rogan kills your cat's animals.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Are the cats verifiably killed because of Rogan?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Is this an actual news item?

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
I didn't do a ton of research, but I saw...

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
You're going just on Mike Chilling's murder of his own...

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
The Poison Control Center, I think it said somewhere, had six cases of cats having terrible reactions to it.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
But they can just sniff your hair.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Anyways, it's over.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
So if I go bald, it's for humanitarian reasons.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Is that the end of Animal Corner?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
That's the end of Animal Corner.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Yeah, I yelled at Channing Tatum through a closing elevator at Comic-Con.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I just was doing that.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
This is a stolen bit that I got from one of the New York Comedy Sports guys.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
The loading dock elevator door was closing backstage at Comic-Con.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
That's where you're going to see the famous people.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
It's like, because everyone's back there, it's like the tunnel that connects all of the panels.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
So you're just...

13:50.000 --> 13:59.000
Josh Whedon's getting flushed down the same toilet as Stan Lee and fucking Black Widow and whoever's doing anything.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
So you see him...

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I was dressed as a bird the whole time.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
And then I saw Channing Tatum in a loading dock elevator, and the doors started to close.

14:08.000 --> 14:16.000
And just as they almost finished closing, I did a little elevator bit I learned from our friends in New York Comedy Sports.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I ran towards the door, panicked, and said,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Soylent, greatest people!

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Just anything really is just...

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
Elevator doors closing, like what would make you worry if you just had heard it?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
You're assuming Channing Tatum knows that film?

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Is that a safe assumption? Do we know Channing Tatum?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It's not why I did it.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I did it so I could tell these people.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
I was like, I bet Channing Tatum is laughing his film-loving ass off right now.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Did you get a reaction?

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
No, you don't get... you eschew the reaction.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
There's no final moment when he's going up and he looks down and he goes,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Oh my God, I'll never see you again.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
It's a blind joke.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
I throw it, not a blind joke for blind fans, it's a blind, blindly offered joke.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Do you have a blind joke? Like for actual blind people?

15:07.000 --> 15:14.000
This blind guy just walks into a wall and the bartender says,

15:14.000 --> 15:22.000
Hey, look out!

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Sorry, blind people.

15:24.000 --> 15:31.000
I called you blind people and not Jeffrey, Suzanne,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
You're human beings without sight.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
You don't need to be dehumanized like that, so you're not blind people.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's weird.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
If you were blind, you wouldn't mind being called a blind person, would you?

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Well, I'm really strong of character.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm not one of these weak blind people.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
I'll say, when you lose one of your senses, you become weaker of character.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
I don't know if you've heard that...

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
He's talking to you, Jeffrey and Suzanne.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
You weak blind people.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Your other senses gain strength, but your character in general weakens.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
You become a worse person.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Would you rather be deaf or blind if you had to pick?

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
I think I... well, I don't want to be willy-nilly about that.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I think I would rather be blind.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Really? You'd rather lose sight than hearing?

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah, and I know humans are 90% visual creatures.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
We're these primates that need to see the function,

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
but psychologically, we really need to be connected to each other.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
Deaf communities, they're very...

16:38.000 --> 16:51.000
It's much more passionate, because being deaf is a really divisive experience.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
It puts a bigger wall between you and the person next to you than being blind.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
If you're blind, you have this impairment,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and you can handle it however you want to,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
but you can still hear and talk to the people around you.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Deafness, especially before the internet, was like a really, really...

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
It really just isolates you.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Human beings can't be isolated. It makes them feel terrible.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Anyway, so I assume I wouldn't be able to suffer that very well.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I need to be able to talk to people.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
I can't do this job blind. I'm not saying...

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
If you're listening, God, do not make me blind to prove that it's hard.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm not questioning how hard it is.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
I just think that I could do a lot of the things that I enjoy doing blind.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Then I would finally...

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
Oh, because you're the guy that hates sunsets and bridges and shit.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
And also, I'm always forgetting, if you're blind...

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
This sounds like I'm doing blind jokes or something.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm not really doing that.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I'm just thinking in my head, like, if you're blind,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
then everyone at every party you go to,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
they have to come up and go,

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
hey, Dan, it's me, Suzanne Johnson,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
which is something that people don't do because I can allegedly see,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
even though I can't recognize their fucking face.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I never remember anybody.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
So, again, God, don't take this seriously in a Twilight Zone way,

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
but it might be kind of a lucky break for me to be blind.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Because you already suffer from face blindness and other kinds of blindness.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
It would make the things that make me a prick a lot more excusable.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
I would rather lose my hearing than my sight,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
because I'm a more visual guy.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I would rather see things and hear them.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And I'm talking straight to God.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
God, I fucking dare you.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Strike me blind.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
I was backstage in an event where Channing Tatum, again...

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Again?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I was sad that that story had only one accent.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Please tell me there's more accents to that story.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I was near Jamie Lannister.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Oh, shoot!

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Whatever his name is.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That hunk of sex.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
And Aaron and I saw him.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
I really hope Aaron doesn't mind me telling the story.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
She's not here. She won't listen to me.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Aaron saw him and she said,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Jamie Lannister's over there and I was like, whoa, holy shit.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
And then we were like, wow, that's fucking Jamie Lannister.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
It's really weird to see him.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
And then Aaron said, man, he looks good.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
And I was like, you know, there's a level of truth to that

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
that supersedes jealousy.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I was like, yeah, he does look really good.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
And this is Aaron just expressing how good he looked.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I don't want to get her...

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I don't know if she'd be mad at me telling this.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
She says, yeah, he's standing next to Channing Tatum

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
making him look like a big bag of puke.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
What's wrong with that?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Channing Tatum's eyes are too close together.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I don't like that fucking guy.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Jamie Lannister is fucking sexy as fuck.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
When I first saw Game of Thrones, I was like,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
that guy, he's almost like exhilaratingly good looking.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
That guy could kick my 10-year-old kid out a window anytime.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
Anytime? He could fuck my sister.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I'd watch him fuck his sister.

20:06.000 --> 20:13.000
I would let him fuck my sister with my chopped-off hand.

20:13.000 --> 20:22.000
I'd take his chopped-off hand to a movie.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
A Channing Tatum movie and just make fun of it.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Who's this ugliest piece of shit?

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Looks like a fucking pumpkin.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
I just think Aaron should be able to choose which celebrity

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
goes on record as calling a bag of puke.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
It's not her.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Look, look, anybody standing next to Jamie Lannister

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
is in deep trouble.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Like, I don't care how good looking you are.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You're in deep shit if you're standing next to certain people.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
That guy, he's so good looking that he shouldn't be that good an actor.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
He also is a good actor.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Like, that's fucking terrifying.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Yeah, you know, he's like Spanish or something?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
What is he?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
He's Israeli. I have no idea.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Did you know he's a muppet?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
What is he?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Danish.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Norwegian.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
He's Norwegian.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Swedish. Well, that's close enough.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
He's across the fjord.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Yeah, he's a hunk.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
He's good.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
What a character arc, too.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
You fucking hated that guy and now you fucking root for him?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
It's so funny to watch Game of Thrones

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
other than every once in a while just purposefully remember

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
that the story started with this guy murdering a child

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
because he saw him fucking his sister.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
And you're just like, ah, let's go.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Don't get him, Superman.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
You're looking. You can do no wrong.

21:34.000 --> 21:42.000
It's like, oh, I hope his sword lessons go good today.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
It's a good show.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
It's a good show.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I just started watching Deadwood again.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I let enough time pass.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
When I first watched Deadwood, I don't know about you guys.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Maybe it's not for everybody, but I watched it.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
We used to watch it at my place, your place.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
We'd have little Deadwood parties.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
But I instantly thought, I wonder how many years has to go by

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
for me to watch this again and enjoy it again.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
The answer is no.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm now watching it again and couldn't be happier about it.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
God damn that show.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
I'm kind of ready for a wire rewatch.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
I'll rewatch wire with you any time, man.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
Will you rewatch it with me and Jamie Lannister's hand?

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
If you call my dick the Kingslayer.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Just for no reason.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Those are my criteria.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Well, let's bring out Game of Thrones and society expert,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Kumail Nanjiani.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
I brought you out as soon as I could just to get into the shade.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Did they say the AC was repaired in this place?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh, is that not on?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I think we could...

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I think that's probably...

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
It's on?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I feel like Satchmo.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Maybe I'm just gaining Satchmo?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Louis Armstrong?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Are you going to carry around a little talent?

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
I need like a rag.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Because that is what he was most known for.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
The rag.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Well, I know he played the horn or something,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
but you're like Satchmo without the historical context

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
and the musical ability.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
By the way, I looked it up.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Minoxidil, which is the ingredient in Rogaine,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
is very, very poisonous to cats.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Yeah.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
But only six cases have been reported.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Four of those died.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
But then so many people probably don't report it, like Chileans.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Because cats die.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I think if a cat dies and you also are going bald,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
you don't connect those dots.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
You're like, now I've only got one problem.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
Also, there was a couple of those people

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
who are actually putting Rogaine on their cats.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Like because their cat has a bald patch or something.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Is that true?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
That's what I read online.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Oh, I read that too.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
That's crazy.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Can I say one...

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Okay, no, let's...

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
No, say it.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Say it.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Okay, so this goes back to a little while ago,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
we had a heated discussion about...

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
and I don't want to bring up like source subjects,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
I thought it was interesting about how we treat people

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
who try to talk to us in public differently.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
You want to engage and I don't.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Like at the airport or something.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
You're like, hey, what's your vibe?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
And I'm like, hey, fuck off.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
Nobody wants to be confronted when you're not ready for it.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Right.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
No, but I mean just like engage in conversation.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
And I said, usually when I'm on a plane,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I'll ignore the people trying to talk to me.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
On a plane, fuck everybody.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
I want to pretend that I absolute object

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
for graveyard silence on a plane.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Last week, I was flying back from Atlanta

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
and I sit down and an old lady's going to sit next to me

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
and I help her with her bag.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
And I put the bag up and she says,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
and I'm thinking about what's your approach.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
And she says, I'm sorry, it's really heavy.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
You don't want to know what's in there.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Now you do.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
No, I don't.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
No, I do.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
You want to know, I don't want to know.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Because it's probably a human head.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Well, luckily she needs no prompting.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
She tells me, she's like, it's six pounds of strudel.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
It's for my son.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
So now.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Now I don't want to know anything.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Now I'm at a crossroads.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Am I going to engage her?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Or am I just going to sit silently?

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
And because you were so passionate about it,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I was like, all right, I'll try this.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
And I said, huh, might have to fight your son for it.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
That's what I said.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
OK.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
That's not how I would have approached it.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Well, this is what happened.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
This is how I got fucked.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I have to fight your son for it.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
And she goes, good luck.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
He's six three.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
He's an architect.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
And that's when I knew I was fucked.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Because she was giving out information

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
that had nothing to do with what we were talking about.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
She just wanted to.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
He could build a labyrinth around you.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
I do need to build a labyrinth around.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
They should have to fight minotaurs or whatever.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
And then she talked to me the entire time.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
She said the phrase.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
And when she said, my son's an architect,

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
I loudly kind of said fuck because I knew I was fucked.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
And she twice used the phrase,

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
well, you know the kind of people

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
that the black community holds up as heroes.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
And in my head, I was just strangling Jeff.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
You're out there.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Jeff, you're out there talking to these fucking people.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
You're out there fucking feeding gremlins after midnight.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
And they go out attacking Phoebe Kates.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Phoebe Kates did nothing.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I'm Phoebe Kates.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Why?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
You did it wrong.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
You did it wrong.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
You got her wet.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
You don't get him wet.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You didn't see her.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
She hasn't been wet in a while.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
I don't mean get her wet like Horny.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
She was in her 70s.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
It's been a while.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Part of the art of talking to the stranger

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
is knowing when to and how to engage.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Well, I didn't.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
I just...

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
You can't just go willy nilly and talk about strudel

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
and fight her sons.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I want to fight her sons.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
She had every right to come back with six foot two

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
and architect.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
And then just so much and I would just look at

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
looking straight and I could just see her like looking at me

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
like as soon as he looks at me.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I've got another thing ready to go.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
If you're in a play with somebody who's a chatterbox

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
and you want them to stop talking, here's what you do.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
You look at them.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
I can't be racist to them because that's just going to spur her on.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Yeah.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
You're part of the black community.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Look at them and go shush.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
But it was a smile.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
You go shushy, shushy pie.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Oh, give me a break.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
No, no, no.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
If you ever shush another adult,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
if you put your finger up to your mouth,

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
they go shush, they fucking shut up.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
I'm shooting.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Nobody keeps talking.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
I'm sorry.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
What's your name?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Maria?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Maria?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Shush.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Well, you could also call her a content.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
She'd shut up.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
No, no, no.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Go around doing it.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
You could pull out a gun.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
No.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Yeah.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
No.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
You could say something more racist than her to the point where

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
she thought you were a little extreme.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
If you're on a plan to go, look, you say, look,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I need to take a nap.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
I want to read my book.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Shut the fuck up.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Shut the fuck up.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I was on a plane one time when there was an old guy.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
I mean, when I say old, I'll put him at 68.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
That's my guess on this guy.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
He was one or two rows behind me.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
And he was talking to another guy at the top of his fucking lungs.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
And I got the feeling that he was probably a little bit hard of hearing

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
because he was yelling.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And so the other guy was yelling to him because I think that guy

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
thought he was hard of hearing too.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
So another two guys just for a five-hour flight from New York to LA,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
just, well, you know another thing about fishing.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I got down, I love to go fishing.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
And like everyone else is fucking sleeping because it's 9 a.m.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
and I just stood up and looked at him and just gave the finger to the lips

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
and went shush.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
And it was fucking boneyard silence after that

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
because I'm 6'2 and I'm an architect.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
You can't just talk to everybody.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
That's a real dick move.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
No, it's a fucking plane.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
There's people, everybody else was bummed out.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
Also, no joke, and this is not me grandizing my situation.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
People came up to me during and after the flight on the plane

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
and then at the baggage claim and came up and said, thank you.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
You should have been shush.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And I said, yeah, shush.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
And I said, I'll fight your son.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
You'll fight, you'll fight your son for strudel.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I was doing a bet.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
She loved it.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
You can't just tap a hornet's nest.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
I know.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
You don't rub the lantern, man.

29:57.000 --> 30:04.000
Are we just saying that some of us are good at talking to people?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Yeah.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
And some of us are bad at it, so we don't want to do it.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
We also talked about, and you're talking about that show

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
several Harmontowns ago, Camille, where you were saying that you,

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
I think you were doing a bit where you were saying that you're not gregarious,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
but you are a very gregarious person.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Yeah, but I don't like to talk to people I don't know.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I'm fairly friendly.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Under any circumstances, you're never curious about a stranger

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
or strike up a conversation with a person next to you?

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
Never once have I initiated a conversation with a stranger.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I'm pretty sure.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
So you tried it because of me and you fucking...

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
And look what happened.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
The kinds of people that the black community holds up as heroes.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
You're a curious guy.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
I was in Nashville recently last week where I wasn't here the last time in town

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
and we had a cab driver, it was an Uber.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I'll talk to cab drivers.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Yeah, because that's a stranger.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Yeah, I will talk to them.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And I was in the front seat and everyone else in the back seat

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
and he was kind of an oddball and he was a guy that...

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I think he gave me a business card.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
He is a guy that is absolutely certain that global warming is not happening

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
and he's a filmmaker and also an Uber driver.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
So he's an Uber driver.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
Well, look, lots of filmmakers are Uber drivers, potentially.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
Yeah, that's what... I saw Spielberg the other day.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
He drove into the business.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
He was just a privilege.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
I would rather watch a movie by a guy that used to be an Uber driver or still is.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
But he was saying like, well, you know,

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
80% of scientists are emphatically agree that global warming is not happening.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And I said, is that right?

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
I said, I've heard people say that 90-something percent of scientists agree that it is.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
He goes, no, that's what Al Gore wants you to believe.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
And my movie is called An Inconvenient Lie.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
Ah, yes, he flipped it.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
Why shouldn't he call it a convenient lie?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Maybe...

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
A convenient truth.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I don't know.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
He's between shots right now because, you know, the weather is shitty.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
He can't shoot anything.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
So he's driving his Uber around the air conditioning on.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
But he's saying like, he's like, no.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I said, but aren't like...

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
And I was not going to try to like...

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
I don't have enough information to shout him down about that.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
But I said, but aren't like...

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
Isn't there like satellite imagery of ice shelves falling off

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
and isn't that kind of proof that that's an unprecedented kind of unstoppable rate?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
And he goes, no, no.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
He goes, that's an absolute lie.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
And he was very level-headed about it.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
He said, every time an Antarctic ice shelf falls off,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
one grows in the Arctic Ocean.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Huh?

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
That is very inspiring.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
And I was like, for real?

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
He goes like, nature has a balance.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
And when one falls off, it creates another ice shelf.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
Like I was like, give me your email address

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
that I have to see this movie.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
I want to premiere that movie about the guy that is certain

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
that humans not only don't have an impact on the environment,

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
they couldn't.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Has he been making it already?

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Or he wants to make it?

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
I got the feeling that this is almost like it's done.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
They're in post on this.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Oh, yeah?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Huh, yeah.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
I want to see it.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
I want to see it, too.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Yeah, I really want to see it.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
But if you didn't talk to strangers,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
you would never know that there's a guy that is certain

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
that scientists all agree that humans are having no impact on the environment.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I'm sure there are guys like that out there.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I just don't want to really talk to them.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
But if they make a movie, I'll watch it.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Then how would you know about it?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
About the movie?

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
I'm friends with you.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
You're our emissary.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Go out and collect the nuggets.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
I find it hard to believe that you could be sitting next to people

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
at an airport or anywhere and not lean over and talk to people.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
You're such a garrulous, friendly guy.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I don't talk to people at airports.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Bullshit, you must.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
I don't.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Not at airports, but at a restaurant, a bar,

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
you don't ever look over and say,

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
hey, you just never strike up conversation?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
No.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Ever.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
No.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Maybe that's why...

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I'm not a stand-up.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
I've never been moved to write jokes, go up on stage and do that.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Maybe that's like a...

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I get it all out.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
To be a stand-up maybe is a thing like...

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Oh, you're getting it out and,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
oh, okay, so if you didn't talk to people, maybe you...

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
I'd be funnier.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
No, you'd be doing stand-up.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
I don't know.

34:39.000 --> 34:45.000
Well, I would like to get a Comic-Con report from the king of Comic-Con

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
2014, Spencer Crittenden.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Hey, guys.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Hey.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Hey.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Whoa.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Hey, Spencer, how you doing, man?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
That was good.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
I thought that vocal was someone yelling at me.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
What vocal?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
The vocal in that song that was playing.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
The song is called Loudmouth by Ray Kondo.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
It sure was.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Comic-Con.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Yeah, what happened?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Give us the scoop.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Uh, my feet hurt.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Did you enjoy yourself?

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Yeah.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Give me a...

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
What was your highlight?

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Is there a highlight?

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I got to play Super Smash Brothers.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
The new one is Mega Man.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
That's all I've ever wanted to do with my entire life.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It was great.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
It was great.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
The convention was packed, packed more than ever.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
And there was more than ever sign saying you couldn't do stuff.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And more than ever, people telling you what to do.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
And it was kind of a bummer.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
And where I remember there used to be booths where it's all like,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
oh, get a free USB drive.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Here, have a free sticker.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Now it's like, win a raffle to get a sticker.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
And it's just, like, it's getting cheapened.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
There was a new development this year that was just,

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
if I hadn't crossed a threshold in my head where I was like,

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
look, I'm just another rich douche here promoting things.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
I'm not going to look at myself as one of the nerds anymore.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
I'm looking at myself as an exploiter of nerds.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I've got two shows I'm promoting here.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I'm getting driven around in SUVs.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Let's be real.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
My experience at Comic-Con, if it's good, is great for me

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and not for anyone else in particular.

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
It was one thing that I let get to me as a nerd of old,

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
which was just like, now they just station these guys

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
who I couldn't describe any way else other than to just call them gym teacher types.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
Because, I mean, I don't know who else goes into security at a convention center.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
And they're peppered every 30 feet throughout the convention center

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
and they're literally just yelling at a sea of nerds,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
keep it moving.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
And they do it indiscriminately when people are moving,

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
when there's heavy traffic areas, when there's no people in a mile.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
So we already know you can't sit on the floor at Comic-Con,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
which used to be, this is my big thing that I always had a problem with.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
I went to SuperCon in Miami, I went to New York, Comic-Con.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
You can still see what is a beautiful thing to me,

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
which is this is our people, this is the way we pray.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
We buy a bunch of shit with our enormously disposable income

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
because no one's dating us.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
We consume the fuck out of stuff.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
And when we get exhausted from buying your shit,

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
we plop our fatasses down on the carpet against the nearest stretch of wall

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
and we look through it until we can get a bit of strength

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
to take another surge through this stuff

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
and we're dressed like the monopoly guy and pirates and spider people.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
And it used to be, and then I was like,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
okay, you can't sit on the floor anymore.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Okay, well yeah, that's because Bruce Willis' PR team's coming through

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
and now I'm part of that problem too, so I dropped that.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I dropped that passion.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
If you want to sit on the floor, go to New York.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
But keep it moving, keep it moving.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I can't fucking move.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
I'm doing too much money for me to move.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That's fucking crazy. Keep it moving.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
That's exactly what a gym teacher says.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
In that vein, a lot of the traffic signals were shut down

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
and they had traffic enforcement directing traffic and stuff.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
And I always thought it was pretty weird

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
because they call them traffic enforcement officers,

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
but they're really more like traffic naggers.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
They just tell you what to do and if you don't, they're like,

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
doh! And then just everyone continues doing it,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
like what they're going to do.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
They don't actually stop people. They never sight anyone.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
There's like five people at the same intersection.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
You think one of them can go tackle someone.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Like, it wouldn't be that hard.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
They're not really enforcing anything.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
Yeah, I saw a lot of mob rule happening at the crosswalks,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
which is kind of a nice thing.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
People just crawling under the cross arms on the railroad track.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
Well, did you see that accident that happened and this family of deaf people

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
got beat up by nerds at Comic-Con?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
What?

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
This happened yesterday.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
So there was a...

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
An accident?

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
There was a...

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Damn deaf people.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
So you chose wisely.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
But they were driving a car,

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
which would be significantly more challenging if you were blind.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
So they were waiting at a crosswalk

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
and it was the zombie run was happening.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
So this guy had little kids who couldn't hear.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
Then suddenly, people in amazing like zombie outfits keep coming by

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
and these kids start freaking out.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
It's taking a long time.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
So he starts like nudging his car forward

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
because there's no rule.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And they started attacking the car

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
and breaking the windshield and stuff.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
What?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Yeah.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
And then so he like tried to get away and hit an old lady.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Why was an old lady there?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
I don't know, but she broke her arm

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
and nobody died, but...

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Oh man.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
But I saw it.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
It's funny because I was over at a pizza place

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
watching like that procession go by

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
and then it kept being interrupted by all these emergency vehicles

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
and that's what that was.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Yeah.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
They were going to attend to that.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
But it was funny because you see this parade

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
and then it gets like pushed off into the sidewalk

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
and then they keep going like nothing happened.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
I became part of that.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I was kind of bummed out about it.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
It seemed like all of the...

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
There's just a sea of what I perceived as San Diego natives

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
who are all eating at restaurants

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
with their cameras out watching

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
really extra slow nerds walk by them.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
And I was like part of this fucking parade.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I'm like this is the worst.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
I'm hungry, not for human flesh.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
I'm going to meet people.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
But I couldn't...

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
You can't like knock over a stroller with a zombie baby in it

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
and I'll blow them by.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I do love going though, even with all that.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
You see when the people are dressed up and stuff.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
It's very exciting.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
There's still a lot of passionate people around

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
and they're getting yelled at by gym teachers.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
But they're still there.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
I had a great time.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
I mean again, as I say, big asterisk at the top of all this.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
I've become some strange protected elitist astronaut.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
I land at Comic-Con and I'm handled now.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
I'm escorted to the place I need to be.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Parts of the convention center that nobody gets to see.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Like behind the thing.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
I get to see Channing Tatum in an elevator and do bits.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
So for me, everything was seamless.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
And every single person I'm meeting is someone who is moved

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
to speak to me because they so admire me.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
So it's like my experience is like...

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
It's insanely biased.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
But I was a really great Comic-Con.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Do you think you could sit down and someone wouldn't tell you to keep it moving?

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
No, I don't.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Well, there was a moment.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Like after I finished the adult swim signing, it was kind of weird.

42:05.000 --> 42:10.000
Like I was sort of like, I was fat, old guy, my gray stringing hair.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
And I had had like Vodka delivered to me while I was signing stuff

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
by Justin's assistant.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
Tomorrow, thank you, tomorrow.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
And I was done with the signing and it was like,

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
no one cared that I had a glass of Vodka on the rocks at the signing table.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
And so, and then when it was over, I just kind of wandered off with it.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
So for a moment there, I was kind of just strolling through the exhibit hall

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
with this cocktail in my hand.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
And I did kind of feel like the king of something.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Because there was no, nobody was telling me, you're not allowed to do that.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And it's like, of course you can't have like glassware.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Yeah.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
But it was filled with booze.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
I was like, I felt like Dean Martin or something.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I don't know if I, last year this happened,

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
I don't know if I talked about it here, but women have like a different experience

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
that women like get groped and stuff, that happens, I was walking with Emily.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
A Comic-Con?

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Yeah.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Well, there was a new thing there this year.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
I mean, it's not a new thing, a new awareness of it.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
What's the Twitter handle?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Cosplay is not consent.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Well, Cosplay is not consent is the slogan.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
There's a Twitter, there's a Twitter account.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Is it really a thing?

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Cosplay is not consent.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
No, it's not.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Yes, all women.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
But women like dress up in cosplay and guys think it's okay to treat them like,

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
you know.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Like cartoons.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Like cartoons, yeah.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Well, not that.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Well, they objectify them.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Like not people, yeah.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
If a girl's dressed as poison ivy, then obviously it's okay to just run up to her

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
and go like, hey, how are you?

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
Or let me get a picture without actually engaging them like a human being

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
because they're dressed as poison ivy.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
But you said that they're actually being handled and groped.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
There's reports of that.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Yeah, well, last year I was walking and it was me and Emily who were walking.

43:51.000 --> 43:58.000
And Emily was like, this guy keeps, like, she felt, she's some guy like sort of,

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
was like really close to her.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
His crotch on her, like weird, yeah.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
So I looked back expecting like a huge crowd, but it was just me and Emily

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and then one guy behind her.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
And no one else around, just the three of us walking

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
and I was like, what the fuck, dude?

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Yeah.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Just mounting her as you're walking around?

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
Well, I mean, it was Jamie Lannister, so he was fine with it.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
No, it was like me and her and just like one dude behind it.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
When I looked, he went away, but we just expected like to be a huge crowd

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
and people getting pushed around.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
But is it Geeks for Consent?

44:36.000 --> 44:44.000
Yeah, that was the Twitter thing I was looking at in the limo ride home

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
from my privileged flying saucer that I hover over.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Yeah, Geeks for Consent.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
It's a small group of people from what I've been able to gather

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
from reading their updates and things.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
What it is, is that San Diego Comic-Con, as an official PR perspective,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
they don't want to create the idea that this is a problem,

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
so they'd rather just wait until something terrible, whatever their position is.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
And that's what this group is running up against.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
They're saying, can we just add, can we make the one formal step

45:18.000 --> 45:28.000
of adding official, thorough anti-harassment language to the Comic-Con guidelines?

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
What constitutes it and how it'll be dealt with and all that stuff?

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
I think they have like one sentence in there that's like, don't harass people.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
Is it for all women or just for women that choose to dress up in cosplay outfits?

45:39.000 --> 45:45.000
I would guess all women, I wouldn't think you'd have to dress up as Sailor Moon to not be sexually harassed.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
You know what I mean? I bet it would be all women.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I think it's just all human beings.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
I think as with anywhere, you're allowed to feel safe.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
If you choose to dress up as a character, you're not necessarily saying to strangers

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
that they have an elevated level of permission with you in a social context.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
They're just saying, that makes perfect sense to me.

46:05.000 --> 46:15.000
All this group is asking, can you please add that language to the big long list of warnings

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
about don't wear your Google glasses when you watch the next Hugh Jackman movie at the panel.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
They're very thorough about that.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
What will happen to you in anti-piracy and stuff?

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
Not so thorough about just letting somebody know, don't run up to Sailor Moon,

46:28.000 --> 46:34.000
throw your hand around her waist, take a selfie, talk to her like she's Sailor Moon.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
It's a person and yeah, that's it.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
I thought that was interesting as our world keeps changing under our feet.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
Spencer, did you have a low light of the Comic-Con?

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
Yeah, I'm like to shame Hasbro Incorporated.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
It's high time, man.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
Yeah, they had this situation where they had a booth that was like a store,

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
like many other stores in the Comic-Con situation,

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
but this booth was special because in order to get the privilege of lining up

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
in the ridiculously long line to buy the merch,

47:12.000 --> 47:19.000
you had to get these tickets elsewhere at a completely different place like at 6 in the morning.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
And that's before the Comic-Con even opens.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
So it's like get to Comic-Con three hours before they open so you could get a ticket

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
so you could stand in line to buy this shit and it was a bummer.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
What were you planning to buy from Hasbro?

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
Promotional magic cart stuff because Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
so they own magic and stuff.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
It's a bummer.

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
But on a highlight related note, I got to go to a weird magic event hosted by Geek and Sundry

47:46.000 --> 47:53.000
and I got to play magic with just some new players, but also this guy, shit.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
I think his name was Doug Byer, but he's a magic executive guy and I got to see one of them.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Did they know who you were?

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
No, no, no. It was cool.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
Did you have any reflected celebrity from being a...

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
Yeah, I mean, there was probably about 40 people that stopped me and talked to me

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
from Harmontown or from TV. It was cool.

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
I bet a lot of other dudes with funny tails and big beers also got stopped.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I bet they did.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
We saw you yesterday, no you didn't.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
There was about three or four people that were like, did I see you?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
And then I was like, I don't know, did you?

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
And then they're like, I don't know. And I was like, do you watch TV?

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
And they're like, no. I was like, well, a lot of people just generally look like this,

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
like with a crazy beard and long hair and glasses and fat.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
They thought you were a Hammurabi.

48:37.000 --> 48:42.000
Yeah. I mean, I have a coat.

48:42.000 --> 48:48.000
I hope I'm not speaking out of term and telling the Justin story, even the elevator.

48:48.000 --> 48:55.000
Justin Roiland, the co-creator of Rick and Morty was really drunk and he got into an elevator

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
and he goes through a curtain.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
He's a great drunk.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
It's great near quotes, you know what I'm saying? He's a big drunk.

49:05.000 --> 49:11.000
And there was a guy in the elevator that was, I think, in a wheelchair.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I'm hearing this story third hand.

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
And he, Justin was just being big and gregarious and stuff.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
And he kind of, he was sort of like putting a hand on the guy's shoulder and saying,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
you know, yeah, isn't that right?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Or whatever, kind of like inviting everyone to the party in the elevator,

49:26.000 --> 49:32.000
kind of like, let's all hang out in the elevator right now and be friends and look at how drunk I am.

49:32.000 --> 49:38.000
And at the third time, the guy said, look, you're really invading my space right now.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
I'm very uncomfortable.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
And Justin was like, oh, shit, sorry.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
He got really quiet.

49:43.000 --> 49:51.000
And then he said, he said, listen, I don't know if you're like a fan of Adventure Time or like that.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
And the guy kind of laughed and said, I know who you are.

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
Oh!

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Oh, shit.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Pack a snap.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Pack a snap.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Wow.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
That could not have gone any worse.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
That elevator just became a crater.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Yes.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
I wouldn't let Jamie Lannister touch me this much.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Wow.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I saw an old friend of ours.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
We haven't had him on the show in a while at Comic-Con.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
And he's looking and feeling great.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
So I told him to come down and I give us a little update because it seems like it's all good news.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
Let's welcome back Seek Donnelly.

50:36.000 --> 50:47.000
Thank you.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
We all remember this guy.

50:49.000 --> 50:54.000
Multiple aneurysm survivor who the last time we saw you.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
We're snuggling.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Oh, yeah.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
You're kind of invading Camille's personal space.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
Hey, I know who you are.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
When I was at Comic-Con, I pressed my junk against people.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
And then when they turned around and go, what are you doing?

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
You go, I survived multiple aneurysms.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
I have earned this.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I played that card, yeah.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
The last time we talked to you, it was very sobering and, I mean, not technically for me,

51:19.000 --> 51:28.000
but emotionally sobering declaration on your part that you had been going to these doctors

51:28.000 --> 51:34.000
and studying you and in the same course, treating you while they studied you,

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
you know, putting coils up your legs and stuff I can't even imagine.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
All I know is Rogaine could kill my cat, so I've got it bad.

51:43.000 --> 51:50.000
And you were told them, let's knock it off because there was a little bit of time that you weren't on the treatments

51:50.000 --> 51:56.000
and then you felt more creative and you were like, I mean, the way that you had put it,

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
or at least the way I've seen articles written about it is that even if it's a crass way of saying it,

52:01.000 --> 52:08.000
you're like, I want to be creative even if it kills me because you're recognizing that you're not getting this treatment anymore

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
and it's sort of like a roll of the dice with whatever's going on in your brain and you,

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
but the effects of the treatment were kind of neutering you creatively.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Am I getting any of this wrong?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
No, that's all exactly what was going on.

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
So you came out here last time and said, all right, no more treatments and off I go

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
and I'm going to go draw stuff and be productive and come what may.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
And so now you can, now you give us the update.

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
Well, yeah, so I mean, my energy level's been up.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
I've been having fewer incidents as far as like blackouts and seizures.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
I still have some, but they're few and far between basically.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
I seem to be thinking a lot more.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
I'm solving like, because a lot of things I do is like I buy puzzles and solve puzzles

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
and like to help, you know, my brain still sponge.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
It's absorbing.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
I build transformers and, you know, and model kits and everything like that.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
So I love doing all that stuff and it keeps the creative juices going.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Now I've found that I can't stop.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I'm getting very little sleep.

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
I'm probably sleeping like three hours a night maybe and I can't shut my brain down

53:12.000 --> 53:19.000
and it's just, it's nonstop going and productive like I'm doing a lot.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
Now a lot more than I did before I had an aneurysm at one time.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
And there are effects that it's having on me, but they're again so far,

53:28.000 --> 53:33.000
few and far between that I'm, I don't know, I seem to be what I've always wanted to be,

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
which is a little super human lately.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Is it a worry that you're not sleeping enough?

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
Like would you like to be able to shut that down a little bit?

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Yeah, I would love to.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
We, we tried a couple of things.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
I actually, a couple, I think it was about a month ago.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
I had sleep deprivation because I was up for a couple of days and then,

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
and then after that I got, you know, some, some stuff to knock me out.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
And then since then I've been, I'll get three hours of sleep at night and then

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
sometimes I'll take an hour nap in the middle of the day.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
But my energy level, like we just did Comic Con last year.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
I think I sat two days out because I was sick.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
This year I, it could have gone three more days.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Really?

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Yeah.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
That's great.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
What about like loud noises and stuff?

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I thought you like, like when you're in big crowds and people are getting kind of loud.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Yeah, I used to walk around with headsets on at cons and I would listen to like

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
water flowing and it would drown everything out.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
Now the noise sounds like water flowing.

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
So even all the yelling and the screaming and the body odor and the everything.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Do your doctors have any, do they weigh in on that?

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
Well, I only have the one neurologist now and he's not,

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
he never gave me advice and stuff on that level.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
It was always the other, the guinea pig doctors.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
Is there anything for them to learn off of this?

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
If I still went to them, maybe.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Really?

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Yeah.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
What's your doctor's take on everything?

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
I mean, he's kind of a pothead.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
So he's like, yeah, transformers.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
He prescribed transformers.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
More transformers.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
I would take three Doritos and call me in the morning.

55:02.000 --> 55:07.000
Do the other doctors try and contact you like an ex-girlfriend or something?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Hey, how are we doing?

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Are you still, you know, with the brain?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Do you just get coffee?

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
No.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
No, I don't, we don't, they don't reach out to me.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Well, that's fantastic.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
What are you up to creatively?

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
Well, I'm working on the book I mentioned that you guys all helped me fund on Kickstarter,

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
Alain Vitao, which is me doing all the different art styles.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
I just recently choreographed a dance for the book.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
Basically, I'm trying to find out what kind of artist I am.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
So every page in the book is a different type of art.

55:36.000 --> 55:43.000
Expressionism, surrealism, sculpting, painting, singing, choreography, filmmaking.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
So it's a very trans-media book.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
So I've been working on that.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
And then I actually premiered my new comic at Comic-Con called Mono Man.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
Well, I was looking at it.

55:54.000 --> 56:00.000
How was your visual memory still where it was?

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
Is that coming back for you, C?

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
For you guys.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Oh, thank you.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Yeah, my visual memory.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
So I've been having more dreams.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
I can remember them.

56:08.000 --> 56:15.000
And I've actually, at Comic-Con, I drew four people came out to me and commissioned me to do sketches for them.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
And only two of them I actually had to look at pictures for.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I actually drew Spider-Man without even looking at them.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I liked seeing a picture of them.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
I was able to know enough in my head to draw Spider-Man.

56:25.000 --> 56:33.000
So I would say, again, it's finally getting past that sponge level and I'm learning.

56:33.000 --> 56:40.000
Yeah, I don't want to go, I mean, I'm going to go out on a limb here, but you know, you ran into me the other day at Comic-Con, you know.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
And you were with a guy who didn't know me, right?

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
So did you recognize me?

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Yes.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Yeah, which didn't happen in the past.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Like at all, right?

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
I mean, sometimes.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
But that's crazy.

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
Yeah, the way I found you this time, I wouldn't have been able to before.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
We were just walking by and I looked over and I go, oh, there's Spencer.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Yeah.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
I'm going to go say hi to him.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
It's amazing.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
Same with Dan.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I mean, same with you.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
Oh yeah, me.

57:06.000 --> 57:12.000
Yeah, when I saw you at the signing and stuff and I saw Dustin too, I just, it's starting to like, I don't know, things are sticking.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
When I see you, I always get the impression that you recognize me and see me and know who I am.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
Well, yeah, because a lot of times what I do is I get things down.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I know you're tall and I know you wear a suit.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
And if I see you at Meltdown.

57:22.000 --> 57:27.000
That does narrow most of the people we hang out with don't fit that.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
Yeah, so if I'm in Meltdown and I see that, I'm pretty much like, or if I'm at a bar and I see that, I like, you know.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
And then also hearing includes you in too, right?

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Yeah.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Yeah, hearing.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
When you say hi.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
How do you recognize me, Sikh?

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Your speech pattern.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Oh, nice.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
Nice side step, bro.

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
We all know what you really do.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
We're going to expunge racism from aneurysm survivors.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
We've got a new strategy about this.

57:58.000 --> 58:05.000
We figured out it's too deeply rooted in society and we're going to start with Sikh and make sure he's not racist.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
This is all your art in here?

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
No, I'm actually the writer of this book.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
So like I said before, I think I told you about it.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
It's really hard for me to find a job.

58:15.000 --> 58:20.000
A lot of people don't want to hire a guy who has memory problems because they're like, hey, did you do that thing yesterday?

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
And I go, what thing?

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
And then it doesn't get done.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
So I have a really great boss who is actually here in the audience.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
I brought him with me.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
His name is Omar Spahi and he started a comic company called OSSM Comics.

58:32.000 --> 58:38.000
And he hired me as an editor and chief for him, which is what I always wanted to do with comics would be an editor.

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
And then he was crazy enough to say, hey, do you want to write one of these comics that we're publishing?

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
So I did.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
I'm a big, you know, like you, a Joseph Campbell fan.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
I wanted to do something I just straight up called it monomyth.

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
It's called a spade a spade and it's the story of Lucifer and Michael in reverse.

58:53.000 --> 58:59.000
So actually Lucifer tells Adam and Eve not to eat the apple and Michael is the angel that falls from heaven.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
So it's like a what if earth book because I'm a big Marvel what if fan.

59:03.000 --> 59:09.000
And it's got a Nerdist.com did a great review on it and a lot of, you know, got a lot of press NPR.

59:09.000 --> 59:16.000
Someone was really nice at NPR and did an interview with me about this and Elan Vitao and soul star.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
So yeah, it's definitely got a lot of controversy.

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
We had, you know, the religious protest protesters outside Comic Con.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
I love those guys.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I made a friend with one of them actually.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Oh yeah.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Yeah.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
Yeah, I recorded a video of him.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
He donated to soul star.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
So you're not all bad.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Those guys are so odd.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
I don't know.

59:33.000 --> 59:44.000
It's like, if you walk by, if you hang out there long enough, there's going to be somebody of equally confusing, equally confusing conviction that starts to yell at them and argue with them.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
And it's like, I don't know what's at stake for either way.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Yeah.

59:48.000 --> 59:55.000
But it's like a guy saying like, you know, why should Jesus have, why should you need more superpowers than Jesus gave you?

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
Like just some doubt.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
It's like, come on.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
What are you taught?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
No one's coming to this convention because they don't want Jesus to be loved.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It's not a convention.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Yeah.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
They're hating Jesus because Superman gets blind.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
How come God can't fuck where it came from?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
What are you talking about?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Have you ever been in there?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Have you ever read a comic book?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
You know what the best origin story was?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Yeah.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I've got a sequel for you.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Reboot this.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Christopher Nolan.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
It's really weird.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
There was a guy who just sat up with a, he had a lawn chair and a boom box.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000
He was just blaring what sounded to me like it was just a bad recording of his church's like rock band or something.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
He just thought he could bathe people in positive energy.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
He didn't regard it as noise pollution at all.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
It's just like, it's already loud here and insufferable and he's just blaring garbage at people.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It's just garbled garbage on a cassette tape.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Now I feel bad because he was blaring the song I wrote for Alain Vitao.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
You're right, Christian Rock music now.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
That's my thing, man.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
What if you found out that was your art?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
That would glow.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Fuck.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Good news, bad news.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
What if you made us all start loving Christian Rock?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That became a new thing.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Then I would be the Antichrist, probably.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Sure, the Antichrist, I mean, you're not a responseer.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
He was just talking about this.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
According to all reports and revelations, the Antichrist, you know,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
his big point of efficacy is going to be that everybody really likes him a lot

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
because he's like really kind of nice and charming.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Yeah, and people might think he's like the Messiah, I think, if I read right.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
So it's just like, well, whatever one looks like the next Jesus, that's get him.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Yeah.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And wait for some shithead that's badmouthing him, too.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And then give that guy your everlasting faith.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
That's quite a problem when you realize it, yeah.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
That is true. That's really funny.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
That's why Jesus doesn't want to come back.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
He's like, they're going to get me again.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
How do you jump into this double dutch?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Red hot peppers, shit.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Do you remember when we were saying that listening to like heavy metal music backwards

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
had like satanic messages in it or whatever?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I just thought it's funny that like Satan is up there, like these are the fucking people.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000
This is what they're doing. They're like sitting around smoking pot, listening to music backwards.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Like they're not like the best, most productive members of society.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
When I was a little kid...

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Their websites are terrible.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
When I was a little kid, there was the D&D report.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
News was talking about people that played this thing called Dungeons and Dragons.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And they were playing it in my town when I was a little kid in Tustin in Orange County.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
There were these big sewers that you could go hang out in if you were a teenager.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
A good turtle?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Yeah, if you were a martial artist turtle.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Which I am.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
But there were reports that there were ritual slangs and there was no...

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Well, that's how the West Memphis 3 thing happened.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
That all came from that kind of fear.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Yeah, it was the Dallas Egbert III, whatever his name was.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It was the kid that went missing from the UCLA.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Now I'm just spreading rumors.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
This was the 80s. There was a kid that went missing.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Dallas Egbert III?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
His name was Dallas Egbert Jr. or something like that.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
There was a book. It's called The Dungeon Master.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
It was published in the 80s by this guy, William Deere, who was a private investigator.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Dallas Egbert... something like that.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
The third, which means someone else's name.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Dallas Egbert IV.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
This is a good enough name.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
If it ain't broke.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
He was a kid that went missing from a college campus.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
He was like one of those worms or archetypes.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
He was there. He was at college way early because he was a genius.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And because he was a genius, he was also kind of, you know...

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
He had wanderlust and rebellion and boredom and stuff, and he just disappeared one day.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And because it was like at the apex of this, what is this judges and dragons thing?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
All of this urban legend started emanating out of this kid's disappearance.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000
It was like, you know, they played Dungeons and Dragons in the steam tunnels underneath the college's campus.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And he was the one with people that was doing this.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And that's why he's disappeared.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And the whole book is written by this private investigator who specialized in cult deprogramming,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
which was the most recent fad, and now is hopping aboard this one.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
So this book is about him hot on the trail of this kid who's disappeared while playing D&D.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
So he goes and climbs trees and spies on hobbit clubs.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Like the Tolkien Society meets in the woods, and he climbs a tree and eavesdrops on them.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000
He goes into a hobby store and pays the clerk 50 bucks on the slides,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
and says, hey, can you give me a game of Dungeons and Dragons?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And he plays in a hotel room, Dungeons and Dragons.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:22.000
So Dungeons and Dragons characterizes as like he loses his consciousness and he wakes up on the hotel rooms empty.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Like he's just writing all this stuff.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And then the kid comes back after a couple of days and says, no, I figured out I was gay and I loved heroin.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I'm a genius. I got bored.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Oh, D&D? Yeah, I played that too.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Jesus Christ.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
The book literally ends with the kid calling the detective and going, I hear you looking for me.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I like that he still wrote the book.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
The story must be told.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And part of it was the note he left didn't match his handwriting and that was always a big like missing puzzle piece.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
So he meets the kid in the diner and goes like, but what about the note?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And he's like, oh yeah, let me show you. And he wrote it with his left hand.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Why'd you do that? Because I thought I would fuck with people.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Because I wrote a book.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I'm a gay heroin addict genius.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Yeah, I'm bored. I'm bored. The society is run by people like you.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Your book needed an ending. I'm trying to help.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Yeah, you're welcome. You're welcome on behalf of everyone in the Manson family,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
but you're welcome on behalf of every teenager whose parents got scared that they were into something bad.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
You're welcome all of you fucking dumb assholes.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I got bored. I'm smart. It's hard to be smart.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I wonder what heroin is like. It seems great.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I bet it's the best.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
It's gotta be fucking wonderful.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It's gotta be better than sex, which is currently the best thing.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Well, it's gotta be better than a can of Pringles, because I had one of those on the show.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Some people call me Pringles, but I never really found out why.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I don't really have a... I've been singing it all day.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Sometimes Pringles just fucking comes into my mind.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Also, I was singing Chicken Noodle Dick all day.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Chicken Noodle Dick, I think, is a good song, and people don't really recognize how good that song is.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
It's a good song.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Some of the bonus footage is you can actually see us coming up with Chicken Noodle Dick on the bus.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
That was my one note with the movie, is that we didn't see the origin of Chicken Noodle Dick.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Also, do they show you trying everything in the bus with that aspirin dick?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
You put peanut butter on my dick, and then not peanut butter on my dick.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000
That sounded weird. Not with, like, a knife.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
A jar of peanut butter.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Yeah, I put it on by hand.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I brought a Cocker Spaniel and a flashlight and a bottle of aspirin.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I don't think... Yeah, whatever.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It's a bonus footage. Check it out.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Let's thank Sieg for coming by.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Thank you. Thanks for coming with me.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Is there anything to plug Sieg?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Hey, how about the Harmontown prints I made?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I'll be here Wednesday selling them and Monomyth here at the store at Meltdown.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Wednesday night.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Thank you, Sieg.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Can I talk about the Rob Schrab thing?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
It's time for our society section.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Rob Schrab continues his fucking campaign of terror on Twitter.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Explain it for people that don't know.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Okay, so this is what it is. This is what it is.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000
For instance, someone will tweet something and he will ask them the most off.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
So, like, yesterday, a couple days ago, Nathan Fielder, who's very funny,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000
wrote you a tweet, a link, and said, this is a sketch from my show,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
and he responded, is there a link?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Well, that's the level of humor we're dealing with, but it's relentless.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It is relentless.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
He's committed to being an obtuse weirdo.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So, like, today, Steve Agee tweeted, who wants a Panasonic DVX100B?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And Rob Schrab responded, how many B is it?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000
It's called Schrabbing, and kids around the world are doing it.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And kids love it.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
They call it Schrabbing.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
This is another one.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
So, I did a really stupid joke, but this is not what the story is about.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I just found this just scrolling through the story.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I made a stupid joke.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It was late night, and I just said, I just combined two comedians,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
like Zach Altonakis and Jack Black, and I said, like, my favorite mashup comedian

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
is Zach Black, or something stupid.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
It's not a funny thing.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And then I...

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Yeah, Jack Altonakis.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Rob Schrab responds, what are some others?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I like...

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
This is what...

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
That's an opportunity for a great tweet premise.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Look at this.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I want 900 of these.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I like Jonah Robin Williams.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Bill Cosby Top.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Bobcat DeGeneres.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Wait, these are yours?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
No, these are Schrabbs.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Bobcat DeGeneres.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
They don't make sense.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
He's just doing random shit.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Red Fox Hicks, and then he starts hashtagging it,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Camelsbit.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
This is my favorite one.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Cedric the Cherry Seinfeld.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Cedric the Cherry Seinfeld.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
He's the Andy Warhol of tweets.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
He really is.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
He's drawing a picture of a soup can.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
So I tweeted.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I started...

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I started rewatching the X-Files, and I do a podcast

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
about the X-Files on the Feral Network.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Listen to it.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I've heard people connected with the show

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
tweeting at me every now and then nobody baked.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
But like, you know, periphery.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So this guy who writes the new X-Files comic book

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
tweeted at me, he was like, hey, have you read it?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
His name is Joe Harris.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I was like, no, I haven't.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I've heard amazing things.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Rob Schrabbs responds to me, him, and the publisher.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Wait, does that mean that he's following all of you two?

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I don't know.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I bet.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
No, it's just he's checking your timeline.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
He's just checking, and like...

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
He does it all.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
He puts the work in.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
He really does.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I mean, if you look at his timeline,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
it's so much work goes into it.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
So many disparate targets.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Like, he's going after everybody.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
He has office hours for this thing.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
So I responded, no, I haven't read it.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Sounds awesome.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Rob Schrabbs responds to everybody,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I heard a cow once.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
So I got really angry.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Is Rob having a stroke?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Is he all right?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I heard it's awesome.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I heard a cow once.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Great.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I can't wait for your office hours to be over.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
So I got really angry, and I just tweeted.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I said, if this tweet gets 200 retweets,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I'll block Rob Schrabbs.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Yeah.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And then it got so many.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And then, obviously, I didn't block him.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
He's like, it's not 200, it's 277,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
so you still have to be friends with me.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
See?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
So then this happened.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
The next thing, this is the one I wanted to tell you guys,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
this is one Dan and I...

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
So this is how you got into it.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
You tweeted that

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Rick and Morty was coming out

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
on Blu-ray,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
and he responded on what format?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Fair question.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
So this is what happened.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So then I tweeted...

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Oh, you tweeted. No, I tweeted

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
something stupid.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I said, it doesn't matter.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
It's about Captain America

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
and how he's black and someday won't matter.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
It's not a funny tweet. It's one of my, you know,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
social justice tweets.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
That's part of my brand.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I said something about that, then Dan Hart...

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
You said, look, whites have a talent for noticing race.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
We can use it to advance or destroy society,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
but if we drop it, then we're out of work.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Very funny, very funny.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Self-deprecating, weight-loathing tweet.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
It's great, and it's me and you talking.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Yes. It's two intellectuals.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
We're kind of a daily show level

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
social commentary.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
A lot going on.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Rob Schrupp jumps in with

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I Can Draw.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
This is his dream, by the way,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
is you recounting all this.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
This is where all the laughter...

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
He's going to be listening to this,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
and it's like...

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I think because he isn't

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
abstractist kind of

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
in general,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I think he has created

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
a movement here.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
He's going through some kind of metamorphosis.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
He was at Comic-Con.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I came to the Starburns booth, and he was sitting there

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
with all these old Skud comics

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
just to sell them and sign them,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
and he kept making these comments as people would come up

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
and they would go, I really like community.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I'm so glad you got six seasons,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and then Rob would just go,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
yeah, look who's nose tried.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
He was just chiming in

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
with old...

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And then I was like,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
man, does anybody have a napkin?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Because I was eating a pretzel with mustard on it,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
and he handed me a copy

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
of Skud number one.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
I was like, here you go.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I was like, what's going on?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
He's doing this bit where he's like...

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I think he's having...

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
the transcendence like that Johnny Depp movie.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Yeah, he's crossing over.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
He's crossing over.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
He came there with a box of comic books.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Rob doesn't need money.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Everybody needs money,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
but Rob didn't think he was going to...

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Why is he sitting at that table

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
with the comic books?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
He was doing a character.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
He's like, we're performance artists now.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
So he responded with,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Rob Schwab just

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
texted me

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
right now.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
He's fucking in here.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Is he here?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
He's inside the building.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
He texted me, what's my name on Twitter?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
What does that even mean?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It's the dumbest question of all.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
He topped himself.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
This is like the beginning of Scream.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
This is horrifying.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Somebody must be texting him

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
and I don't even know him.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I approve of his humor

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
100%.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I always enjoy it.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
It's always perfect.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
He used to get mad at me

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
for doing what he called repeat-rooting

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
where I would do a bit over and over again.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Rob, nice parking and I would keep doing a bit.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
He's now just doing repeat-rooting.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
He just repeat-rooting.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
So he responded with, I can draw

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and Dan responded with hashtag

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
so could Hitler.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And we're both,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
which by the way is my favorite hashtag.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Yeah.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
It trended in Argentina.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Well, that was just because

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
of all the World Cup tweets.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Boy, these guys can really score a goal.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
So, you said that

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and we were both like smarting from

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
just a couple days of just intense stuff.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So then I said

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
the trains aren't running on time.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Rob's watched though.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
So in a way, Hitler was better than Schrab.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
You said,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
well for one thing, when Goebbels posted propaganda

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Hitler didn't write,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
what country is this promoting

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
underneath it?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And then I said,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I said, and when Hitler heard the phrase

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
final solution, he wasn't like,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
how many solutions will there be after this one?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So yeah, in a lot of ways,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Hitler and Schrab.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And then the next thing he did,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
he didn't respond to any of those,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
and that's where the fucking

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Bill Cosby, Robert Foxx thing happened.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And I was like, all right, you win.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I am never.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Is there a way that we can,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
you can't subvert what he's doing,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
because the whole thing is subversion,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
he comes underneath you.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Is there a way that this audience right here

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
that we can attack Rob Schrab on Twitter and do something?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
People are already,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
they can't post his tweets or to his comments.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Yeah, he can't post a picture of his dog without

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
there being 150.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
What kind of animal is this?

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
That's just him spreading.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
It's like a virus.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
It's amazing.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I guess the way to do it is to,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
the way to subvert him is to co-opt it

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and make it bigger than him.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
We should post a standout site.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
We should call it someone else though.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Credit it with someone else.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
We call it coomailing.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
We say that you created it.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
We all go after like Cameron Diaz.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
We all say that it's your bit.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Where should we post it?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Where should we post it?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I think we should post it.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
This is a sad family.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Adam Goldberg just got excited and the crowd got

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
very bummed out about it.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
We should make a huge banner that says

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
hey Rob Schrab, where do you live?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
And put it like outside his house.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
No.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
How about this?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Every time, just hashtag his phone number.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Oh yeah, that's it.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
His home phone.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
His cell phone.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
That's not a thing.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Final solution.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
He's a monster

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
and there is no way to defeat him.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
He's a bad person but he's created

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
an art movement.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
He's like a situation.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I feel like it's spread by this point.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
It's like

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I feel like there's a kid somewhere doing that

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
underneath a high school friends Instagram

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
without any connection to us at all.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
People are just going like

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
There's more.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
This is what he was doing two days ago.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
This is what he's doing.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Wait, he's live testing you right now?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
No, no, no. This is what I found.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
He said two days ago,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I'll be signing,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I'll be signing,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I'll be taking the booth blah blah blah.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Not 391.7 Saturday at 11AM.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Hashtag SDCC 2014,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Hashtag SCUD TDA.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Someone said

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
will you be at the booth there today at all Rob Schrab?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And Rob responded

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I'll be signing slash selling rare SCUD merch

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
and original art.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
He didn't get the joke.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
No, he did.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I said that, I didn't bury the lead.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
No, multiple people have responded

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.760
with that exact thing and he has copied and pasted the same thing in every

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:14.480
response. He says the same thing. The hunters become hunted. But then he's become the hunter again.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:22.560
I think he's having a nervous breakdown. He Instagrammed a picture of himself

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:28.120
heading home from the con and said like I'm leaving the convention because I'm

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.560
having such because it was so much fun or something. It was kind of a sad emo

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.880
kind of picture of him and I don't know how to seriously to take that. Did he have

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:41.240
a good time? I don't know. Does he love this new role he's playing? I don't know.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.520
I think he just misses Kate. I think Kate's doing something. He said I'm leaving

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:49.760
early because I miss my wife and dog. He's worthless without Kate and the

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.360
dog. If you see him out alone, he cannot wait to get back to that little dog. Oh

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.520
yeah, he doesn't like to be like out and about really. Why do you leave

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:14.920
early? That might be the first. All right, I want to bring up a new

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:22.000
person. A new person. Should we slant female? I say definitely. Because we've had

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.440
testosterone. There's too many boys on stage right now. We need somebody to play

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:32.840
Erin McGathy's character in D&D. Do we have any anybody vaguely girly that

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:37.840
wants to do it? Oh, we got a hand over here. All right.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:52.960
Not that I see gender. What is your name? Stephanie. Hello Stephanie. Welcome to the

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.640
stage. Stephanie or Stephanie? Stephanie, sorry. Stephanie. You didn't go to the

01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:03.880
convention? I did not, no. Work? No, it's just kind of expensive. Yeah, they get so

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:10.120
hard to get this. And a fucking glass of water over there. I'm sorry I'm so

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:14.440
profane all of a sudden. Shit, excuse me. Fuck, fuck, fuck. We have one garland

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:23.240
stadium. Fuck, fuck, fuck, poison ivy. Fuck, grab your ass. What was the

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:29.360
example? Your buffet. $26 for a hotel buffet. $26. You couldn't get water for

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:35.320
like under $3. I hate San Diego. San Diego's a bad place. Oh, it was more hotels

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.760
than anything else really. And hotels are always bad. I thought San Diego was

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:45.200
lovely. Never been to Balboa Park. Yeah, but not the downtown in San Diego's

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:51.000
would have a problem. It's really walkable. You can't get up. It's not a... It's so walkable.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:00.400
Is it walkable? It is. It's walkable. It's so fucking contagious. Stephanie, where are you from?

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.440
I live in LA. Are you born and raised here? No, I am from a small town in the

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:12.840
desert. Which desert? Mojave? Mojave, yes. Ridgecrest, California. Anybody? Nope.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:18.640
It seems like you're being pursued by a gang or something. You can't get too many details.

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:24.760
No one's from there. Is that out in the desert? No, no, no. Is it? There's a place

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:30.520
with a very similar name to that. That's definitely out in the desert. She just said it from the Mojave desert.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:36.200
No, sorry, guys. My friend moved out there. He was my best friend. Now we're all in

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:42.280
Schrab Alert right now. I was busting out character sheets, guys. Sorry.

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:47.520
Stephanie, what were you doing? I was busting out character sheets, you guys.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.120
God, no. Don't let it proliferate. Stephanie, you fled the desert. Now you live in Los Angeles?

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.760
Yes. And what do you do out here? I'm a web designer. Really? Yes. Fantastic. What websites have you worked on?

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:05.760
I used to be a web designer. Oh, nothing good right now. That's what I did.

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:11.680
I used to design it. Yeah, it's tough. How do you know when you're finished?

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:17.120
You're never done. Did you go to school for that? I went to school for art, so I have a fine arts degree.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:24.560
Also, your web pages look pretty. You're more, less programming, more, like, vibe.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:32.920
I mean, vibe and brand is important, but also, like, the efficiency of the website.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:39.520
Right. How does it work? I want to be more of a product designer, but right now I'm just kind of doing the visual design.

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.680
Product designer? Product is in, like, the entire website, the functionality.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.240
Okay. You know, really taking the count of users. Yeah, you're just starting, though.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.720
Yeah, I'm kind of starting. Do you believe in God? No.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.520
Well, then nobody's going to help you. I can tell.

01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:01.400
It's a bummer. Because, you know, if God wanted us to be on the web,

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:08.320
he would have put mouse cords in our hands. He would have had.com as a button on the keyboard.

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.600
Yeah. Yeah. Gotta keep typing that shit out all the time.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.440
You hold control and press O. Fuck you, Adam.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:22.040
Wait, okay, no, I'm sorry. You do what? You hold control and press O.

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:27.240
Control O? Control enter. Is that a control enter? We're all strong.

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:33.880
Is that Mac or PC? Control enter is.com? It's not true. Control enter. Yeah.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.880
For real? Mac or PC? I don't. I use a PC, but it's probably not.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:43.160
Of course you use a PC. Well, then that's... What does that mean? You're a bad person.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:46.120
Yeah. Control O? Control enter.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:53.480
Control enter, I'm sorry. What's control O? Probably open. Open? I think I'll never learn

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.640
all the little hot key things that you can do. I think... I watched you type, Dan, one time

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.160
on the computer. You type and stuff, and you have all these little special commands that

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:05.240
you're making the cursor just duck and dive all over the thing. It was very exciting.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.640
I learned everything I know from watching Swordfish.

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:13.000
Is that why you have two computers and you take your shirt off all the time?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.800
Yeah. It doesn't look as cool, but I always say... There's actually... What's the website?

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.560
Everyone should experience this. It's pretty fun. You guys probably already knew about it

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:28.120
from years ago. It's called Hacker... Hacker... I don't know. Hacker Typer?

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.960
Hacker Typer. Hacker Typer. Google around about it. It's just a website where it waits for

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.760
keystrokes and then it just generates. So you can just sit here and type on your keyboard and it looks

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:47.800
like you're a super hacker. Oh yeah. It's really cool. Does it have like cubes aligning? That's

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:52.200
what we thought... No, no, no. It's just code. It's just code. That's how it is on Silicon Valley.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.560
We just type random shit and it like pops the lights. Yeah. It's really fun. It's like going

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:03.240
to a Western saloon set and breaking a bottle over your head. It's just a magical thing that

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:11.160
you get to do. It's pretty cool. I did it for like 20 minutes. But you can do it for real. I'm not a

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:16.440
hacker. No, but you could... I can't type. You program. You do HTML? I do HTML, yeah. Do you do

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:25.160
PHP? A little bit. JavaScript? Do you use smarty templates? No. I haven't designed a web page since

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:31.880
1999. Is that a real thing? Smarty templates were awesome back in my day. Do you use MS

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:41.880
print shop? I don't. Do you use Mario Paint? All right, Spencer, distribute our character sheets

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.280
if you would. All right. I would. So Stephanie, you're going to play the role of Malran Sedona.

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.120
Are you familiar with that? A little bit. A little bit. Now, I did not listen to the last

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:56.120
episode. So what happened as Spencer... I haven't listened to it. We wisely did a side mission

01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:02.280
because we had Duncan up here. So all he wanted to do is cut off Kumail's nipples. Duncan wanted

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:10.200
to assassinate Kumail's character so much. His is a different culture. He cut my nipples? I have

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:15.960
some theories. We did like a side... It was like a what if Marvel comic. Is that canon? Are my nipples

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:24.520
still there? Who knows? It felt like a one-off. We were playing ourselves and we just ran out

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:29.240
into traffic and we were like flipping cars over. Spencer not met a gaming or side barring,

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:35.240
but my cactus card from the cactus bunch, we never found out about, right? Well... Did I ever

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:42.600
find out about it? You found out... What? It's a card. It's a card, but what does it entitle me to?

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.240
Who knows? I guess you didn't find out. And also, I have a strange painted stick

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:55.160
that we don't know about. You sure do, man. Okay. Okay. Stephanie, are you ready to join us on what

01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.520
threatens to be the greatest D&D in podcast history? Sure. All right. Yeah, don't worry about that

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:06.680
cheat so much. It's like a jumping off point. I'll just drink a lot and then ignore it completely.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:17.800
That's a... She's drinking water. I'm drinking water. I'm also only 18. I can't even drink. That's a lie. That's a lie.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:25.800
You're 18? No, I'm 25. Oh, god damn it. That was really bad joke. All right. We're all going to jail.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:36.360
Spencer, take us away. Last time on Harmon Town, our heroes were shitting in the purple caverns.

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:43.320
After a wild goose chase by Tylenol with Codeine, they found and destroyed three magical gem

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:49.640
creatures, then went through a crack. It was in that crack that the gang encountered a black dragon,

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:55.480
and after great discussion and harassment, our heroes woke the dragon, but luckily ran away

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:01.000
before it could attack. Leave in the cave and blinking in the sunlight, Sharpie saw a shape

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:07.320
on the horizon, a great black airship. It was one of Admiral Darkstar's vessels. The airship

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:13.160
crashed into the canyon walls, ejecting flaming goblins across the wreckage site, and after

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.760
slaughtering two of the flaming passengers, Sharpie bagged the last one in his bag of holding.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:23.720
Examining the flaming vessel for loot, Quark discovered a crystalline disc, and realizing

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:30.440
its nature, used the unit to power on the robot baby. But would the robot be peace-loving or

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:36.920
built for war? Could our heroes navigate their way out of the purple canyons? Are bags of holding

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:44.280
fireproof? Where was Tylenol with Codeine? Find out on this next episode of an all-new Harmon

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:54.280
Talent Time episode.

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:59.080
So we have a flaming goblin in the bag of holding right here. I mean, who knows? That's what I said,

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:03.640
I think. It's in the bag of holding, right? Sure. And the robot baby's awake. Oh, yeah.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:10.040
Seeing, yeah, you find yourself in the purple caverns. The robot baby is slowly but surely

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:16.280
powering itself on. As you look, you feel arcane energies coalescing in the air around you,

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:22.760
and as your threads of light seem to be streaming from the ground in air converging upon the baby,

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:28.520
it activates its eyes glow bright blue and all the energy absorbs inside of its metal shell

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:33.080
with a twinkle. It gets up onto its feet and looks around, and it's like,

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:43.640
unit active, diagnostic complete, logic core damaged. Hello. Swipe to unlock.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:54.040
I swipe the baby. Hello. You guys aren't gnomes. I'm a gnome. You guys are a gnome.

01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:02.840
But you guys aren't. I'm confused. You're just a baby. What's your name, little fella?

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:11.480
Logic damaged. That's a strange name. What? What's your name? Logic damaged.

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:17.320
Well, I have to give him a name. His name is Logic damaged. Logic damaged. What?

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:23.400
Your name is Logic damaged. Oh, my name is Logic damaged.

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:29.880
What is your prime directive? Prime directive.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:36.440
My prime directive unlocked the secret gate of Logic damaged.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:43.080
Resting place of Logic damaged. What are you guys doing?

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:50.920
That's a good question. I feel like that's important information. We're just kind of like,

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:55.560
we kind of roam from town to town, generally kill people, forget to loot them. We're kind of

01:32:55.560 --> 01:33:01.160
faggabonds. We set things on fire mostly. I don't really, I guess that's fine.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:08.520
We stole you. Oh, these are all normal things? Yeah, totally normal. Very admirable traits.

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:16.840
Can I call you a Lodgy? Whatever you want. Listen, Lodgy, how do we restore your logic,

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:23.880
the part of the syntax, the code that doesn't compute? I don't know. I don't know how I'm put

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:31.400
together. Well, can we talk about the location that you're supposed to go to to find the resting

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:36.360
place of the thing that you don't remember? I don't know where it is or what it is. Who has

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:45.480
Logic Arcana? What? Of us. Because he's spoken like Arcane Logic or Arcane Knowledge Arcana.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:51.560
Arcane energy is coming off of it. It's true. Knowledge of Arcana. That'll teach you of its

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:55.720
magical nature, perhaps. I don't have it. I have a sticky that says Robot Plans.

01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:03.560
Yeah, Robot Plans. Oh. Could we look at the Robot Plans? Or is that Plans we make? Is there

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:09.560
some code we can hack? You look at it. You see some various words, but you can't read it, I guess,

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:14.680
because it's there maybe in Gnomish. I take the Robot Plans and read it. All right. Most,

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:18.440
you can't read a lot of these words, too, because they're weird jargon. But a couple places, you

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:24.920
see a couple of areas by the forehead that say Logic. Those are the words you can make out.

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:32.120
On the baby's forehead? On the Plans. Oh, it's like a drawing of the baby. Yeah, the Robot Baby

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:40.760
Plans. I examine the baby's forehead. It looks normal, I guess. I do have knowledge of Arcana,

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:47.880
like a 13 skill bonus. I mean, that doesn't, we don't care, do we? Well, it mostly is about

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:55.320
magic. So if you're questioning, like, oh, wow, what kind of magic animated this guy? Yeah. I mean,

01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:04.120
any insights there? What's it, plus 13? Yeah. You determine that it's, you know, a golem. It's

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:09.080
not any other type of automata. It's definitely a golem, which means it's infused with some sort

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:16.280
of living soul. Is that a Jewish thing? Well, yeah, actually, I mean, technically speaking, yeah,

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:22.120
Jewish. So it's like a Jewish baby? It's like a Jewish muppet. We should probably circumcise it,

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:29.480
right? It doesn't, we've been over this, it doesn't have a penis. Oh, so somebody already fucked that

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:41.400
up. Is it a lady? Is it a baby? It doesn't seem to have a gender, really. Your location that

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:48.840
you're supposed to go to, were you supposed to go to it with others? I don't know. Was it on this

01:35:48.840 --> 01:36:00.040
plane of reality? Yep. So it's a geographic location? Yep. And you, but you don't know where it is? Yep.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:06.520
Would you, would you, would you know if you got closer to it? I don't really know. Probably.

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:14.040
Maybe. I don't know. Maybe not. No. Well, are you, are you programmed with a map that, that,

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.920
that tells you where to go or are you programmed with a sensor that like, like makes you sense when

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:25.720
you get closer to this place? I don't think either of those things really. Have you been awake before?

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:32.280
Is this your first time awake? No, I have not, sir. Hey, I like this guy.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:42.120
How many of you are there? I don't know. I'm of me. Are you programmed for battle?

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:50.600
I don't, what? No, what? Can you hurt people? Maybe. How would you do that? We should test

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:57.720
it self-defense by trying to kick it and see what it does. So, okay, well, what do you want to do?

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.440
Well, I'm not doing that. Can I try it? I'm a gnome. I'm not kicking this baby.

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:09.000
I'm going to try and kick the baby just to see, just to see if it's a fighting baby. I think this

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.360
is a bad idea, but I, maybe it's a fighting baby and this is how we find out. Okay. All right.

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:25.560
Hey, uh, uh, Lodgy, uh, and then I, I kick you. What's your strength here?

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:34.520
I don't kick at full strength. Okay. 13 plus one. All right. Well, uh, you kick it and it just falls

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:43.640
over. Jesus Christ. Oh my God. Jesus. I scoop it up in my arms and start crying. Oh my God.

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:51.160
It's not a fighting baby. Jesus. Not a battle baby. This is normal, right? Yep. Please forget

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:55.480
about this. Lodgy, Lodgy, this is not normal. I take it down to a river and then there's all

01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:01.560
kinds of flashbacks of what my dad did to me and I'm freaking the fuck out and I'm just like crying

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:07.720
and like rocking back and forth. Um, it's called stimming what I'm doing. What, what about this,

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:11.960
this Admiral Darkstar vessel that crashed into the, uh, the caverns? It's on fire.

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.720
And so all the goblins came out of that and we, we killed a couple. Yeah. Well, Tylenol with

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:23.240
Codeine, um, he stomped on one and he killed the other one. And we have one in the bag of holding.

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:28.920
Yeah. And it's on fire. Uh, what? He was on fire when we put him in there. The goblin was on fire.

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.400
Yeah. Right. Somebody take this baby. I give it to a court. Can I have the baby? I'm going to give

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:39.480
it to the gnome. No, you keep kicking the baby. I just kicked the baby once. You kick one baby.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:46.120
Mulraine, wait. Mulraine, go ahead. Baby cause I'm a woman. Okay. So it's my duty. Is that sexist?

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:53.320
If I give it to him, it's racist. What is it if he give it to me? A fucking practical danger.

01:38:53.320 --> 01:39:01.240
An actual measured, scientifically proven danger. Let's give it to Mulraine. Mulraine holds the baby.

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:05.640
All right. I give it to Mulraine, but, and I'm going to pull this goblin out of the bag of holding.

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:13.320
All right. It's time to get enhanced about our interrogation. Okay. All right. Jack Bauer business.

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:23.800
Oh. Bored some water. Has the lamp been invented yet? Yeah. Yeah. Wait, which kind of lamp?

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:31.960
One with a dimmer switch? No. I mean, we have enough weapons, enhanced interrogation is not

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:39.800
going to be a problem. All right. All right. So as you pull them out of your hand, it burns,

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:49.640
you know, because the goblin's on fire. Ow. Is it still on fire? Yeah. Yeah. You take

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:56.200
Schrabbing? No. I just, my characters thought you reached it. I take my water skin and douse

01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:06.920
the goblin. Well, Sharpie takes five fire damage and you smell the smells of burning wood and

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:13.640
fibrous items coming from inside the bag of holding. Ah, fuck. What does that mean? I put my

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:18.760
head and hand into the bag of holding. No, no. I got to put out the fire. Okay. Well, I take my

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:23.560
water. Hey, I have a weird theory. Maybe it's a fire putting out baby. Let's toss in.

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:31.960
You guys are, it could be a, give you lady, give the baby to the gnome. No, you just lost your

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:39.400
baby privileges. I take the baby, I take the baby and protect the baby. He could be a fireman

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:46.440
baby. He's a robot baby. And we tried to kick it and we succeeded. Listen, and I feel terrible

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:51.880
about it. These, these are the, the imprinting moments of a robot baby's wife. It's learning.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:59.320
It doesn't know its name. Now its name is Robert Loggia. It's not Robert Loggia. So could we tell

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:05.160
him that he fights fires? Well, not if, not if he's not good at it. I, I take the baby, I said,

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:10.840
baby, we got to, we got to, we got to fire a situation. Oh, great. No, bad. That's bad. You

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:16.120
just said, you earlier said that that was completely normal to do to towns and cities. Oh, no. Okay,

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:24.280
yeah, look. Oh, no. What are we doing to this baby's mind? This is like three men and a baby.

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:32.040
Um, I said, do you have any firefighting skills, baby? How do you fight the fire? I don't, I'm

01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:37.720
asking you. Clearly doesn't. Okay. Sharpie, you're going to put your, you're going to look into the

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:43.160
bag. I'm going in the bag with my, and I'm going to cast Ray of Frost on any existing fire. All

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:48.040
right, you put out any existing fire and the rest of the smoke puts a, you know, comes out, but

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:55.320
bring a frost. Some of your used to be popular. Some of your items is not like a kind of a low

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.320
level spell, but that turned out pretty good. Yeah. But it gives a job done. What got lost?

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.320
Some of your items are damaged. Which, which ones? I don't know. Nice to your sheet.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:10.360
Well, I already crossed everything off. I think. Oh, so, so you, everything that was in the bag

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:16.120
of holding caught fire and now it's all bullshit. I put a burning goblin in her bag of holding.

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.160
Was the goblin alive? I wasn't, I don't remember. Well, as it happens, everything flammable was

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:26.200
not in the bag of holding. It was in a backpack. Okay, good. So there's a, there's a, maybe some

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:31.800
burning happening in the inside of the bag that's, you know, maybe there's some bag leaks.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:39.240
Great. Nothing you can see inside the bag. It's all dark. Get that goblin out, Sharpie. He's

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:44.360
already out. He's out, but he's still on fire, right? Yep. He's still on fire. It's like magic

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:50.440
fire. He's like a trick birthday candle this guy. Oh, he's a flaming goblin, like by trade.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:56.600
He's not just on fire by accident. I mean, whether or not you decide that he's a flaming

01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:03.560
goblin by birth or by cultural choice is very controversial. So tread lightly.

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:13.640
I prefer to think that he was born this way. That makes it better for you. Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.880
What do you want to look at it as like a perverse lifestyle?

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:25.560
I thought we were talking about a different parallel and now I realize it's gay people. Yeah.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:33.320
What did you think I was doing? Black people? Really? I prefer to think black people were born

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:44.520
in black. I do. I also would like, but the traits, the specific traits. Anyway, this is us. We're

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:55.080
getting into a real bag of holding over here. I asked the goblin, what was it going on in the

01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:06.200
Admiral Darkstar's ship? Oh, what? Did you talk like this too? Hello, goblin. I hope my sword

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:11.160
at like in a threatening manner towards his neck. I go, I go, what's what's your story,

01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.720
cocksucker? You didn't choose to be a cocksucker.

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:23.560
There's nothing wrong with that. I've been watching a lot of Deadwood,

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:33.160
everything's gonna be a cocksucker. My name is Justin. Justin. Justin. State your purpose,

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:40.440
Justin. I'm a member of the BuzzFace Raiders. The BuzzFace Raiders. Yeah. Our gang is tough,

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:50.920
loving goblins. Tough loving. We love tough. Well, you're gonna love sword in your stomach.

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:55.400
If you don't tell me what Admiral Darkstar is up to right now. I don't know who that is,

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:59.480
what you're talking about. Did you just come off a vessel from Admiral Darkstar? I came off of a

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:08.360
flaming ship. It wasn't flaming earlier. The ship bore his mark. Quote unquote, cocksucker.

01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:17.400
Our brethren liberated the vessel for ourselves. Oh, interesting. We couldn't drive it.

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:22.200
Oh, so you didn't get shot down. You guys are just bad at flying vessels?

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:30.920
We're not terrible. Looks like you are terrible. I think that maybe there just weren't enough of us.

01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:36.280
Where did you get the vessel from? We stole it from the air city. If there wasn't enough of you,

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:43.000
can we all hop on and drive it? Oh, it's all wrecked up, I think. I can't fix it. I'm a pirate.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.280
Do you think the baby could fix it? Maybe it's a ship fixing baby. Maybe it's a ship fixing baby.

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:53.240
That's the purpose of this baby. I put the baby down on the ground and I go,

01:45:53.240 --> 01:46:01.160
baby, I grabbed the baby. No. You're not a fit parent. I want to show you guys that I'm a good

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:06.920
parent. I'm not going to do anything bad to the baby. I'm sorry I kicked the baby. And I'm not,

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:12.280
this is me showing I love the baby. Okay. And I'm going to be good to the baby. I give you one more

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.680
chance with this baby. Oh, I'm good with the baby. All right. So I have the baby. Right. Yeah.

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.680
All right. I want to ask the goblin one question. All right. Where did you get the disk that

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:30.680
activated this baby? That was on the ship. Oh, where did you get the ship? We stole it from the

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:38.600
air city. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean to Schrab you. How can we get to the air city? You'd have to fly

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:46.520
there. No, that makes sense. How damaged is the ship? Is it totally unflyable now? Is it

01:46:46.520 --> 01:47:01.720
all Hindenburg? Too soon? Too late, I think. Too late. Don't kill me. I'm on fire. Do you want us

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:07.240
to put you out? Are you comfortable being on fire? If I recall correctly, you tried that multiple

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:14.600
times. So you're good. I'm on fire, but I can't do anything about it. Are you always on fire?

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:20.920
This is I was not always on fire. We should. Is there more? Do you have no more radio frost?

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:27.720
I have my armlet of winter, my armulets. And I go, I'm a little winter. Put this goblin out.

01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:34.280
Cold air streams towards him. And it doesn't put him out. Jesus Christ. I mean, it's,

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:41.160
the guy's, he's fine. Fire. He seems okay. Hey, uh, you know, people go through changes and that's

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:49.960
part of it. Do you think that this fire is not going out because of the propulsion system of

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:57.960
your stolen zeppelin? I know. I don't think so. We got hit by lightning, flaming lightning. Oh,

01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:04.520
it's like a magic fire. You're like cursed or something. Sure. It's like a fire curse. I take

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:09.800
the baby and go examine the wreckage. No, I don't give you the baby. I hold on to the baby. Ask me

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:16.360
if you want the baby. Ask me if you want the baby. Christopher, would you accompany me while holding

01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.280
the baby and go look at the wreckage of the ship? Because it seems to be that maybe there's,

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.680
this baby has some sort of connection to it. I would love to. Okay. Wasn't that easy?

01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:32.440
You're really on edge right now. I just, I'm, I feel bad about, I, I feel bad about kicking

01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:38.360
with it. We, we, we probably want to get to this air city, right? Let's go to look at the thing.

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.400
I don't know. Do you want to just go everywhere that gets mentioned

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:51.240
in a movie? Yeah. Yes. Yes, I do. And here's why Sharpie. Here's why I do want to go everywhere

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:56.120
that's mentioned because we've, we've been to a lot of places. We were, we were in an, in Finifish.

01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:00.920
We have been to the like nether worlds, the shadow planes. We've been all over the place.

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:06.760
And what do we have the show for it? Nothing. Right. We are, I don't want to be wandering the

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:11.560
earth or the planes and the realms for the rest of my life. I want to, I'd like to have a little

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:15.800
money. I'd like to, I'd like to, you know, maybe we'll open a shop one day that sells cigarettes

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:21.160
and, and just be a happy gnome. But right now, like we're not getting anything done. I feel

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:25.880
like now we're hitting our stride. And I feel like right now what we do is we follow our nose

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:31.800
and we go, we say yes to the universe right now and we loot every fucking person we see.

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:38.840
Wait, you want to go to the air city to rob it? What? Yes. Yes. Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:45.240
Because look, are we good or are we bad? We've killed a lot of people for no reason. Hey, hey,

01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:51.800
you kick baby. No, I'm saying when we earmuffs, baby, now you could talk about the shit we've

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:59.400
done. Now you're protecting the baby. Yeah, it's a baby. Okay. I'm just saying, I think we have a

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:05.640
moral compass right now that we're pretty good about knowing good from evil. But I do say that

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:12.040
what we've gained over these travels is an ability to ascertain and use that sword to cut through

01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:20.600
the bullshit of morality, of good and evil. And I think it's time to start making that money.

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:27.080
I feel exactly the opposite way. I mean, I feel like we have been directionless in all of our

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.480
adventures. Well, maybe we should just part company then. Like maybe like what are we doing? Listen,

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.440
I think, should we all just say fuck it? I mean, okay, how about this? Let's all go home. Where's

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:42.360
your home? I can't remember. Yeah, I don't even I don't I can't remember my phone number where I

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:47.640
live. I don't know what the fuck. I don't know how to like taxi. There's no taxi. We can't go. I do

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:53.400
need to get back home to my father. Yep. Back at the but the Buttsalot. Where is that? Where is the

01:50:53.400 --> 01:51:01.320
Buttsalot tribe? How do we get there in Buttsalotia? How do we get to Buttsalotia? Butz expanse. Where

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:05.800
where's the butz expanse? Well, I mean, you took some portals. You don't know exactly your

01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:10.200
geographic location. I'm saying that we're we're adrift right now. Yeah, but you know what? Now

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:16.920
we have a new anchor. We have a baby. We don't know what's going on. And we don't know. But we

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:21.560
want to give this baby the best life possible. I agree with you. I agree. We've done a lot of wrong.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:26.200
But now I agree. Right. Christopher with you. Christopher. I agree with you. But we have to

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:29.960
give this baby a life. What sort of life are we going to give them? We're gonna do the right thing.

01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:35.000
No more looting. No more killing things. I say enough. Are you saying that we're not if we get

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.520
confronted by bad guys, we're not going to kill them? Listen, it's self defense. Sure. But we're

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:43.720
not going to set red shops on fire because we don't like their prices. I'm not saying I'm not

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:48.360
saying that we're murderers. We go out and there's wantonly killing people. I'm saying that when

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:53.480
the crisis presents itself, yeah, and we have to use violence, we take care of ours. And we loot

01:51:53.480 --> 01:52:00.840
the motherfuckers. I mean, I don't like the L word. Here's what I would say. All right, the disc,

01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:05.800
the disc that got put into the baby came from the ship. The ship came from the city. The disc

01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:10.680
has the information on it. The information is damaged. The disc has something to do with some

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.480
waking place, arresting place, some place of the treasure, the thing the baby's programmed to go.

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.320
I have, I think we follow that instinct. We go to this city, we find out who made the disc.

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:25.560
And it's not, it's not just us saying, yes, everything is mentioned, we go do. I'm saying that

01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:30.600
by this point, we have to follow our noses. You just gotta stop robbing and raping and

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:35.880
we're not going. We don't, we've never raped. No, I've raped, I've raped. Okay, look. Don't

01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:40.840
say the rape word. Old habits die hard. I might rape anything that comes up by.

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:45.800
Usually an animal of some sort. Usually a furry creature. Okay, could you just give us like

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:51.240
five before you can go do it so we can not have the baby see you fucking a deer or whatever?

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:54.840
I say, because we have a baby with us, I'm going to be on my best behavior,

01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:59.720
but we do have to go find Sky City. Okay. All right, we go to the air city to find out where the,

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:05.240
where the, where the disc got made so we can find out, let this baby fulfill its destiny and make

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:12.680
us rich. Yes. How are we going to air city? How? Yeah. We go to ground town, which has gotta have

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:17.000
a way to get to air city. Otherwise, how would they get there? Yeah, you gotta take a step back

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:23.960
to move two steps forward. Is there a place called the ground town? Who are you asking, I guess?

01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:33.400
Is there a place? I asked the goblin, like where, when you go get to air city, where do you go

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:39.480
first? How did you get there? We flew there. Yeah. Where do you get the shit that you fly there? Arrow

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:48.920
Hawks? Arrow Hawks? You fish them out of the sky. What are they? They're all around us. What are

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:55.960
they? They're Hawks. Arrow Hawks. I look up, I examine the sky for Arrow Hawks. You don't see

01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:05.400
any. Shit. Avenger. Seer. What? See, that's how I think how Animorphs noted Falcon Cries.

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:16.840
Avenger, look for Arrow Hawks. Seer. It does. It looks around. It doesn't, it doesn't see any.

01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:22.280
Are they around in this area or do they habitat a different part of the world? Where I'm from,

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:28.280
they're all around. Where are you from? The hills. Okay, well, how far are the hills? Well,

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:35.320
we flew there. I don't, I don't know. Feels like we need to go to the hills to get an Arrow Hawk

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:42.200
to fly to air city. Let's, let's run to the hills. Are those the, do we see hills? You do.

01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:49.480
Not those ones though. Not those, not those. All right. Okay. What do you say? He said,

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:53.720
not those. The hills where you can see are not the hills that he means. Where did it,

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.520
Goblin, do you know how to find an Arrow Hawk? Oh, you know, you find me an Arrow Hawk nest.

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:06.440
Where would you find an Arrow Hawk nest? The tops of the hills. Lead us there. I don't know. We flew

01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:16.280
here. It's different down here. I can't see where wet. I want to kill myself. Goblins have

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:19.560
a lot to tell. Adventure can't accomplish this. Adventure can't find the highest. He's flying

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:24.040
around. He's not seeing anything. They're not native to these parts. Airships go fast and far, man.

01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:31.080
Shit. Maybe they're on all the hills. So maybe these hills will have Arrow Hawks on them.

01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:37.720
I mean, I'm not saying it's amazing logic. Anybody in the crowd have any ideas?

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:42.600
I don't think he can fly.

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:54.760
Yeah. Tylenol with codeines there, by the way, guys. Oh, hello. Kalu Kalei. I have been hither

01:55:54.760 --> 01:56:04.520
and yon and yon and hither. I was just hanging out with the Jabberwock on Emerald Hills.

01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.720
Tylenol. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've been neglecting you right now. Do you know how to find an Arrow

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:20.280
Hawk? Oh, yes. Yes. I know many Arrow Hawks in my travels. Take us to one. I will. And now away.

01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:25.960
Away. He grasps his Emerald of Shadowworlding and phases out of existence.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.680
He left? Yeah. I feel like that's pretty in character for him.

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.400
That fucking guy. Is he coming back? Hey. We don't swear in front of the...

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:50.040
Okay. Don't swear in front of the kick, baby. Okay. New rule, we don't bring up the K word.

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:57.000
New rule? Yeah. New rule. Can we just let that be? Avenger. Return to my arm. Seer.

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:05.880
Where are the most hills? North. I say we go north. Let's go north.

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:09.000
North. Wait, where are the hills of specific color? Where are you from, Goblin?

01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:15.000
They're just... No, they're the same color as this one. Okay. All right. Sorry.

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:21.240
Hey, no, no, no. Music swells as we walk... We walk north. Time passes.

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:31.320
You see, you see, far off a small village in a signpost that says Rosebook, a tiny little village.

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:38.120
Please don't pillage. Yeah. Can we take this sign seriously? Can we practice? Practice,

01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:43.640
right? Yes. No. We're in town. We're not... We don't... They're lucky. Look, we never pillaged

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.360
shit. We broke his Job's turkey, man. We don't have any fucking money. I don't know what that

01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:55.400
means. I don't like it. We destroy everything we touch. But we don't pillage. We just destroy.

01:57:55.400 --> 01:58:04.200
Okay. We won't anymore. Pillage implies gain. All right. Let's go and be nice. Okay. We're

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:12.040
going to the village. We walk into Rosebook. It's slain. Yeah. You walk into Rosebook and be prepared

01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:30.520
to face all the things it has to offer. It's 10-0-5. No, he wasn't. Cliff Hanger! There we go.

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:37.080
Let's thank Stephanie, everybody, for helping us out. Good luck with your web design.

01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:46.040
Let's also thank Seek Donnelly. Good luck with Mono Myth. Kumail Nanjiani. You can see him on

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:54.520
the Meltdown Show on Comedy Central. Silicon Valley, of course. Spencer Crittenden. The Dungeon

01:58:54.520 --> 01:59:03.480
Master with the mostest. I'm Jeff Davis. Your mayor is Dan Harmon. Thank you. I would say,

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:08.360
of all cliffhangers, that has to be the most tantalizing. I think we really left the audience

01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:33.480
on the edge of a cliffhanger. Good night all. Drive safely. Or drive fast and take chances.
