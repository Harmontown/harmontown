WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Oh, yeah!

00:07.000 --> 00:26.000
Some Babagius Maximus, Harmontown is now in session.

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
Let's bring out our Game Master Spencer Crittenden in, everybody.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Oh, yeah.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
And the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
We should get some official business out of the way first.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
There's a birthday boy here.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
There's probably multiple birthday boys, but only one had friends that emailed Steve Levy

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
and said birthday boys come into town from Ohio.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
His name is Ian Bowers.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Ian Bowers, are you in the house?

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Raise your hand, Ian, where are you?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Way back there.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Ian Bowers and his business casual Saturday look with no sleeves.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I like that.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
So I wrote a little song for you, Ian.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Ian Bowers, are we singing that right?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
You're from Ohio, correct?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
And you and your gal flew in just for this?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
More or less.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
You could have lied to us and said...

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Well, yeah, they said just for this.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
So I wrote a song.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
What are you going to medieval times to?

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Because a lot of people come to the show just, you know, to knock out other shit.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I wrote you a song.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Dan, you don't have to sing it.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
If your feelings are hurt, maybe you don't sing it.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
This is the phone sound, the lightning we need working.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Ian, what else did you come to LA for?

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
All right, meaning drugs.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Awesome. Are you going to clamor rocks and do acid and stuff?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
No less.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Is the lightning cable audio?

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Oh, yeah.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
Ian Bowers grew his food from the land.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Ian Bowers took a poop in his hand.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Ian Bowers told the truth like a man.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
He said, mama, I just took a poop in my hand.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
And she said, oh, Ian, don't you know, this is how you grow.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
You need to leave Ohio while the harvest moon is low

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
and drive across the land so Dan can use GarageBand to make you understand.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
You got to not poop in your hand.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
You got to use a toilet, Ian, because it's your birthday.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Ian, it's your birthday.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Ian Bowers, it's your birthday.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It's the day you're worth the day.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
It's your birthday.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Second verse is improvised.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Ian Bowers took some pee in a jar.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Drank it down, got in his car.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
With his girlfriend's drove.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And they drove across the land.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
With some beer inside their hand.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
And a pee inside a jar.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
And they rubbed it together.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
And made poopy pee together.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Birds of a Midwestern feather.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Ian and his girlfriend not to objectify her.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Let's let her pass the sexy lamp test.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I think they call it.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Have you heard of that test, Jeff?

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
It seems a little co-dependent if your boyfriend wants to make you

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
drive across the country and drink his pee and poop.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Now, it's called true love.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It's called interdependent.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Two people, individuals that love each other so much.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Will you know when you love somebody truly

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
if they'll eat your poo and drink your pee?

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Darling, won't you come to the Apache Trail

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
and put on your boots and fuck a snail?

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
And they never had to even stop for gas

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
because their car was fueled by the love

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
that comes from drinking each other's poop and pee.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Ian Bowers.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Now, flowers grow for you.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
For your pee and poo.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
For pee and poo.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
In the ring of fire.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
For me and you.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Now, Ian, if you think the people in the fucking medieval times

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
are going to do that for you, you're fucking mistaken.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah, they're going to get a list of everyone's birthdays

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
and then they're going to throw a plastic treasure at you

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
because everyone that goes there, it's their birthday.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
It's a con.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Only this show does what we just did.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Only this show makes you theoretically eat pee and poo.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
So, Jeff, are you familiar with the pill cultures,

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
like the online, like the red pill, the blue pill.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
There's more pills.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, well, it's based on the matrix.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
No, I am not. Hit me to the jaw.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
It's based on the matrix of the blue pill community, man.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah, but, man, those blue pill people are the worst.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
No, we just love it. They're just in the dreamland.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh, man, that's great.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
That's us. We're the blue pill people.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh, boy, yeah.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Because we live in the fucking illusion where, like,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
you know, women are equals and, like, your vote matters.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah, that's great.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Stink tastes good and, like, Joe Pantaleano is a senator

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
or something, I don't know.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And the blue, that's the illusion.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
And then the red pill is, like, the nuance.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
It's the edge. It's the fucking. I see all the levels.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
I see it. I see the hard truths that no one wants to see.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
That's the red pill that's you living in reality.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
But then there's, we were getting confused today

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
because there's also black pill.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Black pill, I think, is when you're,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
I think it's when either pill is just made you insane.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I think if you red pill so much that you disconnect from reality,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
now black pill.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Also, those pills are more likely to be shot by police.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Yes.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
But if you take the red pills, you know why.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Right.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
If you take blue pills, you're like,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
why are the black pills getting shot?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
I don't understand.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Are they Snagopus?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
And then there was something about white pills,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
and I don't know what that is,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
but there's different pills for different things.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
And then there's different movements too, online.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
It's now come to, so this is the weird thing,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
because you know, like in my day, 2016,

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
like it was like you were either an alpha or a cuck.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
That's what I understood to be the case.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And so a cuck is, okay, you like,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
like you can't handle women like you're like,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
you're submissive to them because you just hope

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
that women will just donate some sex to you.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
You're living the lie.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
You're like, please, ladies, if I virtue signal enough,

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
won't you give me your vagina nuggets?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Alms for the cuck poor.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Please, Cersei, please throw your vagina candies

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
from your Lannister wagon.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
And those are cucks.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
That's me.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And then, and all of our friends

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
and almost everybody in the audience

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
except for maybe one guy who's like gonna run up here

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
and go ee-ee-ee or something at some point in the show

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
and I'll become Shia LaBeouf.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
But that's, and then I thought,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
and then the other thing is like you're alpha, okay,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
like you work out, you take, your body's a temple.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
You try not to jerk off a lot, I think,

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
because you deserve sex from women who are sluts.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
And if they try to pretend like they're not,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
it's like some shit they're trying to pull

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
and you need to understand that if you say to a woman,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
like, nice coat, she'll be like,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
oh, can I suck your dick?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Because, like, they just respond to that shit

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
since paleo times.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
So that's the other side.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And I'm trying to be objective about this,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
like I'll be like, oh, those are the two things I understood.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
But lately what I've been learning about is now there's like,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
there's, I have no, and I don't want to like stomp on any,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I don't want anybody to be like,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
that's not what that is and you got that backwards.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I don't think I don't know what the fuck anyone's talking about anymore.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
But I'm just like,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Cody was like sitting in bed today with the iPad

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
and she's like, what the fuck?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And I was like, what?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
There's these things, there's like omega,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
omega virgins or something.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
There's this whole thing about virginity now.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
There's like the, so there's like,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
alt-righty kind of people who are virgins,

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
but who don't want to have sex with women

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
and are straight.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I'm a cuck.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Right.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
What?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I think that's what it is.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It's like, I'm a virgin and I have power because I'm a virgin

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
because no sale, young lady.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Because the very idea of pleasuring a woman is vile to me.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
But there, or even getting pleasure from them though,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
that's like, so you're talking about,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
we're subdividing now because there's people who are going like,

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
look, you're not gonna fucking defeat me by pointing out

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
that I have a hunchback or a mole on my lip

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
or something that that's why I'm a Nazi.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Like, I know that card and I'm not gonna let you play it.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Like, because there's a thing called incel, is that?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
It's involuntary celibacy.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Now, is that the same thing?

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
That just means like I'm a militant virgin.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Right.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
But involuntary doesn't sound like militant

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
about being a virgin.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It doesn't mean voluntary, but it's like,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
I can't get laid, but I wouldn't if I could.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
No, involuntary means you didn't choose.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Right.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
It's like being like a proud quasi-modo.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I chose to be unfuckable.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
No, I didn't choose, but I choose to be proud

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
of not being involuntarily fuckable.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Oh, okay.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, but if you think about it for a second,

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
they're taking it back.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
What's that?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
They're taking it back.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
They don't want to be called virgins, they're incels.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Sounds like their splinter cell or something.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Well, they're breaking the chains of that go-to

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
that you can always say.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Sure.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
You could just say, well, you're ugly

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
and you're just doing this because you're pent up

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
and you have a lot of sperm in your balls that can't get out

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
and you don't like jerking off for some reason

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
because you read that Joe Rogan does it or something.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
And you're...

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
And I'm not bagging on the rooster.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Now, I don't want to jerk off anymore.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Joe Rogan does it?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
I don't know.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
He's all ripped in, like, cage fights and, like, I don't know.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I imagine that he probably...

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I wouldn't be surprised if you found out he was like,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
no, dude, you got a no-fap or something.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I don't know.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Or maybe he's like, no, you're going to jerk off three times a day.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I don't know.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
But I shouldn't have rift Joe Rogan's name.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
That's going to be very distracting.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm just saying, like, I think it's kind of interesting,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
the idea of, like, because what we're really talking about here

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
is our original base, nerds.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
You're talking about people that feel unfuckable,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
people that are, like, maybe...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
And when they look in the mirror, they're like, oh, yeah,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I know why no one wants to fuck me.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
And then those people are saying,

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
yeah, but I still want to be, like, on the alpha side.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
So you can't tell me, oh, no one wants to fuck you.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I know that.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
You're not supposed to want to, and I don't care.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Yes, if I had a magic wand, I would make myself look like Tom Cruise.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
No, I cannot do that.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I do not have that magic wand.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I am proud of myself.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
You will not shame me.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I still know bitches is crazy.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
I'm the king of unfuckability.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
It's interesting.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
These little quadrants that are sub-quadrants are developing.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
There's this guy.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
This guy, I had...

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Cody was like, she just went down this rabbit hole.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Like, if it was me, I wouldn't...

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
But I was like, you got to text that to me.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
So this is like an example, this is like a...

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
This is a blog entry from a guy that's like...

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I don't know if he would call himself incel or if he...

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
His blog entry, and I don't want to be the reason why shade gets thrown on him as the millennials say.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
I don't want to be the...

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
But yeah, the words Omega Virgin are in his URL.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
So I assume it's like he's like an incel or a superverge.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
I don't know if these guys hate each other.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Just look over there, the superverge has just crashed the party.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Let's show him how incels do it.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Sanctuary!

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
So this is his blog entry.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
The title is Women Think That Gospacho is Creepy.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
Well, that's where he and I agreed because I...

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
I'm kidding.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Yesterday I was out getting lunch that recently added Gospacho,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
a cold Spanish tomato soup to their menu.

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
I overheard two women ahead of me in line talking about the new Gospacho.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
One of the women asks the other what Gospacho is.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Change tense, that's fine.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
The other woman says, damn, damn, don't, don't tense change.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
I mean, where is the Pride Maple?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
If it's not, I mean, it's gotta be something.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
You gotta be Frasier if you're gonna go here.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Okay.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
One of the women asks the other what Gospacho is.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
The other woman says that it's like salsa that you drink.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
The first woman says that Gospacho is creepy.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
The second woman agreed.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
After that, I made sure to get some Gospacho with my lunch

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
because I was not going to let women ruin Gospacho,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
especially by calling Gospacho creepy.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
I have been saying for a long time that women calling men creepy is bullshit.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
However, this proves it.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
Women are willing to call traditional Spanish cuisine creepy,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
which is complete rubbish by itself.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
If a soup can be creepy, then any man being called creepy is meaningless.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
He let himself off the hook.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
I don't know what formula that is in geometric equations.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I don't know if that's the transitive property.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
It's called the prestige.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
If two women think soup is creepy and all women think I'm creepy,

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
and I eat the soup and like it, I'm Tom Cruise.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
It brings up this point because I can almost sense some of you thinking

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
what I'm thinking is I'm halfway through that.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I'm like, wait, is this a bit?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Is this guy doing a character?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
This is the problem with our new generation.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
They're very ironic and savvy.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
You can't tell.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
And also, I think that's like a fallback.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
When you go to a high school dance or wherever,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
it's a function and you're feeling awkward

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
and you don't know when you should dance and if you should dance

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
and if you do dance, how you should dance

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
and what you think of the people dancing.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
There's all these things going through your head,

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
but you can conquer a lot of them by just kind of going like this

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
and dancing goofy.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
There's so much fluidity there.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
I just think that these kids today,

16:41.000 --> 16:50.000
it's so easy to just be passionate about something

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
and like rail about something,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
and then if anybody were to ever say,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
well, that's fucked up.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You seem like a horrible person.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
You could be like, that's the point.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Even if it wasn't the point,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
you could just be like that's the point.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Or you could say, I was kidding,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
even if you weren't kidding.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
You could even not know if you're kidding or what the point is.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
That's why these fucking children of the damned

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
are terrifying to me.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
They don't know even what Nazism is.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
And they're like, oh, this swastika will look great on my balls

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
and then they take their balls out there,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
they put them out there and their balls get kicked

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
and they're like, this is fucking fucked up, man.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
We don't know when they're kidding.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Did you see that guy, the guy that talked like Bob Hope,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
the white supremacist in the Vice Land documentary, that guy?

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
It's like, the Jews are killing me.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Oh, boy.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I got a thing.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
I didn't even say we're nonviolent.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I mean, we're not violent.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I'll kill these fucking people if I have to.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And then he's in the hotel room and he's going like,

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I don't even know what is Chelsea Manning's.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Didn't you think while you were watching that video,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
is this dude kidding? He might be doing a bit.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
And I'm like, where does this bit land?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Like, what if it's part of some plan, you know?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
That's why I didn't bother making fun of him,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
because I was like, this is too easy.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
But what I did love most of all was that then, of course,

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
the OK Cupid pulling his profile and going like,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
he's banned for life.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
This is why I choose the blue pill,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
because I like the idea that a hive mind or not

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
that that can be this guy's purgatory,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
he's like, that's like, undatable.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Like, he's just branded and he's like,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
ah, come on, that sucks.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
Like, I just wanted to use OK Cupid to meet a Nazi girl.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Talk about Jews and how they shouldn't be.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Well, like, tickle their belly with a rose.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I like long walks on the beach

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
and I can't wait to get these black people out of here.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
I got 17 guns and four manifestos

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
and I love stranger things.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Will you be mine?

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Pending an ancestry.com check.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
He's also that new wave of Nazi,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
where he's not afraid to show his emotional side.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
He's not afraid to cry on camera.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I know, but why would he do that?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I mean, the answer is why he's nuts, right?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Like, he's unhinged.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
He's borderline.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
Like, that's how he got into racism in the first places.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
There's some valve missing where he doesn't understand.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
He doesn't have perspective.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
He doesn't see the bigger picture.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
And maybe sometimes we don't.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
There were 20,000 people in Boston.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
It was like this big show.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
We all loved it.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
And then we were like, I was just slowly like,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
wait, who's in that rotunda?

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I was like, you woke up to it.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I was like, hate speech rally.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
You know, absolutely shut down by the people of Boston.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
They filled the streets with this beautiful image.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
All the racists in the world only fit inside this little rotunda.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
And then everybody else is going around.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
There were people chanting, fuck free speech.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
It's alarming.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
But it's still like, you still take it.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
It's way better than the alternative.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Five months ago, if you had asked me,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
oh, what do you think is going to happen?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
All those 20,000 people are going to be like,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
give them a chance.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Give Trump a chance.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
And I'm like, I'll be packing my bags.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
And I just go to, I don't know where I'd go.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Tulum.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
We're going to go back to, maybe I can afford to live under the hotel.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Eggs I like.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
But I really, no, I had the lowest opinion of us.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
I thought that all the people,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I thought that if you gathered 20,000 of us,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
we would be like, oh, I'm scared enough to,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
sure, I'll hate an immigrant or two,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
or we'll wrap that in a package where I don't have to say that.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
I'll allow it anymore.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
We'll call it a different thing and I'll start chanting that.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
So it had, even if there was just one old lady in that rotunda

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
with like a free speech sign,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
and she just pissed her pants and died,

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
it's still a better day than, you know,

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
maybe if she really died, I guess, okay, fine.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Would she die of pissing her pants?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I mean, let's say she died of natural causes

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
and people felt bad.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
Like, she was like, oh, like, she had a thyroid condition.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I hope you get that.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Anyways, but it's better times now, right?

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
It's like, it's like a weird, like,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
it's like part of the carnival ride

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
where you're already through the shit

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
that really made you piss your pants

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
and then, but it's like no more safe now,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
but you're like desensitized.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
But now you're kind of like, I don't know,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
I feel like we're now shouting like faster at the carny.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Like, we're like faster!

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Whereas we were, you know, now we're all out of our minds

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
and we're just wanting to do this.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Like, let's just, like, let's take this,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
let's see where this goes.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
Yeah, it's like, the most alarming thing for me

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
is that they don't have to wear hoods anymore.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
They get to actually show their face on camera.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
That's the scary thing.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I mean, it's alarming that they thought they could,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
but it's uplifting that it turns out they kind of couldn't.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Like, they're getting fired

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
and they're bummed out.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
I just thought I could hate a couple black people on the weekends.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Yeah, and it's that logic thing,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
that you revert to that logic thing

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and the outrage thing and the victim thing.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It's like, more and more what we're learning

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
is that the entire time is just like,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
we're all like little kittens

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
and we want to suck at this titty of like,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
feeling sorry for ourselves.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And it's like, these are the people

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
that we see else as getting a big mouthful

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
of that specific titty.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Like, they perceive the rest of us

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
as feeling sorry for ourselves

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
and getting like handouts for being victims.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
And they were like, I want that job.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I always thought the whole time they were like,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
get off my shoe, you crazy victim.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
They were like, no, move over victim.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I want that victim gravy.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
You're hogging it all.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I want to be oppressed.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
There was a guy, one of those virgin soldier people

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
was like, they referred to women as oppression thieves.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Wait, what?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
And I thought that was a high up,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
but I was like, yeah, they were oppression thieves.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
They were referring specifically to the Harambe meme

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
and how women hijacked that and turned it into something.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
And that's not fair, because we were just having fun

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
and women turn everything into how women are victims.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Yeah, that sucks.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
And then I thought I understood all of that logic,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
but I have adorable that it turns out the rest of that sentence

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
is like, yeah, women, we're the victims.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
We want to be the victims.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
We never get to be the victims.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
It's like, that's what privilege really is.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It's a form of oppression.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
It's like denial of victimhood.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
That's not fair.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I never got to be a victim.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
You don't know what it's like to wake up every day

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
and have no idea what a victim feels like.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
There's not a minute that goes by

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
where I don't know that I command all that I survey.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
And I still can't get a job.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Right, exactly.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
Hey, Mr. Superior Race,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
you could drop a few.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
You could be a little sexier.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
What, are you fucking kidding me?

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
I've been turning my body into a fucking shoe-killing machine.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
Why? I got a fucking bar in my kitchen doorway

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
and a fucking crank on it.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Mr. Superior, I don't understand

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
if you're so superior to everybody,

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
how come you feel so under the thumb of these inferior people?

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Because of the Jews and the black people

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
and the black Jews.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
It sounds like you're afraid that they might have one up on you.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
They might be superior.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I think you're afraid. I think you're afraid of the reality.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
I think the guy that doesn't have six guns and a knife on him.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I seem more relaxed than you do.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
I just brought these so I could feel comfortable speaking my mind.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
That's not something you could understand.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
You bring black people when you want to speak your mind.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I have weapons.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
I don't trust black people to protect my speech.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
You've got all these black people helping you speak.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Are you literally Jay Leno?

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
No, no, not at all.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
I just want to show you some headlines about the problem that we're facing here.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
This is real. This was really in the paper.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Look at this headline.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
I saw that you drove here in a Stanley Steamer.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
Look, that's a white power car.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
It's vintage. It's a Buick.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Look at this headline. It says,

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
Man saves Jew from tree.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
Gives it a bowl of milk. This is real.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Anyways, we get these headlines. I don't know.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Here's the next one.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
This is a coupon in the paper.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Look at this. Three cakes and then look down on the corner.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
Jews.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Okay, I'm Jay Leno. I'm Jay Leno.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
It's okay to admit that you're Jay Leno.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
I just feel like I don't have a place. I feel like I'll be replaced.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
You were the king of late night for a while.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Like no rite lasts forever.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
You can't be the king of late night for a thousand years.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
That's your perception. That's how you see it.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Anyways, we have a great show.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Let's bring out Kira Knightley, everybody.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Kira Knightley is here today.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Actually, we do have a guest.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
He's been on the show before. He's our old friend.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Let's welcome him back.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
The creator of the original IT crowd

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
and so much more and a big, old Irish cousin of Harmontown

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
from the Irish Harmontown annex.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
I was giving him time to get in the door.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Let's have a hand for Graham Linehan.

27:12.000 --> 27:27.000
Hello, Graham.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Hello, Graham.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Hi. How are you?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Good. How are you?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
We're bringing you to town. Do you live here now or are you a traveler?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I just come here to do Harmontown.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
That's it? You just play?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
The last time I was here, the first day, I did the same thing.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
I tweeted, I'm in LA. What should I do?

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
And I went to Glendale, which I didn't really like.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
So no offense to people.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
It was the kind of square...

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Nobody really likes Glendale.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
It's like the prisoner, isn't it, a little bit?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Doesn't it?

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
And then today, I forgot I went to Glendale before

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
and I did exactly the same thing.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I said, where should I go?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
And I fucking ended up in Glendale again.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
And then I did Harmontown that night.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
And I've just done that again now.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
So it's like Barton Fink, except instead of doing wrestler movies,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I'm just going to be on Harmontown for the rest of my life.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
The next time you come, you should come with Ian Bowers.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Who's Ian Bowers?

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
He's this guy who comes here sometimes and does a million things

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
and maybe occasionally drops by here if it's convenient.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
And I wrote a song for him.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Yeah, I'm really glad that the show I'm on is going to...

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
It opens with a five-minute thing about drinking piss.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Oh, this is the Graham Leonard episode.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Do you want some vodka?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
No, I'm okay.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
It's made with potatoes.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
I know it's not whiskey, but it's made with potatoes.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Now, we were talking backstage, Graham.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I think I mentioned this last time you were on,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
but I'm a huge Father Ted fan, which is one of your early shows.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Was that your first one?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Yeah, 25 years ago, no.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Was that the first show that you created?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
No, we did one before that called Paris,

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
which was a sitcom about artists in the 1920s in Paris.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
If you've not seen Father Ted, please just get on Father Ted.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
It's really funny. It's really, really good.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Thank you.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
And you're saying, kind of like in that Luke thing,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
where you keep doing the same thing,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
that two of your actors died on the same date?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
That's right. Yeah, Frank left us.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
On the same date.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Which is what date?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Oh, God, I can't remember.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
You should find out, because you might be next.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
No, no.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
But Arnold's getting a bit nervous.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
There's just two left, but they're still young,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
so it's going to be okay for a while, I hope.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
But anyway.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
You can cut things in this, can't you?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
If we're not cutting the pee and poo song,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
that's staying in there.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
I just have one more question about Ireland.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Where's my wife?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
She's...

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
She's your ex-wife now.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
She went to Ireland, she never came back.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Really?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
I think she's still over there.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
She's in Edinburgh.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I just thought that would be a funny joke.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
It was, it was great.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I lost my wife.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
She was in Ireland for a while.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Right, right.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Do you blame Ireland

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
for stealing your ex-wife?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
That's a beautiful country.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
It's flowing green hills,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
so it acts so innocent.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And then they bird-dog you.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
We went to see a comedian once in the States,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
and somewhere, where was it?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
New York.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
And the guy said,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
who was doing the where are you from business?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
And he said it to us, and we said Ireland.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
And he obviously wasn't expecting it.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
He was expecting a state.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Green.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
She flew over Ireland.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
What are you, a weather station worker,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
headed for John Carpenter's The Thing?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
She flew over Ireland.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Where is he going?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Yeah, yeah.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I don't know where Ireland is, so I thought maybe...

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
It's on the way to John Carpenter's The Thing.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Yeah.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
So what, I mean, it's kind of like,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
so we're hysterical over here

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
right now,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
and we're kind of like

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
probably not paying

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
very much attention to everything.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
We're familiar that the UK

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
have Brexited,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
and we equated that with

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
the right-leaning movement that we've been having over here.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Yeah.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
It's what's really great

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
is that UK people

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
can't feel too superior.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Right. No, that's...

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Immediately we were making that joke that we're like,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
at least the British won't be making fun of us

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
during all of this.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
It's super hard.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
But you're

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Irish about that, but I'm curious,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
like, how

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
is Scotland feeling about Brexit?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
I've never...

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Well, Scotland's in a weird position

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
because Scotland recently voted

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
to remain part of the United Kingdom.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Right.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Then Brexit happened.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And now it's going to happen again,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
and they're probably going to want to get out now.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
So it's kind of... There's all sorts of insane things.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
The only thing they didn't take into account at all

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
was the Northern Ireland situation.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
There's a very fragile piece

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
that's lasted only, you know,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
a couple of decades

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
now, and they've just

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
rolled a dice on it.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
So it's really odd.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Why is that so fragile?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Why would

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Brexit affect it?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Because the border in Northern Ireland

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
that separates Ireland from

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Northern Ireland is

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
a soft border at the moment.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
You can, you know, pass

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
from Northern Ireland to Southern Ireland

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
without going through, you know, a lot of controls

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
and so on, but that's going to have to change

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
because Ireland's going to be part of the European Union

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
and Northern Ireland isn't.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Of course, yeah, okay.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
It's just insane. But it's one of these things...

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
It's kind of like what happened, I think,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
as well with

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
what's happening in the States

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
in that people just started realizing,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
oh, maybe people aren't

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
really clever.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Maybe the people

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
we trust, oh, they

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
do this, so they know what they're doing.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Maybe they aren't really that clever.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Maybe they're kind of crazy,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
some of them, you know.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Which is an uplifting feeling, right?

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
But you can't call it uplifting...

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
It has been this week, as you say. I've liked this week.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Is it like watching them because it's like

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
the insinuation is that, yeah, they can't do this?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Well, the only problem is if there's no one

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
to replace them.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
If there's no one clever

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
to replace them, then what do we do?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
They've already said they will not be replaced.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
They were saying that and everything.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
This was a good week, though, I think.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I feel good about this week.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Well, because it turns out...

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Yeah, I guess what it is, is it's like...

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
It's weird, because I'm 44 now,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
and the

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
24-year-old version of me

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
would have... God knows

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
where I'd be in this

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
map, because I

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
would throw

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
my Writers Guild magazines across the room

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
when I saw the diversity

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
report card in the magazine, and I'd go,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
why are they spending my money?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Who cares about diversity?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It should be a meritocracy.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Writers should be... You want the best

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
writer for the job, and

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
like...

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Everything made sense to me.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
If you hooked me up to a lie detector test,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
it's not like I ever would have said

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I'm racist and it would have gone

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
wrong.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I think he's right.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
It wasn't racism.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
It was like, I don't know,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I don't want to use such a haughty word as ignorance

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
or something.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
My scope was kind of small at that time.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I was also broke.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Nothing makes you

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
more susceptible to

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
this right-leaning,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
toothy philosophy,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
like being fucking

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
unemployed and having no control over your future.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I don't want to be too

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
joyous about all these idiots losing their jobs

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
because while it's

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
short-term, it's great

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
to see them losing their jobs long-term.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
You've got to think, what are these idiots

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
going to do next?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Where have they got to go?

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I blame it all on

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
heavy metal not really being a thing

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
anymore.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I think in the old days, they just all

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
have been listening to Iron Maiden,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
and everything would be fine.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
You know,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
headbanging, and

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
these kind of releases.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
That's why Scandinavia is so chill, because they've got loads of metal up there.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
They love their metal.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
So that stuff got replaced with

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
kind of meth-y club music

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
in the middle of a second.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
But do you remember, it wasn't

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
a period where in a stadium

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
or something, they burnt disco records

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
in the 70s, do you remember this?

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Right, that was a big thing, hating disco.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I think it's the same kind of people, you know?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And I just think, there was a time

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
when everyone was able to,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
when the internet wasn't around, everyone was able to channel it

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
into

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
one of about, let's say,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
15 activities, you know?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And now, they can channel it

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
into this

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
weird kind of performance art

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
that they're just realizing

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
has real consequences.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I'm very

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
fascinated by why it's happened and why it's,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
and I don't know.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
One thing I'm wondering is,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
are there going to be a lot of these guys

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
who, with the death in Charlottesville,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
are they going, are there a lot of these

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
irony kind of Nazis

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
who are going to just suddenly go, oh,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
you know, and back away from it?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
That's something that I'm interested in.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I think a certain percentage, or that I think a certain,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I don't think anybody's going to be really drawn to it that much.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Like, there's no,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
like, maybe like Norman Bates

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
or something like that.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I think this, the percentage

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
that are into that kind of

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
hardcore right-wing philosophy,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
that number probably stays around the same.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Yeah, they were all in that bandstand.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
They feel a little liberated right now

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
to come out there without their costumes on

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
and to come out and, you know,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
let that flag fly.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
But that bandstand was great.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
The visual of that bandstand.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I've gone from being very optimistic

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
and very joyful about the internet.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
There's a comedian called David O'Darherty

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
who describes it like,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
the internet used to be like this telescope

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
that we'd look up

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
and see, you know, other people

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
in other lives, and it was amazing.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
And now it's like we, it's like a shit pipe.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
And every day you look up

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
and you think, oh, I wonder what's coming down the shit pipe.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Blah, blah, blah.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Yeah, that's not, like,

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
the millennial generation, as much as I

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
say they're dumb

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
and whatever, and poop on them, because I'm an old man,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
saying, get off my line. But the thing

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
to pity about them is that they've been born

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
into a culture that we,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
we're processing everything through time to get

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
on the internet.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
The internet will always be a second language to us.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
We'll always be translating

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
real life into the internet and vice versa.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
And these poor kids,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
often it's characterized

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
as a fire hose to the face of information.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
And we always thought

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I think when you and I were kids,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
we probably thought, when we think about the future

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
and we think about minds connecting to each other,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
we always thought that that meant everyone

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
would get smarter and more patient.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
You wouldn't even have

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
the option,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
the information would be

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
all up in your face,

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
which would automatically make you less

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
this, less that, less that,

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
like, slowly, but it turns out

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
and it makes sense now that we're seeing it

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
that that doesn't make the case,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
that that's not the case, because it's like,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
if everything

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
is bullshit, which it would appear to be,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I mean, there is no way

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
to represent truth

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
without

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
creating your own version, blah, blah, blah,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I mean, there,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
but that doesn't mean you can say the earth is flat

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
and have Spencer not make fun of you.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
It just, it just means

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
that I think we've,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
it's like we live in this age now where we're back

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
to the propaganda

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
kind of consciousness, but now we're

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
conscious of it and conscious

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
of the consciousness and now everyone is just sort of,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
that's what this mean culture is,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
everyone's just going like, yeah, propaganda's a thing,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
so what's your propaganda?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
What's yours?

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
And there's the only people left that are saying

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
there's an objective truth, they're kind of like,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
they're more right

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
than everybody else, because if they're calm

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
and educated, but they're also incredibly

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
frustrated, because they're like, wait,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
how are you people just dancing to a completely

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
different song that's not even playing

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
and they're like, because it is, and they're like,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
well, can't argue with that!

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
It's almost like,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
it's like, I, when I

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
first started thinking

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
about this seriously, I thought, oh, we

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
are now plugged into a consciousness, I mean

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
the hive mind is the word that we

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
all use for it, but it really is like

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
we are also plugged into

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
the consciousness of a lot of, you know,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
there might as well be bees,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
you know, it's just like a buzzing, you

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
shouldn't know what, none

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
of us should know what blackpilling is,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
you know, only some of us do.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I mean, there's an argument to be made that you and I

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
shouldn't know how many stray dogs

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
there are in Los Angeles, you know,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
like someone else

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
would say, yes, you should know that, you need to

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
be aware, because that's a huge problem, because

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
that's their thing, and they're like, yeah, why would

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
you not want to know, that's why there's 75

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
million of them, is because you didn't

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
know and you didn't care, so now, thank God

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
you know, then you add

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
900 things like that,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
how do you not become a nihilist?

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
When you just know everything

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
and everything is

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
everything is misery, there's

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
no real fairy tale,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
there's no actual NBA

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
all star who goes home to his wife

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
and kids, and

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
eats an apple pie, and

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
like, I don't know

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
what our definition of a hero is, but

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
it's like, sooner or later.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
His name is Kevin Durant.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
But here's the thing, so that's a funny,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
I mean, yeah, that's the

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Mobius strip of this, is that with this,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
as shit gets more and more

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
scary, the

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
bar for heroism

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I almost don't want to say it lowers

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
like it takes less of a hero, but yeah,

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I mean, it's just like the minimum

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
standard

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
it becomes higher in that way, and then we re-enter

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
a world where people are kind of like walking

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
tall and like, saying gallant

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
things, I think that's a good thing.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Well, did you see the two

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
newsreaders, I don't know what channel

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
it was, but it was one of the rare times

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
when they took a Trump mouthpiece

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
and said, and every single

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
point he tried to make, they said, no, no, that's not true, that's a lie.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Do you see those guys?

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
It's a great video, it's well worth

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
checking out, I wish I could remember.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Did you see the person that played a tuba

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
next to the...

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Did you see

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
did you see today

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
the girl, the woman doing that

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
to the civil...

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Was that from...

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Then someone did a video of it, like a

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
bit of the Ken Burns thing, yeah, yeah.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
That was the kind of internet I thought

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
we would have, I thought it was going to be

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
a great kind of outpouring

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
of creativity, you know, but the

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
unfortunate thing is that right-wing people

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
aren't funny, and they don't have

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
a sense of humor.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
That's not even a controversial thing to say.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
They're not funny, so

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
they think like...

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
How do you pronounce it? I don't think I've ever said in real life

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
peep or pepe.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Oh, pepe. So if they do a pepe,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
I don't think I've ever said it. I've never had reason

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
to, because people I know have liars.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
But like...

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
But, you know,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
to have an image of

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
pepe putting someone in a gas chamber,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
you know, it's not funny

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
on any level.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Well, it's...

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
That's why they keep retreating to

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
meta, meta, meta, meta, meta. Oh, it's funny in a way, you don't understand.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I'm 15 years old and I don't believe in God

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
and I'm moments from

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
shooting up a school, maybe, maybe not.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I'm already hard-hard. Here's

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
a gift of a Chinese baby getting run over

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
in a parking lot. I jerked off to it.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
The only

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
cool thing about that, those

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
terrifying children... He didn't really jerk off to them.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
It's a

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
fictional character I'm making up.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
But it's like that thing where

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
they're like...

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
They're never more than

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
one shocked

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
reaction away from

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
revealing that that's all part of the

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
joke. It's like this kind of odd...

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
It's like celebrating

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
being...

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Well, we kind of

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
pinned a medal on,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
for instance, gangster rap

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
when it was the 90s

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
and it was like we're going from

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
rapping about peas and carrots

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
to all of a sudden this person saying

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
the N word a lot and the F word even

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
more and the C word and everything

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
and he's talking about shooting other

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
people and all this stuff and the parents are like, oh my God.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
And the defense of

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
that is...

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Well, we're just

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
showing you how it is.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
We're

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
expressing something that's going on and it's

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
kind of hard to argue with that. In fact,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
in the right cultural context, we

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
applaud that. So

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
now you've got these

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
kids who are like... They're not showing

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
anything that's going on. They're

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
showing what's going on. They're showing what's going on to the

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
human mind under the influence

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
of a global culture,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
which is absolute warpage.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
They're showing what's going on when

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
your parents don't hit you enough.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I think...

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Maybe that's a joke.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
See, I can do it too.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
But like they're showing...

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
You've got to hit your children, people.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
You've got to hit them. They're showing

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
how a primate reacts to

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
being part of an 8 billion

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
light bulb Christmas

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
display and it

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
ain't pretty.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I'm not saying

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
it's excusable at all.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I went off-line for a while.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
It was really good. I

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
realized my mood was much better.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
And my son,

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
my son noticed that

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
when I was going back online, I was getting

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
anxious.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
It's crazy, man.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Twitter, which is the only thing I actually

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
do go to online, because it read it's

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
like too...

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
It's like an actual fucking...

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
It's gotten to a point where

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
for real, it wouldn't even be a funny episode of

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
intervention, it would actually be an

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
understandable one. Because it

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
truly is this toxic thing I'm doing to myself.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
You feel like you're helping as well.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
If I retweet this...

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
It's giving you a sense of order and justice

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
and also community

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
and feelings and all this stuff.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
You cannot fucking...

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I keep hitting that goddamn app

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
and then I'll delete it for

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
and then I'll be cuddling with

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Cody and laughing and all this stuff

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
and then somehow it'll come up

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
because it's embedded in a web page

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
or you click on a thing and you're like back on Twitter

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
and I'm like fucking...

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I'm like

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
snapping at people.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I said I want my eggs poached!

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I haven't seen Dan

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
for a few days. I can tell if Dan is

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
in New York to LA Flight

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
and drunk because there's

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
9 million tweets.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
You're trapped

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
on a plane and something got under your skin

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
and also another

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
unfortunate thing about it

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
is how fast

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
time passes when you're on it.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Sometimes I realize

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I saw a sketch by these

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
two guys that I really liked

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
and I just sent a

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
direct message to them and I said great sketch

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
and they rolled back and said thank you

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
and then I saw because

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
I'd written a direct message to them

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
and the previous

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
message to him had said

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
something similar about an earlier one he did

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
5 years ago

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
2 conversations

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
with this guy

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
and 5 years have passed

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
in between these 2 conversations

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
and it feels like I blinked

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
it feels like I looked down on Twitter

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
and when I looked up everyone's

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
my kids are 10 years old

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
and a US president used it

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
to get elected and he continues

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
that's a really telling thing

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
we're going to look back at this and go

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
this is like having mercury in your food

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I'm not saying everybody get off a Twitter

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
obviously

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
wouldn't that be great if we all realized

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
one app was somehow the thing

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Twitter is a really easy example of it

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
because Trump clearly got addicted to it

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
it's like blood magic

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
yeah, hashtag

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
it's like this weird

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
magic that gets in your body

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
and then it kind of takes you over

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
we've all been saying it over and over again

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
he can't stay off Twitter

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
he got elected through it

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
so why would he stop and I feel exactly the same way

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
I didn't get elected

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
but I keep feeling like

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
well my life up till now

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
has gotten where it is

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
with Twitter in my pocket

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I've tweeted my life

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
and it's fucking insane

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I used to blog

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
and word

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
I used to

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
express myself in prose

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
he used to not say

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
N-word

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
it was like

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
he said the N-word

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
by the way

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
our

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
let's trade

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
my leader is so dumb

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
again we're not totally in tune

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
my president

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
revealed today

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
absolutely unequivocally

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
including like multiple

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
peer reviewed control groups

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
scientific lab

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
he didn't know how to spell the word heal

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
and it was scientifically proven

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
because he deleted it

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
twice you know about this right

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
he wrote our country will heal

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
we're gonna heal the country

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
multiple times

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
no typos

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
and then so heal was twice in the tweet

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
but he gave it double

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
then the tweet was deleted

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and then reposted

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
same spelling

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
and then deleted again

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
this is in the span of 36 minutes

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
the leader of the free world

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
as we used to call it is figuring out

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
homonyms

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
forget about North Korea

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I got that figured out

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
fire and fury now

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
if I say dear mom

49:31.000 --> 49:37.000
no letter why she got no antlers

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Harvard where did he go

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
didn't he go to fucking college

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I dropped out

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
I don't know where he went

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
he's a college graduate

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
consensus is he kind of just

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
bought his way through

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
how can that be

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
that's fucking insane

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
he couldn't go to college he was too busy

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
not fighting in Vietnam

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
so give us

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
oh I'm not sure there's anything

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I mean

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
everyone knows how to spell

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
that's kind of the base

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
in Europe the idiots know how to spell

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
they do know how to spell

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
but

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
it's almost worse in a way

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
because as I say that kind of level

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
of oh people

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
they don't seem to know what they're doing

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
is disguised by their ability

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
to spell

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
you know

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
so you don't really see

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
how disastrous everything is

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Boris Johnson and the Penn

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
they can spell

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
but they're still villains

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
you're right about that because

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
whether or not they realize it or not

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
it's just like so flies in the face of

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
I think Malcolm X had some quote of

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
I think it was him that said something

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
that's like

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
underneath

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
something about that racism

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
gets a stronger reaction

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
when there's a suspicion

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
that it's

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
valid or something like that I can't remember

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
the actual quote he was speaking to the fact

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
that we all know in common psychology

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
which is like you know if you're

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
truly like fucking

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
you know the score and you're cool

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and objective truth is on your side

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
and life is fair to you

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
someone calls you honky

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
like you're like yeah and

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
but if you're

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
if the cards are not stacked

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
in your favor and all these things and you've been

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
and then someone says something fucked up to you

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
your anger could be

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
it's buoyed by the

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
as he put it I think suspicion

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
suspicion of its validity or something like that

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
the so

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
now you have this like kind of right wing movement

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
which says what is predicated

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
on this idea that in America

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
first of all there was a golden age that's

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
fascism 101 some reference

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
to some fucking like

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
vague golden age that no one will ever be

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
pinned down on make America great again

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
when was it great

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
they will never answer that question

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
1983 okay

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
well now that you said that I'm going to show you charts

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
fake news

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
but like

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
it's this idea that

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
that you know

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
whiteness is better America's better

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
America's a white country the Statue of Liberty

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
only says huddled masses

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
on the bottom of it because there was a poetry contest

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
like come on that was

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
we've never meant that that was co-opted

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
that was Michelle Obama turned that into a thing

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
also she's green

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
she's not even white but when they

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
can't spell

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
first grade English

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
it does help

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
like because you could be

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
still a 90 IQ anti-immigration

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
politician

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
and just by virtue of

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
boarding school you could spell the word heal

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Pence is

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
really dangerous

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
everyone moderate who now knows

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
how many doors can be opened and how quickly

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
and how far they are allowed to go before anyone

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
cries uncle is dangerous now

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
it's really frightening to me that

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Pence would never

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
have gotten within miles of the White House

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
if he hadn't snuck in under

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Donald's fart cloud

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
there's no way

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Donald's fart cloud

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
is that what she said? it's like a protective

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I'm writing that down

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
that's the new series you're pitching

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
when you're here

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
but you know

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
he wouldn't be known

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
he's even

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
visibly disturbing

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
there's something very kind of

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Stephen King villain about him

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
and

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
he just wouldn't have got in and now what

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
he's going to be

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
in power for three years

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
I mean that's something

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I'm a little bit worried about

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I'm more worried in a weird way than Donald

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
because I'm kind of enjoying watching Donald

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
become the biggest loser of all time

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
but there could be a

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
thing here it could be like a defibrillation

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
a near death experience where coming out of it

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
no matter what happens as politics resumes being

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
politics and becomes even more dangerous

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
because it stops being a rodeo clown

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
that the woke

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
the millennials the younger

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
people even than them have now

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
experienced this thing of like are you telling me

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
that becoming the president

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
is first of all not

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
a contest that you win by being

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
a good person not a contest you even win

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
by being good at that job

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
but most importantly

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
is actually holds no reward

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
if you actually

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
just blunder into it

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
and start throwing birthday parties for yourself

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
people you will become more

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
hated than if you just stayed a manager

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
at Burger King

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
and therefore maybe there are more important things

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
going on in my world than winning this weird

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Highlander contest of who can be the biggest douche

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
like

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
and then maybe I don't know

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
but let's talk about

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
like I want to talk to you as a writer

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
so I can pretend that I'm one

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
about like

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
are you finding it difficult

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
to write

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
period like right now

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
yeah kind of I mean good

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
okay good

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
no I think it's

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
what's the problem what's the problem with it

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
because life is a fucking

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
screenplay and you can't

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
type fade in and a guy finding magic shoes

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
there's interesting things

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
well what do the shoes turn into

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Hitler heads because otherwise

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I'm beaten by

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
but I think you might suffer for not worse than me

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
because I think you've got

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I think you're

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
in a great way very cerebral

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
and I think that you don't like

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
you hate like Tim and Eric I know

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
have this thing where I think they said

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
once that a lot of their style

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
just comes from them being terrified of

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
boring people so they have that kind

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
of very insane style

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I have no such fear

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
but like you know

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
your stuff is very aware of itself

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
you know it's very aware of what it's doing

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
you know I I

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
try and I try and

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
suppress that for a first draft

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
you know what I mean sometimes successfully

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
and sometimes not but it's harder to do that

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
these days because

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
it's like what you were saying I think

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
you said about Rick and Morty that you

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
were going to have a big

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
secret but you decided not to because

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
the internet would figure it out before

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
and did and did yeah

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
yeah and that's

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
kind of the problem it's like

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
you're competing now against

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
a giant

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
wasp brain you know

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
that is the world and that makes a little bit

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
more difficult to do the

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
necessity of a boring first draft

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
yeah do you know what I mean

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
but I still but I'll tell you what I'm doing

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
that's helping I'm watching a lot of cheers

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
that helps

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
because because you look at coach and you

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
just think I want to write someone like coach

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
right you know I love

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
I love him

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
the show you're working on now is

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
what's it called?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
we just did a show Count Arthur Strong

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
which is

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
this really funny guy

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
played by Steve Delaney who

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
we had three years

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
on BBC One where I might as well

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
have just thrown every episode down the

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
crevasse

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
because they didn't repeat it

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
when you're writing like

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
please don't let me stop complaining about

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
that

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
it'll just die there and I'll look like I'm blaming

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
everyone but ourselves but

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
when you're writing your stuff like

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
you're writing for mostly a

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
UK audience or

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
yeah but I'm hoping that everything travels

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
the way the IT crowd and Ted

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
is kind of traveling a little bit

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
the IT crowd especially

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
but you're not hopefully writing to try to

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
please a certain kind of audience

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
you're just writing what you like

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
no I guess

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I was always really

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I mean I don't want to speak ill of any show

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
but I always preferred

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Seinfeld to Curb

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
because for me Seinfeld

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
because it had to navigate

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
kind of strictures of

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
you know

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
network TV

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
for me it was like

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
a cold porter song or something it was just a bit more

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
elegant than Curb

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
because of the constraints

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
yeah because of the constraints and I felt that

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
the performances were stronger

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
and the whole thing together

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
I like the elegance that I like

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
when

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
things are difficult so with Count Arthur for instance

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
you know we don't curse

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
because kids love them

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
so writing

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
and one of my favorite things

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
which I think I've spoken about before on this show

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
but one of my favorite things is taking

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
taboo subjects and making the palatable

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
to a

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
family audience

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I think that's a really funny thing when you get it right

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
and I thought Seinfeld did that beautifully

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
you know I mean Master

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Master

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
she's a brother fucker

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
she fucks her brother

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
fucks her brother

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
oh yeah

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I'd like to be her brother

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
giddy up

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
but yeah

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
why is it that

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I mean you probably can't answer this because it's a question

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
about my own taste but like why do I

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
find English or

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Irish like writers and

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
TV shows like the

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
same reason I like American shows

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Toast of London is the funniest goddamn thing

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
because they sound funny is that the answer

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
but you know that's written by Arthur who did

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Father Ted as well

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
yeah that's a fucking doozy

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
yeah yeah but that's you know

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
it's the same thing when I saw

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
me and Arthur we used to watch

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
little clips

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
of Saturday Night Live

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
which you couldn't see

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
it wasn't broadcast over where we were

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
so we would just see little videos of it

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
you know later on on YouTube and stuff

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
but beforehand they were just on these compilations

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
where they had to show tiny clips because

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
they couldn't use any of the celebrities because

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
they would have to pay them again or something

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
wow weird so you'd only see like

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
snatches of sketches just all Lorraine women

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
yeah but we were

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
but you know we would see some

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
we would see a sketch like

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
you know it was like that it's the greatest

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
thing and

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
and we just thought they were working on this

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
on this you know

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
really high level and it wasn't until we saw

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
you know whole episodes

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
where we realized oh okay

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
it's a little bit more conventional

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
you grew up on Money Python and we did

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I saw Money Python

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
piecemeal through like weird

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
syndicated shows in the middle of the night

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
and I saw Python when I was

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
a teenager so it had that

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
on a kid so it had a very strong

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
effect on me probably more of an effect

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
you know it's just you see stuff that

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
when it's hard to see it feels more

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
valuable yeah I didn't know what a budgie

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
was I didn't know that was a parakeet I

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
just knew it was a funny word

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I just thought they were making shit up

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
like no that's that's that's a thing

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
in England I didn't know that well I remember

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
half the audience half the American audience

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
as teenagers probably didn't know what the

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Spanish Inquisition was I thought I was like oh

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
that's funny it's a joke from history class

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
but like you didn't have to know because

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
it's like that's the thing I'm like

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
it doesn't matter how many references

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
you know like it doesn't matter that

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
because they didn't they didn't seem to have

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
a lot of references I mean you know

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Python yeah I mean it was not cultural

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
references it was all very

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
not pop cultural yeah

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
not like of the moment but they were all

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
cultural references to us because we don't know

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
what Yorkshire is and we don't know what

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Burnley is and they were

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
but maybe that's why it travels I don't know

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
yeah I mean it just I remember

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
being like a freshman in high school

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and being in theater class and then we

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
were doing a play and the seniors

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
all had the secret language and they were all

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I found out years later they were all

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
quoting Monty Python somebody

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
had gotten a hold of some

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
tapes or something like that and

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
they would all like like

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
it's just a fish or like no one

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
expects a Spanish Inquisition I had no idea

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
what they were talking about I thought they were all just

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
like great friends who had their own

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
like riffs but like yeah no like

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
they were all speaking Monty Python

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
and it was like the punk

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
rock of comedy yeah yeah absolutely

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I'm kinda curious

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I still don't think it's been beaten as a sketcher

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
is Des here the

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
our new he's not here is he

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
alright fine

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
jeez

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
you remember how excited we were of Des the blind guy

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
and we were like he should come back and he was

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
like obviously got in his van and was like fuck off

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I mean he's blind

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
he could be anywhere right now

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
he probably thinks he's at the show

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
he's probably

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
this is the show's little light on lefts

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
this is the show's little light on lefts

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
so he's here

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
yeah but

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
so

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
so we talked about

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
finding it harder to write

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
now let's talk about

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
how have the duties

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
changed in writing

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
if you do manage

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
to write again

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and you're writing comedy

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
the thing is what you're talking about is

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
saying I'm watching Cheers

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
good so you're saying

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
getting back to the craft of just like

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
making people

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
happy you're right like am I

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
spoiled by

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
the idea that it's okay

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
for things to

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
acknowledge what's happening outside

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
the bubble of television reality

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
is it a superior

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
craft to let go

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
alright

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
well the answer is yes

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
in my opinion it's just that I don't know how to do that though

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I'm not sure what to

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
can you rephrase that?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
well I haven't finished even wrongly phrasing it

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
he answered his own question that he hadn't quite asked himself

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I'm just sort of babbling about it

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
because I'm like I mean when you say

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
watching Cheers and like I'm thinking about

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
like okay so like

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Cheers didn't say

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
there's either socialism or fascism

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
happening outside of the Cheers bar

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Cheers might make jokes where

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
if you were an alien society you could go

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
it appears they lived in some kind of democratic republic

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
because they just made a joke

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
about a senator

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
well we did

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
on counter author

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
they'd call out 9-11

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
it's 9-11

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I don't know what's gotten into them

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
never encouraged it

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I don't know

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
if I'm answering the question

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
but with counter author

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
the thing we just did we just

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
made the

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
the guy who owned the cafe

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
they all go to Turkish

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and we lost a lot of

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
a lot of his idiot fans

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
from his previous incarnation

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
a lot of his idiot racist fans

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and that's what we wanted to do

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
so he's not Turkish he plays a Turkish character

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
and fans of his

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
no sorry Steve counter author

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
it was a radio show before it was a TV

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
show and on the radio show it was totally different

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
we reinvented it for the TV

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
one of the things we put in was this Turkish guy

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
and so Steve and I discovered

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
that a lot of racists liked him

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
and they just fucked off

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
so we just had this kind of nice

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
filter

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
that we got rid of a lot of people

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
we didn't like just by having a character

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
that's fucking crazy

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
but the thing about it

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
actually I hope I'm not exaggerating

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
it wasn't many it was just with the internet

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
you always think there's more than there are

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
they're louder because they know

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
they know that there's no shows for them

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
they're fucking desperate they'll grab

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
a thousand pots and pans and bang them as hard

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
as they can

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
and you think there's more than there are

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
but you know it was nice

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
so I think the whole diversity thing

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
you know for us it was a very

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
natural character to have in the show

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
because there's a lot of Turkish

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
it's a lot like trolling right

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
people in London you know

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
you're doing things that in your gut

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
you know you have a processor you go like

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
a certain kind of person

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
there's a bump on this

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
but I genuinely didn't know that would happen

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I genuinely didn't think just the appearance

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
of this character in the show

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
would have a lot of people saying

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
like we were called politically correct

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
just because we had this character in

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
you know and I didn't expect that

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
you know it was very strange

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
what was the impulse to make that character

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Turkish in the first place

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
because we knew a lot of Turkish guys who were like that

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
and we thought they were funny

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
kind of grumpy you know

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
there's the soup Nazi in there as well

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
who you know everything I do is influenced

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
by Seinfeld in some way

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
you know

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and we found this brilliant actor

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
who was just every when he never

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
smiled he was hilarious

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
so they just wanted the show to be lily white

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
and no

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
because that's how the original was

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
you know anything that was different to that

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
and it was a mixed race relationship

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I think the people that freak out

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
it's like I'm gonna say

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
a solid chunk of them

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
they're not actually if you

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
change Peter Parker to African American

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
if you say this character

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
can be female now

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I think that there's

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
surely a bunch of people that are like

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
no I hate women you shouldn't do that

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
and then there's these like cousins of theirs

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
who are perfectly comfortable standing

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
next to them because they think

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
that they're such big fans of comedy

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
or sci-fi or comic books

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
or whatever their thing is

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
they're such big great fans

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
that

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
and then they perceive

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
this agenda

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
that has nothing to do with for instance

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
making comic books as cool as they can be

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
making video games as great as they can be

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
making movies as funny or as loyal to

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
this or that

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
and then they actually

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
it's almost like a recruitment thing for them

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
it's like those guys go oh man

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Doctor Who's a woman

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
like that ain't Doctor Who

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
standing in the shadows 5 feet from there

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
going over here

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
we agree

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Doctor Who ain't Doctor Who no more

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
if it's a Doctor Her

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
come over here and they're like what

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
yeah I'm so frustrated like

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
oh you don't know the frustration

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
how many people is 6 million

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
people do you think

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
there's a lot of people exactly

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
come here just keep walking with me

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
it's getting awful dark

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
um

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
not to cast any of those people as innocents

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
but I do think I think that they're

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I think it's like there's a difference between hate

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
and ignorance I think

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
hopefully because otherwise we gotta just go

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
oh there's always hateful people we might as well be like

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
fine they're like white walkers and let's just

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
either like what eliminate them

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
or let them kill us like

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
no it's like it's not like that it's like

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
there's a lot of ignorance at play

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
and people get like at different

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
times in their life they go like oh I'm a big

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I hate this idea that

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
feminism is a thing in comedy

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I'm sick of reading these articles

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I can't all these headlines oh women women women

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
women women I'm so sick of the women

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
and you must not be

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
thinking about comedy very much if you're

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
focused on women being involved

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
that's not comedy comedy should be

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
about the comedy which is me

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
at 24th throwing that magazine across the room

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
yeah but as far as

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
you know I've done it

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
for a long time now I know

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I can do a certain type of show we did

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
father Ted it had four

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
three three male characters

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
and one female character

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
you know I know I can do that

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
it would be interesting to do a show

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
with three female characters and one male character

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
which we've just done you know it's

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
interesting you know it just keeps you limber

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
you know well yeah well I think the important

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
thing is to do that and then have it be fucking awesome

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
because that is the that because

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
that's the it does it

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
it otherwise you're like

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
that's the it's like you're pouring like

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
energy into this weird

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
engine that

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
exists where I don't even know

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
that's another half hour

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
you know you can do it so why do

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
why do it again why you know

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
that's why I think diversity is an interest

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
it's another it's another

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
discipline you know and it's another

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
structure you can put on yourself

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
and I don't know I think that leads

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
to interesting interesting

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
as I say

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
best example you know you can't say

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
you can't talk about masturbating on a show

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
but so they come up with

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
three different ways of talking about it

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
you know

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
that's where the fun is

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
so why not embrace it

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
why not embrace something like diversity

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
as a chance to show

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
what you can do

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
and I think the answer is

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
if not for the wider reasons

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I mean also obviously

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
there are good reasons to do it anyway

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
but for reasons of

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
artistic reasons it's good

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
artistic reason too it's a good reason

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
guys like me I always want to just say

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
don't you want to

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
prove that you're the most talented person in the world

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
so don't you want all of this

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
nonsense about anyone not having

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
access and any suspicions

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
of an unfair

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
field to be abolished so

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
at some point in your life you can go I'm the best writer

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
there's a flip side to it though

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
with the internet though

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
which really does annoy me

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
which is

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
people telling writers what they can

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and can't write about that

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
really annoys me you see that a lot

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
like writers are jukeboxes

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and that's

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
a really good argument for unplugging

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
yourself from the internet

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
the uplifting thing about that though is that I got like shit man

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
no one's going to replace me this generation

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
is fucked

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
they think TV is like a faucet

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
they're just like so

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
25 year old Dan Harmon

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
coming down the pike

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
well when I see that stuff

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
that's how I make myself feel better

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I'm like well if this person

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
can yell at the creator of a show

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
and say you're not creating it

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
right then

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
no one's going to like these kids

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
are not equipped to produce a competitor

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I really like it

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I've got this terrible

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
twin is this boring for everybody

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I've got this

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I've got this terrible

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
someone nodded

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
and that person

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Norman Lear

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
sorry Mr. Lear

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
he comes up with a spell or a wrestler

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
yeah I'm bored

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm bored of the scene Mean Jean

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I'm bored of these whippersnappers talking about

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
how they should diversify

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I think you need to energize a pie

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
ain't that right

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
William

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
he's a writer everybody

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
he can't write

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
William

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I tried to think of another show

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
runner

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I was like I don't know

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I've got this double thing

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
going on where

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I kind of don't like watching new things

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
because I'm jealous

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
but at the same time I really

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
want to see good things

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
because when you see good things

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
it makes you want to write better things

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
but it's really hard

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
it's like showering for me

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
every time I'm in the shower I'm like

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I should do this all the time

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
and that's like how I feel

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
if I'm halfway through an episode of New Girl

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I'm like why the fuck don't I do this

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
this is fine

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
the reason one for me

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
was the good place

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
which I started watching

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
because it's just a show

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
my inclination is not to watch it

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I don't know what that fucking is

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I haven't watched Atlantic yet

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
it's really good, Megan Amron

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
who's really funny

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
you don't read like novels

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
or things like that right

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I have a real bookworm

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
what the fuck

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
but I need to ask though

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
this is something I tried to ask him on twitter

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
and I never get an answer

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
so I'm going to be able to ask you now

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
where does your understanding

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
of the

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
the circle

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
is it from reading Campbell

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
the first thing I read is that book you mentioned

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Christopher Vogler's Writer's Journey

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
before

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
and I always recommend that to young people

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
or old people

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I mean new people

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
that are asking me how do I

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
process the Campbell stuff

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
read the Vogler book first

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
because it's so simple

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
you need my numbers

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
but don't stop there

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
having read that

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
now

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
try to digest Campbell

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
from cover to cover

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I bought it today and I started reading it

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
it's tough going

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
because once you've got Vogler

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
or any other kind of like

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
there's a chapter

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
or two in there for me that I've had to read

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and reread and reread

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
every paragraph like Campbell writes

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
a thousand times

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
but that's a five and six on the circle

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
it gets really dense at one point

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
he's blowing my mind I think

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
yeah

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
my mind has been blown so my mind doesn't work anymore

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
he's explaining to you that the concept

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
of mind-blowing reveals to you

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
that you are the mind-blower

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
but you see I've been asked

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I've been asked to go to Australia

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
and talk to

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
people about comedy writing

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
like to do a course like Robert McKee or something

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
but the thing is

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I'm just copying your

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
your blog post

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
you know what those guys want down there

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I've been down there

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
they want you to pretend

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
they don't have poisonous spiders

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
they're very sensitive about that

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
apparently there hasn't been a poisonous spider death

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
in 30 years or whatever

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I said to them

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
no other country has that statistic

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
you protest too much

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
but

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
they really just like

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
they like you to sound like one of them

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
so can I teach you a phrase?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
oh wait

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I like that

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
just remember that

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
if you get into a jam just go

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I like that

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
you know what

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I find suspicious about

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
the Aussies

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
they really insist that you

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
don't have any worries

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
they don't want you to have no worries

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
at all time

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
that worries me

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
yeah but I don't know

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
but the thing is I don't really have

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
a unified theory of writing

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
my stuff is

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
grabbed from all different places

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I'll give you a sneak

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
there's a cheat

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
the circle

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
so just do

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
quadrants now

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
top half is

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I want to make sure I get this right

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
order

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
stop

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
top half is good

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
just stop

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
top half is

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
good, bottom half is bad

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
right half is dishonest

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
left half dishonest

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
yeah I love that

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
it's just a cheat

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
it doesn't even matter

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
things about a banana

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
good dishonest

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
bad dishonest

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
dishonest

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
the goddess midpoint

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
there's this truth that changes everything

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
it's like another threshold

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
you go into

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
honest bad

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
why you get your ass kicked

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
the truth is you suck

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
and then you recover from that

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
and now the truth can be that you're good

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
can you riff the banana

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
story

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I want to know what

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
bad dishonest banana is

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
still to do it right today

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
in my Seth Rogen

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
animated film called

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
banana boys

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
there's a bunch of bananas

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
and they all agree that

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
getting peeled is

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
the worst

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
so then

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
they try to avoid getting peeled

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
and then one of them gets peeled

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
and

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
he has to adapt to getting peeled

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
like a naked banana

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
but he's like

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
he's cool with it

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
and then he finds out that

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
bananas are actually

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
plantains

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
that he was never a banana

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
so

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
he was adopted, his parents didn't want him

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
he just looked like a banana

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
it doesn't matter peeled, unpeeled, go fuck yourself

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
and then he gets back to

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
the fucking banana story

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I'll just tell the Australians

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
yeah

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
look it's never going to sound very great

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
on the whiteboard

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
but I tell you that was

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
the biggest change

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
in writing for me was seeing

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
that juicy details post

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
once I realized

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
that everything in the second half

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
was the

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
trailer, that's how I describe it to people

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
that everything in the bottom half

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
is the trailer for that week's episode

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and I thought that was just

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
so clear as soon as I realized

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
that you could start filling out the bottom half

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
and that helps you decide what the top half

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
is, it's so

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
easy and wonderful

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
it made everything better for me

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
as you can imagine if you ran the simulator

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
as a writer that you

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
admired saying that to you, it hits you in

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
like an orio of

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
of flattery and

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
fucking panic because you're like wait

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
so then there's going to be some subreddit

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
where people say have you noticed that since

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Graham said that

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Dan Harmon changed how he wrote

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
that all his shit sucks or something

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
like they're going to trace it

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
and I'll be like I don't want any

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
responsibility

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I won't tell you the exact point I

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
started

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
but they called

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
out 9-11 because

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
we start playing D&D around this time

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
so stick around

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
and have a drink with me after

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I'd love to, I've got to meet a friend

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I don't know what he's doing but I will

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
fuck you

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
you're giving us an Irish goodbye, that's amazing

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
we don't usually get the real thing

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
it's a real Irish goodbye

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
everybody thank Graham

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
for coming

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
grab a hand everybody

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
thank you Graham

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
let's thank him by the Graham

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and bring up Steve Levy everyone

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Steve

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Dahlia Jr. to the stage

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
hello Steve

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
hey

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
oh shit

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
now I just want to go home and rewatch

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Father Tech because I got to hang out with the guy that made it

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
makes me so happy

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
fuck off

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
drink

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
that's for the four people that have seen that show

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
all right Spencer do you want to

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
disperse the character sheets here

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
no

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I wish somebody

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I don't feel bad

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
when I interview people

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I don't want to interview them

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
just tell me how do you think

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
you should interview people

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
just for years you're great at it

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
listen to Steve you're great at it

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
what do you think is the right thing to do

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
in an interview I'm just curious

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
plum the depths

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
do you

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
think you tend to do that

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
no well there's a great

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
first step

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I don't know I'm just

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
I don't know the right answer I'm trying to work through

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
with you

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
does it feel good

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
just play your game

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
this is why I sequester myself

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
for other people's benefit

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Steve how you been doing man

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
how's your week been

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
my week

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I don't know

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I can't remember

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I think it was a decent week

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
you overworked aren't you

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
yes

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
it's fine

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
it's great I love it

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
you're dying a little inside every day aren't you

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Steve's an incel

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
but he likes it

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
that's not true

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
he likes dying a little inside

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
he likes being overwhelmed

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I'm not going to say who it is Steve

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
but there's a guy that came to one of our shows

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I don't know if it's this one or something else

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
here at the castle

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
but you got a secret admirer out there

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
who has got a lot

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I got a big crush on that Steve Levy

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
they're just all over the place

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
what

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
they're just not here that's the problem

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I don't even admire a woman

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
that is hot for Levy

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
because it's like

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
it's such an obvious

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
it's like low hanging boy candy

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
that's what I call my balls

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
it's a boy scout

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I'll just take this ring to Mordor

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I don't care

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
yeah yeah

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
what kind of girl falls for

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
sweet good looking guys

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
with biceps

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
that's what I'm saying

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
the wolf

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
good luck impressing me as a woman

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
if you're hot for an obvious choice

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
go ahead

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
but I'm just going to be like

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
the reason why

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
he's so

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
adorable is that he doesn't consider himself

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
an obvious choice

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
do you secretly think I got the fucking goods

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
no

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I don't think I consider myself an obvious choice

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
it's never worked out for me

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I want to fuck you

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
because that was so charming

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
he just made me gay

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
you're saying Steve

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
you don't know you're beautiful

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
and that's why you are

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
isn't that the song

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
yeah

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
you don't know you're beautiful

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
that's what makes you beautiful

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
you think you're a nerd

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
you're like Velma

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
or Mary Ann

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
see I wear suits because

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I don't look good in a t-shirt

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
you can just go out in a t-shirt

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
you look good in a t-shirt

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
you look like young Jewish Paul Newman

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
all the time

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
young Jewish Paul Newman

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
he's fucking

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
he's Jewish cool hand Luke

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
you're kind of saying

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
because Paul Newman was young at one point

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
so then you can contract that

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
you can just call him Paul Newman

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I mean that sounds a little more insulting

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
but yeah

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
it's a little bit

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
maybe a little bit

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
that's good

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
he's a cute dad

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Neb

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
like Neb-ish

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
do you speak Yiddish?

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Hebrew

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Hebrew

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I'm sorry

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
what's the difference between Yiddish and Hebrew

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
different dialects man

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
so is Yiddish like an informal

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
or what's the

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Steve, do you want to feel this one?

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Yiddish was like Eastern European

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
it's even in German

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
there you go

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
because I have relatives that speak a little

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
my great grandparents

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
they're from the Polish

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
corridor part of Europe

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and there's a lot of

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Yiddish

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
like isms

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I would get my dupa washed

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
in the bathtub dupa means

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
no wait that's Polish

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
your family washed

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
like those dupa wash

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
madam out there I think we can agree

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
does Steve have a pwnum?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
what a pwnum?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
a what?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
he's got a pwnum

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
a Shane a pwnum?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
he's got a Shane a pwnum

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
unge tchachka

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
did I say something?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I think you called me a knick-knack

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
we'll play some D&D shall we

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
before the time runs out

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I think we've had enough of this

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Michigas

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
we'll set aside a segment

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
for next week

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
as someone on Twitter suggested

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
take it or leavey

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
we'll get to know leavey a little bit

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
we just have leavey dating game

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
we'll just bring up

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
all the women that are in love with him

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
this will be great

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Steve won't even be here

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
it'll be great

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
he doesn't need any help there

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I'm not going to whore him out

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I just want to make him uncomfortable

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
because it's adorable

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
we went to New York

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
every woman we met

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
just fell in love with him

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
that's not true

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
he can't see it

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
we try to help

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
don't get us wrong

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
it's something you don't see

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
it's great

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
that's part of your charm

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
especially you got to squeeze lately

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
any action in the dating room

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I've squeezed a few

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
but

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
no one's happy about it

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000
there's no squeaking happening

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
nobody won

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
no

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
all right

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
if you don't mind

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
last we left

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
some weird shit was going down

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
so hit us to the giant

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
when last we left

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
some weird shit was going on

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
what happened

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
you guys had infiltrated the church

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
with partially the help of

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Patchins you conspired

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
in the courtyard on what to do next

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
and you decided what to do next

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
was to go to the library

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
once in the library you read a couple

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
of the books and then went up some stairs

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
and one of the stairs had marbles

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
in it and Chad

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
grabbed the marble

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
one of the marbles and then Carlos grabbed the rest

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
of the marbles and went up the stairs

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
and nothing was theirs

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
you went down

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
and found a secret door

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Carlos found a secret door

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
and he opened it but there was a trap

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
and they took damage

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and I hope it's written down on your character sheets

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
and then they went down into the secret

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
dungeon where they saw

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
an unholy sight

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
a rogue figure manipulating a magical

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
object

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
and melting flesh together

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
unhinged monstrosities

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
oh boy

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
who knows what would happen next

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
find out now

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
now do they see us

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
do they notice our presence in the doorway

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
here

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
are they too busy making

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
sexy blood magic

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
so let's pretend

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
we're going back in time

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
how do you guys go down this ladder

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
because that would determine the answer

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
to that question

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I usually sing my ladder song

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
ladders

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
go up

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
but mine goes down

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
love a rung or two

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
when you ring me a frown

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
no we're trying to be stealthy

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I think

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I should go down first

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
and put my shield

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
and use my shield so you guys

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
can come behind me

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
and I can defend you

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
just in case

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
explain that more

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
you're on a ladder and you're using your shield too

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I'm going to like ghostbusters down the ladder

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
and then whip out my shield

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
and then you guys follow behind me

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
and then any sort of

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I'm sliding I'm going to do a quick move

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
with my shield

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
which is very like action hero-y

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
you know

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
is this the

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
original ghostbusters

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
the first movie

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
ghostbusters

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
alright well I assume

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I don't know I've seen that movie

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
but I don't know what the fuck you're talking about

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
they have a firepull

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
they have a firepull they go down a firepull

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
right I come down like

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
like the new women's

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
ghostbusters and I go oh this looks like a room for the nightmares

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
it is

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
yeah

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
alright well you ghostbusters down

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Steve's in the lead

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
with the shield leading and the rest of you

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
are behind him so that's kind of the situation

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
and that it sounds like

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
they do know you're here

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
how many people are in the room

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
you see six

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
six people no seven people

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
six of the people got all warped

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
by flesh

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
bathed in flesh

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
and it was mutating them into horrid monstrosities

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
like getting long arms

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
and weird legs and stuff

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
their chins are melting

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
and they're getting like an eyeball

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
on a stick

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
it's gross

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
but that rogue figure is the one that we found

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
in the pumpkin patch where we were trying to be cow people

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
and he flew off right

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
yeah you can tell by the robe

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
oh really

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
yeah that's cool

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
same one that plan kind of worked then

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
it worked enough

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
alright guys

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
how far away are we from them

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
uh

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
sorry

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
do we got a map of this room or no

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I don't have a map

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
a lot of the rooms are rectangular

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
and this is no exception

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
hahahaha

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
alright so you're in the corner

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
the ladder comes down

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
the corner

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
that barrel stacked up along the walls

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
and there's one cabinet

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
on the far end of the

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
of the longish room you see

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
the table that all that melted flesh

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
was on

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
and there's also like an altar

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
it looks like an altar to an evil entity

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
and there's also a little well

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
like a well

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
for drawing water

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
you're saying this to all of us because we've all

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
you're figuring we've all come down the ladder

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
that's my assumption currently

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I'm willing to go with that

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
we came down the ladder

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
whatever you guys want

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
okay so they know we're there

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
the jig is up right

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
oh it is

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
battle formations

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
gentlemen

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
being man or beast you still

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
be of the church of the silver flame

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
lay down your aggressions

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
recant

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
you'll be shown mercy

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
the road figure picks up a

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
barrel it's like a you know

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
a big size barrel and throws it at you

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
she's faster than you

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
oh man

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
what did you say she

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
oh no yeah

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
um yeah

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
well it hits you in the face steve

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
what I have my shield out

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
it hits you right in the shield

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
yeah because you you you

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
you gender

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I signed her

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
all right you take seven

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
damn you should have taken

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
the eggshell pill can you guys

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
can you guys heal me

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
the barrel explodes

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
spraying urine everywhere

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
oh boy

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
she threw a pee barrel at you

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
oh it was a barrel

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
yeah so it was a pee barrel

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
why are they peeing in barrels it's the olden days

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
people peed in barrels back then

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
where do you want to go

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
the first city national bank building

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
why are they saving

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
the pee

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
it's for doing laundry

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I take that gold marble

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
that I found in the trap it has kind

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
of slushies maybe possibly liquid in it

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
and I don't know what it is but I think

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
it's probably a weapon and I throw it

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
at the road figure all right

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
what's your

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
what's your ranged

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
do you have a ranged attack

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
like with my bow you mean

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
yeah just give me your bow base

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
attack bonus

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
no just the base attack bonus

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
sorry base attack bonus

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
where are you

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
it's on the left

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
yeah

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
oh boy you throw

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
the marble and it lands on the floor

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
it explodes

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
and it emits a shrill ringing

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
sound it's like ring

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
the hooded figure

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
recoils with a terrible

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
scream as if they're

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
hyper sensitive to sounds

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
but they don't seem to take any damage

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
or anything oh wait wait

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
I start

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
hitting my steel shield

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
with my elvish blade

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
alright you do that it's making noise

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
oh boy

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
they don't seem happy

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Carlos can you heal me

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
sure

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
uh

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
well I mean normally

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
you can substitute any level 1

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
spell for a healing spell

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
that's a spontaneous

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
casting

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
alright well I substitute divine favor

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
off of my offensive

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
loadout

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
for a healing spell

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I have a well

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
of course I'm not happy about it

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
you don't have to heal me

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
no one wants to give up divine favor

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
that never sounds like a good idea

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
but friendship is friendship

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
oh man you heal him

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
for 10 damage

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
oh wow thank you

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
so I think you're back to full health

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
even if you took the trap damage

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
I'll get that later

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
oh really? yeah

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
so then all the shambling

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
mounds start shambling towards you

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
it seems that all this mutating

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
didn't make them faster

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
so they're just

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
they're kind of like a wall

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
of disgusting flesh

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
it's horrendous

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
how many of them? there's six of them

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
they're kind of forming a wall between

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
you and the hooded figure

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
so it's just

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
of the original people

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
in this Roman Polanski scene

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
that we walked into

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
there's just the hooded figure and now everyone else

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
has turned into these shambling flesh people

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
there's three of them

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
six of them

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
nice try

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I summon nature's ally

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
alright

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
you can just say take a shit

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
we're friends

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I summon a serpent

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
alright

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
what kind of serpent? like a big ass cobra

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
like a mutant

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
love him

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
cobra chopper

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
alright you summon a big ass cobra

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I drop the kids off at the pool

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
what do you want the cobra to do?

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I want them to attack

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
the boogins that are coming at us

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
it attacks the boogins

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
sorry hold up

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
while Spencer's consulting the literature

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
to see how that attack fared

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
it's a good time to wonder

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
whether you should have

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
meal ingredients delivered to your home in a box

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
do you hate

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
eating prepared meals?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
do you want to make your own

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
but you

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
don't want to go to the grocery store?

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
then the world is dying

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
and you're in luck

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
fresh hello box

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
fresh hello box

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
brings you five boxes a day full of gourmet

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
ingredients from only the freshest people

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
alright so I got a cobra

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I have a magic cobra in the room right now

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
you guys know what I hate is liquid cologne

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
it's just not solid enough

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I don't like other people's undies

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
what happened to me undies

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I don't want to keep walking around

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
there undies

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
alright the cobra

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
it wraps around one of the legs

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
of one of these shambling horror things

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
and bites it

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
jaws sink into the flesh

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
of the leg

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
and oh man it hurts

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
the thing it cries out

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
a horrifically garbled cry

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
oh man

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
it goes down

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
he's like he's wracked in pain

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
from the what do you call it

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
poison

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
yeah that's the word

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
yeah that's

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
guys that's called

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
my little cobra friend

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
does he keep moving around

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
and kicking butters?

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
that guy is dealing with it right now

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
he's like tussling with it

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
okay so the hooded figure crosses over

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
and attacks at what do you call it

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Chad

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
that's me

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
she's like real fast

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
and she like blasts over to you

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
what's your AC

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
it is

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
17

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
equals

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
yeah 17

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
alright you take three damage

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
she punches you with the strength

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
of something real strong

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
inhumanely strong

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
oh boy it hurts

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
but only three damage so it doesn't hurt that much

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
alright so Steve's turn

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
if she was affected

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
by the clanging sound

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
of your shield she's not really showing it

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
okay how far is she from me

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
she's within

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
10 feet of you because she's like mixing it up

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
with Jeff who's close to you

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
or behind you potentially

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
do I have to go through the monsters

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
the monster people to get to her

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
no

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
can I do a full attack on her

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
uh yeah

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
how many attacks do you get

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
on a full attack

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
how many do I get

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
where would it say that

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
probably just one

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
it wouldn't say that

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I'll just assume it's one

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
they can't be not one

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
sorry everybody

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
it says plus four plus four attack bonus

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
oh you do get two

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
alright

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
you hit her with your sword

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
no do you have a sword

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I want to use my elvish blade

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
and do some kind of cool

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
leg loss

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
attack with my bow

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
yeah

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
yeah

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
is that doable

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
you said two attacks

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
two attacks right

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
so you can use your sword first

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
and then do a bow attack

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
it's not going to be

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
you have a penalty to bow attacks

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
within a close range

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
oh I didn't know that

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
alright I'll use my elvish blade

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
twice

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
one will be cooler than the next

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
one is cooler than the next

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
the first hit misses

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
and the second hit hits

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
good thing I had two tries

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
you slash into

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
the hooded figure's face

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
revealing her face

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
it's pale

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
yeah it's just pale

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
she's got long stringy black hair

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
it's like gross black hair

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
oh boy

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
she's pale

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
is it a person

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
yeah it's like a human looking

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
person yeah

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
you slice her in the face

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
is it that moment

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
in the 80's movie where it's like

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
she shakes her hair

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
no she starts to but

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
she's doing something else

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
and we already knew she was a woman

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
how much damage does she take

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
she takes 17 damage to the hooded

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
alright

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
you score a deep blow

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
it goes deep into her face

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
is she bleeding

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
she's bleeding

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
she's sliced her in the face

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
is it like human red blood

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
yeah it's human red blood

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
okay

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
but then her wounds start healing

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
together

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
it sucks together

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
it's starting to heal fast style

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
it doesn't heal completely or anything

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
but it's starting to heal up

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
inhumanly

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
that's where I come in right

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
isn't it my turn

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
yeah it is

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
nowhere to hide

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
nowhere to run

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
summon monster one

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
level one

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
don't tell her what level one is

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
yeah right you're right

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I don't know why I made that part of my incantation

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
make it

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
make it sound like a high level monster

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
summon monster

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
market price

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
you don't know

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
what do you want to summon

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
if you have to ask

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
you care for it

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
oh the lobster thermometer you want

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
what are you trying to summon man

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
well I'm sorry I had to ask you this

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
but I don't know my choices

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
there's a dire rat, a dog, a dolphin, eagle

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
fire beetle, poison frog, pony

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I mean I got distracted when you said dolphin

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I didn't hear anything else

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I hear a dire rat because it sounds like diarrhea

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I got distracted by that

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
just go from the top, dire rat

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
dire rat, dog, dolphin

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
eagle, fire beetle

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
e-e-e-ewo? eagle

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
eagle, eagle, eagle

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
sorry sorry, fire beetle

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
fire beetle

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
frog, frog, poison frog

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
it's a poison frog

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
it's a choice between frog and poison frog

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I was clarifying poison frog

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
don't pick the frog

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
don't pick the regular frog

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I hope he settles near me

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I believe the dire rat

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
is gonna be the perfect like

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I'm like yeah

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
we're in a legit dungeon

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
where you gotta bring the rat out

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
we got a snake and a rat

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
it's like the Chinese calendar

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
alright

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
you summon a dire rat

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
what are you doing with it

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
attack! the robed woman

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
alright you summon a filthy rat

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
the size of a small dog

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
that's my commanding him

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
who are you attacking again

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
oh man it lunges at her

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
but it misses

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
it jumps straight past the rentable wall

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I should have sicked it at one of the

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
poison frog

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
no I should have sicked it at one of the

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
the shambling mounds

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
that poison frog though

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
oh boy

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
the shambling mounds they continue to advance

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
they get towards you and start lashing out

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
with their grubby gross

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
flesh hands

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
six of them

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
yeah

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
I don't like the sound of that

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
alright Jeff you take

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Steve takes

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
two damage

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
and Dan takes

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
they should be

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
you said earlier you hoped we marked it down

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I'm down to six HP right now

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
oh boy

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
whose turn is it

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
it's not

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
the shambling mounds turn

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
no it's the rogue figures turn

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
alright

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
we're not running from shit

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
we got a cobra

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
we got your weak ass fucking rat

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
we could make a fast getaway on those horses

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I won't turn away from a fight though

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
let's keep going

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
the vampire turns into

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
mist

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
the vampire oh yeah it's a vampire

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
spoiler alert

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
pale humanoid

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
it's kind of vampire right

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
especially if they're healing

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
yeah I could have done a better job

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I'm not going to deny that

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
it's a vampire

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
well now it's a mist

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
it's not clear what this portends

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
alright it's Jeff's turn

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
that vampire just boned out

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
well it's a mist

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
it's still misting around

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
it hasn't really picked a direction

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
did it do it because

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
you don't want to get eaten by a rat

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
or it's not clear what this portends

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
alright well

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
is it mist kind of all like in one

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
like space

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
no it's kind of like the room's a bit foggy

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
it's not quite that compact

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
alright now are these

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
these shamblin mother fuckers

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
are they all in a group

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
are they kind of like

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
yeah they've all converged kind of around

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
towards you

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
I try to go zap

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
like zoom

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
like pickle rick laser

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
against

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
against what was his name

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
condor

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
yeah I try to go

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
crush these mother fuckers

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
alright one of them catches on fire

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
oh boy he takes six fire damage

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
and catches fire

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
and he's screaming

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
this gurgly scream that sounds like he's got

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
a melted uvula

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
and he starts running around

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
and he's like catching things on fire

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
catching barrels on fire

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
making pee barrels

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
catch fire

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
you know flammable pee can be

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
is pee actually flammable

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
no

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I don't think so at least

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
mine frequently is

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
how would any organism

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
survive Darwin's gauntlet

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
with flammable pee

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
I don't know

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I wasn't thinking about it

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
alright so we got one

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
we got one that's been subdued by my snake

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
by the viper yeah

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
oh yeah the snake should have a turn too

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
oh yeah does he still want to keep tusslin

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
is it a snake

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
it's a cobra

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
cobra's always want to fuck another chance

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
is that the case

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
yes

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
alright he bites him again

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
oh this time he bites him right in the eye

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
alright

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
that's on your dice

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
yeah it was a snake eyes

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
that's our show

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
he bites him in the eye

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
now he's screaming real loud

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
as if the poison's in his brain

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
alright

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
it's a gambling mound you're talking about

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
it was a person

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
it's like a mutant person

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
it's like if a person turned into an action figure

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
and melted

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
so I got one dude on fire

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
this other guy's going crazy on snake eye poison

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
alright

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Steve

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
alright

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
have we eliminated any of those

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
I'd say two seem to be out of the immediate fight

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
okay

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
um

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
I'll attack the closest one

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
with my elvish blade

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
alright you miss once

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
and then it's a critical hit

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
oh boy

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
dealing damage

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
dealing 14 damage

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
that was less than that normal hit

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
okay

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
well that's numbers

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
alright

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
you lop off the stretchy

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
head of one of the mutated forms

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
oh boy

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
yeah

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
it's pain baby

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
alright

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
nice job DJ

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
thanks

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
it's Harbin

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
I am using channel smite

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
it's one of my feats

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
which won't fail me now

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
to deal extra damage

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
to undead on attack

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
now

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
I'm making a snap judgment in my head

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
that these shambling mound things are not undead

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
and I got a nod

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
so I'm attacking the mist

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
I didn't think this through

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
if you have a towel

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
do you think that could help

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
I don't know

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
so you absorb the mist

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
towels

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
and the mist's one great weakness

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
the shambling mounds aren't undead

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
I'd know that as a cleric

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
yeah you'd know that as a cleric

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
they're like mutants, they're like demonic

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
they're not

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
alright

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
but they are evil

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I just

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
this mist I gotta

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
get this fucker

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
I can't hit her

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I'll just hit a shambling

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I'm not channeling smite, I'm not doing that

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I lied

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
I'm hitting a shambling mound

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
with my morning star

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
alright

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
what's your attack bonus?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
plus two

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
times two if it's critical

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
damage is 1d8

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
plus one

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
you

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
alright

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
you smash one in his head

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
you explode his giant

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
ear and it oozes puss

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
as his brain also pusses

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
out of his ear

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
he dies

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
yeah

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
alright

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
it's 9.59 right now

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
so we got how many standing

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
we got two

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
we still got a frog

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
not a frog we got a rat

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
has the rat gone again?

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
oh yeah make the rat do something

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
oh rat attack

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
one of the shambling mounds

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
rats don't attack mist

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
sorry

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
yeah it bites one of the guys

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
right in the neck oh boy

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
it tears his neck open

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
he's not dead but he's really heavily injured

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
oh man

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
the mist it takes a turn

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
it leaves it goes up out of the ladder

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
shit

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
follow that mist

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
come on snake come on rat

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
we're going up this ladder

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
I put the snake around my neck

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
like a scarf

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
and

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
like let's go

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
get this god damn mist

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
alright

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
the shambly guys

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
they reach after you with their fucked up limbs

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
but you manage to

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
get away unscaved

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
up the ladder

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
the mist is nowhere to be found

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
it was a mist

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
we missed the mist

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
it was a swing and a mist

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
should we go back down

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
and just fuck up the other two guys

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
just out of frustration

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
there's a giant explosion from underground

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
oh shit

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
explodes

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
I guess the urn is flammable

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
below the ladder

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
is the explosion ongoing

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
or it just ends?

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I have low light vision

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
you can see a crumbling support pillar

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
pretending

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
collapse

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
imminent collapse

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
