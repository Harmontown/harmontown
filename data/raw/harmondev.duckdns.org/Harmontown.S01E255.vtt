Hit me to the jaw.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nIt's based on the matrix of the blue pill community, man.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nYeah, but, man, those blue pill people are the worst.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nNo, we just love it. They're just in the dreamland.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nOh, man, that's great.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:08.000\nThat's us. We're the blue pill people.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nOh, boy, yeah.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:12.000\nBecause we live in the fucking illusion where, like,\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:16.000\nyou know, women are equals and, like, your vote matters.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nYeah, that's great.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:22.000\nStink tastes good and, like, Joe Pantaleano is a senator\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nor something, I don't know.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nAnd the blue, that's the illusion.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nAnd then the red pill is, like, the nuance.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nIt's the edge. It's the fucking. I see all the levels.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:35.000\nI see it. I see the hard truths that no one wants to see.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nThat's the red pill that's you living in reality.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nBut then there's, we were getting confused today\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nbecause there's also black pill.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nBlack pill, I think, is when you're,\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:49.000\nI think it's when either pill is just made you insane.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nI think if you red pill so much that you disconnect from reality,\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nnow black pill.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nAlso, those pills are more likely to be shot by police.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nYes.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nBut if you take the red pills, you know why.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nRight.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nIf you take blue pills, you're like,\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nwhy are the black pills getting shot?\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nI don't understand.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nAre they Snagopus?\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nYeah.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nAnd then there was something about white pills,\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nand I don't know what that is,\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nbut there's different pills for different things.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.000\nAnd then there's different movements too, online.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nIt's now come to, so this is the weird thing,\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nbecause you know, like in my day, 2016,\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:35.000\nlike it was like you were either an alpha or a cuck.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nThat's what I understood to be the case.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nAnd so a cuck is, okay, you like,\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nlike you can't handle women like you're like,\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nyou're submissive to them because you just hope\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nthat women will just donate some sex to you.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nYou're living the lie.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nYou're like, please, ladies, if I virtue signal enough,\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nwon't you give me your vagina nuggets?\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nAlms for the cuck poor.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:05.000\nPlease, Cersei, please throw your vagina candies\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nfrom your Lannister wagon.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nAnd those are cucks.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nThat's me.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nAnd then, and all of our friends\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nand almost everybody in the audience\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:21.000\nexcept for maybe one guy who's like gonna run up here\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nand go ee-ee-ee or something at some point in the show\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nand I'll become Shia LaBeouf.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nBut that's, and then I thought,\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nand then the other thing is like you're alpha, okay,\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nlike you work out, you take, your body's a temple.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nYou try not to jerk off a lot, I think,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nbecause you deserve sex from women who are sluts.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:44.000\nAnd if they try to pretend like they're not,\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nit's like some shit they're trying to pull\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nand you need to understand that if you say to a woman,\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nlike, nice coat, she'll be like,\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\noh, can I suck your dick?\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nBecause, like, they just respond to that shit\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nsince paleo times.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nSo that's the other side.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nAnd I'm trying to be objective about this,\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nlike I'll be like, oh, those are the two things I understood.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nBut lately what I've been learning about is now there's like,\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nthere's, I have no, and I don't want to like stomp on any,\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nI don't want anybody to be like,\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nthat's not what that is and you got that backwards.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nI don't think I don't know what the fuck anyone's talking about anymore.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nBut I'm just like,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nCody was like sitting in bed today with the iPad\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nand she's like, what the fuck?\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnd I was like, what?\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nThere's these things, there's like omega,\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nomega virgins or something.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nThere's this whole thing about virginity now.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nThere's like the, so there's like,\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:37.000\nalt-righty kind of people who are virgins,\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nbut who don't want to have sex with women\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nand are straight.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:44.000\nI'm a cuck.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:45.000\nRight.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:46.000\nWhat?\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nI think that's what it is.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nIt's like, I'm a virgin and I have power because I'm a virgin\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nbecause no sale, young lady.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:57.000\nBecause the very idea of pleasuring a woman is vile to me.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nBut there, or even getting pleasure from them though,\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nthat's like, so you're talking about,\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nwe're subdividing now because there's people who are going like,\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:09.000\nlook, you're not gonna fucking defeat me by pointing out\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:12.000\nthat I have a hunchback or a mole on my lip\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nor something that that's why I'm a Nazi.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:18.000\nLike, I know that card and I'm not gonna let you play it.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nLike, because there's a thing called incel, is that?\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nIt's involuntary celibacy.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nNow, is that the same thing?\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:29.000\nThat just means like I'm a militant virgin.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nRight.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nBut involuntary doesn't sound like militant\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nabout being a virgin.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nIt doesn't mean voluntary, but it's like,\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nI can't get laid, but I wouldn't if I could.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nNo, involuntary means you didn't choose.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:43.000\nRight.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:46.000\nIt's like being like a proud quasi-modo.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nI chose to be unfuckable.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nNo, I didn't choose, but I choose to be proud\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nof not being involuntarily fuckable.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nOh, okay.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nYeah.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nWell, but if you think about it for a second,\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nthey're taking it back.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nWhat's that?\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nThey're taking it back.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nThey don't want to be called virgins, they're incels.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:08.000\nSounds like their splinter cell or something.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:11.000\nWell, they're breaking the chains of that go-to\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nthat you can always say.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nSure.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nYou could just say, well, you're ugly\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nand you're just doing this because you're pent up\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nand you have a lot of sperm in your balls that can't get out\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nand you don't like jerking off for some reason\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nbecause you read that Joe Rogan does it or something.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nAnd you're...\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:30.000\nAnd I'm not bagging on the rooster.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:33.000\nNow, I don't want to jerk off anymore.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nJoe Rogan does it?\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:41.000\nHe's all ripped in, like, cage fights and, like, I don't know.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nI imagine that he probably...\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nI wouldn't be surprised if you found out he was like,\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nno, dude, you got a no-fap or something.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nOr maybe he's like, no, you're going to jerk off three times a day.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nBut I shouldn't have rift Joe Rogan's name.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nThat's going to be very distracting.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nI'm just saying, like, I think it's kind of interesting,\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nthe idea of, like, because what we're really talking about here\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:03.000\nis our original base, nerds.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nYou're talking about people that feel unfuckable,\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\npeople that are, like, maybe...\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nAnd when they look in the mirror, they're like, oh, yeah,\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nI know why no one wants to fuck me.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.000\nAnd then those people are saying,\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:19.000\nyeah, but I still want to be, like, on the alpha side.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:24.000\nSo you can't tell me, oh, no one wants to fuck you.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nI know that.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nYou're not supposed to want to, and I don't care.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:34.000\nYes, if I had a magic wand, I would make myself look like Tom Cruise.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nNo, I cannot do that.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nI do not have that magic wand.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nI am proud of myself.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nYou will not shame me.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nI still know bitches is crazy.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:47.000\nI'm the king of unfuckability.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nIt's interesting.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nThese little quadrants that are sub-quadrants are developing.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nThere's this guy.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nThis guy, I had...\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nCody was like, she just went down this rabbit hole.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nLike, if it was me, I wouldn't...\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nBut I was like, you got to text that to me.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nSo this is like an example, this is like a...\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:09.000\nThis is a blog entry from a guy that's like...\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nI don't know if he would call himself incel or if he...\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:19.000\nHis blog entry, and I don't want to be the reason why shade gets thrown on him as the millennials say.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nI don't want to be the...\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:27.000\nBut yeah, the words Omega Virgin are in his URL.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:33.000\nSo I assume it's like he's like an incel or a superverge.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:36.000\nI don't know if these guys hate each other.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:39.000\nJust look over there, the superverge has just crashed the party.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:43.000\nLet's show him how incels do it.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nSanctuary!\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nSo this is his blog entry.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:53.000\nThe title is Women Think That Gospacho is Creepy.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:57.000\nWell, that's where he and I agreed because I...\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:00.000\nI'm kidding.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:04.000\nYesterday I was out getting lunch that recently added Gospacho,\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\na cold Spanish tomato soup to their menu.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:13.000\nI overheard two women ahead of me in line talking about the new Gospacho.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:17.000\nOne of the women asks the other what Gospacho is.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nChange tense, that's fine.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:25.000\nThe other woman says, damn, damn, don't, don't tense change.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.000\nI mean, where is the Pride Maple?\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nIf it's not, I mean, it's gotta be something.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nYou gotta be Frasier if you're gonna go here.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nOkay.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:37.000\nOne of the women asks the other what Gospacho is.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:41.000\nThe other woman says that it's like salsa that you drink.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nThe first woman says that Gospacho is creepy.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.000\nThe second woman agreed.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:52.000\nAfter that, I made sure to get some Gospacho with my lunch\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:56.000\nbecause I was not going to let women ruin Gospacho,\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:59.000\nespecially by calling Gospacho creepy.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:05.000\nI have been saying for a long time that women calling men creepy is bullshit.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:09.000\nHowever, this proves it.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:14.000\nWomen are willing to call traditional Spanish cuisine creepy,\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:17.000\nwhich is complete rubbish by itself.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:23.000\nIf a soup can be creepy, then any man being called creepy is meaningless.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:27.000\nHe let himself off the hook.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:31.000\nI don't know what formula that is in geometric equations.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nI don't know if that's the transitive property.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\nIt's called the prestige.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:42.000\nIf two women think soup is creepy and all women think I'm creepy,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:46.000\nand I eat the soup and like it, I'm Tom Cruise.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:52.000\nIt brings up this point because I can almost sense some of you thinking\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nwhat I'm thinking is I'm halfway through that.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nI'm like, wait, is this a bit?\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nIs this guy doing a character?\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nThis is the problem with our new generation.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nThey're very ironic and savvy.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nYou can't tell.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:07.000\nAnd also, I think that's like a fallback.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:13.000\nWhen you go to a high school dance or wherever,\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nit's a function and you're feeling awkward\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nand you don't know when you should dance and if you should dance\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nand if you do dance, how you should dance\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nand what you think of the people dancing.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:26.000\nThere's all these things going through your head,\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:30.000\nbut you can conquer a lot of them by just kind of going like this\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nand dancing goofy.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:35.000\nThere's so much fluidity there.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:41.000\nI just think that these kids today,\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:50.000\nit's so easy to just be passionate about something\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nand like rail about something,\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nand then if anybody were to ever say,\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nwell, that's fucked up.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nYou seem like a horrible person.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nYou could be like, that's the point.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nEven if it wasn't the point,\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nyou could just be like that's the point.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nOr you could say, I was kidding,\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\neven if you weren't kidding.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nYou could even not know if you're kidding or what the point is.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nThat's why these fucking children of the damned\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nare terrifying to me.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nThey don't know even what Nazism is.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nAnd they're like, oh, this swastika will look great on my balls\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nand then they take their balls out there,\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nthey put them out there and their balls get kicked\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nand they're like, this is fucking fucked up, man.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nWe don't know when they're kidding.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:32.000\nDid you see that guy, the guy that talked like Bob Hope,\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.000\nthe white supremacist in the Vice Land documentary, that guy?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:39.000\nIt's like, the Jews are killing me.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nOh, boy.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:44.000\nI got a thing.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:47.000\nI didn't even say we're nonviolent.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nI mean, we're not violent.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nI'll kill these fucking people if I have to.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nAnd then he's in the hotel room and he's going like,\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nI don't even know what is Chelsea Manning's.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nDidn't you think while you were watching that video,\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nis this dude kidding? He might be doing a bit.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:03.000\nAnd I'm like, where does this bit land?\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nLike, what if it's part of some plan, you know?\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nThat's why I didn't bother making fun of him,\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nbecause I was like, this is too easy.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nBut what I did love most of all was that then, of course,\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:17.000\nthe OK Cupid pulling his profile and going like,\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nhe's banned for life.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nThis is why I choose the blue pill,\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:25.000\nbecause I like the idea that a hive mind or not\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:28.000\nthat that can be this guy's purgatory,\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:31.000\nhe's like, that's like, undatable.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nLike, he's just branded and he's like,\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nah, come on, that sucks.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:40.000\nLike, I just wanted to use OK Cupid to meet a Nazi girl.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:44.000\nTalk about Jews and how they shouldn't be.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:48.000\nWell, like, tickle their belly with a rose.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nI like long walks on the beach\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:56.000\nand I can't wait to get these black people out of here.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:00.000\nI got 17 guns and four manifestos\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:06.000\nand I love stranger things.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:10.000\nWill you be mine?\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:14.000\nPending an ancestry.com check.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.000\nHe's also that new wave of Nazi,\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:20.000\nwhere he's not afraid to show his emotional side.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nHe's not afraid to cry on camera.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nI know, but why would he do that?\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nI mean, the answer is why he's nuts, right?\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nLike, he's unhinged.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nHe's borderline.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:32.000\nLike, that's how he got into racism in the first places.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nThere's some valve missing where he doesn't understand.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nHe doesn't have perspective.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:38.000\nHe doesn't see the bigger picture.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nAnd maybe sometimes we don't.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nThere were 20,000 people in Boston.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nIt was like this big show.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nWe all loved it.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\nAnd then we were like, I was just slowly like,\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nwait, who's in that rotunda?\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\nI was like, you woke up to it.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nI was like, hate speech rally.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:54.000\nYou know, absolutely shut down by the people of Boston.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:57.000\nThey filled the streets with this beautiful image.\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:01.000\nAll the racists in the world only fit inside this little rotunda.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:04.000\nAnd then everybody else is going around.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:07.000\nThere were people chanting, fuck free speech.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nIt's alarming.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:12.000\nBut it's still like, you still take it.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nIt's way better than the alternative.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nFive months ago, if you had asked me,\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:19.000\noh, what do you think is going to happen?\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nAll those 20,000 people are going to be like,\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\ngive them a chance.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nGive Trump a chance.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nAnd I'm like, I'll be packing my bags.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.000\nAnd I just go to, I don't know where I'd go.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nTulum.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:33.000\nWe're going to go back to, maybe I can afford to live under the hotel.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nEggs I like.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\nBut I really, no, I had the lowest opinion of us.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nI thought that all the people,\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nI thought that if you gathered 20,000 of us,\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:44.000\nwe would be like, oh, I'm scared enough to,\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nsure, I'll hate an immigrant or two,\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nor we'll wrap that in a package where I don't have to say that.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nI'll allow it anymore.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:52.000\nWe'll call it a different thing and I'll start chanting that.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:56.000\nSo it had, even if there was just one old lady in that rotunda\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nwith like a free speech sign,\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nand she just pissed her pants and died,\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:04.000\nit's still a better day than, you know,\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:09.000\nmaybe if she really died, I guess, okay, fine.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:13.000\nWould she die of pissing her pants?\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nI mean, let's say she died of natural causes\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nand people felt bad.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:20.000\nLike, she was like, oh, like, she had a thyroid condition.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nI hope you get that.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:25.000\nAnyways, but it's better times now, right?\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:29.000\nIt's like, it's like a weird, like,\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nit's like part of the carnival ride\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:35.000\nwhere you're already through the shit\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nthat really made you piss your pants\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nand then, but it's like no more safe now,\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nbut you're like desensitized.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:44.000\nBut now you're kind of like, I don't know,\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nI feel like we're now shouting like faster at the carny.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nLike, we're like faster!\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nWhereas we were, you know, now we're all out of our minds\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nand we're just wanting to do this.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nLike, let's just, like, let's take this,\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nlet's see where this goes.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nYeah, it's like, the most alarming thing for me\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:05.000\nis that they don't have to wear hoods anymore.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nThey get to actually show their face on camera.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nThat's the scary thing.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nI mean, it's alarming that they thought they could,\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nbut it's uplifting that it turns out they kind of couldn't.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nLike, they're getting fired\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nand they're bummed out.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:22.000\nI just thought I could hate a couple black people on the weekends.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nYeah, and it's that logic thing,\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nthat you revert to that logic thing\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nand the outrage thing and the victim thing.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nIt's like, more and more what we're learning\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nis that the entire time is just like,\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nwe're all like little kittens\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nand we want to suck at this titty of like,\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nfeeling sorry for ourselves.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nAnd it's like, these are the people\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nthat we see else as getting a big mouthful\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nof that specific titty.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:47.000\nLike, they perceive the rest of us\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nas feeling sorry for ourselves\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:52.000\nand getting like handouts for being victims.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nAnd they were like, I want that job.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nI always thought the whole time they were like,\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.000\nget off my shoe, you crazy victim.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nThey were like, no, move over victim.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nI want that victim gravy.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nYou're hogging it all.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nI want to be oppressed.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:11.000\nThere was a guy, one of those virgin soldier people\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:16.000\nwas like, they referred to women as oppression thieves.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nWait, what?\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nAnd I thought that was a high up,\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nbut I was like, yeah, they were oppression thieves.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nThey were referring specifically to the Harambe meme\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:28.000\nand how women hijacked that and turned it into something.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nAnd that's not fair, because we were just having fun\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nand women turn everything into how women are victims.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nYeah, that sucks.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nAnd then I thought I understood all of that logic,\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nbut I have adorable that it turns out the rest of that sentence\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nis like, yeah, women, we're the victims.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nWe want to be the victims.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nWe never get to be the victims.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nIt's like, that's what privilege really is.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nIt's a form of oppression.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nIt's like denial of victimhood.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nThat's not fair.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nI never got to be a victim.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nYou don't know what it's like to wake up every day\n\n23:56.000 --> 24:02.000\nand have no idea what a victim feels like.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nThere's not a minute that goes by\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:08.000\nwhere I don't know that I command all that I survey.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:11.000\nAnd I still can't get a job.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nRight, exactly.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:16.000\nHey, Mr. Superior Race,\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nyou could drop a few.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:22.000\nYou could be a little sexier.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nWhat, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:30.000\nI've been turning my body into a fucking shoe-killing machine.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:34.000\nWhy? I got a fucking bar in my kitchen doorway\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nand a fucking crank on it.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:39.000\nMr. Superior, I don't understand\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nif you're so superior to everybody,\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:45.000\nhow come you feel so under the thumb of these inferior people?\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:49.000\nBecause of the Jews and the black people\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:52.000\nand the black Jews.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:57.000\nIt sounds like you're afraid that they might have one up on you.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nThey might be superior.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nI think you're afraid. I think you're afraid of the reality.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:05.000\nI think the guy that doesn't have six guns and a knife on him.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nI seem more relaxed than you do.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:11.000\nI just brought these so I could feel comfortable speaking my mind.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:14.000\nThat's not something you could understand.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:17.000\nYou bring black people when you want to speak your mind.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nI have weapons.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:23.000\nI don't trust black people to protect my speech.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:27.000\nYou've got all these black people helping you speak.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nAre you literally Jay Leno?\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:34.000\nNo, no, not at all.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:38.000\nI just want to show you some headlines about the problem that we're facing here.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:41.000\nThis is real. This was really in the paper.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nLook at this headline.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:45.000\nI saw that you drove here in a Stanley Steamer.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:49.000\nLook, that's a white power car.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nIt's vintage. It's a Buick.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nLook at this headline. It says,\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:58.000\nMan saves Jew from tree.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:01.000\nGives it a bowl of milk. This is real.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:04.000\nAnyways, we get these headlines. I don't know.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nHere's the next one.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nThis is a coupon in the paper.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nLook at this. Three cakes and then look down on the corner.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:16.000\nJews.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nOkay, I'm Jay Leno. I'm Jay Leno.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:22.000\nIt's okay to admit that you're Jay Leno.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:26.000\nI just feel like I don't have a place. I feel like I'll be replaced.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nYou were the king of late night for a while.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:31.000\nLike no rite lasts forever.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:35.000\nYou can't be the king of late night for a thousand years.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:40.000\nThat's your perception. That's how you see it.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nAnyways, we have a great show.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nLet's bring out Kira Knightley, everybody.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nKira Knightley is here today.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nActually, we do have a guest.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nHe's been on the show before. He's our old friend.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nLet's welcome him back.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.000\nThe creator of the original IT crowd\n\n26:55.000 --> 27:02.000\nand so much more and a big, old Irish cousin of Harmontown\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:06.000\nfrom the Irish Harmontown annex.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nI was giving him time to get in the door.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:12.000\nLet's have a hand for Graham Linehan.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:27.000\nHello, Graham.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nHello, Graham.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nHi. How are you?\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.000\nGood. How are you?\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nWe're bringing you to town. Do you live here now or are you a traveler?\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nI just come here to do Harmontown.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nThat's it? You just play?\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:37.000\nYeah.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:41.000\nThe last time I was here, the first day, I did the same thing.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:44.000\nI tweeted, I'm in LA. What should I do?\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:47.000\nAnd I went to Glendale, which I didn't really like.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nSo no offense to people.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nIt was the kind of square...\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nNobody really likes Glendale.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nIt's like the prisoner, isn't it, a little bit?\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nDoesn't it?\n\n27:56.000 --> 28:01.000\nAnd then today, I forgot I went to Glendale before\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nand I did exactly the same thing.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nI said, where should I go?\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nAnd I fucking ended up in Glendale again.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:11.000\nAnd then I did Harmontown that night.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nAnd I've just done that again now.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:17.000\nSo it's like Barton Fink, except instead of doing wrestler movies,\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nI'm just going to be on Harmontown for the rest of my life.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:22.000\nThe next time you come, you should come with Ian Bowers.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nWho's Ian Bowers?\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:27.000\nHe's this guy who comes here sometimes and does a million things\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:31.000\nand maybe occasionally drops by here if it's convenient.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nAnd I wrote a song for him.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nOh, I see. Yeah, yeah.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:38.000\nYeah, I'm really glad that the show I'm on is going to...\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:42.000\nIt opens with a five-minute thing about drinking piss.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:45.000\nOh, this is the Graham Leonard episode.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:48.000\nDo you want some vodka?\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nNo, I'm okay.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nIt's made with potatoes.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:56.000\nI know it's not whiskey, but it's made with potatoes.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nNow, we were talking backstage, Graham.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nI think I mentioned this last time you were on,\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:03.000\nbut I'm a huge Father Ted fan, which is one of your early shows.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nWas that your first one?\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nYeah, 25 years ago, no.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nWas that the first show that you created?\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nNo, we did one before that called Paris,\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:15.000\nwhich was a sitcom about artists in the 1920s in Paris.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:19.000\nIf you've not seen Father Ted, please just get on Father Ted.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nIt's really funny. It's really, really good.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nThank you.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nAnd you're saying, kind of like in that Luke thing,\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nwhere you keep doing the same thing,\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nthat two of your actors died on the same date?\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nThat's right. Yeah, Frank left us.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nOn the same date.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nWhich is what date?\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nOh, God, I can't remember.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nYou should find out, because you might be next.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nNo, no.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nBut Arnold's getting a bit nervous.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nThere's just two left, but they're still young,\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nso it's going to be okay for a while, I hope.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nBut anyway.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nYou can cut things in this, can't you?\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nIf we're not cutting the pee and poo song,\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nthat's staying in there.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:59.000\nI just have one more question about Ireland.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nWhere's my wife?\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nShe's...\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nShe's your ex-wife now.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nShe went to Ireland, she never came back.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nReally?\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nI think she's still over there.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nShe's in Edinburgh.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nI just thought that would be a funny joke.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nIt was, it was great.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nI lost my wife.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nShe was in Ireland for a while.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nRight, right.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nDo you blame Ireland\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nfor stealing your ex-wife?\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nThat's a beautiful country.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nIt's flowing green hills,\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nso it acts so innocent.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nYeah.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nAnd then they bird-dog you.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nWe went to see a comedian once in the States,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nand somewhere, where was it?\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nNew York.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nAnd the guy said,\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nwho was doing the where are you from business?\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nAnd he said it to us, and we said Ireland.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nAnd he obviously wasn't expecting it.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nHe was expecting a state.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nGreen.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nShe flew over Ireland.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nWhat are you, a weather station worker,\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nheaded for John Carpenter's The Thing?\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nShe flew over Ireland.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nWhere is he going?\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nI don't know where Ireland is, so I thought maybe...\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nIt's on the way to John Carpenter's The Thing.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nYeah.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nSo what, I mean, it's kind of like,\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nso we're hysterical over here\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nright now,\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nand we're kind of like\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nprobably not paying\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nvery much attention to everything.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nWe're familiar that the UK\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nhave Brexited,\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nand we equated that with\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nthe right-leaning movement that we've been having over here.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nYeah.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nIt's what's really great\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nis that UK people\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\ncan't feel too superior.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nRight. No, that's...\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nImmediately we were making that joke that we're like,\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nat least the British won't be making fun of us\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nduring all of this.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nIt's super hard.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nBut you're\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nIrish about that, but I'm curious,\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nlike, how\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nis Scotland feeling about Brexit?\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nI've never...\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nWell, Scotland's in a weird position\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nbecause Scotland recently voted\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nto remain part of the United Kingdom.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nRight.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nThen Brexit happened.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nAnd now it's going to happen again,\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nand they're probably going to want to get out now.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nSo it's kind of... There's all sorts of insane things.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nThe only thing they didn't take into account at all\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nwas the Northern Ireland situation.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nThere's a very fragile piece\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nthat's lasted only, you know,\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\na couple of decades\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nnow, and they've just\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nrolled a dice on it.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nSo it's really odd.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nWhy is that so fragile?\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nWhy would\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nBrexit affect it?\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nBecause the border in Northern Ireland\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nthat separates Ireland from\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nNorthern Ireland is\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\na soft border at the moment.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nYou can, you know, pass\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nfrom Northern Ireland to Southern Ireland\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nwithout going through, you know, a lot of controls\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nand so on, but that's going to have to change\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nbecause Ireland's going to be part of the European Union\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nand Northern Ireland isn't.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nOf course, yeah, okay.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nIt's just insane. But it's one of these things...\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nIt's kind of like what happened, I think,\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nas well with\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nwhat's happening in the States\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nin that people just started realizing,\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\noh, maybe people aren't\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nreally clever.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nMaybe the people\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nwe trust, oh, they\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\ndo this, so they know what they're doing.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nMaybe they aren't really that clever.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nMaybe they're kind of crazy,\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nsome of them, you know.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nWhich is an uplifting feeling, right?\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nBut you can't call it uplifting...\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nIt has been this week, as you say. I've liked this week.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nIs it like watching them because it's like\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nthe insinuation is that, yeah, they can't do this?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nWell, the only problem is if there's no one\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nto replace them.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nIf there's no one clever\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nto replace them, then what do we do?\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nThey've already said they will not be replaced.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nThey were saying that and everything.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nThis was a good week, though, I think.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nI feel good about this week.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nWell, because it turns out...\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nYeah, I guess what it is, is it's like...\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nIt's weird, because I'm 44 now,\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nand the\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\n24-year-old version of me\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nwould have... God knows\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nwhere I'd be in this\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nmap, because I\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nwould throw\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nmy Writers Guild magazines across the room\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nwhen I saw the diversity\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nreport card in the magazine, and I'd go,\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nwhy are they spending my money?\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nWho cares about diversity?\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nIt should be a meritocracy.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nWriters should be... You want the best\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nwriter for the job, and\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nlike...\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nEverything made sense to me.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nIf you hooked me up to a lie detector test,\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nit's not like I ever would have said\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nI'm racist and it would have gone\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nwrong.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nI think he's right.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nIt wasn't racism.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nIt was like, I don't know,\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nI don't want to use such a haughty word as ignorance\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nor something.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nMy scope was kind of small at that time.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nI was also broke.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nNothing makes you\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nmore susceptible to\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nthis right-leaning,\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\ntoothy philosophy,\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nlike being fucking\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nunemployed and having no control over your future.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nI don't want to be too\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\njoyous about all these idiots losing their jobs\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nbecause while it's\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nshort-term, it's great\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nto see them losing their jobs long-term.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nYou've got to think, what are these idiots\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\ngoing to do next?\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nWhere have they got to go?\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nI blame it all on\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nheavy metal not really being a thing\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nanymore.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nI think in the old days, they just all\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nhave been listening to Iron Maiden,\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nand everything would be fine.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nYou know,\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nheadbanging, and\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nthese kind of releases.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nThat's why Scandinavia is so chill, because they've got loads of metal up there.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nThey love their metal.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nSo that stuff got replaced with\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nkind of meth-y club music\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nin the middle of a second.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nBut do you remember, it wasn't\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\na period where in a stadium\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nor something, they burnt disco records\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nin the 70s, do you remember this?\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nRight, that was a big thing, hating disco.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nI think it's the same kind of people, you know?\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nAnd I just think, there was a time\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nwhen everyone was able to,\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nwhen the internet wasn't around, everyone was able to channel it\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\ninto\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\none of about, let's say,\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\n15 activities, you know?\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nAnd now, they can channel it\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\ninto this\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nweird kind of performance art\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nthat they're just realizing\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nhas real consequences.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nI'm very\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nfascinated by why it's happened and why it's,\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nand I don't know.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nOne thing I'm wondering is,\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nare there going to be a lot of these guys\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nwho, with the death in Charlottesville,\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nare they going, are there a lot of these\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nirony kind of Nazis\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nwho are going to just suddenly go, oh,\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nyou know, and back away from it?\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nThat's something that I'm interested in.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nI think a certain percentage, or that I think a certain,\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nI don't think anybody's going to be really drawn to it that much.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nLike, there's no,\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nlike, maybe like Norman Bates\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nor something like that.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nI think this, the percentage\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nthat are into that kind of\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nhardcore right-wing philosophy,\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nthat number probably stays around the same.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nYeah, they were all in that bandstand.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nThey feel a little liberated right now\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nto come out there without their costumes on\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nand to come out and, you know,\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nlet that flag fly.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nBut that bandstand was great.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nThe visual of that bandstand.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nI've gone from being very optimistic\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nand very joyful about the internet.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nThere's a comedian called David O'Darherty\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nwho describes it like,\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nthe internet used to be like this telescope\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nthat we'd look up\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nand see, you know, other people\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nin other lives, and it was amazing.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nAnd now it's like we, it's like a shit pipe.\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nAnd every day you look up\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nand you think, oh, I wonder what's coming down the shit pipe.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nYeah, that's not, like,\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nthe millennial generation, as much as I\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nsay they're dumb\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nand whatever, and poop on them, because I'm an old man,\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nsaying, get off my line. But the thing\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nto pity about them is that they've been born\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\ninto a culture that we,\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nwe're processing everything through time to get\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\non the internet.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nThe internet will always be a second language to us.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nWe'll always be translating\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nreal life into the internet and vice versa.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nAnd these poor kids,\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\noften it's characterized\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nas a fire hose to the face of information.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nAnd we always thought\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nI think when you and I were kids,\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nwe probably thought, when we think about the future\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nand we think about minds connecting to each other,\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nwe always thought that that meant everyone\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nwould get smarter and more patient.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nYou wouldn't even have\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nthe option,\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nthe information would be\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nall up in your face,\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nwhich would automatically make you less\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nthis, less that, less that,\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nlike, slowly, but it turns out\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nand it makes sense now that we're seeing it\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nthat that doesn't make the case,\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nthat that's not the case, because it's like,\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nif everything\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nis bullshit, which it would appear to be,\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nI mean, there is no way\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nto represent truth\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nwithout\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\ncreating your own version, blah, blah, blah,\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nI mean, there,\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nbut that doesn't mean you can say the earth is flat\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nand have Spencer not make fun of you.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nIt just, it just means\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nthat I think we've,\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nit's like we live in this age now where we're back\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nto the propaganda\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nkind of consciousness, but now we're\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nconscious of it and conscious\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nof the consciousness and now everyone is just sort of,\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nthat's what this mean culture is,\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\neveryone's just going like, yeah, propaganda's a thing,\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nso what's your propaganda?\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nWhat's yours?\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nAnd there's the only people left that are saying\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nthere's an objective truth, they're kind of like,\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nthey're more right\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nthan everybody else, because if they're calm\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nand educated, but they're also incredibly\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nfrustrated, because they're like, wait,\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nhow are you people just dancing to a completely\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\ndifferent song that's not even playing\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nand they're like, because it is, and they're like,\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nwell, can't argue with that!\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nIt's almost like,\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nit's like, I, when I\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nfirst started thinking\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nabout this seriously, I thought, oh, we\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nare now plugged into a consciousness, I mean\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nthe hive mind is the word that we\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nall use for it, but it really is like\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nwe are also plugged into\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nthe consciousness of a lot of, you know,\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nthere might as well be bees,\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nyou know, it's just like a buzzing, you\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nshouldn't know what, none\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nof us should know what blackpilling is,\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nyou know, only some of us do.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nI mean, there's an argument to be made that you and I\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nshouldn't know how many stray dogs\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nthere are in Los Angeles, you know,\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nlike someone else\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nwould say, yes, you should know that, you need to\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nbe aware, because that's a huge problem, because\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nthat's their thing, and they're like, yeah, why would\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nyou not want to know, that's why there's 75\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nmillion of them, is because you didn't\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nknow and you didn't care, so now, thank God\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nyou know, then you add\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\n900 things like that,\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nhow do you not become a nihilist?\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nWhen you just know everything\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nand everything is\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\neverything is misery, there's\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nno real fairy tale,\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nthere's no actual NBA\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nall star who goes home to his wife\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nand kids, and\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\neats an apple pie, and\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nlike, I don't know\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nwhat our definition of a hero is, but\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nit's like, sooner or later.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nHis name is Kevin Durant.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nBut here's the thing, so that's a funny,\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nI mean, yeah, that's the\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nMobius strip of this, is that with this,\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nas shit gets more and more\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nscary, the\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nbar for heroism\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nI almost don't want to say it lowers\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nlike it takes less of a hero, but yeah,\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nI mean, it's just like the minimum\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nstandard\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nit becomes higher in that way, and then we re-enter\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\na world where people are kind of like walking\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\ntall and like, saying gallant\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nthings, I think that's a good thing.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nWell, did you see the two\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nnewsreaders, I don't know what channel\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nit was, but it was one of the rare times\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nwhen they took a Trump mouthpiece\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nand said, and every single\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\npoint he tried to make, they said, no, no, that's not true, that's a lie.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nDo you see those guys?\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nIt's a great video, it's well worth\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nchecking out, I wish I could remember.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nDid you see the person that played a tuba\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nnext to the...\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nDid you see\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\ndid you see today\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nthe girl, the woman doing that\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nto the civil...\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nWas that from...\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nThen someone did a video of it, like a\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nbit of the Ken Burns thing, yeah, yeah.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nThat was the kind of internet I thought\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nwe would have, I thought it was going to be\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\na great kind of outpouring\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nof creativity, you know, but the\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nunfortunate thing is that right-wing people\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\naren't funny, and they don't have\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\na sense of humor.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nThat's not even a controversial thing to say.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nThey're not funny, so\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nthey think like...\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nHow do you pronounce it? I don't think I've ever said in real life\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\npeep or pepe.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nOh, pepe. So if they do a pepe,\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nI don't think I've ever said it. I've never had reason\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nto, because people I know have liars.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nBut like...\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nBut, you know,\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nto have an image of\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\npepe putting someone in a gas chamber,\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nyou know, it's not funny\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\non any level.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nWell, it's...\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nThat's why they keep retreating to\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nmeta, meta, meta, meta, meta. Oh, it's funny in a way, you don't understand.\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nI'm 15 years old and I don't believe in God\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nand I'm moments from\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nshooting up a school, maybe, maybe not.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nI'm already hard-hard. Here's\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\na gift of a Chinese baby getting run over\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nin a parking lot. I jerked off to it.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nThe only\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\ncool thing about that, those\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nterrifying children... He didn't really jerk off to them.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nIt's a\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nfictional character I'm making up.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nBut it's like that thing where\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nthey're like...\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nThey're never more than\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\none shocked\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nreaction away from\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nrevealing that that's all part of the\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\njoke. It's like this kind of odd...\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nIt's like celebrating\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nbeing...\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nWell, we kind of\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\npinned a medal on,\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nfor instance, gangster rap\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nwhen it was the 90s\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nand it was like we're going from\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nrapping about peas and carrots\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nto all of a sudden this person saying\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nthe N word a lot and the F word even\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nmore and the C word and everything\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nand he's talking about shooting other\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\npeople and all this stuff and the parents are like, oh my God.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nAnd the defense of\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nthat is...\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nWell, we're just\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nshowing you how it is.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nWe're\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nexpressing something that's going on and it's\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nkind of hard to argue with that. In fact,\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nin the right cultural context, we\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\napplaud that. So\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nnow you've got these\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nkids who are like... They're not showing\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nanything that's going on.

anyone\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\ncries uncle is dangerous now\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nit's really frightening to me that\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nPence would never\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nhave gotten within miles of the White House\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nif he hadn't snuck in under\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nDonald's fart cloud\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nthere's no way\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nDonald's fart cloud\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nis that what she said? it's like a protective\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nI'm writing that down\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nthat's the new series you're pitching\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:19.000\nwhen you're here\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nbut you know\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nhe wouldn't be known\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nhe's even\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nvisibly disturbing\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nthere's something very kind of\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nStephen King villain about him\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nand\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nhe just wouldn't have got in and now what\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nhe's going to be\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nin power for three years\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nI mean that's something\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nI'm a little bit worried about\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nI'm more worried in a weird way than Donald\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nbecause I'm kind of enjoying watching Donald\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nbecome the biggest loser of all time\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nbut there could be a\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nthing here it could be like a defibrillation\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\na near death experience where coming out of it\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nno matter what happens as politics resumes being\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\npolitics and becomes even more dangerous\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nbecause it stops being a rodeo clown\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nthat the woke\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nthe millennials the younger\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\npeople even than them have now\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nexperienced this thing of like are you telling me\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nthat becoming the president\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nis first of all not\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\na contest that you win by being\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\na good person not a contest you even win\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nby being good at that job\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nbut most importantly\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nis actually holds no reward\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nif you actually\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\njust blunder into it\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nand start throwing birthday parties for yourself\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\npeople you will become more\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nhated than if you just stayed a manager\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nat Burger King\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nand therefore maybe there are more important things\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\ngoing on in my world than winning this weird\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nHighlander contest of who can be the biggest douche\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nlike\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nand then maybe I don't know\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nbut let's talk about\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nlike I want to talk to you as a writer\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nso I can pretend that I'm one\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nabout like\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nare you finding it difficult\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nto write\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nperiod like right now\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nyeah kind of I mean good\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nokay good\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nno I think it's\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nwhat's the problem what's the problem with it\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nbecause life is a fucking\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nscreenplay and you can't\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\ntype fade in and a guy finding magic shoes\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nthere's interesting things\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nwell what do the shoes turn into\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nHitler heads because otherwise\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nI'm beaten by\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nbut I think you might suffer for not worse than me\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nbecause I think you've got\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nI think you're\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nin a great way very cerebral\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nand I think that you don't like\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nyou hate like Tim and Eric I know\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nhave this thing where I think they said\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nonce that a lot of their style\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\njust comes from them being terrified of\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nboring people so they have that kind\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nof very insane style\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nI have no such fear\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nbut like you know\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nyour stuff is very aware of itself\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nyou know it's very aware of what it's doing\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nyou know I I\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\ntry and I try and\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nsuppress that for a first draft\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nyou know what I mean sometimes successfully\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nand sometimes not but it's harder to do that\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nthese days because\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nit's like what you were saying I think\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nyou said about Rick and Morty that you\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nwere going to have a big\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nsecret but you decided not to because\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nthe internet would figure it out before\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nand did and did yeah\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nyeah and that's\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nkind of the problem it's like\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nyou're competing now against\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\na giant\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nwasp brain you know\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nthat is the world and that makes a little bit\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nmore difficult to do the\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nnecessity of a boring first draft\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nyeah do you know what I mean\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nbut I still but I'll tell you what I'm doing\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nthat's helping I'm watching a lot of cheers\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nthat helps\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nbecause because you look at coach and you\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\njust think I want to write someone like coach\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nright you know I love\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nI love him\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nthe show you're working on now is\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nwhat's it called?\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nwe just did a show Count Arthur Strong\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:57.000\nwhich is\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:59.000\nthis really funny guy\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nplayed by Steve Delaney who\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.000\nwe had three years\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\non BBC One where I might as well\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nhave just thrown every episode down the\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\ncrevasse\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nbecause they didn't repeat it\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nwhen you're writing like\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nplease don't let me stop complaining about\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nthat\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nit'll just die there and I'll look like I'm blaming\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\neveryone but ourselves but\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nwhen you're writing your stuff like\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nyou're writing for mostly a\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nUK audience or\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nyeah but I'm hoping that everything travels\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nthe way the IT crowd and Ted\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nis kind of traveling a little bit\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nthe IT crowd especially\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nbut you're not hopefully writing to try to\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nplease a certain kind of audience\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nyou're just writing what you like\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nno I guess\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nI was always really\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nI mean I don't want to speak ill of any show\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nbut I always preferred\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nSeinfeld to Curb\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nbecause for me Seinfeld\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nbecause it had to navigate\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nkind of strictures of\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nyou know\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nnetwork TV\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nfor me it was like\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\na cold porter song or something it was just a bit more\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nelegant than Curb\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nbecause of the constraints\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nyeah because of the constraints and I felt that\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nthe performances were stronger\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nand the whole thing together\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nI like the elegance that I like\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nwhen\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nthings are difficult so with Count Arthur for instance\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nyou know we don't curse\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nbecause kids love them\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nso writing\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nand one of my favorite things\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nwhich I think I've spoken about before on this show\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nbut one of my favorite things is taking\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\ntaboo subjects and making the palatable\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nto a\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nfamily audience\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nI think that's a really funny thing when you get it right\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nand I thought Seinfeld did that beautifully\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nyou know I mean Master\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nMaster\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nshe's a brother fucker\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nshe fucks her brother\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nfucks her brother\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\noh yeah\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nI'd like to be her brother\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\ngiddy up\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nbut yeah\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nwhy is it that\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nI mean you probably can't answer this because it's a question\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nabout my own taste but like why do I\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nfind English or\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nIrish like writers and\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nTV shows like the\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nsame reason I like American shows\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nToast of London is the funniest goddamn thing\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nbecause they sound funny is that the answer\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nbut you know that's written by Arthur who did\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nFather Ted as well\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nyeah that's a fucking doozy\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nyeah yeah but that's you know\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nit's the same thing when I saw\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nme and Arthur we used to watch\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nlittle clips\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nof Saturday Night Live\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nwhich you couldn't see\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nit wasn't broadcast over where we were\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nso we would just see little videos of it\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nyou know later on on YouTube and stuff\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nbut beforehand they were just on these compilations\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nwhere they had to show tiny clips because\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nthey couldn't use any of the celebrities because\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nthey would have to pay them again or something\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nwow weird so you'd only see like\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nsnatches of sketches just all Lorraine women\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nyeah but we were\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nbut you know we would see some\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nwe would see a sketch like\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nUnfrozen Caveman Lawyer\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nyou know it was like that it's the greatest\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nthing and\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nand we just thought they were working on this\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\non this you know\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nreally high level and it wasn't until we saw\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nyou know whole episodes\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nwhere we realized oh okay\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nit's a little bit more conventional\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nyou grew up on Money Python and we did\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nI saw Money Python\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000\npiecemeal through like weird\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nsyndicated shows in the middle of the night\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nand I saw Python when I was\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\na teenager so it had that\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\non a kid so it had a very strong\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\neffect on me probably more of an effect\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nyou know it's just you see stuff that\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nwhen it's hard to see it feels more\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nvaluable

01:05:15.000\nactually I hope I'm not exaggerating\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nit wasn't many it was just with the internet\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nyou always think there's more than there are\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nthey're louder because they know\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nthey know that there's no shows for them\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nthey're

01:05:37.000\nyou know for us it was a very\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nnatural character to have in the show\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nbecause there's a lot of Turkish\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nit's a lot like trolling right\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\npeople in London you know\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nyou're doing things that in your gut\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nyou know you have a processor you go like\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\na certain kind of person\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nthere's a bump on this\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nbut I genuinely didn't know that would happen\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nI genuinely didn't think just the appearance\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nof this character in the show\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nwould have a lot of people saying\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nlike we were called politically correct\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\njust because we had this character in\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nyou know and I didn't expect that\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nyou know it was very strange\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nwhat was the impulse to make that character\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nTurkish in the first place\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nbecause we knew a lot of Turkish guys who were like that\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nand we thought they were funny\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nkind of grumpy you know\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nthere's the soup Nazi in there as well\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nwho you know everything I do is influenced\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nby Seinfeld in some way\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nyou know\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nand we found this brilliant actor\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nwho was just every when he never\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nsmiled he was hilarious\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nso they just wanted the show to be lily white\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nand no\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nbecause that's how the original was\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nyou know anything that was different to that\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nand it was a mixed race relationship\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nI think the people that freak out\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nit's like I'm gonna say\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000\na solid chunk of them\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nthey're not actually if you\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nchange Peter Parker to

big fans of comedy\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nor sci-fi or comic books\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nor whatever their thing is\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nthey're such big great

yourself\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nand I don't know I think that leads\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nto interesting interesting\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nas I say\n\n01:10:01.000

01:10:21.000\nwhat you can do\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nand I think the answer is\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nif not for the wider reasons\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nI mean also obviously\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nthere are good reasons to do it anyway\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nbut for reasons of\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nartistic reasons it's good\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nartistic reason too it's a good reason\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nguys like me I always want to just say\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\ndon't you want

jukeboxes\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nand that's\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\na really good argument for unplugging\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nyourself from the
