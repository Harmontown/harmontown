00:00.000 --> 00:13.640
Hello! Hello, you apes! Well, welcome. My name is Mitch Hurwitz. I'm the temporary cop

00:13.640 --> 00:18.800
stroller here in Harmontown. Is that what the guy's name is? Dan Harmon, I understand.

00:18.800 --> 00:24.000
Well, I want you to give it up. He's not even backstage yet, so don't give it up, I guess.

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
Just hang on to it, and get ready to say hello to the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
Thank you. Thank you, guest cop stroller Mitch Hurwitz. Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm sorry, I didn't know that you didn't know, but for some reason I always come up through the crowd.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
I don't know much about anything. I was listening to Harmontown on the way over to kind of prepare.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
And suddenly you had a sense that Jeff always sees me in the back room.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
First of all, I didn't realize you were recording it. So people elect to listen to this.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They drive to work, or they, I don't know.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
It's a whole new world full of less fame and more stuff to listen to.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
No, I do know all about it. In fact, I was here, you know, Dan doesn't like people to know this part of it,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
but we started our rehearsal early today. We did this at one o'clock.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
And I hope I remember everything. Yeah.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
It is the only thing that I ask people that are involved in the show to...

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Sorry. That was your line. Sorry, sorry.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
To keep a secret is the amount of preparation that goes into the show, because I find it uncharismatic.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I like to pretend that we stay in the moment here at the show.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm less groomed than the normal Comptroller. Did you notice that?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
No. Oh, then Jeff, you mean? Because he's so dapper.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah, he's very dapper. And actually, maybe later we can talk about some grooming ideas for me,

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
because I just looked in the mirror on the way out here and I thought,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I might be too old for this hairstyle.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
What do you mean? Well, we'll get to it. We'll get to it. We'll get to it. We'll do your thing.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
What do you do different?

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
What do I get your opinion on? I mean, I guess you could shave it down, though,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
like a little short... That sounds sexy.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
You could grow it out into a big old poofy thing.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Those are the only two things I can imagine based on what I'm seeing. Yeah, I really have the two options.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
It could be longer or shorter. Small ball, large ball.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Not the guy to talk to about this. I will go to the stylist sometimes and just say,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
small ball me, will you? But you're very...

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Look, let's try not to have the whole show be you and I just blowing each other,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
but you're a very handsome man.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Thank you. I'm going to just really quickly take off my shirt and I want to show you.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Wow. No, I'm not.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
I was shocked when I met you because I assumed from how talented you were

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
that you must have been 800 pounds.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
The first time I ever saw you physically, I went to the Asset of Arrested Development shooting.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
I remember meeting you. And for some reason I didn't Google image search you

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
to be prepared for anything. I just pictured this mountain of a man

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
with birds and squirrels and his beard.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
I know that's a compliment. It is.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I don't feel like saying thank you.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
I pictured David Milch as being slightly less, like a slightly less

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
large mountain with a couple less squirrels. I pictured Vince Gilligan as being like,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I don't know, like maybe... Steve Buscemi.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
...twice as fat as both of us, but with like a corkshoe-shaped dick or something.

03:44.000 --> 03:52.000
I automatically assume if people are that talented that they ought to be nice.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
That's very nice. Well, I'm getting there. I do remember when I met you,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
I think the first thing I said so as not to scare you off was fuck them.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
You were like, yeah, right? I was like, no, because it was right after the whole event.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
It was a dream come true because you were like an oily salve

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
on my gaping wounds.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Again, I don't feel like saying thank you.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
But I know it's a nice thing that you're...

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I also thought you'd be cranky and not approachable.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
This is all self-justification. I think like, okay, I'm a bad person in this way,

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
that way, that way. So as long as the guy that made the rest of development

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
is fatter and more of an asshole, that puts me on a map that makes sense.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I think I'll just hide it better. I really do.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I can be more of an asshole tonight, if you'd like.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Just try it for five minutes. Just give us a taste.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I'll be like Niles to your Frasier.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Just give it a taste. Let's just give it a taste so we can turn it off.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
So what else is going on in the news today?

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
I guess our vice president is up to his old tricks again.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Well, I haven't seen a paper in a while.

05:04.000 --> 05:14.000
Health care is at an all-time health...

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
You know, don't you agree?

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
It's all bullshit, man. It's all bullshit.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Stop those guys.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
This is you being an asshole.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
All right, all right, all right. Let's reset.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
So I've got a... Let's see. I took a bath tonight.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
Thank you.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
You're a big water displacement guy, right?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
You're a whole...

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
You don't care about weight.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
My argument is principles, yes.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, you care about mass.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I don't care about water.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
I took a bath, and I love taking bubble baths,

06:01.000 --> 06:08.000
but Aaron bought me for my birthday a waterproof iPad sleeve.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
It's just a plastic bag that seals,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
but the plastic is made out of a material

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
that allows for your wet soapy fingers to pinch and zoom and tap

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
and double tap right through the bag.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
And you got... Just because I missed a couple of shows,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
but you got her a diamond ring, didn't you?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Wasn't there a...

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
As I recall, there was like a big, large...

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
That was fitted that you actually...

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
But it was definitely the waterproof iPad case of engagement.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
And she's getting the iPad case of husbands, for sure.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
She's ahead. She's a more generous person than me,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
no matter how much I would ever give her.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
But she...

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
And it's not like a thing...

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
You don't submerge it.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
It's not like, hey, submerge it.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
There's not a picture on the cover of an Asian girl in a pool

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
with goggles smiling.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Like a picture of a fish on the iPad under the water.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Right, with a burst that says, like, try submerging it.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
It also doesn't say, don't submerge it,

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I assume you shouldn't just, like, hold it under and tempt fate.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
But the big difference is, if this is a thing that you put on your iPad,

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
if you dropped it, definitely, and you just grab it and fish it out,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
it's gonna be fine.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And that makes the world of difference.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
So, like, here's the thing about my life.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Two things, like, keep me going.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Hot soapy baths.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
And tweeting, I guess.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Usually just at people who say, like, oh,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I was disappointed in the last night's episode,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
and I just go, fuck off, fuck off!

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And then I just...

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
It feels like I took a bath with my...

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
in my heart or something.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And I'm, like, so...

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
You drew a buoyance.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Whenever I would get into the bath,

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
most people, like, they get out when they feel clean or they feel pruney.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And I would get out when I've...

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I haven't tweeted in a while.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, okay, I get it.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
So, somebody might be saying, hey, good show last night.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah, or I was disappointed.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I would get off my ass and say, thank you.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
I was disappointed in last night's episode.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Don't say anything. Just take a bath if you agree.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
And then I miss it.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Oh, you miss it.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Sorry, I already blocked you, bro.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Carmen admits mistakes were made.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
So I sunk into this soapy water

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
and I tweeted, I'm taking a bath.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And I took a picture of myself taking a bath.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And then I had nothing else to say.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
But I took the longest bath in the world

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
because I had the...

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
It didn't... I never used it again.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I didn't do anything with it.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
But it was there in a plastic bag next to the tub.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
So I took the world's longest, most satisfying bath.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Great. You could have watched,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
you could have watched, like, Showa on your iPad.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
And just really, just dug it.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Just enjoyed it, relaxed.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Because you love the Holocaust, right?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Wasn't that you?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Is Showa a...

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Oh, it's a hoot.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Rob Schrab, who's coming out later,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
did a very funny comic book about it.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
It's about the Holocaust.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I stopped taking baths when I realized,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
which was late in life.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I mean, I was in my late 20s

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
when I realized that the penis floats.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Yes.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
And it floats.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
For those of you, I guess,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
who are women,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
or under 29.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And I didn't like...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I didn't like seeing it in there,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
in the bubbles.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You know what I mean?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Well, it embarrassed me.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm sorry to say that I do not have that problem.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
My balls float.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
The penis doesn't float.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
My penis, as I've said on this podcast,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
is a...

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm proud of it.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I've heard great things.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
If there was no such thing

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
as this whole mythology

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
of size and stuff,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
apparatus-wise,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
it's very functional.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I would look at it as Darwin.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
This is a very fit specimen.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Because that thing,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
when it's not needed,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
boom, it's gone.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
And that, I think,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
in a world of saber-toothed tigers,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
is like, that's valuable.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I'm impressed by that.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
This guy's like Inspector Gadget.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I'll tell you what's not impressive

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
are the balls.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Because if you think...

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Mine are giant and they're unwieldy.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
But go on, please.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I think they're all unwieldy.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I mean, that's the nature of the ball.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
But you know why

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
they're on the outside of the body?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I'm sure you do.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Apparently, spermatogenesis

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
requires one degree difference.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I've never understood this about God.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It's the argument against intelligent design.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
It really is.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Because it's like...

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Oh, the eyeball's so complicated.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, let's talk about your nuts, you fucking idiot.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And the solution, the design solution,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
which, if Apple came up with it,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
you would blog how much you hate the thing,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
is, how about a sack?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
How about a sack on the outside?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Maybe in one of the hands?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Gentlemen, what if part of the inside of the body

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
was outside the body?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
It's never going to be a problem.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
People walk on all fours.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It's never going to be a problem.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
It's protected.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Yes.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Because they always explain that in health class.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
They go, well, you need one degree cooler

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
than body temperature

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
to make sperm.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
You can't figure out a solution to this

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
to make my body.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Here's your new Jaguar.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
As you can see, it's a convertible.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
It's got that nice little grill.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
This is sort of a floppy sack full of gasoline.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Make sure not to hit anything against that.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
The answer is absolutely,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
you couldn't figure out a solution.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
If you were Steve Jobs,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
and God is not Steve Jobs,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I'm not saying he's not as smart.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I'm saying he gives way less of a shit

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
about design.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
About customer satisfaction.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
We got mad at Steve Jobs,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
and he said, then don't hold it that way

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
when the antenna was on the other side for the first time.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
God doesn't answer your emails.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
How's that for a start?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
When you get a human body, it's not always set to

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Cupertino time.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
It's not that kind of...

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
It's a horrible...

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I mean, even under the armpit would be...

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
would make more sense.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Kind of keep your arm down.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
There's got to be a chemical way.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Even as humans, with our short time with intelligence,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
we've learned how to design things

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
that chemically can create...

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
could be one degree lower or higher in temperature.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
We've done great.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I have toe warmers in my boots.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Not right now.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Maybe that's it.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Maybe they're just waiting for us to discover

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
we need a testicle cooler.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Because they do retract again if you're under a certain age

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
or you're a woman.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
They're always moving.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
They get around.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
When you...

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
If you ever just lay...

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
If you ever have a healthy relationship enough

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
where you're just laying on your bed naked

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
and in your full Shamu glory

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and just air drying

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
after a shower or something.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
And you bother to look down

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
at your balls.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
The first thing you'd think would be like,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I'm never going to get a woman.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And if I did,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
she would be so disgusting

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
to like...

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
continually

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
shifts and moves

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
like a river of magma.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Like some kind of

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
weird psychedelic...

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
It's self-conscious.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
It's incredibly self-conscious.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
There's nerve endings in your balls,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
to be sure, but there's nothing...

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
It's only visual. When you look down at it,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
you have to see it. You have to catch it in the act.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Shifting and pulsing

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
and adjusting

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
to what?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
There's nothing that has to do with me.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Doesn't care if community was good last night.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It has no reaction to anything.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Just stay in ready.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Just moving around. Stay in ready.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I guess based on making that one temperature...

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah, and kind of getting ready

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
to get ready for sex

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
and kind of thinking like, hey, let's not let these guys get too productive.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Right? Let's distract them.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I have to imagine that

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
pants...

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
that they raise the temperature

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
for your balls by at least a degree.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
That's interesting.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Thank you for pretending that's the case.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
The problem is, you know,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
these universities,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
they just don't give up the research money

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
for a while.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
You got to sound so smart, you know, and they don't...

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I remember reading that our sperm count

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
had dropped since the days of World War II.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Well, you know what has dropped is our testosterone.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Oh, really?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I think it's just because we're nervous, but...

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
No, it has.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I talked to a doctor recently,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
who did a whole blood panel,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
and he said, you know,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
in my generation, it would have been like 1200.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
And if it dipped below 1200,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
you know, I would really feel like weeping all the time.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Your generation, he said,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
you want to be around 800.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
And he said, young people today, it's like 400.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Wait, what?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
That's what this nut told me.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Can't say his name. He was kind of an interesting dude.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
But apparently there is a worldwide trend.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And we know this is happening in Asia.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Right? They're having a lot less sex.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Huh?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah. Really?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah, this could be it.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Society could end at nerd melt.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
That's as great as we ever got.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
You know, we had aqueducts,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
and then we had the computer,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
and then we did these podcasts, and that was it.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I hadn't heard that,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
but I remember becoming terrified in biology class.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
A biology teacher explained, he said,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
you know, populations of mammals

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
as they outgrow their food supply,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
they radically change in behavior.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
If you have a relatively

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
closed-off warehouse full of rats

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
and a certain amount of food in that warehouse,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
the rats will hit a point

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
where they're conscious as a species

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
or that localized population

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
of the amount of food that's left.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And they will spontaneously

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
engage in self-mutilation

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
and murder

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and all kinds of

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
just, well, very familiar-sounding behaviors.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah, to us.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Right.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
And not to rats.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
And I just remember hearing that,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
and he didn't even bother to say,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
so think about it.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
He was just pointing that out about mammals,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and I was like, holy shit, that's what we're doing.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I mean, this is the guy you strangled, right?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Because

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
you had to stay there during the snow or something?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
No, it is.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
It's a problem.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
We had 6 billion, what, 20 years ago,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
and now we got 9 billion.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I don't want to bum you guys out.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
You can't bum these guys out.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Like yeast.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
When yeast is deprived of oxygen,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
which it really needs, right?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
If you put it at the bottom of a bunch of grape juice,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
it makes alcohol.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
So maybe that's our destiny.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Yeah, that's why we have alcohol.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Because they want

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
oxygen,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
but there's nothing there but fruit juice.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
And it happens in our body, too.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
So that's how you create alcohol.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Let's try it.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
The opposite of making lemons out of lemons,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
or lemonade out of lemons,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
it's like making poison out of...

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
out of lemonade.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Right.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Not enough lemonade.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Like, you're saying that, well,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
yeast isn't getting drunk, though.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
No, yeast is basically

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
shitting alcohol.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Well, I don't know how much you want to reveal.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
No, tell them anything.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
So we went out the other day.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And we said, what can you shit?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Um...

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Mitch shit the entire bill of rights.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Now, here's what's...

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I swear to God, I found one typo.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
There was one typo.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Not true.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Not true.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Self... self... self-ervident.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
And I didn't bother to point it out.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Those were, you know, my S's and my F's

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
when I shit bills of rights.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I do it the way they did it.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
The preffident shall have.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
All right.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Well, we have some friends here tonight.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I guess we should bring them out,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
since we've covered all of these.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
They're still friends.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
They have fundamental material.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
They're our first friend that's out here.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
He's celebrating a special event.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
He's my best friend from Milwaukee

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
before I moved to L.A.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
The reason I moved to L.A.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
is because this guy I was doing stand-up

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
and improv with created this comic book

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
at the film rights option by Oliver Stone.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And so we moved out to L.A.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
because we thought that that meant

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
it's time to participate in Hollywood.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
And we were so wrong and so naive,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
but thank God we were.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
And he's the beginning

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
of the second chapter

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
of my life.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
He's the... he's my everything.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
He's experienced all the grief

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
and disillusionment and triumphs

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
and victories from, like,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
the age of 20 to the age of 35

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
with me.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
And it just so happens that comic book

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
that he created on his kitchen table,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
it turns 20 years old on Wednesday,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
which should make me feel sad.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
But it...

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I don't know.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I think you get to a certain age

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
where that kind of stuff makes you feel good.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I think that's absolutely true.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
That's the fantasy

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
of pharaohs and kings

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
and fat people with rec rooms

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
is to make something that lasts 20 years.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
So let's bring out

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
somebody who's made something that lasts 20 years,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
my friend Rob Schrab.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Rob is wearing his

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Skud the disposable assassin baseball cap,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Skud t-shirt,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
his fireman press,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
his gun jacket.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Uh, yeah, yeah.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
You're all decked out.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Now, you're a man of means.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
You've got your own career.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
You've moved beyond this comic book you created.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Yes.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
You're not here scratching for dough.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
No, no. Wait, I'm sorry. You get paid for this?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I don't think he does.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
He's not here

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
scratching for dough.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
He's got plenty of ways to be happy

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
if all he cares about is material things.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
But you have an emotional attachment

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
to this product you created when we were kids.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I created it

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
when I was 23

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
and it came out

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
1994, same year as

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Pulp Fiction.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
when the World Trade Center came down.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And what? No, nothing.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I mislanded a joke that

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
What were you talking over each other?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm going to take this off

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
because it makes my ears look

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
weird.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Your ears look amazing now, by the way.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Thank you.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Thank you very much, Mitch.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Have you mentioned what the name of the book is yet?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
No, I don't think I have, actually.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
It's Skud, the disposable assassin.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Skud.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Where is it? I saw it back.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I laid out some vintage

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Skuds

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
on some of your chairs.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
This is

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
all of Skud number fours.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
This was the first time you and I

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
really, well, we wrote sketches and stuff together

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
but this was the first time we wrote like a story.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Right. Because we wrote some comedy sketches

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
together, you trusted me enough

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
to, you said like, hey, write

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
this next issue of my comic book and stuff.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Correct. Yeah.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
You were the first person to learn that

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm a bad, I have a very bad work ethic.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I remember a lot of answering machine

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
messages from you going, come on, man.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Why?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Just tell me how far you are.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
For young people. Oh, water under a bridge.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
20 years ago, we had answering machines

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
for the young people.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
You're probably picturing robots that answered the phone

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
but no, it was just like a tape recorder.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I mean, we had, yeah, and you think,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
oh, how lame answering machines, but holy shit,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
like, we had these cassette tapes

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
and like,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
every time I called Rob,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I would do a character.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Yeah. Back in the early days of our

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
improv training that everything was a bit.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Everything had to be funny, everything had to be

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
a bit. We were, we were so, we were

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
so into comedy.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
It's me, Mr. Philips.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Look up on me, Rob, Rob, I'm just a refrigerator

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
here for him, yeah.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And then seriously, pick me up at the hospital.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
And so for one of my birthdays, Rob

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
gave me a cassette tape

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
unlabeled that was

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
a year

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
of all of my shitty

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
comedy messages to him.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Which you can't do these days. It's a little blue.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
A little blue. There's a blue material in there.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
The funny thing is that our technology

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
now allows for so much more,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
but it's not as, I don't know, it was

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
analog, so it was actually, it was more

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
logical to do it. It was like one of those

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
two hour tapes, you know,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
and, you know,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
kids and

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
tapes. What are you, a little Scotch?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
But

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
each message was, you know,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
probably, hey man,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
give me a call back.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Listen, I'm over here. I got

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
one foot, sure could use two.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
You know, just dumb fucking

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
garbage.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Another lot of racist shit.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Lot of racist shit. Because it was 93.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Well, because we knew at that time

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
that African Americans would never get

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
answering machines.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It was safe, you know.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
There was some amazing stuff in there too.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
It expressed your fears.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
But

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
there was a lot of raps.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Yeah, a lot of raps.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
There was a lot of music in there.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
But it was like, it took forever.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
And I knew like your birthday was coming up,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
and I had like another like five minutes to go.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
So I would just like,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I gotta know, like call you up

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
with the answering machine or whatever.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Like on or whatever.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And there was like the last couple of phones

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
like, what the fuck are you doing?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
What are you doing?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I'm, fuck.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
This is so fucking stupid.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Why are you doing this?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Fuck you.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Seriously?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Again? Fuck off.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
We had to fill the tape.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Oh, gosh.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
And let's, do you want to, let's

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I brought it here tonight.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
No, no, no, no, no.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
That's not the tape.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
No, I wish, I wish

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
the tape doesn't exist.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
That would have been cool, but

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
you listen to it probably

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Well, I probably listen to it 15 times

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
which is, which is

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
unfortunately I was in a relationship at the time

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
and my girlfriend, not a fan

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
of the tape.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
If you're dating, if you're dating somebody

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
who secretly hates you

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
you sitting there going

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
listen to how funny I am

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
something's gonna start

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
boiling

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
It's so funny to me looking back

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
how she must have like

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
You want to hear what happened?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Who wants to hear what happened?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Picture making

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
something for your best friend

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
that took a year

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
something really personal

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
something that was actually incredibly entertaining

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
something that

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
So like a bigger than like an iPad waterproof case

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
There you go.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
So like a real

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
diamond ring

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
A big deal, a big deal

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Throw out any carrot you wish

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
It was something

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
really, something that would be

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
like you would frame that

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
like now

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
and then people would go, well, did you want to listen to it?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Well, okay, I have to buy

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
like a thing on eBay to play it

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
but here's this thing

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
you had it

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
maybe a week and then one day

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
because I would

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
before I gave it to you, I would listen to it

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
I went, so I went to

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I thought it was that funny

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I went to my girlfriend's place

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
and I wanted to listen to it for a 16th time

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Why don't we

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
stay in and listen

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
to my drunk friend Rob

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
leave a message on my old machine

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I just want to lay in bed

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
with you and listen, it's exactly

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I mean, my heart goes out to this poor woman

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
We can use the good speakers

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
We use the good speakers

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
any regular

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
normal non-psychopath

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
person would go, would roll their eyes

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
and go, ugh, god

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
You know what, that's not as entertaining to me as it is to you

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
It sounds, yeah

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Boy, you got to get over yourself

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
You would at least give it like a couple of months

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
maybe a year

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
You wouldn't go, well, that's pretty impressive

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
that your friend did put that much

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
work into it

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
But this is what happened

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I couldn't find it

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I wanted to listen to it again

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
And

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I said, sweet story

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Where is it?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
She said, well, you left it

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
on the window sill

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
and it rained

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
and the rain

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
damaged it so much that

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I thought it was best to just throw it away

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Right, right

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Wow

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Because you know when

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
you have like a tape

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
that gets wet

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
it just disintegrates

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
We've all had those tapes

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
that disintegrate when water

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I mean, let it dry out

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
We've all been in those house cleaning

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
jacks where you just, you can't like

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
where else would I put this besides the garbage

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I didn't have to get a towel

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Why would I hold on to this

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
as proof of what I'm saying

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Did you

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
grill or did you go, so the whole

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
tape was bad or just like

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
part of it that got wet

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Did you listen to the whole thing?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I think I smelled a rat and I said

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
so

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
you thought

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
it would be best to

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
throw it in the garbage

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
so that I never had to see it wet

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Throw it in the garbage

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
and then take it out of the

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
apartment as quickly as possible

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
and throw it into the

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
garbage truck as it's driving away

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
And it's not the best technology

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Give it a couple of days. This thing will get

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
all warbled up and, you know, tangled

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
and those things fell apart like

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
everything is underwater

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I think in that moment I realized

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I was like, oh shit, I've been listening to that thing

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
a lot and she's been silently

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
she's been hating

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Don't make her a hero

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
It took me a fucking year to make that thing

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
You were getting mad at me at the end

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I have the perfect punishment

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
for her. She is currently Dan Harmon's

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
ex-girlfriend

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I can't think of a worse fate

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
And head of the International

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Monetary Fund

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
That's a big deal

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah, but honestly

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Dan Harmon's ex

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
And she invented the CD

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
That was really the thing

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Because she actually felt so bad

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
about it. Oh my god

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Oh my god, there must be a way

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I have to go to her

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Device that can handle a

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
storm. Right.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I got it

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
She's just working so hard on it

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
and her new mentor love interest

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
played by Pierce Brosnan is like

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Hey, take it easy

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
And she's like, I'm sorry, I just

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
I loved a man once

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
and I

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
His tape got rained on

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I understand

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
That was a little

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
My girlfriend was killed by a volcano

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Did you see that fucking movie

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
His girlfriend, really

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
She got murdered by a volcano

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
JFK style

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
He got into a car with her

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
What movie was this?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Dante's Peak

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
He gets into a car with her

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
And it's like, come on, cut

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And looks over at her and goes

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
We're gonna be okay

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
That volcano can't get us now

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Pierce Brosnan

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
A volcano rock

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Flies through the

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Because the volcano, it's personal

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
And it dissolves to

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Pierce Brosnan doing crunches

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
On the floor of his apartment

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Where he's been living

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
In fucking hatred of volcanoes

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
For sexual reasons

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
For the last 20 years

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
And the only thing that's gonna break him out of it

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Is Linda Hamilton as a civil servant

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Because she loves

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
He's fucking running a city so much

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And it reminds me of how much she loved volcanoes

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
He actually

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Says at one point, he says to Linda Hamilton

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
He goes, I love the woman once

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
She loved volcanoes

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
He says

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
She loved volcanoes

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Didn't they say that in Twister too?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I'm sure they did, yes

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
My parents love Twister so much

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Well, in Twister they have to

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
They create a, they go, it's a category of Trinado

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
So that you can identify

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
That's the F5

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
That's the Trinado that killed my father

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
That's the combination of heat

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And cold

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
It was twisty just like that

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And there was stuff in it

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
That's the finger of God?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Isn't that what it...

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I would know it if it wasn't the one that got my dad

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
It would still be twisty

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
The layman would make that mistake

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
That's what these hicks do

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
They sit on their porch with a shotgun

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Twister, you killed me, Pappy

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I'm a scientist

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I know the one that got my dad

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
It had a little fin on the top

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
It had a pointed nose

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Sharknado, I don't like this

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
New generation of purposefully ironic

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Horror things, I sharked to push it

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
No good

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
A kiss doesn't get the joke

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
Kiss doesn't get the joke

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Dan pointed at me, so I repeated it

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
When Schrab and I first moved to LA

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
We had a meeting

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I swear it was Stuart Kornfeld that told us that story

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Yeah, that was Jack Black that told us the story

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Oh, really?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Because we were talking about heat vision and Jack

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
And how it needs to be played serious

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Otherwise it's not funny

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Jack Black told us the story

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Going like, oh, I know what you mean

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
There's this parable, this anecdote

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
About some graphic designer

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
That was hired to design a poster

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
For a kiss reunion

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
And they made some poster that was sort of like

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I don't know, I can't picture this

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
In my head, because I'm not

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
He's got Gene Simmons, but he's like winking

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
And big elbows

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
You know what I'm talking about?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I'm trying to picture the difference between a sincere kiss poster

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
And an ironic one, and I can't picture it

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
But the important part of the story

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Is that Gene Simmons did

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
He looked at the poster

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
And handed it back to the person

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
And said, look babe, kiss doesn't get the joke

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
You've got me

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Wearing the star on my eye

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I don't get it, man

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Kiss doesn't get the joke

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Kiss has to think that they're demons

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
That have powers and stuff

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I did, I thought they were scary

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Hey man, kiss isn't in on the joke

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
And that's what that ended up being

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
That concert

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Kiss isn't in on the joke

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And that's what kiss stands for

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Kiss isn't so smart

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
I want a rock and roll

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
All night

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
But I never want to be

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Involved in the joke about it

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I know I'm going off meter

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
But it's important that caveat

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
And party every day

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Rock and roll all night

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
What are you guys laughing at

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
What's so funny

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Who's laughing over here

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Get this man out of here

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I got two guys laughing at the back

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I don't know if that beach ball is a bit

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Anyway, party all day

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Okay, they're having fun

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Having fun with the beach ball

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
It's cool, if it's about how much fun is my weight

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
It's the way of life

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
It's the way of life

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
You're an army, you're the kiss army

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Armies don't have beach balls

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Let's go invade Ario Speedwagon

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Ario Speedwagon gets the joke

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
That was their big claim to fit

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Ario Speedwagon gets the joke

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
That's what Ario stands for

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Yeah, we get the joke

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
In Latin

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
But at the end, when they were like 45

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
They'd come out in a big Speedwagon

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
It was a big fucking joke

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
It was so stupid

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
They'd have pacifiers in their butts

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Ario Speedwagon

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Ario Stationwagon

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I think they started calling themselves

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
They'd come out in a grand safari

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
The Speedwagon had a beanie on board

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Really a missed opportunity

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
All right

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
So it seems like the

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Schrab.ells run dry enough

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
We have not talked about the

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
The thing, tell us about Skud

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Tell us what it's

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
There's a lovely story by your wife

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Who I just asked, are you still married?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
But in fairness

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
That was just based on what you were wearing

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I swear to God

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
We've known Schrab.for all nine years

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
He's dated Kate and now he's just recently married her

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
We're all astounded every day

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
That she doesn't dump him

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Me too

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
She's a fucking trooper

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
She's crazy

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
She's Amish, right?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I think that might be what it is

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Because of his technology, she thinks he's bionic

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
She doesn't know

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
She's on an extended rom spring

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
She wrote a beautiful forward

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
You guys are real funny

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Real funny

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
This is my life

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
He just lights cigarettes

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
In front of her and she's like, wow

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
He's amazing

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
He's not that bright

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
He's verbally abusive

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
But he can make fire with his hand

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
And for that reason

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I will stay with him

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
He has a box with moving images on it

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
All right

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
The floor is like crap

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
He started out so good

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
About this present that I took a year

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
To make

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Now you're fucking with me

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I'll read from the

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Forward

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
When I first saw Rob

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Schrab.make fire

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I knew that even though

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
He could not make a hinge

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
He had special powers

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
So romantic

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
It's like those twilight stories

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I guess, I assume

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Do you do this to Kamel when he comes out here?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
No I don't, let's bring out Kamel

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Man of the hour

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Hello

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I'm not the man of the hour, Schrab.s the man of the hour

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
What are you talking about?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
It's your 20th anniversary

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Doing

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Being 20 years older

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Than you were 20 years ago

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I heard about that

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
You know what, good job

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
In a way I am

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I was just thinking that earlier today

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Are you a Skutt fan, Kamel?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I haven't actually read

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Oh Christ

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
It's a picture book

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Can I take that again?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Can I take that again?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Can I give you another take?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Are you a Skutt fan, Kamel?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Not really, fuck

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
One more time

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
This is the worst

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
I'm a huge fan of Rob's

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Before I met you

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I watched

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I can't remember the name of it

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
But that Channel 101 thing you did

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Which was the

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
The answering machine thing

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
You liked that quite a bit

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Yeah, I would listen to it with all my ex-girlfriends

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Twiggy's Holiday

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Yeah, it blew me away

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I was visiting LA

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Is it online?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Twiggy's Holiday

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Twiggy's Holiday

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Is it Twiggy's Holiday?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I love Twiggy's Holiday

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I love Skort

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I love everything you've done

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Skort

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
All the stuff

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I just want to say

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
A couple of weeks ago

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Hey, it's the 20th anniversary of mine

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
If I hand out some Skutt books at your show

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Fuck it, man, I'll put you on stage

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
I mean, is that what you...

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Is this a trap?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
You gotta make fun of me

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
No

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Your audience that loves you

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
What if it was Dan saying

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
The whole point was like, okay, we never got it published

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
We just made those two

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I've been sending you checks

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
This also

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I wasn't dating anyone

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
when you gave me that tape

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I didn't think it was a very good answering machine

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
compilation

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I found the edits were

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
sloppy. Hold on, let me finish

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
But I really like, like, are you gonna color

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
the book at some point?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Cause I know this spawn

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
was always so colorful

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah, that's good. Spawn's the best

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
It's just like spawn

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I fucking love spawn, bro

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
But if you do them in color

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
you don't get to also sell them in the coloring

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
book section

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
So it gives you twice the...

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Are you gonna do anything about this?

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Are you gonna do anything about it?

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
You're starting this shit

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Is there a pop-up version of the book?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Is there a pop-up version of it?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
And Neil's taping all of this too

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
for you to jerk off later on

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Fucking love it

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Fucking love

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
I'm ruining him

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I gotta shoot tomorrow

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I'm gonna be groggy

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
What are you shooting tomorrow?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I'm shooting Mindy Project tomorrow

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Nice

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Kinda like Skud

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Are you like shadowing somebody?

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Get the fuck out of here

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Get the fuck out of here!

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
You didn't even talk to me about this

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
What's your early? There's no format to the show

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I didn't know they had an internship program

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Well definitely don't tell them

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
about the comic book

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
You just, you know, follow the guy

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I mean you make it funny

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Your reactions make it funny

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
My reactions on the podcast

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
make it funny

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
My facial expression

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I'm laughing right now

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Well, okay, so for people who are listening

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
on the podcast, he's crying

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
And that's funny

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
That's why it's so funny

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Because liquids usually supposed to come out of a faucet

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
He's a fucking cocksucker

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Liquids come out of a faucet

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
When they come out of people's eyes

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
it's so funny to me

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
You don't even recognize expressions

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Look, Water is leaking

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
from their eyes

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
They're called tears

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
as a symbol of their species weakness

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
That's what they think

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Make the merciless

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Make the merciless at that

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Is that a movie you want?

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
No, in all seriousness

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Here we go

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
In all seriousness, yeah

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It's gonna start getting gay

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
In all seriousness, congratulations

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
on getting the Mindy project

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
That makes it worse, doesn't it?

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Doesn't that make it worse?

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Yeah, no

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
That makes it much worse

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Well, this is like your fourth time directing

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I know, he's so proficient

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
I've seen him direct up close and personal

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
He's bonafide

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Did you say he's so proficient?

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Did I?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
We watched it with you, the one episode

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
and it was fucking fantastic

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
You're...

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
It is worse when we're sincere

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
We should go back

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
No, it looked like Mindy the whole time

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Everything was in focus

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Their lips and the words

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
that were coming out of their lips

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
were like, synced up

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Remember when I sat in there

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
before you came out

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Remember I said, hey, do me a favor

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I'm worried that no one's gonna give a shit

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
about my comic books

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
You know, it's been a long time

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Throw me a couple of bones here and there

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Okay!

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I smell blood in the water, bro

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Yeah, alright

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Seriously

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Every time you say seriously

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I will say this, seriously, folks

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
When I met you, I was very

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
intimidated because of Trigger's holiday

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
because you guys should go watch this

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
and the Death Cap for Cutie video

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
is like one of the best things I've ever seen

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Thank you

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Go watch it, it's called Crooked Teeth

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
What's it called? Crooked Teeth?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Crooked Teeth, this video

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
It's unbelievable

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Yeah

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Come on, let's get back to

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
making them cry

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
How do you know when you're a good TV director?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
You just leave the set and it's not on fire?

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
It's an artless craft

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
As far as I'm concerned

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I just don't have time to do it

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I think it's that there's no story happening

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
during the commercial break

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
That's how you've done a good job

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
It's television

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
It's the opiate of the masses

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
It's like just marshmallow fluff

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
You did a very good job

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
this season

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Why is this so fun?

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Because he's a great straight man

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
He knows what he's doing

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
He's a fucking Abbott

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Abbott got paid more than Costello

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
because it takes more talent

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
to sit and fume

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
It's funnier

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Don't butter it up, man

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Don't butter it

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
No, no, no, you're really greedy

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Let me shit on you

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
He's a great kid

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
He loves everything I do anyway

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Come on out here

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
These people do not love everything I do anyway

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
At any particular time

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
One of them will lunge out of the audience

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Come up on stage and tell me

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Why aren't you up here doing something

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
No, no, no

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Seriously, you're always interrupting shit

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
at the wrong time

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Interrupt him making fun of me

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I notice you're super quiet now

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
It's your turn in the barrels, Rob

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
It's a very challenging thing

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
You don't want to say it

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
You write an episode of a sitcom

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
and you don't realize how anyone can do it

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
It is pretty easy

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Dude, I just got a text to direct

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
an episode of the Mindy Project

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I hope, you know

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I'm gonna

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
You're gonna stop, right?

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I'm gonna pass on it

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I like that Ike Barron holds

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
He's funny

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Just Mindy, no, you're gonna

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
He's like Donald Glover funny

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I like him a lot

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
That's great too, I just met him two days ago

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
He's really good on that show

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
On that and newsroom

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
And Mindy's great too

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I'm not suffering the illusion

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
she's sitting here listening in her bathtub

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Oh, you didn't mention me

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Come on, come on, say my name

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Come on, come on

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
When will my name be mentioned?

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
But no, well

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
she runs the show

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
and she had the wisdom to walk into a writer's room

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
with Ike Barron holds

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
and then immediately grab him

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
and yank him and throw him onto camera

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
because I really

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I feel like I've seen him in things before

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Oh, I'm not sure he was on things

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
but he acts and writes and stuff like that

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
This is by far his big thing

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
I think he's so good

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Yeah, he's on Eastbound

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
He's great on that, yeah

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
He's like Glover where you're just like, fuck you

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
This is turning more into just a conversation

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
and less into an interesting conversation

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I just want to

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
as the Comptroller

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I feel like we should now talk about

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
transhumanism or get into a whole new world

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
No, no, no, let's talk about gender

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I feel like we didn't gender

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
We haven't really figured that one out

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
We haven't rules about gender

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
We haven't covered what's wrong with the woman's body

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
By the way

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Yeah, what parts of that sag

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Oh, there's three glaring mistakes

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
No, I'm not going to go there

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
What are they?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
No, no, no, no

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
I think one of the biggest problems

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
with the design of the balls is that

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
they are the perfect kicking height too

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
like

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
low enough that everyone can get to it

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
but high enough that you get good momentum going

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
It's a really terrible design

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
If they were on the foot

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
you wouldn't get hurt as much

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Why are there two of them also?

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Just give me one terrible thing on my body

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Or don't put them next to each other

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Yeah, two

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Separate them

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Do you just have one big grapefruit one?

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Who do you have?

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Well, there's one scrotum

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
holding two little things in there, yeah

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I've never looked that close

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
It's all about that bilateral symmetry

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
It's such a strange, but I guess

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
effective thing

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Like everything got

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Oh, so do I have redundancies?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
One eye goes, the other eye goes fine

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Should I move?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Here? No, no, no

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
You're doing this a lot

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
No, I'm just trying to make eye contact with everybody

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
That's not you

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
on stage, so

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
What's on your shirt?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
What is this? Is this a detergent?

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
That's coming out

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
But you know we started

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
biologically obviously as like these

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
unicellular organisms

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Well, the face itself

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
comes around from the back, it's true

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
The way it embryologically comes together

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
it like goes around the back

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
So this is just the seam

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
The nose is basically the seam

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
the part that you would sort of clip off

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
And your mouth is

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Beautiful

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Oh yeah, the mouth goes

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
exactly to your asshole

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Because you're a worm, we're all worms

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
or donuts

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
The first multicellular organisms

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
they're just trying to

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
optimize

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
the surface area to

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Digestance

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
And everything you eat

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
you're rubbing up against with the outside of your body

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
It's just that advanced organisms

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
we have a part of the outside of our body

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
we're like

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
these balloon animals

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Part of the outside of our body

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
is inside our body

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
So when you eat a donut

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
it's moving, it's rubbing up against

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
the outside of your body

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Donuts eating donuts, huh?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
You're not going anywhere, Rob

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
No, do you know

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
why we stand direct?

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Because

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
of capitalism

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Because we really love the show

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Because

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
it's less surface area

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
for the sun to hit

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
So we could be out at noon

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
when all the other animals were inside

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I mean, that's one crazy theory

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I mean, the most

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
amazing thing about us walking

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
erect is that it's probably the most dramatic

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
change

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
in evolutionary, well, certainly in

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
our evolutionary history

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
the amount of time

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
the amount of time it

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
took the human species to go from

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
to start walking

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
erect, that amount of pelvic shift

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
in the

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
amount of time that it happened

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
is so dramatic

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Well, Camille, would you mind

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
kind of showing us? Take us through the

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
stages?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Why me?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Just seem really talented physically

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Alright

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
It's not to humiliate you in any way

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Just go ahead and get down on your knees there, buddy

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I would

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
take us through the evolution of those

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
You could just say you're doing it

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Stop it, if you're embarrassed

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
I feel much better if Schrab was doing it

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
No, no, no, no

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
By the way, I heard

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and what I do is

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
when I hear a great theory

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
about evolution, I don't look it up

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
because I want it to be magical

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
is that our brains got too smart

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
so

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
that's why we all have back problems

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
You're disproving your theory

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
as you make your theory

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Our brains got too smart

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Like, okay, well, it's not that

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Wait, am I the new Schrab?

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Let's bring out Rob Schrab, everybody

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Status change

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Status change

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Do we have to call it Schrab?

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
That's great, Rob, yay!

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
You got Schrab

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Our brains got too smart

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
too quickly

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
and so that's why we have back problems

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
is that it would have made more sense

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
for the back to be completely straight

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
but we figured out ways to sort of go around that

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
No, no, no, no, we disagree about this

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
So is all of anthropological society

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
That's the beautiful thing about it

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
You can't get a straight answer about this

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
There is no straight answer

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
But here's an answer that's kind of interesting

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
about how we were around

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Homosapiens

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
We were around

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
That word cracks me up

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Homosapiens were around at the same time

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
as Neanderthals

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
and Neanderthals they discovered were actually

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
more intelligent, like by brain mass

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
versus body weight, which is really how you do it

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
They had religion first

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
They dug up the Neanderthals

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Interestingly, they did not have creativity

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
That's where we were the ones making cave paintings

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
and then language and the written word

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
and then scud the disposable assassin

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
turn 20

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
And it was that

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
that gene for creativity that allowed us

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
to like wipe out the Neanderthals basically

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
because we could pass along what we learned

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
But I think it's an incredibly

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
important thing to also

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
like Neanderthals

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
they

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
they couldn't find

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
any Cro-Magnon burial sites

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
that had any

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
burial sites, period

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Neanderthals, there were burial sites

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
everywhere and with all of them

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
like items

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
which indicates like

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
some kind of connection to

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
the concept of death

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
of death

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
which is so interesting when you think about like

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Cro-Magnons were creating like these

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
we hunted them to extinction, I say we

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
like hey, we

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
we're the Packers

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
That's exactly

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
that's such a great, we hunted Neanderthals

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
to extinction because we basically

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
created like ranged weapons

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
like we

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
started throwing shit at things

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Maybe Scott gave it to them and they were so enthralled

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
in how good it was

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
that then we murdered them

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
But it's interesting the idea that yes

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
also there is no Neanderthal as far as

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
we know it, there's no Neanderthal cave

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
paintings that Cro-Magnons were

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
starting to like so

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
this is what really disturbs me

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
the idea that it's possible to be creative

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
but have no emotional

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
attachment to people who die

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
which is like a sociopathic

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
we know a lot of artists like this

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
the Cro-Magnons were very creative and a lot of their sitcoms were very funny

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
but they didn't

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
they wanted to reach a lot of people

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
but they didn't give a fuck if you die

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
it was all multi-cam shit though

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
it was all

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
multi-cam shit

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
it was like motion capture

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
it was all multi-cave

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
multi-cave

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
dumb

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I'm doing a single cave

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
you go into one chamber and you build one fire

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
but it's like more personal

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
it's like you look here and you look there

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
it's up to you

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
I know the audience

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Cro-Magnon have multi-cave

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I understand everyone go in

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
everyone laugh

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I hear when funny

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
even when not funny

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
and we all

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
whitey still has

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
a lot of Neanderthal genes in us

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
that's the other thing

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
which Africans don't have

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
we have a little moment here

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
about all the great things you people have

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
we have everything

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
everything including drones

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
so everybody shut the fuck up

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
do you have keyless entry

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
we have keyless entry

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
do you have waterproof iPads

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
by the way I can't think of a greater present

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
than that

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
that is amazing

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
somebody put it on twitter

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
she's just doing it to keep me clean

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
she's luring me into the tub

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
like a dog

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
it's like a dog thinking

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
hey there's always a treat

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
in the back of that cage

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
on the way to the place where they give me the shots

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
exactly

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
the trail of donuts and then a waterproof iPad

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
but

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
so crow magnans fucked

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Neanderthals we didn't just hunt them to extinction

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
we fucked right

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
well I don't think crow magnans and homo sapiens

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
were together at the same time

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
what's the difference between homo sapiens

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
and crow magnans

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
we're all missing very important pieces of information

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
like phd

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
the homo sapiens

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
the homo sapiens just make shit up

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
this is what we have creativity

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
homo sapiens have podcasts

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
and fucking overzealous

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
I feel like

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
what makes sense is that they were fucking

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
that's probably it

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
which one of them

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
had brown toe burgers

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
which one of them had cars that would tip over

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
if the ribs were too big

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
that would have been interesting

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
to go back and do a Flintstones

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
with what we know now about those people

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
and just you know

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
the rape

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
all animals have rape by the way

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
there's a caveman

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
you put a comma on that

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
and then ended the sentence

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
just what we know about the rape

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
by the way what's great about

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Flintstones

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I don't think it was like a lot of consenting caveman sex

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
what's great about Flintstones

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
is that it was animated but it still had a laugh track

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
so there's somebody drawing it and like

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
wait wait wait this is what it is

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
and then people laugh

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
really slow

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I'm sure the audience was animated too

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
so think about MASH

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
during its 11 year run

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
MASH was a single camera comedy

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
based on a Robert Altman film

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
with a theme song

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
called Suicide is Painless

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
which they kept

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
well we don't want to lose that

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Suicide is Painless

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
a single camera comedy about a war

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
about doctors patching people together

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
literally having blood spraying on their face

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
it was always

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
single camera but sometimes it had a

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
laugh track and sometimes it didn't

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
it didn't in the operating room

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
that was the distinction they made

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
when you're operating on it

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
I mean that's not a joke

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
they're still doing bits

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
but there's blood spraying

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
you know that I just saw 12 years of slave

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
over at Fox as a comedy

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Kevin Hart

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Kevin Hart

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I don't know how

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
but that's the most horrible thing I've ever heard

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
it's going to be funny

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
we're not going to

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
we're going to keep some of this stuff and keep slave

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
but it's going to be fun

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
it can only run 12 seasons though

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
it's limited

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
it can only run 12 seasons

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I heard

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
you worked a lot of home alone elements into it

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
he's trying to stop

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
being a slave and there's like

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
there's bumbling slave owners

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
where these two white slave owners

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
they bonk heads

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
and he uses a MacGyver like

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
kind of intuition to

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
that's the whole joke of the thing

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
he's so much smarter than them and they're always

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
following the trap but he's always

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
he's still you know slave

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
12 years slave and then we're going to do two years

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
as a real estate executive

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
just for international

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
yeah just because we lost some of the

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
cast and we wanted to hit that 14 year mark

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
so it'll be like

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
two years

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
two years are real estate executive

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
that's our aftermash

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I don't know if Kevin Hart can pull off

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
real estate executive

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
when they did aftermash

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
none of these kids know what we're talking about

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
they're probably dimly aware of it

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
they know there was a show called MASH

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
it was based on the Korean word

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
who knows about MASH

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
okay okay okay

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
show MASH lasted 11 years

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
okay now who's seen it

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
same people

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
so there was a multi-camera

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
show that they aired for

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
six episodes called aftermash

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
about like three of the MASH

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
characters moving into an apartment together

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
the best ones the ones you want

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
well okay

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
no

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
not radar no sorry

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
okay Klinger, Father Mokehi and Colonel Potter

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
and they moved

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Colonel Potter only had to do two out of every six

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
but

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I wikipedia

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
recently it was like did aftermash really

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
happen and I kind of wikipedia

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
and they talked about the fact that

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
they were promoting it

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
because they were up against the 18

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
so they had these promotions where

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Klinger was

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
shaving a mohawk

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
off of

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
a guy who had his back turned to camera

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
and they were like I'll take your mohawk

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
we're gonna fuck you up AT

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
was Klinger a barber

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
and the

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
aftermash

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
there was the presumption that he was always removing a lot of hair from his body

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
right

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
because he was Lebanese

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
what were the characters that they introduced

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I mean there wasn't three people

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
and was it not in the Korean War

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
where are they now

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
it takes place in the aftermash

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
of the Korean War

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
it takes place in America

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
like they went back home

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
well that's the weird thing because of course as we know

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
the Korean War lasted what

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
two years

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
and the series lasted

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
eleven years

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
which is why Sony is always

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
so frustrated with me

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
look this isn't rocket science

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
it's okay that he said he needed a four year degree

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
just fucking make a tv show

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
until we're all dead

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I wanted to make a sitcom

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
it'll be too late for a refund

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
we've established they're not very polite

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
you'll have their money

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
you know I did Golden Palace

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
so I have to recuse myself from this conversation

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
what's Golden Palace

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
it does sound like a Chinese restaurant

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
but it was the spinoff of the Golden Girls

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
with three of the Golden Girls

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Don Cheedle

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
what the fuck are you talking about

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
what are you seriously talking about

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I worked on the Golden Girls as a young man

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
and then they did

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
and then my

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I was the young man

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
not so funny Mitch

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
get a cheese

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
come on guys don't treat me like I'm a fucking

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Schrab over here

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Mitch what was your rank on Golden Girls

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
so well here's the

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Golden Girls was low level I think got up to producer

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
which sounds high level

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I know it sounds like it

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
but then

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
you were overlord on the rest of development

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
underlord

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Jack Lord

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
no so there's a

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I know

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
this is the rehearsal right

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
when do we do the actual

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
so anyway they have the Golden Girls

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
three of the Golden Girls

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
B. Leaves

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
the Donald Lover of the Golden Girls

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
and I was suggesting

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
they bring in like Tony Randall

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
or something like that

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
but they said no we have a better idea

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
and the idea was the Golden Girls are broke

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
right they have no money so

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
they buy a 30 million dollar hotel

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
they're silver girls

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
they buy a 30 million dollar hotel

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
in Miami and then they have to

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
you know they have to clean the rooms themselves

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
and that kind of thing because they just spent that 30 million

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
but it was the

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
three remaining Golden Girls

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
so it was like faulty towers meets Golden Girls

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
right with Don Cheadle

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Meshack Taylor

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
yes in a funny way right

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and Cheech Marin

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
no

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I like that

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
this actually sounds great so far

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
that's it we did a whole season of that

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Don Cheadle

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
in that super real Don Cheadle way saying

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
okay now hold on girls wait a second

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Rose

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
you really like this guy

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
tell him

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
it doesn't matter if he's older than you

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
that sounds ahead of its time

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
because I immediately thought of Meshack Taylor

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
who but then realized

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
oh no that's not Golden Girls

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
that's Designing Women which is so many years later

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
and still the black guy in your sitcom

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
had to be in that case

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I think he was playing a gay guy

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
but he was certainly like he was very

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
in Golden Palace

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
no no no Designing Women

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
like

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
it's been a long time coming

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
for black people on sitcoms

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
it's either like you're doing black sitcoms

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and it's like hey it's Uncle Martin's place

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
or

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
it's like you're a white sitcom

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
we have not learned how to do sitcoms together

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
well in fairness

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
it's because

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
white people kind of have no right

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
to make black people funny

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
you know it really almost comes down

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
you can make them dumb

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
you can make them smart

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
anything is kind of offensive right

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
when it comes from

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
that red fox

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
during Sanford and Sun who wanted to get rid of all

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
the white writers

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
and so he had a whole African American writing team

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
and then they had a table read

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
and at the end of it he yelled

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
bring me my juice

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
which is a great way to look at

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
it's like in my juice

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
it's a great way to split the difference between white and black

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
it's white

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
like you know like

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
there's a historic significance to that idea

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
are you Jewish?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
yeah I'm Jewish

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
which comes up

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
every time you know I take a bath

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I'm confronted with that

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
with this fucking giant

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
blackness monster room size

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
but there's a historic significance

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
to the idea that in the

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
old days entertainment

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
along with handling money

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
and garments and all this stuff

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
that became stereotypical

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
that was

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
beneath the upper class

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
we're not going to handle that

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
banking you know all that stuff

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
but the idea that entertainment

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
was considered one of that it's dirty

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
it's pornographic basically

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
before there was pornography

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
entertainment was pornographic

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
the idea of making movies

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
that's why there's such a heavy tradition

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
of like

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Jewish fellows

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
they

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
they go where they stick

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
their nose in a little

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
is that what you were going to say?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
they stick their nose into

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I'm pretty sure that's what he was going to say

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
don't make me the new fraud

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I'm pretty sure that's what he was going to say

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
he doesn't take that nose in our heads

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
historically they've gone

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
where we let them go

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I said we

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
the chromagons let them go

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
it was

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
considered like beneath

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
like proper people

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
only the heaps would do it

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
is that what you're about to say?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
unbelievable

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I'm pretty sure that's what he was saying

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
whoa whoa Rob were you about to use the N word?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
say it

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
that was Will Arnett

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Will Arnett did that to Jason that's Will's joke

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
he was in a meeting with Jason Bateman

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
in the middle of it he said

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
were you about to say the N word?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
and as Jason was saying

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
no he was like because that's not okay

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I'm not down with that

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
and everybody of course just looked at Jason

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
no

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
one of those bright trot

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Jason takes

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Jews, black people, TV we'll figure it out

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:51.000
let's bring out Spencer Crittenden

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
hey everybody

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
what do you think about Jews and black people in TV?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I'm for them

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
it's an incredibly condescending attitude

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
that you can't win

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
you're part of the problem you know that

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I'd like to think so

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
you have the beard

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
of a Talmudic scholar

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I was thinking that

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
around here there's a lot of Hasidic Jewish neighborhoods

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and I don't know

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I don't think they have long not-beard

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
hair but I always wonder

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
when I'm walking amongst them like

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
do they know it pisses me off

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
do they know that you're just not one of them

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
having a really lazy day

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
because they're wearing a community t-shirt

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
and no Indiana Jones hat

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
wait

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
wait what?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
that's what they wear

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
those like Indiana Jones hats

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
the big square ones?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
no not the square ones

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
they're like round...

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
all I can say is Indiana Jones hat

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
you can't picture that what the fuck

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
he's never seen an Indiana Jones movie

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
no it's like an adventurer's

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
they don't wear those

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
but it is a funny idea for an adventure movie

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
where you have to get the hat under the

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
oh it's vague

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
of course it's the

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
tomb with all the gold that he has to go with

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
instead of snakes it's just gold

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
why did it have to be gold?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I could say that because I'm anti-Semitic

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
that's right that's fair

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
it's just

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
who I am

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
yeah but you could definitely

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
if you put a black Indiana Jones hat

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
on a suit

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I kind of want to see that

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I figured that they didn't have long hair

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
you see the earlocks and stuff

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
but their head hair is not that long

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
that might be true for all we know

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
you can hide it in the hat

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
the beard might be reserved

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I feel about those guys the way

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
that a lot of gay people must feel about

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
like transvestites

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
like really we're in the same club

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I'm on your side in this

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
hey treat us

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
fairly and you know obviously the guy

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
with the hat too

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
he's with us

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
or the gay person

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
who's got to say and also that

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
60 year old man who's dressed like a stewardess

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
be nice to him

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
in Brooklyn

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
in Williamsburg which is a very Jewish neighborhood

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
before it became all hipster

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
there's like certain places where

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
it's like a certain time, certain days

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
of the week I don't know much about

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
but there's only certain things you can do in the house

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
and you can't do them outside

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
on the day of Gahach

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
the third day of Gahach

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
you're thinking of the Beastmaster movie

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
so they have ropes

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
from their house

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
basically extending the boundary of their house

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
so you go down and it's all like

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
ropes around so you can basically do everything

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I believe it, I don't know much about it

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
there's all kinds of amazing

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I know more about Neanderthal

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
our mutual friend Ryan Ridley

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
he went through

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
oh yeah he had the period, I blocked it out

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
during that phase I was really

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
fascinated to hear about all of the

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
he went to Israel for a long time

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
what crazy shit do you believe

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Sabbaths and shuls and

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
shabashivas and stuff were about

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
like

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
the idea that

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
the idea that you would have a day in the week

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
for your religion where the idea was

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
basically just put your fucking cell phone away

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
like don't tweet

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
don't

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
you can have your neighbors coming and turn on your oven, that's a thing

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
well yeah if they're not

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
other people

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
it's basically forcing your hand as a human being

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
it's saying are you human

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
it's such a cool

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I think

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
we've talked about this before but it's like

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
obviously Christianity took this route that was like

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
holy shit let's

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
take over the world

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
let's have a Ronald McDonald

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
and let's have a corporate headquarters

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
and let's franchise

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
and let's have pretty low requirements

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
for our franchise

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
we should pass around a plate

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
whatever you want we're not looking

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
just God is who will decide what happens to you

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
but whatever you want

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
and I think people who fetishize Judaism

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
ideologically like I do

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
what you're fetishizing is the idea of keeping

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
it in the community which has

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
obvious benefits like it's so amazing

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
the idea of a religion that actually

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
deals with your neighbor

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
which it should the idea that

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
you and the people that live near us do

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
you could say that or you could say it's just piggybacking on

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
our natural proclivity to do that

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
what do you mean? well we're very social creatures

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
right?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
that's why your religion should do that

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
but it kind of

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
it's like how a hypnotist holds the watch above

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
your eyes and then says you're getting sleepy

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
and you're actually just looking up

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and you're hearing you're getting sleepy and your eyes are

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
kind of getting tired right but don't you think

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
to a certain point a magician's act

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
like to a certain point if that magician

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
is an asshole he might

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
end up molesting a Hooters waitress

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
with that power

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
or

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I don't think you'd have to hypnotize them too

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
or if he's

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
a hypnotherapist he might use that power

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
to make a husband and wife

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
but that

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
has nothing to do

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
if you're saying that these

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I mean I know you're not saying this but the idea of religion

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I probably am if I know me the idea

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
of the religion saying to the magician

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
like and by the way don't finger

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
that little boy

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
is like you know again like I wasn't

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
going to but

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
it's nice to know that I get a reward for that

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
but wait are we talking

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
about the same thing? I don't think so

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I don't think you're talking

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
about the same thing

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I'm talking about Skud

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
but I'm supposed to be

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
an assassin now 20 years

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
as a guy raised

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
definitely like

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
semi-Christian totally not

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Jewish but learning

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
what I've heard about the covenant

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Judaism when you're growing up

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
like

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I fetishize it the way I fetishize

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
like English

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
comedy like I because I look

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
over that fence and what I see is

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
community I see

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
not the show which is awesome

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
you see it everywhere

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
it's so interesting I saw it on the side of a bus

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
it's not

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
it's not centrally franchised and I think

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
that's the key it's the

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
it's the Saturn dealer of

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
religions it's

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
it's very important to not

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
centralize we do it anyway

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
is kind of my point everybody

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
fucks up every religion somewhere

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
every house you walk into

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
every place but I'm saying like

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
like the

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
central is the thing that doesn't

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
make sense is how you know it's

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
real

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
the thing you know

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
you cannot prove this if you're gonna try to

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
prove this then you don't get it

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
yeah that's fake

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
that's good religion though

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
isn't that better than

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I demand everyone in this room realize

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
that your eyeball was built

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
by God no because if you demanded it

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
people would would rise up against it

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
so if you it's like that's

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
why I'm saying like the hypnotist if you give people what

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
they're kind of doing anyway

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
right and it's like hey you guys

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
are here so you must believe in Zinu

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
right it's like well

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
they're here like you know it's I

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
don't know it's just

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I don't know but

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
there's there's something good there's a

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
difference between going with the flow

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
and exploiting natural

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
impulses people have

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
a tribal impulse

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
absolutely that's why

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
the Flintstones had a laugh track

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
because and no one went like

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
what the fuck this is a curtsy

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
no I knew it was Jerry Hanna

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
saying to Scott Barbera

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
if somebody shows you an image

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
these animals have a social instinct

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
no you're absolutely right

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
if somebody says to you hey listen to

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
200 people with you yeah like

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
not 2 million not 4 million not

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
6 million but 200 people

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
in the room with you laughing at something

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
do you it comforts you

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
and you you can relate to it

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
we can remember 200 people's names and stuff

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
so you you you go to your

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
shul I am I'm barfing

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
up things that I learned from my Jewish friend

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
well he was through his mega Jewish

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
phase but I was like this is so much

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
cooler than yeah then Sunday

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
school this is what I miss about like

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Islam we would go to the mosque and it's

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
powerful whatever the ideas are but

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
there's like 200 people and we all believe

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
the same thing right that's what

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
that's what it's convincing you of

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I mean I would argue that what

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Spencer is about to take us through makes more sense

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
right yeah you know I was

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
just gonna say that religion

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
and devotion is a lot like

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
you know being you know fanaticism

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
it's all the same thing it's like

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
when people are really in to say

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
like a very well

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
high quality graphic

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
novel like about

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
maybe a robot that murders

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
people for a living

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
by the way it's Skud's 20th anniversary

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
yeah you know last night

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Rob gave me that book not

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
too long ago but uh for your birthday

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
yeah and I hung out with him helping him

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
helping him helping him with his

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
AMA on reddit and oh yeah

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
like a friend like a real friend might do

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
like like like somebody

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
like my oldest friend no probably

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
would I also pick you up from the airport

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
no I will

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
so

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I mean there's that

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
what was your proof

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
when your old friends like Steven Spielberg

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
doesn't pick George Lucas up from the airport

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
and he doesn't help him with his

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
AMA you get a Spencer

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
for that and then Spencer's awesome

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I didn't even ask you

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
when you said your oldest friend you shot me a look

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I don't want anything to do with this

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I'm just going to be Jewish about this

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
super cool

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
now go back to talking

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
somehow the religion thing was less

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
controversial than the AMA

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
I did not understand that religion

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
discussion I'm sorry

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I feel like we're not because neither of us

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
almost talked about my comic book

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
oh yeah we never got to

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
neither of us kind of formed our point

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
we might have been making the same one

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
we don't know I always feel like

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I clumsily stumble

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
around this button at Harmontown

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
about the value

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
of religion and I'm talking to some very smart

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
you know

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
quite possibly

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
spectrum oriented people

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
who

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
very very justifiably

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
and very heroically like are very

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
skeptical about

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
any kind of

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
religion

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
in their life

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I almost like

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I never want to break down

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
that wall because that would be evangelism

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
and I'm not

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I believe that when I die it's going to go black

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
and I probably have no idea

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
what's going to happen to that

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
but during my life

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
on this earth boy howdy

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
is there a whole bunch of shit that I can't

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
account for and don't understand

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
and I don't cotton

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
to

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
not exploring that stuff because

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I think there's a higher power

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
to believe in the very lazy

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
natural neck pillow of going

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
you know what for now that stuff's called

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
asshole in the sky

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
who is

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
like self admittedly

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
in all of holy

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
literature

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
a guy who

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
alternatingly comes home from work drunk

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
or sober and in either case

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
might want to beat your ass

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
or help you out but I think the key is you try

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
you kind of I mean I'm complicit

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
in this too that you almost try

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
not to think about it and it so happens

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
that it is becoming more

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
socially appropriate

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
to challenge it which is probably

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
the only reason I'm even doing that because

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
the market, Sam Harris and everybody else

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
so we're

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
sorry go ahead you know

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I was going to say that neck pillow

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
is shrinking as we sort of do

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
figure out all those things

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
that we don't need a God to be like

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
well God's angry that's why there's a hurricane

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
we know because the hot and the colder

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
however hard it can actually work

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I don't know

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
well to mutilate that metaphor

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
the pillow shrinks as our neck shrinks though

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
we as a species like

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
we but

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
by the time we've gotten

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
down to.0001 seconds

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
after the big bang not knowing what's happening

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
by the time we're debating about gluons

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
versus zoons and blueons we also

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
at the same time are developing

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
weapons that can destroy us

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
in the blink of an eye so we

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
with one hand

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
it's so hard to articulate I have to

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
be such a more sober intelligent

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
academic person

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
or more drunk right I mean it's true

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
access it I never

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I don't want any smart people to ever

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
ever ever drink any Kool-Aid

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
ever but I

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
want them to

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
allow themselves

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
the emotional and instinctive

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
joy that is

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
to connect

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
to the unknown

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I think you have to

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
be stupid

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
that's not a religious phenomenon

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
in fact I would argue

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I would argue that religion

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
that's not a religious phenomenon that

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
actually religion tries to quiet

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
that joyous acceptance

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
absolutely I will be the first

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
person if you want to burn down

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
a fucking establishment if you want

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
me to talk shit about

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
we could do there's a

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
temple on the corner of Highland

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I mean I would

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
do you guys want to do that

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
if you

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
if you want somebody to take a big

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
steaming dump on modern

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
American Christianity

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
as it is served up to us I'm

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
first in line with you I'll do

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
a better more self-destructive job than

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
anybody I just think the big crime

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
is that is the mishmash

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
of like of the

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
you know we're wearing these crosses around

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
our necks the crosses because there's this

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
dude who mythical

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
like Paul Bunyan or not the story

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
is about a guy that's a great

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
story and he was a brilliant guy

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
to the point where and who said

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
to people here's the thing

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
all they can do is bully you to the point

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
where you're you're afraid to die

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
if you stop being afraid to die

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
they don't have any power over you

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
he was he was like I mean

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
the equations between that and Martin Luther

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
King jr. are not unjustified

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
like it was a person who without

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
question that is a human connection

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
that's human to human and the question

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
is when ichthyostega first crawled out

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
of the sea if they could pray

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
would the cross have like two

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
you know horizontal bars

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
because their god was a giant

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
ichthyostega and this simple doesn't matter

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
so now you flash forward to these

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
megachurches where people are being told

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
hey you don't have to understand any

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
of this all you have to do is accept

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Christ as your savior and then

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
that's not religion

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
that I will be the first to agree

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
with Bill Maher

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I think it's very interesting that you said that

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
taking the fear of death away

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
which is what a lot of religion does

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
there's something else after it because

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
that's all our instincts as animals

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
are about fearing death

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
staying away from death and in a way

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
and about our anxiety about causing it

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
yes exactly and I think

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
that's why it's an opiate

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
what religion does is

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
remove you from that and Islam is always about

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
body and spirit are two very different things

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
spirit is good, body is bad

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
and I think that's when religion can get harmful

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
well body and spirit gets tricky

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
that's where it gets tricky it also gets tricky

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
because you don't just define yourself

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
of what you are but by what you aren't

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
in opposition so

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
a lot of the problems that we have with

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
the biggest problem of religion is

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Islam well we're right but also

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
that means that they're wrong so we should fix

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
that and that's where the problems come

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
in I think also religion is good because

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
you don't want everyone negotiating their own

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
morality you know like it's good

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I think everyone in this room would probably

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
agree that the big

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
problem point

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
comes when oh now

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
we agree now we now we believe in some

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
kind of afterlife

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
and then politicians on

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
earth here and now start selling

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
you stakes in that

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
even if it's just by telling you oh

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
it's cool that you're poor the poorer

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
you stay the richer you're

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
going to be later that's

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
complete horseshit I don't think that

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
it's this afterlife concept

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I think it's very harmful

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
incredibly because I don't

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I mean the idea of

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
the messages behind religion that I've read

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
have to do with how you should live your life

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
right now none of them say curl up in a

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
ball and hang out for 40 years

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
and then die by saber-tooth tiger

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
and then tap dance

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
in the heaven with gishmahgas

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
but they're not ever about being good for

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
being good sick it's all about

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
the reward or the punishment like

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Islam has to go to heaven

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
they say a lot of stuff but the people that play it up

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
for profit those are the people

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
that are that fuck things up

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
for the nice people but it's not even just

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
and ironically they won't go to hell

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
because there is

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
probably because that would be

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
a silly waste of spiritual resources

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I mean really honestly

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
would it just be loaded with bad animals

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
too or is it just people

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
where do the bunnies go

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
we had a very in Islam it's very

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
specific it's like a hellraiser kind of hell

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
like if you listen to music when I was

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
a little kid we were told that they would pour

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
molten lead in your ears in hell

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
and I remember listening to Michael Jackson's smooth

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
criminal and being like I'm in trouble

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
because this song is so good

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
there's gotta be a point though where you'd be like

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
oh molten lead I don't care because that's the other thing

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
about hell is that it's eternal

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
you're like eight that's all that matters

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
is not getting molten lead in your ears

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
the thing that scares me about the concept of

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
hell was one of the smartest guys I ever knew

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
my high school dungeon master

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Graham Cummings

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
he explained he said well

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
you know when you die

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
your last thought

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
the time it takes for you to think it

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
is relative

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
so for you

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
as a dying person

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
to other people you're already dead

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
your last thought

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
as you die we don't know how long

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
you think it relative to you

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I was like

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
oh so if you're walking across the street

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
and you're like this

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
donut's too salty bus hits you

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
500 million years

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
this donut's too salty

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
this donut's too salty

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
this donut's too salty

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
that would be okay

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
but worse would be this bus is gonna hit me

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
this bus is gonna hit you

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
or more importantly like

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
my girlfriend's bitch

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
any hatred that you're carrying

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
or my donut is just salty enough

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
yeah

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
that's heaven bro

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
well

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
anything forever but I think you're perfect

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
saltiness level

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I don't know anything about food

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
oh bacon's in this

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
that's your last one

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I always think as a person

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
sounds like a very wise

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
dungeon master

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I always

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
make it my goal to make sure that

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
that last thought will be like smooth as ice

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I've been

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
outed as enough things

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
and I've got it it's all out there

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
I'm not hanging on to anything

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
when you die however you die

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
so that your last thought can be as close to nothing

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
as possible

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
so that if it lasts 50,000 years

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
it's just like

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
it probably doesn't

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
you probably don't

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
let's play Dungeons & Dragons

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
yeah

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
you probably don't

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
you probably don't

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
you probably don't

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
oh shit oh fuck I died

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
this heroine is great

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
this heroine is great

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I don't think this is a heart attack

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
this is a panic attack

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Dr. Schroeder told me this is a panic attack

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Dr. Schroeder told me this is a panic attack

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Dr. Schroeder told me this is a panic attack

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
now it's the green wire

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
oh shit

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
it was probably the green wire

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
it's probably the green wire

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I can make fun of Islam's Muslims are laid back

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
that's a good one

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
oh that kid with the very

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
heavy vest just wants to hug me

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
yeah

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I love being a reservist

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
what a friendly lion

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
let me talk to these guys

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I'm also waving

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
but um

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
oh hello

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
oh yeah you guys should all feel free to wave

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
where did he go

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
we were just trying to find him

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
shit we'll play Dungeons & Dragons

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
what's under your mind young man

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
well I had a couple of thoughts

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
about the whole religion conversation

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I was hoping to chime in

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
I feel like we pretty much wrapped it up

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I thought we

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
let's talk about this for another five hours

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
we usually have a policy of

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
you know what

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
come on up here

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
we'll be pretty

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
hypocritical of us to

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
to say

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
you might as well take mic microphone

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
watch out he has a vest

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
well I've got to say

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I heard first that this was going to be a Schrab.episode

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
my first thought was damn it

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
and then you tore my part for half an hour

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
which was the best thing ever

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
the fact that you had

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
a pre-written opener

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
is worrying us

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
you told us you had thoughts about religion

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
like we want you to be sincere

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
yeah it doesn't include banter

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I apologize

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
well no it got me thinking because

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I'm an aspiring scholar of religion

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
as Spencer said I've got me thinking

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
because you're comparing

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Judaism

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
which the reason for the side locks

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
and for the rope attached to the house

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
it's about how far you can travel on the Sabbath

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
what constitutes travel on the Sabbath

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
that's the reason for the side locks

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
no the ropes that extend your house

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
yeah it's all things

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
those ropes are not that light

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
that sounds about it

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
but the thing is

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
because there are 613 mitzvah

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
rules that shalt and shalt not

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
in the Old Testament and those are the neck pillow

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
the way they experience

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
their connection with what is

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
beyond us

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and to them that structure there's actually a really good Jew

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
blog called Jew in the City

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Jew blog yeah Jew in the city

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
it's an Orthodox Jewish blog about this lady

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
and how she and how they use

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I find it doesn't update on Fridays

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
there's just a rope hooked up to a keyboard

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
there you go

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
just

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
just waving

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
no I'm just waving

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
and those structures are how they

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
are how they connect with God and then on the other end

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
you've got I'm behind

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
personally and we have a very very loose

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
very easygoing spirituality and what

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I'm bewasted by the way

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
very good

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
well what you said over there you said that

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I'm not

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I'm not you said that

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
more like buh-bye go ahead

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
tell me

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I was just going to say that what Mr. Hurwitz over there said that

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
what we're about to do with Spencer makes more sense than

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
you know religion X

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
a lot of friends of mine are hardcore rules lawyers

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
and that's how they enjoy the game

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
they enjoy having an answer or a do or do not

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
for any given situation right like a give and take with God

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Yes!

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
No that's right

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
man you really

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
launched a scud missile at his argument

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
a religion with a monotheistic

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
God which is what

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I hope I don't offend anyone by saying this

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
what

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
the Hebrews invented

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
what they brought into

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
popular usage which is

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
a relationship with one dude

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
who was coming home drunk

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
and mad

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
well I hope you do not piss off drunk daddy when he comes home

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
and then you go and you

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
debate the rules

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
and you finger your beard and go like

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
well when he said this did he really mean that

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
and it's part of the game and it's fun

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
it's a covenant

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
if you will with like

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
a game isn't a game if it doesn't have rules

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
exactly and then you've got people like

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Moses Maimonides who figured out the whole

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
what constitutes travel on the Sabbath

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
thing and so people figuring out how to experience

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
that on their own after the rules have already

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
been laid down which is essentially home brewing

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
like God somehow thought you know if they live on

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Detroit or maybe on you know

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
that street that's parallel to Fairfax

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
that's a duplex situation

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
so there's a height

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
issue

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
you can go down you can go down

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
you can stay up there

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
alright so can we engage

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
in the ancient Hebrew

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
tradition of ejecting you from the

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
stage

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I know

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
it wasn't a disagreement

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
we got kicked out of Eden

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
exactly it's just an emerging trend

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
and I won't break it

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
thank you sir what was your name

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Casey thank you Casey

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
thank you Casey

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
very nice to meet you

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
behind has some

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Islamic influence right

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
we're actually the christianity to

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Islam's Judaism

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
so you hate us

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
the christianity

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
to Islam's Judaism

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I like how messed up that is

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I have a t-shirt that says that

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
we are we think of ourselves as

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
the metal arc lemon to

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Penny Marshall's

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Joe Biden

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
when we get out of the 60's

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
the 70's look like the 90's

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
we're the after-match

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
to the ipads

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
whatever

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I think the Baha'i thing was I think that's what

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Ridley got into

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
is not

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
he got into Orthodox Judaism

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Baha'i is its own religion that sort of

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
takes influences from

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
we emerged in an Islamic context

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
stop

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
this is going to be a funny one

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I think you should

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I don't think we should yell out stop at people

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I understand

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
it's very new right

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I understand you want the show to be good

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I mean

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
you roll the dice

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
you live your life organically

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
you do a fucking show

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
you talk about what you talk about

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
you take the good with the bad

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
people wonder

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
these are the facts of life

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
you take the good

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
you take the bad

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
you take them both

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and then you have

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
you have some episodes

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
that are me and a blackout drunk

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
talking about gender neutrality

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
you have the power to go change the channel

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
then you're watching Big Bang Theory

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
and go watch that

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
this is free and it's two hours long

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
and you get what you get

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
it's not free

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
but it's very cheap

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I have pain a lot

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
this is ten dollars for you guys

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
fuck you

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
and several hours of standing on your feet

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
in a comic book store

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Spencer I'm sure you're not angry right now

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
about the amount of time you've been allotted

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
for your Dungeons & Dragons

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
just disappointed

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
no I don't know

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I don't care about

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I'm more upset on Trob's behalf

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
to be perfectly honest

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
why are you upset?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
because I get to come on every day

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
and be ignored so

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
like he only gets this opportunity

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I just wanted to say

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
I read a couple issues as a kid

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
but you know I got that book from him

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
and I read it last night

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
straight up until four in the morning

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
just reading the whole fucking thing

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
it's fucking great

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
thank you

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
and

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
a lot of things that have been discussed tonight

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
are themes that the whole

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
novel kind of at least

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
pokes fun at if not explores to some level

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
very true we definitely get heavily into

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Judaism

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
yeah definitely

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
we take it apart piece by piece

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
yeah

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
we take the pieces and we

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
fucking shit on them

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
hmm

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I don't know

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
so

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
if you love Judaism

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
or hate it

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
you'll love Skud the disposable assassin

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I feel like that's everyone in the world

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
aha marketing

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
but yeah that was all I had

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
it seemed a little kiss-assy of you

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
it's a really fucking good graphic

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
novel I know that

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
I've been his friend I've paid my dues

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
well you wouldn't think that from listening

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
to this podcast

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
you'd think it from listening to me for the last

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
20 years how much time have you put in

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
with this fucking guy not enough

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
he's difficult to deal with

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
not enough

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
nah I hear you

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
he will high road you

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
he'll low road you

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
oh I know

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
you don't know you don't know

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
yeah you're right

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
tell me about the complete collection

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
it's like you get by all the Skud in one

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
you just gave it to me

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I'm reading it right now

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
it's the whole book

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
it's called the whole shebang

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
it's called the whole shebang

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Skud and you can get it on Amazon

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
yes are we doing an ad

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
well I'm just saying people want to listen

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
oh yeah you can get it on Amazon

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
fuck it let's just do Dungeons & Dragons

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
whatever

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I mean sure

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I need to pass out the character sheets first

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
also what character

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
you guys saw how many texts this guy sends

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
to my girlfriend fiance

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
congratulating her

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
on turning me straight

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
this stuff I could throw him under the bus

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
we've been friends for 20 years

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I'm the bad guy

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
he likes to

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
he likes to he knows what he's doing

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
I'm not doing nothing

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
that's what he's doing

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
he acts like he's not doing anything

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
well that was funny to make fun of him

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I just read it

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
it's great it's mostly pictures

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
but I agree

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
no it looks great

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I'm like four pages into it

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
so Dan you wrote this with a guy named Monty and Rob

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
there was three guys

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
different issues or what

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
what's the relationship

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
it's a story by Dan Harmon

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
and Rob Schrab

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
is Monty Carter just like some kind of name

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
for the two of you combined

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
he's just a guy

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
he wrote some stuff

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
didn't pull his weight

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
yeah we wrote him

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I promise you he doesn't listen to anything

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
or watch community

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
he does not want to see you guys be successful

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Monty is you can say whatever you want

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
about Monty

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
he stopped he's

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
we purposely avoided anything with your name on it

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
for a long time

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
in fact somebody

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
was going to say Monty they were talking about you

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I don't want to hear it

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I'm happy for their success

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I don't want to hear it

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
help me fashion this noose

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
so it'll take some time

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
to catch them up on what's going on

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
with D&D right

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
yeah

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
yeah will

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I recall a very passive aggressive skeleton

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
who

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I'll catch them up

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
our characters were walking

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
in the snow

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
away from the last adventure

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
to the next one

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
and we were being led by a skeleton

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
with orange glowing hands

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
and

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
an inflated sense of self-importance

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
but that's

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
my description so don't

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
racially common among skeletons

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
racist

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
then

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
so we were walking with him and because I was in a blackout drunk

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
the previous time I was

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
asking for I just said

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
is this guy cool

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
we said are you cool and he said yeah

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I'm your friend and we said how do we

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
know you're our friend and he said

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I'm not eating your face

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I took a

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
fence at that

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I felt like that was a threat

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
yeah okay all right I could see that

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
yeah

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
so then we exchanged words

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
and then that's all at the end of it

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I guess he was going to be some kind of badass

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
so you took a friend

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
and you made him our enemy

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
he does this

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
he does this

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
he does this

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
you dropped the skeleton

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
you know Mozart was good at piano

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
time will tell which skill is more important

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
yes I took a friend and turned him into an enemy

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Jackson Pollock took a canvas

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
and turned it into a dynasty

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
yeah

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
not an enemy

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
he didn't take something great

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
and make it of lesser value

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
yeah

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
you know Hitler did that with the Jews

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
they turned them

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
into enemies

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Jackson Pollock was risking

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
lowering the value of a blank canvas

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
that's true

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
he was doing a splattering paint everywhere

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
it was a pretty selfish move

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
he wasn't exercising any fucking

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
he was like I'm a baby

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I want to

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
he knew that there were people that needed that canvas

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
you know there's kids in Africa

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
who have no blank canvas

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
who can eat that canvas

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
are there really kids in Africa

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I pictured right

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
less and less

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
no they're growing up

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
they're getting older

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000
they're becoming kids in Africa who were born in 1994

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
almost as old as your comic book

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
it is fucked up in Africa man

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
I mean first of all let's open that up to the group

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
anybody want to weigh in

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
on how to fix Africa

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
there's a continent of troubles

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
oh my god

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
there are parts that are really

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
really going through

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
oh I'm sure there's jewels of Africa

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
yeah I'm sure there's bustling

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
metropolis

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
yeah central Africa

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
I read something yesterday that was so

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
horrifying that I'm not even going to say it

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
no I'm not going to say it

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
okay alright

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
that's the one thing that

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Tune into Harmontown After Hours

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
to hear what Camille was going to say

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
come on

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
you don't want me to

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
it's like really dark shit

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
we're in the Africa segment

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
fucking say it

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I brought it up it's Harmontown

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
okay well I didn't

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
are you sure?

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
there's a guy

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
okay there you go

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I forget what he calls himself

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
like Hand of God or something like that

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
this is not the conny thing

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
and he videotapes

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
don't nobody

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
yeah you asked

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
google it

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
what were we talking about

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
oh Africa

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
yeah that's right

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
you remembered it

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
so that's a lot like

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
they got Christian

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
they got Christian the lion too

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
it's not all bad

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I guess there's AIDS

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
let's get out of this conversation

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I saw Dallas Byers Club

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Matthew McConaughey is so charming

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
he's got great abs

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
we should exercise and try and get abs

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I think we're out

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I forgot about AIDS

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
in Spencer's defense

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Camille's exit strategy of

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Dallas Byers Club wasn't that clean

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
that tunnel didn't take you through AIDS country

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
yeah

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
but we're in AIDS country

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
we gotta go through a little bit of AIDS country

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
to get out of AIDS country

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
there's AIDS all around us

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I just went the direction of McConaughey

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
that was the least successful ride

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
I think Disney ever tried

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
the AIDS country and the AIDS country critters

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
they try to have

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
the boat drivers

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
do comedy

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
and it's just sad

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I can't tell if I'm in on the joke

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
does AIDS get the joke

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
hey look out for that elephant over there

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
he's spraying AIDS on you

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
just kidding but that monkey will

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
hey he doesn't work here

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
and then actual AIDS

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
you working for tips just take me

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
around the river

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
well I mean don't get me started on that

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
are you pointing at me and laughing

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
and hearing at me

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
you were talking you got a microphone

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
it's called Harmontown

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I'm gonna be looking at you while you're talking

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
you know the look you were giving me

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
welcome to passive aggressive town

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
look at me like you want to eat my face

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
oh he's the skeleton

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I feel like a skeleton after I'm gone

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
we got four minutes

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
we need to pass these things out

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
no we shouldn't

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
I got to do extra work if we

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
stretch three more minutes I won't have to do anything

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I think we're out of stuff though

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I can tell you

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
I also think it's a special Harmontown

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
it goes a half hour longer

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
fuck you

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
you want to pass out the character sheets then

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
that's actually true

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
it does it amortizes their ten dollars

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
it's less per minute now

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
it's Monday

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
it's not that late

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Jeff would never allow this to happen

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
yeah right

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
so good

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
so this is there would you talk

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
talk he wants to talk

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I like that people are gonna be like oh an extra half hour

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
they're listening at home and it's just silence as we

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
get our character sheets

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
just use that 15 seconds skip button

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
now

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
I went on a vision

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
quest on Friday

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
maybe you can fill the time with one

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
of your horrible stories and then we'll catch up

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
right before

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
this guy's tapping himself

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
so you know how flammable

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
okay I think we're out of time

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
okay let's

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
what do you mean you went on a vision quest

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I went on a vision quest

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
have you ever had a

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
strong like sense of what you should do in your mind

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
and you just go do it

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
right now I do

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
what are you feeling

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
do it

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I found the mighty Morpheus

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I'm sorry

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
we bought those mics today

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
and you already

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Schrabbed it up

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
did you take mushrooms or something

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
no I just had the sense

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
like my car was gone it was early morning

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
I hadn't eaten or drank anything

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
I was like oh shit I gotta go find

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
the mighty Morphin Power Ranger's secret hideout

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I don't think you know what vision quest means

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I'm starting to feel

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
these people aren't gonna get their money's worth

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
out of this extra half power

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
you know what I mean

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
so basically you needed an omelet in you

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
or something

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
that's how it starts

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
I just mean that's how it starts

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
they don't eat omelets and then they get ideas

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
alright well they shot that crap

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
in the desert so you want to see a rock

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
or something

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
they shot the exteriors in this building

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
it's called the house of the book

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
it's a Jewish university

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
oh thread connect

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
house of the book

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
it's called the house of the book yeah

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
it's a great thing

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
see I told you Jews were forced to work

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
in television

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
so do we have the

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
do we have the music cue for Spencers

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
we don't have it do you have anything

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
they do have it

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
let's play it for Spencers

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
maybe play

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
maybe go watch Citizen Kane

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
play an Adam Corolla

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
podcast we're just gonna

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
bump this thing up an extra 10 minutes

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
or so yeah right

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
okay so I wrote this one

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
from the perspective of Lenev

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
so this is all metagame information that you don't know

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
yeah

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I am Lenev the rebel from the city

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
of Tormatour

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Lenev is the asshole skeleton that

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
fucked with me

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I am captain of the death guard

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
and peacekeeper for the city of Unshackled Dead

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
our city is in peril

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
344 of our most skilled craftsmen

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
lost their lung lives today

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
crushed to redef by a castle

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
falling from the sky

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
the sages sent me to investigate the disaster

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
and I discovered four living suspects

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
among the wreckage

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
at first their antics seemed harmless

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
merely self-destructive

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
but they became more neurotic as time passed

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
their leader taunted me

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
threatened me and then broke into

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
song about eating dirt

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I was ready to leave

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
but then he lay down on the ground

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
hurling insults at me and demanding I

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
eat his face

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
with some random destructive impulses

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I had no doubt that these were the cretins

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
involved in the disaster

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
almost certainly dooming

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
our culture

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000
and then he called me Laverne

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
I snapped

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
it's Lenev

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
he lunges at your throat

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
thank you for calling me the leader

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
yeah

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
alright fine he lunges at my throat

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
you took a friend and you made him an enemy

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
that's what's happening

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
does anyone have any clarifying questions

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
no get those out of the way

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
no eat my throat

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
see where it gets you

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
I mean can I

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
oh is he coming for him

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
can I shoot him with my Elizabethan eyes

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
you can try

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
just because I feel bad

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
for attacking you guys

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
it goes awry it doesn't hit anything

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
alright so I looked to Lenev and I go

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I didn't mean to hit you I wasn't trying for you

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
this is occurring

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
mid Lenev Lunge

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
he grasps you

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
by the throat with his glowing hands

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
and you feel the blistering hot energy

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
around your neck

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
you take some damage

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
hold on

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
just seven damage

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
and you feel an intense heat around your throat

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
as he's trying to throttle the life out of you

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I go

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
it's a nerving

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I'll put it at a

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Dan's turn

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
how interesting

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
level six sorcerer

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
am I

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
take a look at my wares

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
magic and otherwise

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
seem to have

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
lost my spell sheet

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
that's that ring with sharpie spells here

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
okay

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
you know what

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
this isn't a good time to fuck around

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I think we should go shocking grasp

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
since he's up close and personal

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I grab him and I say

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
shocking grasp

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
try that

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
as he's grabbing you

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
you find it very easy to touch him

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
with your shocking grasp

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
and you hit him directly

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
dealing some damage of some sort

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
21 electricity damage

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
surges through his body

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
he's all like

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
wait but skeletons wouldn't be hurt by electricity

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
right? they don't have anything

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
who

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
side are you on

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
in the morning

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I don't know

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
in the evening who's side are you on

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
when you sit down to supper

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
better make him your mind real quick

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
it's a fair point but as far as I'm aware

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
skeletons only have resistance to cold

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
well and you go down that road

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
and it's like well how's the skeleton really grabbing him

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
he has no tendons

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
it's a can of worms

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
did we just find out

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
that this game's dumb

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
if you remove all the bones from my body

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
can I go golfing in the rain

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
was that science? no

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
it was still danger

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
so he's so

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
shocked in pain

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
from the shock that he actually lets go of you

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
and stumbles back a few feet

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
staggering style

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
and I say enough if you want it

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
to be enough

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
it could be enough

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
I could rephrase that

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
basically my point is

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
we don't have to do this

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
inbomb

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
that happens yeah

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
he has a response maybe

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
but it's Schrobb's turn now

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
who's character do you get Rob?

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
I got Aaron's character

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Mulrainee

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I've got Mulrainee's character

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I'm going to use uh

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
fuck man

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
what are we doing here

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
what are we really doing

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
what do we know about Aaron's character

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
we know she doesn't spend a lot of time shopping

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I told him

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
you don't have to do anything

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
first off

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
take the ring off

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
throw it on the floor

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
and uh

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I take the dog and move out

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I think

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
my amulet will do that

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
roll to see if I

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
get to keep the cat

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
you don't

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
get the cat

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
what's the amulet of summer do

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
that will read you in magical flames

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
set me on fire

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
yes

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
but it doesn't hurt though

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
not like what they were doing in Africa

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
I turn on my amulet of summer

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
and then I

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
and then I start chasing the skeleton around

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
no no no

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
we were trying to be friends with the skeleton

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
he was like hurting him

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
but now he's a dick

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I don't know what the fucking people are doing

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
he's like strangling him

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
but shocked him

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
am I still on fire while they're yelling at me

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
stop yelling at me

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I'm on fire now

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
what do you want me to do

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
try and talk to him while you're on fire

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
hey

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
listen to me for a second

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
listen to me for a second

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
listen to me for a second

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
can you hear

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
listen

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
he's a dick sometimes

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
but we'll be nice to you

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
if you settle down a bit

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
okay

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
just relax

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
don't listen to him

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
shut the fuck up for two seconds

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
so you say those things

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
he's not really responding

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
so

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
this is word for word what happened was Sarah Silverman

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
you didn't say anything

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
you didn't respond

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I grab his arm and I shake it

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
of course you're on fire

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I know, listen

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
yeah you grab his arm

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
and I shake it

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
and it burns his bones

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
burn your bones now huh

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
now settle down

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
you need to settle down now

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
knock it off

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
quit barking at the cars

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
every time they drive by the house

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
it's not having the intended effect

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
ridiculous you're acting ridiculous

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
look at yourself

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
you're so stupid

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
it's not working

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
you look like Matthew McCoy

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
should I get more on fire

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
maybe if I was more on

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I don't think the issue is that you're not enough on fire

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
cause I'm completely on fire

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
you're all the way on fire

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
does anything burn

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
flammable else other than myself

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
you're as on fire as you can get

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
it's pretty much a binary way

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
we should cook something

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
we don't know when we're gonna eat again

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
I've got his one arm

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
if you give me like a bucket with some water

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
and I'll hold that and we'll

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
make some soup or something

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I'm gonna try to make him pee himself

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
you can do that

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
yeah I'll put that out

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
settle down, you need to settle down skeleton

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
skeleton you need to settle down

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Christopher's term

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:47.000
oh tap that

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I don't think I can

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
so what's happening is he attacking him

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
he's getting grabbed on his arm right now

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
that guy is

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
the nevus

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
what I do is

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
and I'm still

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
not myself right

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
that's crazy

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
I

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I fucking throw up on him

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
and I say

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
you throw up on him

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
but he doesn't seem too bothered

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
for whatever reason

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
we're trying everything

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
everything in the book

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
we've tried fire

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
if you hang on him

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
you shocked him with your fingers

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
he seemed like all the things that bones would be

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
especially since

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
and he's just looking at us

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
well I don't know why he's not bothered by it

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
because my thing is

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
acidic and acid hurts bones

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
wait a minute

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
what if he's already dead

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
he is a skeleton

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
are you already dead

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
are you already dead and you're making us look ridiculous

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
don't waste a turn asking him that

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
the answer won't help us in battle

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
let's just assume

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
we would not have been in battle

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
if it wasn't for

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
you know what

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
let's not bring up old shit

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
so

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
are you playing Mitch

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
do you know what's happening

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
I've never felt more in my life

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
like I'm in a dream

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
than when this happens

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
even actual dreams

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
where it's just like

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
we're talking about this thing

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I don't understand

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
why were you trying to contribute

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I wake up and think

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
why were you trying to contribute

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
you should have just been quiet

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
make something clear to you

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
whatever you do with your turn

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
the next turn is the asshole skeleton's turn

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
he's probably going to kill me

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
you have to do something effective

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
I'm Monty Carter

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
no

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
you're a fighter

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
and I'm consumed with resentment

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I'm pork

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
this is

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
you're going to have to take all that out right

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
no he doesn't

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I promise

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
he doesn't listen

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
and now he's not going to watch arrested

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I mean we're losing him on a couple of fronts

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
so

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
now just give me this tiny little piece of

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
information

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
what are we trying to do

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
do we want him on our fighting team

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
well he was on our fighting team

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
and then one of us

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
so we're kind of trying to

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
win him back and now he's just left handed

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
because

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
we're going to kill or subdued

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
kill or subdued

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
really? yeah

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
that's an easy one

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
so you're a barbarian with a big sword

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
you have a big sword

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
do you have an amulet of summer

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
rage powers

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
am I just somebody?

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
the sword catches fire

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
sword catches fire

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
low light vision

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
your sword catches fire

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
so I've got a flaming sword

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
which is also the name of my nightclub

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
flaming sword

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
flaming sword yeah

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
long line

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
that's what we do

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
we line them up

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
but anyway

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
I'm going to use my flaming sword

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
and I'm going to go right down the middle

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
right down the middle

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
I'm going to bisect him

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
he's going to become a bisexual

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
as I

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
turn him into

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
rubble

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
swinging your mighty sword aloft

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
it glows with a bright

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
flame

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
you cleave right into his shoulder

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
and you slice straight

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
through his arm

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
the one that Rob's holding as it happens

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
that sucks that one was already incapacitated

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
the arm comes right off

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
and he takes some damage of some sort hold up

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
yeah he lost his arm

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
well 10 damage

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
he takes 10 damage as his arm

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
falls clean off his face

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
that's not where arms are attached

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
wait so you just got it

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
he might have been put together wrong come to think of it

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
he has an arm on his face

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
no no my mistake

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
and maybe I scream like go back to elementary school

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
in science class and dangle in front of those kids

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
and then I

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
he takes it to heart

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
he's insulted

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
so

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
he looks at his stump and he's like

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
oh shit that's it

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
kid gloves are coming off

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
but they don't have to

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
you could be our friend

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
you're jumped in now

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
you've got one kid glove left

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
we all did this to each other

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
that's why we're friends

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
we make some mistakes

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
we're the 2-7 boys

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
you're not

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
you're not convincing him unfortunately

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
he's seen through

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
the deception in your eyes

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
I feel like if we hadn't talked about religion so much

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
he would be a lot

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
friendlier am I right

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
yeah I think we alienated him

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I don't get it

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
anyway

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
he said that thing that he said

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
that he said

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
and then you hear this

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
the intense sound of snapping and cracking bones

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
and you see two more

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
bony arms just kind of burst forth out of his back

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
and now he has three arms

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
and he's like I ain't got one arm no more

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
see

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
the two arms in the back

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
are useless

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
if you're having a baby

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
and you see a baby that has two arms on its back

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
you throw it back

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
you throw it back

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
you say do over

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
do over

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
so he does that

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
and then he's like

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
I didn't get to be the captain of the death guard

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
by getting my arm chopped off

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
and then just listening to people insult me

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
while I'm just describing the situation

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I got it

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
by casting haste

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
and then

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
he kind of disappears

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
you don't see where he's gone

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
that's over

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
we won again

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
see if him

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
oh good

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
well good work guys

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
we should probably give each other battles

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I think we all said some things we regret

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
yeah but

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
I was well then end well

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
kind of like him

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
before reappearing behind sharpie Buttsalot

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
what

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
hey look who's here

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
his three glowing hands they change their glowingness

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
they stop glowing orange and they start glowing blue

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
they kind of

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
make her with a blueish flame

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
and he stabs them at you like daggers

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
you dodge one of them

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
but two of them plunge

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
into your body and

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
you feel just really cold

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
inside like a cold

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
winner's day

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
not here though in LA like a cold place

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
but inside of him

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
yeah

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
you take one negative level

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
well the joke's on you because dan already feels

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:07.000
all cold inside anyway

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
he's used to it

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
I hope you had fun doing that

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
oh it's your turn by the way

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
oh me me personally

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
yeah

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
I'm gonna fuck this motherfucker

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
so for real

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I'm not kidding

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
um

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
this is like

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
those list of spells it was just

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
ah

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
would you

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
consider him a creature

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
look we're not leaving until this fight is over

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
that's it no we're gonna fuck this guy

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
can I cause fear on him

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
ah no the undead are immune to fear

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
fuck off

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
sorry I'm drunk

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
that's fair

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
fine call out

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
than level one

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
what do you mean sure

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
I'm looking at this spell list you put together

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
it's like you picked my spells

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
that I picked

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
yeah

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
like I'm a little baby and you

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
do my happy meal

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
behind the scenes work

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
but I have other spells than this available

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
well not since I restatted you as a pathfinder

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
what's this some guy yelling out yeah from the audience

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
alright look that's John Pathfinder

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
he is cool

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
alright well I'm just like

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
he phased in behind me yeah yeah

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
can I do a fireball

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
face yeah but it like it explodes

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
outwards and it's gonna hurt me

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
yeah probably

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
same with lightning bolt no lightning

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
bolt you could definitely do fuck

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
lightning bolt do you want some help

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
lightning bolt behind me over my shoulders

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
casting your arms in a magical

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
manner you channel a lightning bolt

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
of arcane energy

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
fire it directly out of your back

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
it blasts

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
straight through his chest all regions

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
continues on into the darkness

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
behind and he takes

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
some damage probably bone

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
to meet you

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
yeah that's good

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
that's the poster

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
what about I have a bone to pick with you

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
doesn't that would have been good

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
we'll workshop it

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
first order of business kill him

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
second order of business be clever

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
taking 15 damage

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
in the process

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
is it in the arm

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
now it's in the chest

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
yeah

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
putting it at your turn

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
well I have

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
something I want to throw out to the group here

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
dealing with the undead

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
there they probably

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
well

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
you start off so confident

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
I ran out of steam there

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
since it's undead

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
don't you think healing

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
would probably do the opposite

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
love it

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
love it

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
healing your medicine is poison to him

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
right heal him

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
fix him and I'm still on fire

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
and I'm still on fire right

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
yeah give him some medicine

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
I go I raise my hand

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
excuse me sir

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
is it too late to be friends

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
excuse me sir

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
you look rather shambled

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
in your bony stature

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I bet you wouldn't

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
please say what

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
and uh

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I'm sorry I'm sorry

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
I hope you don't mind

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
if I heal you

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
and then I do

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
my heel spell on him

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
what heel spell

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
this skill

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
yeah that's like

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
first aid and stuff

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
I think it's a great idea because also

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
it gives him the strength to fight us more

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
everybody's laughing over each other I don't know what I'm doing wrong

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
wait you're healing the enemy

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
and you don't know what you're doing wrong

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
but he's dead if I make him alive

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
he might be our friend

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
I am on board with your plan

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
everything goes by Adam's family rules

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
delicious soup tastes bad to him

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
right

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
it's bizarro guys so

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
so

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
heel skill is like

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
you know how to handle snake bites

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
and you can set a bone

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
set a what

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
a what

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I could what

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
you could fix a broken bone

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I do that

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I do it

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
this is your game man

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
I'm just playing it

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
yeah

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
that is bone

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
that pisses him off right

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
no

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
which bone

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
the one that's broken

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
what the fuck

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
you reattach

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
his severed arm

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
no no no no

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
I don't get what you're doing then

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
it's a little confusing

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I'm confused

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
same with me

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
I think this will work

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
kill him with kindness

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
wait a minute

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
yes

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
so

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
put his arm back on

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
you're laughing at me now

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
they laughed at Columbus

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
you stick his arm

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
actually

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
they laughed at Columbus when he undiscovered America

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
he wasn't a skeleton

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
you stick his arm back

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
on

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
he flexes

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
his fingers

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
don't feel so dead now

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
do you

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I don't know how to

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
respond to that

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
good

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
what's his reaction

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
well if you asked him that question

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
like you said you did

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
it feels fine

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
would be his response

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
he's getting healthier

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
which is bad for a skeleton

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
that's undead

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
this is great

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
he's got any band-aids come on let's do this

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
do I have any

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
let's heal this guy

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
rubbing alcohol

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
do I have any like

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
do I have like a cake I could give him

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
some meals for

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
let's throw him a party

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
let's really

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
fuck him up

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
do I have

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
do I have anything

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
you have like a hunk of meat like an animal

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
alright I say put the meat on the arm

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
put the meat on his arm

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
put the meat on the arm

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I yell

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I yell ET bone home

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I put meat on his arm

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
yeah nice to meet you

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
nice

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
and I cook it with

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
you know my body is still on fire

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
yeah this is totally working

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Mitch take it home

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
take it home

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
back in a flesh

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
I was wrong this game is fun

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
this is a fun game

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
I would like to

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
find him a place to live

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
let's get him an apartment

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
and uh

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
mix the methods

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
so we're gonna just

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
so far it's been working

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
up until your turn

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
get him a profile on okcupid

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
hold on a second

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
um

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
I have a moment of clarity

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
I have a moment of clarity

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
uh huh

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
and

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
and um

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
and I agree with uh Schrab

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
I say you know what we gotta kill this guy with kindness

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
let's bring him back to life

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
let's bring him back to life

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
just bring him to death

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
so maybe with my moment of clarity

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
I convince him to be our friend

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
let's see here

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
I say we got all sorts of tricks

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
we got all sorts of tricks like this

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
we've got a thing

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
we've got a thing that grows your hair

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
you're gonna

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
and I know you hate the way you look

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I mean why would you not

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
but no don't go there

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
but we uh but

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
I think we could really do a number on you

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
let's do the pretty skeleton

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
you know and take it down

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
let's do a makeover

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
let's do a whole makeover

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
we chopped his arm off

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
reattached it, stuck a piece of meat on it

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
so if we can do that

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
now we're telling him we can regrow his hair

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
yeah

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
so uh

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
yeah you say those things

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
with your silver tongue

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
and

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
you know it starts to sink in a little bit

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
nice nice

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:49.000
nice

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
he's like you know what

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
some longer hair might be nice

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
yeah

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
how does that happen, how do we make that happen

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
well that's uh

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Mulraine has a craft

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
we want to speak to you about the Baha'i Faith

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
and uh

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
it's true, it's faith

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
yeah say Baha'i

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
well we could

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I mean don't we have

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
we have no propitia or anything

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
you know the

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
I have craft supplies

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
right, can you make a wig out of them

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I could probably make a wig

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
let me look at my supplies

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
I have a ribbon dagger

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
you can have the ribbon from that

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
make a bow for the hair

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
you're loosing them

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
that's not what you promised, you're loosing them

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
oh it's not working

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
we'll lose the ribbon

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
the ribbon's gone

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
ribbon's gone

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
you like the meat on your arm

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
you like the meat

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
you like the reset phone

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
I've got a nutsack, I swear to God

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
you probably made a hundred jokes about this

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
but nutsack is right there in my gear

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
you don't have a nutsack

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
that's going to be hanging out anyway

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
just like we have, it goes right

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
it just staples right in there

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
okay so

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
out of the craft supplies

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I took some construction paper

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
and I've

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
done some streams

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
and stuff

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
so where do we land on the bow, no?

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
no bow?

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
no bow, no bow

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
just some nice construction paper

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
construction paper hair

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
nice feathered

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
John Bon Jovi

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
back the fuck off for two seconds

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
okay here we go

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
there

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
don't get too close, he doesn't like you

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
look how

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I'm just saying, he looks nice

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
and this is Elmer's, we just rub that in

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
and that

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
now look

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
somebody break the river over here

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
so we can see his reflection

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
who ordered the beefcake?

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
love your nutsack

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
man

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
this is looking pretty great

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
you guys should meet my friends

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
yeah

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
that's right

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
but you're not going to go out like that, right?

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I mean go out with us

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
do your friends threaten people?

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
no

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
wait dude, please

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
I'm kidding

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
well it's time for a slow motion

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
walk down into the sunset

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
with these five friends

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
new paper hair

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
and we're at the end of our show

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
we each grab one of his hands

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
oh yeah, we each hold one

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
and we all walk around

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
alright, yay!

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
that's the end of our show

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
thanks for sticking around

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
for an extra long

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Harmontown

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
a super special hand

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
for our guest comptroller, Mitch Harowitz

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
thank you guys

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
thank Kumail and Rob

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
thank you for coming

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
do you have something to say about the skud stuff?

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
oh, okay

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
so there's skud books on everybody's chair

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
and stuff like that

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
if you want them, please take them home

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
but if you're really not going to want them

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
don't throw them out, give them back to me

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
because they're priceless

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
okay, so they're vintage

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
they're vintage and they're worth something

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I'll take them back

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
okay cool, thanks to Zach and Dustin

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
thanks to Emily for saying

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
you should have a podcast two years ago

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
thanks to NerdMelt for hosting us

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
thanks to Danielle

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
and all the little scooters and booters

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:59.000
and we'll see you next week
