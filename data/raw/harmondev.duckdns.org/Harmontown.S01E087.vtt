{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.640\nHello! Hello, you apes! Well, welcome. My name is Mitch Hurwitz. I'm the temporary cop\n\n00:13.640 --> 00:18.800\nstroller here in Harmontown. Is that what the guy's name is? Dan Harmon, I understand.\n\n00:18.800 --> 00:24.000\nWell, I want you to give it up. He's not even backstage yet, so don't give it up, I guess.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:34.000\nJust hang on to it, and get ready to say hello to the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:44.000\nThank you. Thank you, guest cop stroller Mitch Hurwitz. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:48.000\nI'm sorry, I didn't know that you didn't know, but for some reason I always come up through the crowd.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:53.000\nI don't know much about anything. I was listening to Harmontown on the way over to kind of prepare.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:57.000\nAnd suddenly you had a sense that Jeff always sees me in the back room.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:05.000\nFirst of all, I didn't realize you were recording it. So people elect to listen to this.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:11.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah. They drive to work, or they, I don't know.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:17.000\nIt's a whole new world full of less fame and more stuff to listen to.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:22.000\nNo, I do know all about it. In fact, I was here, you know, Dan doesn't like people to know this part of it,\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:27.000\nbut we started our rehearsal early today. We did this at one o'clock.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:31.000\nAnd I hope I remember everything. Yeah.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:35.000\nIt is the only thing that I ask people that are involved in the show to...\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:40.000\nSorry. That was your line. Sorry, sorry.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:44.000\nTo keep a secret is the amount of preparation that goes into the show, because I find it uncharismatic.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nI like to pretend that we stay in the moment here at the show.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nI'm less groomed than the normal Comptroller. Did you notice that?\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:56.000\nNo. Oh, then Jeff, you mean? Because he's so dapper.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:01.000\nYeah, he's very dapper. And actually, maybe later we can talk about some grooming ideas for me,\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:05.000\nbecause I just looked in the mirror on the way out here and I thought,\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:08.000\nI might be too old for this hairstyle.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:13.000\nWhat do you mean? Well, we'll get to it. We'll get to it. We'll get to it. We'll do your thing.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nWhat do you do different?\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nWhat do I get your opinion on? I mean, I guess you could shave it down, though,\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:23.000\nlike a little short... That sounds sexy.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nYou could grow it out into a big old poofy thing.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:31.000\nThose are the only two things I can imagine based on what I'm seeing. Yeah, I really have the two options.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:35.000\nIt could be longer or shorter. Small ball, large ball.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:39.000\nNot the guy to talk to about this. I will go to the stylist sometimes and just say,\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nsmall ball me, will you? But you're very...\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:47.000\nLook, let's try not to have the whole show be you and I just blowing each other,\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:49.000\nbut you're a very handsome man.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:52.000\nThank you. I'm going to just really quickly take off my shirt and I want to show you.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:55.000\nWow. No, I'm not.\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:01.000\nI was shocked when I met you because I assumed from how talented you were\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nthat you must have been 800 pounds.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.000\nThe first time I ever saw you physically, I went to the Asset of Arrested Development shooting.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:13.000\nI remember meeting you. And for some reason I didn't Google image search you\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:17.000\nto be prepared for anything. I just pictured this mountain of a man\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:21.000\nwith birds and squirrels and his beard.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nI know that's a compliment. It is.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nI don't feel like saying thank you.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nI pictured David Milch as being slightly less, like a slightly less\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nlarge mountain with a couple less squirrels. I pictured Vince Gilligan as being like,\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nI don't know, like maybe... Steve Buscemi.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:44.000\n...twice as fat as both of us, but with like a corkshoe-shaped dick or something.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:52.000\nI automatically assume if people are that talented that they ought to be nice.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:57.000\nThat's very nice. Well, I'm getting there. I do remember when I met you,\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:01.000\nI think the first thing I said so as not to scare you off was fuck them.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:05.000\nYou were like, yeah, right? I was like, no, because it was right after the whole event.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:10.000\nIt was a dream come true because you were like an oily salve\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\non my gaping wounds.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:17.000\nAgain, I don't feel like saying thank you.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nBut I know it's a nice thing that you're...\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nI also thought you'd be cranky and not approachable.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nThis is all self-justification. I think like, okay, I'm a bad person in this way,\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:33.000\nthat way, that way. So as long as the guy that made the rest of development\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:39.000\nis fatter and more of an asshole, that puts me on a map that makes sense.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nI think I'll just hide it better. I really do.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:45.000\nI can be more of an asshole tonight, if you'd like.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nJust try it for five minutes. Just give us a taste.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nI'll be like Niles to your Frasier.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:53.000\nJust give it a taste. Let's just give it a taste so we can turn it off.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:56.000\nSo what else is going on in the news today?\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:00.000\nI guess our vice president is up to his old tricks again.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:04.000\nWell, I haven't seen a paper in a while.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:14.000\nHealth care is at an all-time health...\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nYou know, don't you agree?\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:23.000\nIt's all bullshit, man. It's all bullshit.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nStop those guys.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nThis is you being an asshole.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:31.000\nAll right, all right, all right. Let's reset.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:37.000\nSo I've got a... Let's see. I took a bath tonight.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:43.000\nThank you.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nYou're a big water displacement guy, right?\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nYou're a whole...\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nYou don't care about weight.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nMy argument is principles, yes.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nYeah, you care about mass.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nI don't care about water.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\nI took a bath, and I love taking bubble baths,\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:08.000\nbut Aaron bought me for my birthday a waterproof iPad sleeve.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:12.000\nIt's just a plastic bag that seals,\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:15.000\nbut the plastic is made out of a material\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:20.000\nthat allows for your wet soapy fingers to pinch and zoom and tap\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nand double tap right through the bag.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\nAnd you got... Just because I missed a couple of shows,\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nbut you got her a diamond ring, didn't you?\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nWasn't there a...\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:34.000\nAs I recall, there was like a big, large...\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nThat was fitted that you actually...\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nBut it was definitely the waterproof iPad case of engagement.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:44.000\nAnd she's getting the iPad case of husbands, for sure.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:49.000\nShe's ahead. She's a more generous person than me,\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nno matter how much I would ever give her.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nBut she...\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nAnd it's not like a thing...\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nYou don't submerge it.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nIt's not like, hey, submerge it.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:05.000\nThere's not a picture on the cover of an Asian girl in a pool\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nwith goggles smiling.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:11.000\nLike a picture of a fish on the iPad under the water.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:16.000\nRight, with a burst that says, like, try submerging it.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nIt also doesn't say, don't submerge it,\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:22.000\nI assume you shouldn't just, like, hold it under and tempt fate.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nBut the big difference is, if this is a thing that you put on your iPad,\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:31.000\nif you dropped it, definitely, and you just grab it and fish it out,\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nit's gonna be fine.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd that makes the world of difference.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nSo, like, here's the thing about my life.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:43.000\nTwo things, like, keep me going.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:46.000\nHot soapy baths.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:51.000\nAnd tweeting, I guess.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nUsually just at people who say, like, oh,\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nI was disappointed in the last night's episode,\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nand I just go, fuck off, fuck off!\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nAnd then I just...\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nIt feels like I took a bath with my...\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nin my heart or something.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nAnd I'm, like, so...\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nYou drew a buoyance.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nWhenever I would get into the bath,\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nmost people, like, they get out when they feel clean or they feel pruney.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nAnd I would get out when I've...\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nI haven't tweeted in a while.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nYeah, okay, I get it.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nSo, somebody might be saying, hey, good show last night.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nYeah, or I was disappointed.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nI would get off my ass and say, thank you.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nI was disappointed in last night's episode.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:35.000\nDon't say anything. Just take a bath if you agree.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nAnd then I miss it.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nOh, you miss it.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nSorry, I already blocked you, bro.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nCarmen admits mistakes were made.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nYeah.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:49.000\nSo I sunk into this soapy water\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nand I tweeted, I'm taking a bath.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nAnd I took a picture of myself taking a bath.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nAnd then I had nothing else to say.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nBut I took the longest bath in the world\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nbecause I had the...\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nIt didn't... I never used it again.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nI didn't do anything with it.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nBut it was there in a plastic bag next to the tub.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.000\nSo I took the world's longest, most satisfying bath.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nGreat. You could have watched,\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nyou could have watched, like, Showa on your iPad.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nAnd just really, just dug it.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nJust enjoyed it, relaxed.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nBecause you love the Holocaust, right?\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nWasn't that you?\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nIs Showa a...\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nOh, it's a hoot.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nRob Schrab, who's coming out later,\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\ndid a very funny comic book about it.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:35.000\nIt's about the Holocaust.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nI stopped taking baths when I realized,\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nwhich was late in life.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nI mean, I was in my late 20s\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nwhen I realized that the penis floats.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nYes.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nAnd it floats.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nFor those of you, I guess,\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nwho are women,\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nor under 29.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nAnd I didn't like...\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nI didn't like seeing it in there,\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nin the bubbles.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nWell, it embarrassed me.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nI'm sorry to say that I do not have that problem.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nMy balls float.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nThe penis doesn't float.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nMy penis, as I've said on this podcast,\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nis a...\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nI'm proud of it.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nI've heard great things.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nIf there was no such thing\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nas this whole mythology\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nof size and stuff,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\napparatus-wise,\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nit's very functional.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nI would look at it as Darwin.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nThis is a very fit specimen.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nBecause that thing,\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nwhen it's not needed,\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nboom, it's gone.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nAnd that, I think,\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nin a world of saber-toothed tigers,\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nis like, that's valuable.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nI'm impressed by that.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nThis guy's like Inspector Gadget.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nI'll tell you what's not impressive\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nare the balls.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nBecause if you think...\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nMine are giant and they're unwieldy.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nBut go on, please.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nI think they're all unwieldy.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nI mean, that's the nature of the ball.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nBut you know why\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nthey're on the outside of the body?\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nI'm sure you do.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nApparently, spermatogenesis\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nrequires one degree difference.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nI've never understood this about God.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nIt's the argument against intelligent design.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nIt really is.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nBecause it's like...\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nOh, the eyeball's so complicated.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nYeah, let's talk about your nuts, you fucking idiot.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nAnd the solution, the design solution,\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nwhich, if Apple came up with it,\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nyou would blog how much you hate the thing,\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nis, how about a sack?\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nHow about a sack on the outside?\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nMaybe in one of the hands?\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nGentlemen, what if part of the inside of the body\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nwas outside the body?\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nIt's never going to be a problem.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nPeople walk on all fours.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nIt's never going to be a problem.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nIt's protected.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nYes.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nBecause they always explain that in health class.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nThey go, well, you need one degree cooler\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nthan body temperature\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nto make sperm.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nYou can't figure out a solution to this\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nto make my body.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nHere's your new Jaguar.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nAs you can see, it's a convertible.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nIt's got that nice little grill.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nThis is sort of a floppy sack full of gasoline.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nMake sure not to hit anything against that.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nThe answer is absolutely,\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nyou couldn't figure out a solution.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nIf you were Steve Jobs,\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nand God is not Steve Jobs,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nI'm not saying he's not as smart.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nI'm saying he gives way less of a shit\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nabout design.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nAbout customer satisfaction.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nWe got mad at Steve Jobs,\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nand he said, then don't hold it that way\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nwhen the antenna was on the other side for the first time.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nGod doesn't answer your emails.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nHow's that for a start?\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nWhen you get a human body, it's not always set to\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nCupertino time.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nIt's not that kind of...\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nIt's a horrible...\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nI mean, even under the armpit would be...\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nwould make more sense.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nKind of keep your arm down.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nThere's got to be a chemical way.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nEven as humans, with our short time with intelligence,\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nwe've learned how to design things\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nthat chemically can create...\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\ncould be one degree lower or higher in temperature.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nWe've done great.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nI have toe warmers in my boots.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nNot right now.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nMaybe that's it.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nMaybe they're just waiting for us to discover\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nwe need a testicle cooler.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nBecause they do retract again if you're under a certain age\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nor you're a woman.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nThey're always moving.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nThey get around.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nWhen you...\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nIf you ever just lay...\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nIf you ever have a healthy relationship enough\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nwhere you're just laying on your bed naked\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nand in your full Shamu glory\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nand just air drying\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nafter a shower or something.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nAnd you bother to look down\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nat your balls.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nThe first thing you'd think would be like,\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nI'm never going to get a woman.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nAnd if I did,\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nshe would be so disgusting\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nto like...\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\ncontinually\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nshifts and moves\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nlike a river of magma.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nLike some kind of\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nweird psychedelic...\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nIt's self-conscious.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nIt's incredibly self-conscious.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nThere's nerve endings in your balls,\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nto be sure, but there's nothing...\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nIt's only visual. When you look down at it,\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nyou have to see it. You have to catch it in the act.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nShifting and pulsing\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nand adjusting\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nto what?\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nThere's nothing that has to do with me.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nDoesn't care if community was good last night.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nIt has no reaction to anything.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nJust stay in ready.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nJust moving around. Stay in ready.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nI guess based on making that one temperature...\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nYeah, and kind of getting ready\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nto get ready for sex\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nand kind of thinking like, hey, let's not let these guys get too productive.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nRight? Let's distract them.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nI have to imagine that\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\npants...\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nthat they raise the temperature\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nfor your balls by at least a degree.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nThat's interesting.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nThank you for pretending that's the case.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nThe problem is, you know,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nthese universities,\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nthey just don't give up the research money\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nfor a while.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nYou got to sound so smart, you know, and they don't...\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nI remember reading that our sperm count\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nhad dropped since the days of World War II.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nWell, you know what has dropped is our testosterone.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nOh, really?\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nI think it's just because we're nervous, but...\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nNo, it has.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nI talked to a doctor recently,\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nwho did a whole blood panel,\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nand he said, you know,\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nin my generation, it would have been like 1200.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nAnd if it dipped below 1200,\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nyou know, I would really feel like weeping all the time.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nYour generation, he said,\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nyou want to be around 800.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nAnd he said, young people today, it's like 400.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nWait, what?\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nThat's what this nut told me.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nCan't say his name. He was kind of an interesting dude.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nBut apparently there is a worldwide trend.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nAnd we know this is happening in Asia.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nRight? They're having a lot less sex.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nHuh?\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nYeah. Really?\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nYeah, this could be it.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nSociety could end at nerd melt.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nThat's as great as we ever got.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nYou know, we had aqueducts,\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nand then we had the computer,\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nand then we did these podcasts, and that was it.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nI hadn't heard that,\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nbut I remember becoming terrified in biology class.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nA biology teacher explained, he said,\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nyou know, populations of mammals\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nas they outgrow their food supply,\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nthey radically change in behavior.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nIf you have a relatively\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nclosed-off warehouse full of rats\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nand a certain amount of food in that warehouse,\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nthe rats will hit a point\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nwhere they're conscious as a species\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nor that localized population\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nof the amount of food that's left.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nAnd they will spontaneously\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nengage in self-mutilation\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nand murder\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nand all kinds of\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\njust, well, very familiar-sounding behaviors.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nYeah, to us.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nRight.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nAnd not to rats.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nAnd I just remember hearing that,\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nand he didn't even bother to say,\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nso think about it.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nHe was just pointing that out about mammals,\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nand I was like, holy shit, that's what we're doing.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nI mean, this is the guy you strangled, right?\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nBecause\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nyou had to stay there during the snow or something?\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nNo, it is.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nIt's a problem.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nWe had 6 billion, what, 20 years ago,\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nand now we got 9 billion.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nI don't want to bum you guys out.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nYou can't bum these guys out.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nLike yeast.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nWhen yeast is deprived of oxygen,\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nwhich it really needs, right?\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nIf you put it at the bottom of a bunch of grape juice,\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nit makes alcohol.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nSo maybe that's our destiny.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nYeah, that's why we have alcohol.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nBecause they want\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\noxygen,\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nbut there's nothing there but fruit juice.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nAnd it happens in our body, too.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nSo that's how you create alcohol.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nLet's try it.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nThe opposite of making lemons out of lemons,\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nor lemonade out of lemons,\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nit's like making poison out of...\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nout of lemonade.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nRight.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nNot enough lemonade.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nLike, you're saying that, well,\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nyeast isn't getting drunk, though.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nNo, yeast is basically\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nshitting alcohol.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nWell, I don't know how much you want to reveal.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nNo, tell them anything.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nSo we went out the other day.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nAnd we said, what can you shit?\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nUm...\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nMitch shit the entire bill of rights.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nNow, here's what's...\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nI swear to God, I found one typo.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nThere was one typo.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nNot true.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nNot true.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nSelf... self... self-ervident.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nAnd I didn't bother to point it out.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nThose were, you know, my S's and my F's\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nwhen I shit bills of rights.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nI do it the way they did it.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nThe preffident shall have.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nAll right.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nWell, we have some friends here tonight.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nI guess we should bring them out,\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nsince we've covered all of these.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nThey're still friends.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nThey have fundamental material.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nThey're our first friend that's out here.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nHe's celebrating a special event.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nHe's my best friend from Milwaukee\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nbefore I moved to L.A.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nThe reason I moved to L.A.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nis because this guy I was doing stand-up\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nand improv with created this comic book\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nat the film rights option by Oliver Stone.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nAnd so we moved out to L.A.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nbecause we thought that that meant\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nit's time to participate in Hollywood.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nAnd we were so wrong and so naive,\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nbut thank God we were.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nAnd he's the beginning\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nof the second chapter\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nof my life.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nHe's the... he's my everything.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nHe's experienced all the grief\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nand disillusionment and triumphs\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nand victories from, like,\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nthe age of 20 to the age of 35\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nwith me.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nAnd it just so happens that comic book\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nthat he created on his kitchen table,\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nit turns 20 years

28:13.000\nas proof of what I'm saying\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nDid you\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\ngrill or did you go, so the whole\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\ntape was bad or just like\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\npart of it that got wet\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nDid you listen to the whole thing?\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nI think I smelled a rat and I said\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nso\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nyou thought\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nit would be best to\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nthrow it in the garbage\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nso that I never had to see it wet\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nThrow it in the garbage\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nand then take it out of the\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\napartment as quickly as possible\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nand throw it into the\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\ngarbage truck as it's driving away\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nAnd it's not the best technology\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nGive it a couple of days. This thing will get\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nall warbled up and, you know, tangled\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nand those things fell apart like\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\neverything is underwater\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nI think in that moment I realized\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nI was like, oh shit, I've been listening to that thing\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\na lot and she's been silently\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nshe's been hating\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nDon't make her a hero\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nIt took me a fucking year to make that thing\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nYou were getting mad at me at the end\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nI have the perfect punishment\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nfor her. She is currently Dan Harmon's\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nex-girlfriend\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nI can't think of a worse fate\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nAnd head of the International\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nMonetary Fund\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nThat's a big deal\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nYeah, but honestly\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nDan Harmon's ex\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nAnd she invented the CD\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nThat was really the thing\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nBecause she actually felt so bad\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nabout it. Oh my god\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nOh my god, there must be a way\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nI have to go to her\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nDevice that can handle a\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nstorm. Right.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nI got it\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nShe's just working so hard on it\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nand her new mentor love interest\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nplayed by Pierce Brosnan is like\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nHey, take it easy\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nAnd she's like, I'm sorry, I just\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nI loved a man once\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nand I\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nHis tape got rained on\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nI understand\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nThat was a little\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:13.000\nMy girlfriend was killed by a volcano\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nDid you see that fucking movie\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nHis girlfriend, really\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nShe got murdered by a volcano\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nJFK style\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nHe got into a car with her\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nWhat movie was this?\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nDante's Peak\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nHe gets into a car with her\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nAnd it's like, come on, cut\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nAnd looks over at her and goes\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nWe're gonna be okay\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nThat volcano can't get us now\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nPierce Brosnan\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nA volcano rock\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nFlies through the\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nBecause the volcano, it's personal\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nAnd it dissolves to\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nPierce Brosnan doing crunches\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nOn the floor of his apartment\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nWhere he's been living\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nIn fucking hatred of volcanoes\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nFor sexual reasons\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nFor the last 20 years\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nAnd the only thing that's gonna break him out of it\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nIs Linda Hamilton as a civil servant\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nBecause she loves\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nHe's fucking running a city so much\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nAnd it reminds me of how much she loved volcanoes\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nHe actually\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nSays at one point, he says to Linda Hamilton\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nHe goes, I love the woman once\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nShe loved volcanoes\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nHe says\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nShe loved volcanoes\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nDidn't they say that in Twister too?\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nI'm sure they did, yes\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nMy parents love Twister so much\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nWell, in Twister they have to\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nThey create a, they go, it's a category of Trinado\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nSo that you can identify\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nThat's the F5\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nThat's the Trinado that killed my father\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nThat's the combination of heat\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nAnd cold\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nIt was twisty just like that\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nAnd there was stuff in it\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nThat's the finger of God?\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nIsn't that what it...\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nI would know it if it wasn't the one that got my dad\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nIt would still be twisty\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nThe layman would make that mistake\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nThat's what these hicks do\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nThey sit on their porch with a shotgun\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nTwister, you killed me, Pappy\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nI'm a scientist\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nI know the one that got my dad\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nIt had a little fin on the top\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nIt had a pointed nose\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nSharknado, I don't like this\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nNew generation of purposefully ironic\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nHorror things, I sharked to push it\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nNo good\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nA kiss doesn't get the joke\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:31.000\nKiss doesn't get the joke\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nDan pointed at me, so I repeated it\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nWhen Schrab and I first moved to LA\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nWe had a meeting\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nI swear it was Stuart Kornfeld that told us that story\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nYeah, that was Jack Black that told us the story\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nOh, really?\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nBecause we were talking about heat vision and Jack\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nAnd how it needs to be played serious\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nOtherwise it's not funny\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nJack Black told us the story\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nGoing like, oh, I know what you mean\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nThere's this parable, this anecdote\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nAbout some graphic designer\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nThat was hired to design a poster\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nFor a kiss reunion\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nAnd they made some poster that was sort of like\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nI don't know, I can't picture this\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nIn my head, because I'm not\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nHe's got Gene Simmons, but he's like winking\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nAnd big elbows\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nI'm trying to picture the difference between a sincere kiss poster\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nAnd an ironic one, and I can't picture it\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nBut the important part of the story\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nIs that Gene Simmons did\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nHe looked at the poster\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nAnd handed it back to the person\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nAnd said, look babe, kiss doesn't get the joke\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nYou've got me\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nWearing the star on my eye\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nI don't get it, man\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nKiss doesn't get the joke\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nKiss has to think that they're demons\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nThat have powers and stuff\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nI did, I thought they were scary\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nHey man, kiss isn't in on the joke\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nAnd that's what that ended up being\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nThat concert\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nKiss isn't in on the joke\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nAnd that's what kiss stands for\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nKiss isn't so smart\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nI want a rock and roll\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nAll night\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nBut I never want to be\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nInvolved in the joke about it\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nI know I'm going off meter\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nBut it's important that caveat\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nAnd party every day\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nRock and roll all night\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nWhat are you guys laughing at\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nWhat's so funny\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nWho's laughing over here\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nGet this man out of here\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nI got two guys laughing at the back\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nI don't know if that beach ball is a bit\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nAnyway, party all day\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nOkay, they're having fun\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nHaving fun with the beach ball\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nIt's cool, if it's about how much fun is my weight\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nIt's the way of life\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nIt's the way of life\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nYou're an army, you're the kiss army\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nArmies don't have beach balls\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nLet's go invade Ario Speedwagon\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nArio Speedwagon gets the joke\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nThat was their big claim to fit\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nArio Speedwagon gets the joke\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nThat's what Ario stands for\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nYeah, we get the joke\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nIn Latin\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nBut at the end, when they were like 45\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nThey'd come out in a big Speedwagon\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nIt was a big fucking joke\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nIt was so stupid\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nThey'd have pacifiers in their butts\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nArio Speedwagon\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nArio Stationwagon\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nI think they started calling themselves\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nThey'd come out in a grand safari\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nThe Speedwagon had a beanie on board\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nReally a missed opportunity\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nAll right\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nSo it seems like the\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nSchrab.ells run dry enough\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nWe have not talked about the\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nThe thing, tell us about Skud\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nTell us what it's\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nThere's a lovely story by your wife\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nWho I just asked, are you still married?\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nBut in fairness\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nThat was just based on what you were wearing\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nI swear to God\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nWe've known Schrab.for all nine years\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nHe's dated Kate and now he's just recently married her\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nWe're all astounded every day\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nThat she doesn't dump him\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nMe too\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nShe's a fucking trooper\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nShe's crazy\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nShe's Amish, right?\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nI think that might be what it is\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nBecause of his technology, she thinks he's bionic\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nShe doesn't know\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nShe's on an extended rom spring\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nShe wrote a beautiful forward\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nYou guys are real funny\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nReal funny\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nThis is my life\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nHe just

45:35.000\nDude, I just got a text to direct\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nan episode of the Mindy Project\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nI hope, you know\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nI'm gonna\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nYou're gonna stop, right?\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nI'm gonna pass on it\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nI like that Ike Barron holds\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nHe's funny\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nJust Mindy, no, you're gonna\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nHe's like Donald Glover funny\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nI like him a lot\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nThat's great too, I just met him two days ago\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nHe's really good on that show\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nOn that and newsroom\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nAnd Mindy's great too\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nI'm not suffering the illusion\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nshe's sitting here listening in her bathtub\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nOh, you didn't mention me\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nCome on, come on, say my name\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nCome on, come on\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nWhen will my name be mentioned?\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nBut no, well\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nshe runs the show\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nand she had the wisdom to walk into a writer's room\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nwith Ike Barron holds\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nand then immediately grab him\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nand yank him and throw him onto camera\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nbecause I really\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nI feel like I've seen him in things before\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nOh, I'm not sure he was on things\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nbut he acts and writes and stuff like that\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nThis is by far his big thing\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nI think he's so good\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nYeah, he's on Eastbound\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nHe's great on that, yeah\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nHe's like Glover where you're just like, fuck you\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nThis is turning more into just a conversation\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nand less into an interesting conversation\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nI just want to\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nas the Comptroller\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nI feel like we should now talk about\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\ntranshumanism or get into a whole new world\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nNo, no, no, let's talk about gender\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nI feel like we didn't gender\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nWe haven't really figured that one out\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nWe haven't rules about gender\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nWe haven't covered what's wrong with the woman's body\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nBy the way\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nYeah, what parts of that sag\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nOh, there's three glaring mistakes\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nNo, I'm not going to go there\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nWhat are they?\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nNo, no, no, no\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nI think one of the biggest problems\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nwith the design of the balls is that\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nthey are the perfect kicking height too\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nlike\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nlow enough that everyone can get to it\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nbut high enough that you get good momentum going\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nIt's a really terrible design\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nIf they were on the foot\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nyou wouldn't get hurt as much\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nWhy are there two of them also?\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nJust give me one terrible thing on my body\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nOr don't put them next to each other\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nYeah, two\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nSeparate them\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nDo you just have one big grapefruit one?\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nWho do you have?\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nWell, there's one scrotum\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nholding two little things in there, yeah\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nI've never looked that close\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nIt's all about that bilateral symmetry\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nIt's such a strange, but I guess\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\neffective thing\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nLike everything got\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nOh, so do I have redundancies?\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nOne eye goes, the other eye goes fine\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nShould I move?\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nHere? No, no, no\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nYou're doing this a lot\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nNo, I'm just trying to make eye contact with everybody\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nThat's not you\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\non stage, so\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nWhat's on your shirt?\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nWhat is this? Is this a detergent?\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nThat's coming out\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nBut you know we started\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nbiologically obviously as like these\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nunicellular organisms\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nWell, the face itself\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\ncomes around from the back, it's true\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nThe way it embryologically comes together\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nit like goes around the back\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nSo this is just the seam\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nThe nose is basically the seam\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nthe part that you would sort of clip off\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nAnd your mouth is\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nBeautiful\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nOh yeah, the mouth goes\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nexactly to your asshole\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nBecause you're a worm, we're all worms\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nor donuts\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nThe first multicellular organisms\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nthey're just trying to\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\noptimize\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nthe surface area to\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nDigestance\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nAnd everything you eat\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nyou're rubbing up against with the outside of your body\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nIt's just that advanced organisms\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nwe have a part of the outside of our body\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nwe're like\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nthese balloon animals\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nPart of the outside of our body\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nis inside our body\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nSo when you eat a donut\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:43.000\nit's moving, it's rubbing up against\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:45.000\nthe outside of your body\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nDonuts eating donuts, huh?\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nYou're not going anywhere, Rob\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nNo, do you know\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nwhy we stand direct?\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nBecause\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nof capitalism\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nBecause we really love the show\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nBecause\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nit's less surface area\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nfor the sun to hit\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nSo we could be out at noon\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nwhen all the other animals were inside\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nI mean, that's one crazy theory\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nI mean, the most\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\namazing thing about us walking\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nerect is that it's probably the most dramatic\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nchange\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nin evolutionary, well, certainly in\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nour evolutionary history\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nthe amount of time\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nthe amount of time it\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:31.000\ntook the human species to go from\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nto start walking\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nerect, that amount of pelvic shift\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nin the\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:39.000\namount of time that it happened\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nis so dramatic\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nWell, Camille, would you mind\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nkind of showing us? Take us through the\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:47.000\nstages?\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nWhy me?\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nJust seem really talented physically\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nAlright\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nIt's not to humiliate you in any way\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nJust go ahead and get down on your knees there, buddy\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nI would\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\ntake us through the evolution of those\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nYou could just say you're doing it\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nStop it, if you're embarrassed\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nI feel much better if Schrab was doing it\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nNo, no, no, no\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nBy the way, I heard\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nand what I do is\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nwhen I hear a great theory\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nabout evolution, I don't look it up\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nbecause I want it to be magical\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nis that our brains got too smart\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:23.000\nso\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nthat's why we all have back problems\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nYou're disproving your theory\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nas you make your theory\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:31.000\nOur brains got too smart\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nLike, okay, well, it's not that\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nWait, am I the new Schrab?\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nLet's bring out Rob Schrab, everybody\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nStatus change\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nStatus change\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nDo we have to call it Schrab?\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nThat's great, Rob, yay!\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nYou got Schrab\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:01.000\nOur brains got too smart\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:03.000\ntoo quickly\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:05.000\nand so that's why we have back problems\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nis that it would have made more sense\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.000\nfor the back to be completely straight\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nbut we figured out ways to sort of go around that\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nNo, no, no, no, we disagree about this\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nSo is all of anthropological society\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nThat's the beautiful thing about it\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nYou can't get a straight answer about this\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nThere is no straight answer\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nBut here's an answer that's kind of interesting\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nabout how we were around\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nHomosapiens\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nWe were around\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nThat word cracks me up\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nHomosapiens were around at the same time\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nas Neanderthals\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nand Neanderthals they discovered were actually\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nmore intelligent, like by brain mass\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nversus body weight, which is really how you do it\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nThey had religion first\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nThey dug up the Neanderthals\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nInterestingly, they did not have creativity\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nThat's where we were the ones making cave paintings\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nand then language and the written word\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nand then scud the disposable assassin\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nturn 20\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nAnd it was that\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nthat gene for creativity that allowed us\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nto like wipe out the Neanderthals basically\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nbecause we could pass along what we learned\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nBut I think it's an incredibly\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nimportant thing to also\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nlike Neanderthals\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nthey\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:19.000\nthey couldn't find\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nany Cro-Magnon burial sites\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nthat had any\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nburial sites, period\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nNeanderthals, there were burial sites\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\neverywhere and with all of them\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nlike items\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nwhich indicates like\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nsome kind of connection to\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nthe concept of death\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nof death\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nwhich is so interesting when you think about like\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nCro-Magnons were creating like these\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nwe hunted them to extinction, I say we\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nlike hey, we\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nwe're the Packers\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nThat's exactly\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nthat's such a great, we hunted Neanderthals\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nto extinction because we basically\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\ncreated like ranged weapons\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nlike we\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nstarted throwing shit at things\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nMaybe Scott gave it to them and they were so enthralled\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nin how good it was\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nthat then we murdered them\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nBut it's interesting the idea that yes\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nalso there is no Neanderthal as far as\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nwe know it, there's no Neanderthal cave\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\npaintings that Cro-Magnons were\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nstarting to like so\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nthis is what really disturbs me\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nthe idea that it's possible to be creative\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nbut have no emotional\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nattachment to people who die\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\nwhich is like a sociopathic\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nwe know a lot of artists like this\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nthe Cro-Magnons were very creative and a lot of their sitcoms were very funny\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nbut they didn't\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nthey wanted to reach a lot of people\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nbut they didn't give a fuck if

fucked right\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nwell I don't think crow magnans and homo sapiens\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nwere together at the same time\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nwhat's the difference between homo sapiens\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nand crow magnans\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nwe're all missing very important pieces of information\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nlike phd\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nthe homo sapiens\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nthe homo sapiens just make shit up\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nthis is what we have creativity\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nhomo sapiens have podcasts\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nand fucking overzealous\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nI feel like\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nwhat makes sense is that they were fucking\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nthat's probably it\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nwhich one of them\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nhad brown toe burgers\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nwhich one of them had cars that would tip over\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nif the ribs were too big\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nthat would have been interesting\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:57.000\nto go back and do a Flintstones\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:59.000\nwith what we know now about those people\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nand just you know\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.000\nthe rape\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nall animals have rape by the way\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nthere's a caveman\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nyou put a comma on that\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nand then ended the sentence\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\njust what we know about the rape\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nby the way what's great about\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nFlintstones\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nI don't think it was like a lot of consenting caveman sex\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nwhat's great about Flintstones\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nis that it was animated but it still had a laugh track\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nso there's somebody drawing it and like\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nwait wait wait this is what it is\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nand then people laugh\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nreally slow\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nI'm sure the audience was animated too\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nso think about MASH\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nduring its 11 year run\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nMASH was a single

--> 58:05.000\nsingle camera but sometimes it had a\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nlaugh track and sometimes it didn't\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nit didn't in the operating room\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nthat was the distinction they made\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nwhen you're operating on it\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nI mean that's not a joke\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nthey're still

ever heard\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nit's going to be funny\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nwe're not going to\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nwe're going to keep some of this stuff and keep slave\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nbut it's going to be fun\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nit can only run 12 seasons though\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nit's limited\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nit can

man\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nand then they did\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nand then my\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nI was the young man\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nnot so funny Mitch\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nget a cheese\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\ncome on guys don't treat me like I'm a fucking\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nSchrab over here\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nMitch what was your rank on Golden Girls\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nso well here's the\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nGolden Girls was low level I think got up to producer\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nwhich sounds high level\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nI know it sounds like it\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nbut then\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nyou were overlord on the rest of development\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nunderlord\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nJack Lord\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nno so there's a\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nI know\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nthis is the rehearsal right\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nwhen do we do the actual\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nso anyway they have the Golden Girls\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nthree of the Golden Girls\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nB. Leaves\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nthe Donald Lover of the Golden Girls\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nand I was suggesting\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nthey bring in like Tony Randall\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nor something like that\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nbut they said no we have a better idea\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nand the idea was the Golden Girls are broke\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nright they have no money so\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nthey buy a 30 million dollar hotel\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nthey're silver girls\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nthey buy a 30 million dollar hotel\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nin Miami and then they have to\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nyou know they have to clean the rooms themselves\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nand that kind of thing because they just spent that 30 million\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nbut it was the\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nthree remaining Golden Girls\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nso it was like faulty towers meets Golden Girls\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nright with Don Cheadle\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nMeshack Taylor\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nyes in a funny way right\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nand Cheech Marin\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nno\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nI like that\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nthis actually sounds great so far\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nthat's it we did a whole season of that\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nDon Cheadle\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nin that super real Don Cheadle way saying\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nokay now hold on girls wait a second\n\n01:03:55.000 -->

you\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nthat sounds ahead of its time\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nbecause I immediately thought of Meshack Taylor\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nwho but then realized\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\noh no that's not Golden Girls\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nthat's Designing Women which is so many years later\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nand still the black guy in your sitcom\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nhad to be in that case\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nI think he was playing a gay guy\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nbut he was certainly like he was very\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nin Golden Palace\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nno no no Designing Women\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nlike\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nit's been a long time coming\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nfor black people on sitcoms\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nit's either like you're doing black sitcoms\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nand it's like hey it's Uncle Martin's place\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nor\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nit's like you're a white sitcom\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nwe have not learned how to do sitcoms together\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nwell in fairness\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nit's because\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nwhite people kind of have no right\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nto make black people funny\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nyou know it really almost comes down\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nyou can make them dumb\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nyou can make them smart\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nanything is kind of offensive right\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nwhen it comes from\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nthat red fox\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nduring Sanford and Sun who wanted to get rid of all\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nthe white writers\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nand so he had a whole African American writing team\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nand then they had a table read\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nand at the end of it he yelled\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nbring me my juice\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nwhich is a great way to look at\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nit's like in my juice\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nit's a great way to split the difference between white and black\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nit's white\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nlike you know like\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nthere's a historic significance to that idea\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nare you Jewish?\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nyeah I'm Jewish\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nwhich comes up\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nevery time you know I take a bath\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nI'm confronted with that\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nwith this fucking giant\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nblackness monster room size\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nbut there's a historic significance\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nto the idea that in the\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nold days entertainment\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nalong with handling money\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nand garments and all this stuff\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nthat became stereotypical\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nthat was\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nbeneath the upper class\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nwe're not going to handle that\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nbanking you know all that stuff\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nbut the idea that entertainment\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nwas considered one of that it's dirty\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nit's pornographic basically\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nbefore there was pornography\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nentertainment was pornographic\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nthe idea of making movies\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nthat's why there's such a heavy tradition\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nof like\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nJewish fellows\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nthey\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nthey go where they stick\n\n01:06:27.000 -->

01:11:49.000\nwe've talked about this before but it's like\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nobviously Christianity took this route that was like\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nholy shit let's\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\ntake over the world\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nlet's have a Ronald McDonald\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nand let's have a corporate headquarters\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nand let's franchise\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nand let's have pretty low requirements\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nfor our

decide what happens to you\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nbut whatever you want\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nand I think people who fetishize Judaism\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nideologically like I do\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nwhat you're fetishizing is the idea of keeping\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nit in the community which has\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nobvious benefits like it's so amazing\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nthe idea of a religion that actually\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\ndeals with your neighbor\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nwhich it should the idea that\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nyou and the people that live near us do\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nyou could say that or you could say it's just piggybacking on\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nour natural proclivity to do that\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nwhat do you mean? well we're very social creatures\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nright?\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nthat's why your religion should do that\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nbut it kind of\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nit's like how a hypnotist holds the watch above\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nyour eyes and then says you're getting sleepy\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nand you're actually just looking up\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nand you're hearing you're getting sleepy and your eyes are\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nkind of getting tired right but don't you

he might\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nend up molesting a Hooters waitress\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nwith that power\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nor\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nI don't think you'd have to hypnotize them too\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nor if he's\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\na hypnotherapist he might use that power\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nto make a husband and wife\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nbut that\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nhas nothing to do\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nif you're saying that

01:13:25.000\nof the religion saying to the magician\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nlike and by the way don't finger\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nthat little boy\n\n01:13:29.000 -->

01:23:17.000\nare about fearing death\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nstaying away from death and in a way\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nand about our anxiety about causing it\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nyes exactly and I think\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nthat's why it's an opiate\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nwhat religion does is\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nremove you from that and Islam is always about\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nbody and spirit are two very different things\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nspirit is good, body is bad\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nand I think that's when religion can get harmful\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nwell body and spirit gets tricky\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nthat's where it gets tricky it also gets tricky\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nbecause you don't just define yourself\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nof what you are but by what you aren't\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nin opposition so\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\na lot of the problems that we have with\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nthe biggest problem of religion is\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nIslam well we're right but also\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nthat means that they're wrong so we should fix\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nthat and that's where the problems come\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nin I think also religion is good because\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nyou don't want everyone negotiating their own\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nmorality you know like it's good\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nI think everyone in this room would probably\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nagree that the big\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nproblem point\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000\ncomes when oh now\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nwe agree now we now we believe in some\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nkind of afterlife\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nand then politicians on\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nearth here and now start selling\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nyou stakes in that\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\neven if it's just by telling you oh\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nit's cool that you're poor the poorer\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nyou stay the richer you're\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\ngoing to be later that's\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\ncomplete horseshit I don't think that\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nit's this afterlife concept\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nI think it's very harmful\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nincredibly because I don't\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nI mean the idea of\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nthe messages behind religion that I've read\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nhave to do with how you should live your life\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nright now none of them say curl up in a\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nball and hang out for 40 years\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nand then die by saber-tooth tiger\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nand then tap dance\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000\nin the heaven with gishmahgas\n\n01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nbut they're not ever about being good for\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nbeing good sick it's all about\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nthe reward or the punishment like\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nIslam has to go to heaven\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nthey say a lot of stuff but the people that play it up\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nfor profit those are the people\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nthat are that fuck things up\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nfor the nice people but it's not even just\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nand ironically they won't go to hell\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nbecause there is\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nprobably because that would be\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000\na silly waste of spiritual resources\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nI mean really honestly\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nwould it just be loaded with bad animals\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000\ntoo or is it just people\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nwhere do the bunnies go\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nwe had a very in Islam it's very\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nspecific it's like a hellraiser kind of hell\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nlike if you listen to music when I was\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000\na little kid we were told that they would pour\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nmolten lead in your ears in hell\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nand I remember listening to Michael Jackson's smooth\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\ncriminal and being like I'm in trouble\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nbecause this song is so good\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nthere's gotta be a point though where you'd be like\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\noh molten lead I don't care because that's the other thing\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nabout hell is that it's eternal\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nyou're like eight that's all that matters\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nis not getting molten lead in your ears\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nthe thing that scares me about the concept of\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nhell was one of the smartest guys I ever knew\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nmy high school dungeon master\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nGraham Cummings\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nhe explained he said well\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nyou know when you die\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nyour last thought\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nthe time it takes for you to think it\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nis relative\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nso for
