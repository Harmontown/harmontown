WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.080
There we go. Welcome, one and all, from Hollywood, California, Meltdown, Comics, Nerd, Melty,

00:16.080 --> 00:30.720
Theater, Harmontown is now in session. Don't be alarmed that I'm not wearing a tie tonight,

00:30.720 --> 00:51.880
just think we're going to get loose. Speaking of loose, let's bring out Spencer Crittenden. Solo

00:51.880 --> 01:08.520
cups down. Speaking of tights, let's bring out Mr. Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmontown.

01:08.520 --> 01:26.840
Thank you for coming to my show. Thank you, I know you could have done something else

01:26.840 --> 01:43.960
for me. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, I really thank you, I'm full

01:43.960 --> 01:50.520
of gratitude for you. Also, I should mention, special vocal guest, Jello Biafra, tonight,

01:50.520 --> 02:00.200
was fantastic. Not familiar with his style. You sounded just like him. Yeah, I think our

02:00.200 --> 02:07.880
guest tonight is, he's a writer, and he wrote a movie, I'm not introducing him yet, it sounds

02:07.880 --> 02:13.840
like an introduction, but he wrote a movie, I was just watching an iTunes, it's the Stanford

02:13.840 --> 02:21.480
prison experiment. To feel good film. I think just talking to him about writing and talking

02:21.480 --> 02:26.040
about that movie and all of the thoughts about that is like enough, like I don't need to

02:26.040 --> 02:29.920
babble too much, I don't have anything that wouldn't fit within the context of a conversation

02:29.920 --> 02:33.600
with him. I say you and I and Spencer, we catch up briefly, we talk about where we're

02:33.600 --> 02:39.600
at. Do we do business? We have some business to talk about, we have some important business.

02:39.600 --> 02:46.240
I haven't picked up my gun yet. Ten day waiting period has turned into two months of normalization

02:46.240 --> 02:50.000
on my part, apparently I'm normalizing. So someone's going to break into your house and

02:50.000 --> 02:53.480
you're going to be like, oh Jesus Christ, I got a run to Burbank to get to that gun store.

02:53.480 --> 02:57.960
It would be the story of my life, I had Batman security cameras installed all over my house,

02:57.960 --> 03:04.440
and then I was part of some weird, lost village. When he says Batman security cameras, they

03:04.440 --> 03:09.560
have little bats on it, like the under-oos of security cameras. And then I was, my

03:09.560 --> 03:16.400
mailbox was part of some lost feel as wide, wet bandits, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, mailbox

03:16.400 --> 03:23.880
raiding, where some two guys wanted to look at my piles of furniture catalogs really bad.

03:23.880 --> 03:30.840
Also, I could have had them on camera, I could have, but whatever. Yes, of course, someone's

03:30.840 --> 03:37.960
going to break in before I get my gun, so I don't get to deliciously shoot them. I can't,

03:37.960 --> 03:44.120
I don't. But in a pre-Trump universe, if somebody was just like breaking into your

03:44.120 --> 03:47.240
house because they were poor and needed the money, you'd probably say, hey, take what

03:47.240 --> 03:51.040
you want, but now you're going to feel like you're under siege. I think it's more like

03:51.040 --> 04:00.440
in a post-Trump universe, if someone's breaking in, I'm going to go, are you just poor? Are

04:00.440 --> 04:07.280
you just out of food and money? And I'll wait for, yes. You've just told everyone to listen

04:07.280 --> 04:11.240
to the show how to break into your house without being shot.

04:11.240 --> 04:17.280
Well, the timbre of your voice is going to matter. You better be able to fake a very

04:17.280 --> 04:25.920
authentic Latino sounding. You're not allowed to be offended by that because I'm saying

04:25.920 --> 04:36.080
I won't shoot you if you're Latino. That's the opposite of racism. It's reverse racism.

04:36.080 --> 04:48.040
That's fantastic. If you sound white, I will fucking pop a cap in you. And white people

04:48.040 --> 04:57.040
don't act like you don't, sound different when you're coming through a window. White

04:57.040 --> 05:03.800
people come in your window like this. Can I have a cup of sugar? Anyways.

05:03.800 --> 05:09.840
Black people come through your window. It's in the way that you use it. They love Eric

05:09.840 --> 05:20.480
Clapton, black people. Enty? Okay. Enty nodded. All right. Where was I? Where was I? You

05:20.480 --> 05:23.640
were saying that all Latinos are poor and white people are rich.

05:23.640 --> 05:34.560
I was saying that our brothers of a different color are under threat and in a post-Trump

05:34.560 --> 05:45.040
apocalypse universe, my gun has been purchased for the sanctity of guarding my Danadoo. Not

05:45.040 --> 05:56.800
so much from the Huypilloy as from the assertors of a newfound fascist state.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.320
You haven't had a desire to go scoop up this gun and take it out to the range?

05:59.320 --> 06:02.840
Because I've been like, well, he's not doing very good at taking over everything. He's

06:02.840 --> 06:08.280
having a bad time. He seems to be doing as badly as I would do. He's very grumpy and

06:08.280 --> 06:14.480
he's self-destructing. I don't think the gun will be needed to protect my home because

06:14.480 --> 06:20.040
I think that the ice caps will melt. I think I should go shopping for a canoe paddle before.

06:20.040 --> 06:24.040
What would you have to see on Twitter or here in your news alerts that made you get right

06:24.040 --> 06:28.200
into a car and get to the gun shop? I would have to see CNN's Brian Stelter would have

06:28.200 --> 06:39.760
to say, another great day. Trump Hile. The leader is good. The leader is all.

06:39.760 --> 06:46.920
Yeah. I'm keeping my eye on the journalists, the activists, the prominent folks. I'm keeping

06:46.920 --> 06:52.280
my eye on certain buoys. If I see them go like this, I'm like, okay, the Jaws shark

06:52.280 --> 06:57.960
is here. I don't know. I got to go pick up the gun. What are we talking about? Don't

06:57.960 --> 07:03.080
worry, kids. I'm going to get my gun. You've just told a couple million people that you're

07:03.080 --> 07:08.560
currently unarmed at home right now. And if you ask for sugar, you can go right through

07:08.560 --> 07:15.120
the window. You just fuck that up. You just, I know if you ask for sugar, you're white

07:15.120 --> 07:21.040
and I will fucking kill you. Oh, well, okay. You told, you told Latinos that they could

07:21.040 --> 07:25.840
ask for sugar and go through the window if they could put on a nice fucking it up. No,

07:25.840 --> 07:29.520
if you're white and you don't want to get shot, go, I, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, when

07:29.520 --> 07:36.840
you're coming in the window. If anything, I'm trying to, yes, and his fucked up racist

07:36.840 --> 07:46.560
point of view. I'm here. I really have gone too far tonight. I'm not going to be, it's

07:46.560 --> 07:51.760
fucked up to like what you do. You antagonize and you, on our cut, you sabotage. It's fun

07:51.760 --> 07:55.800
to fuck with you. I try to get up here and I try to speak my mind and try to share my

07:55.800 --> 07:59.840
thoughts with people and you're like, what about this? What about that? And I'm like,

07:59.840 --> 08:03.520
what are you talking about? What are you talking about? And then I try to explain myself and

08:03.520 --> 08:11.520
you're like, aha, like, am I your enemy? These kids need wisdom. They need to know what

08:11.520 --> 08:23.520
color they're allowed to be if they're coming in my window. The answer is less than white.

08:23.520 --> 08:37.560
I mean, I'll let the audience handle that one. I think it's, I think it's more embarrassing

08:37.560 --> 08:41.520
the amount of time someone said less than white and then I went less than white and

08:41.520 --> 08:49.840
then the whole audience went, whoa. My white audience was like, bingo. We are, we are

08:49.840 --> 09:01.520
institutionally racist. Yeah, less than white. What are you going to do? It's how we see

09:01.520 --> 09:07.560
the world. Fragility, we were talking about tonight and the ride over here. The thing

09:07.560 --> 09:13.800
that made me buy a gun, the thing that I have in common with the people that we would probably,

09:13.800 --> 09:19.800
I'm assuming most of us liberal, would associate with our so-called enemy on the other side

09:19.800 --> 09:24.000
of the political spectrum. The thing we have in common, the thing that I have in common,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.600
speak for myself is like fragility, the fact that I experienced things not going my way

09:28.600 --> 09:33.640
and then I went and bought fucking hardware that puts holes in people because it was like

09:33.640 --> 09:38.120
no matter, no matter the Al Gore's and dangling chads and the whatever is in the primaries

09:38.120 --> 09:44.040
and all this shit, I had the luxury of going like systems. And then, and like something

09:44.040 --> 09:48.240
real happened that made me actually think this is going to change my schedule. This

09:48.240 --> 09:52.760
is going to change how I have to behave next Tuesday. I'm going to be held accountable

09:52.760 --> 09:57.680
to something and I went and bought a gun. It's called fragility and it doesn't matter

09:57.680 --> 10:01.440
how right you are, how wrong you are, how smart you are, how logical you are. It's

10:01.440 --> 10:05.800
like it's a thing that's associated with privilege. You've been privileged. You're

10:05.800 --> 10:12.680
more fragile. You're going to be more reacting to things that are on a smaller scale than

10:12.680 --> 10:18.800
somebody who's maybe put up with shit and had to be desensitized to it and realized

10:18.800 --> 10:23.640
that, oh, there's a pick your battles thing or whatever you would call it. And it's like,

10:23.640 --> 10:27.360
that's what we're learning firsthand. All of that talk, all that white privilege, all

10:27.360 --> 10:32.000
that stuff that I would get offended by and be like, well, wait a minute, hold on a second.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.360
It's not logical. See, there's nothing logical about it. It's like a gut reaction. You find

10:36.360 --> 10:43.260
out what you're made of and it turns out to be glass, beautiful, pristine fucking sugar

10:43.260 --> 10:49.880
glass as soon as something goes wrong that fucks up with your picture of the universe.

10:49.880 --> 10:57.040
I bought a gun. I turned into a fucking Sandy Hook truther. In terms of my behavior, I was

10:57.040 --> 10:58.360
just like, I want my gun.

10:58.360 --> 11:03.200
Yeah, we could have seen some bodies if that really happened, right?

11:03.200 --> 11:09.200
We've waited this long to share with you something special about Spencer.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
No, and you already like me. It's too late.

11:11.200 --> 11:19.200
I have to say, you already signed off on Spencer. He's a Sandy Hook truther.

11:19.200 --> 11:24.200
If there's any person in podcast history that could maybe get you to sign off on that,

11:24.200 --> 11:25.200
would it have to be Spencer?

11:25.200 --> 11:31.200
Spencer talked long enough, like five minutes, I'd be like, all right, maybe I guess, why

11:31.200 --> 11:36.200
was that corner acting so weird?

11:36.200 --> 11:40.920
I went down a Sandy Hook hole today because I was listening to true crime podcasts and

11:40.920 --> 11:45.200
then there was mention of Sandy Hook and then there was reference. When Sandy Hook happened,

11:45.200 --> 11:52.200
I was probably doing community and I was probably also just like the gross, you don't want to

11:52.200 --> 11:59.200
know about it, like most of us, but now it's interesting. It's like the magma's cooled and

11:59.200 --> 12:02.200
the stakes seem so much higher in this different spot.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.200
And it's like all these things are like, so from a true crime perspective, Sandy Hook

12:06.200 --> 12:10.200
gets mentioned and I started like, they started mentioning like the thing.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.200
I just started the today of all days.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.200
I like went there. I was like, what was all that business?

12:15.200 --> 12:19.200
Why were people thinking it was fake and what was going on?

12:19.200 --> 12:25.200
And as I was going through it, I thought it was really interesting to note that like,

12:25.200 --> 12:31.200
it wasn't just like, it was like, you had to be a whack job to think that it was fake,

12:31.200 --> 12:36.200
but you also, excuse me, I burped, you have to, you also had to be a whack job who was

12:36.200 --> 12:43.200
absolutely convinced that Obama was like Hitler, like he was going to get you.

12:43.200 --> 12:48.200
He was going to, you know, and I would personally speculate that that absolutely,

12:48.200 --> 12:54.200
given the total lack of empirical evidence that Obama was going to get us, like I have to,

12:54.200 --> 12:59.200
I'm sorry to play this card, but I have to assume you're a little itty bitty racist

12:59.200 --> 13:02.200
if you really thought from the moment that he got inaugurated that you're like,

13:02.200 --> 13:04.200
shit's going down.

13:04.200 --> 13:09.200
Because if you weren't, if you didn't have that, I think it comes down to that.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.200
I do also think it came down to something other than emails,

13:12.200 --> 13:17.200
why you were choosing with all your logical fucking things,

13:17.200 --> 13:20.200
all your speeches that you made about why you're voting this way and that way,

13:20.200 --> 13:24.200
you know, your very salient points about the status quo and how to shake things up

13:24.200 --> 13:30.200
and all these things like, you don't like the vagina, you don't like the black people.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.200
Because I think there's other ways to rebel.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.200
But what am I going to do? What am I going to say to some kid who's like,

13:36.200 --> 13:38.200
I'm going to stir things up.

13:38.200 --> 13:43.200
But I just thought it was very interesting looking at three-year-old like cooled obsidian,

13:43.200 --> 13:49.200
like people freaking out and recognizing the distorted shape of myself,

13:49.200 --> 13:54.200
like seeing people that were so hysterical,

13:54.200 --> 13:59.200
that were so convinced that they were living in the end times politically,

13:59.200 --> 14:05.200
that in the very real moment of two dozen children being massacred,

14:05.200 --> 14:12.200
that they would actually, that politics could interfere that greatly

14:12.200 --> 14:16.200
with your fundamental human need for empathy,

14:16.200 --> 14:21.200
that you would actually just skirt around it and start actually,

14:21.200 --> 14:25.200
you would rather just live in an alternate universe.

14:25.200 --> 14:30.200
And I don't think every single person that flocked towards those YouTube videos

14:30.200 --> 14:34.200
that are all the first thing that comes up when you Google Sandy Hook,

14:34.200 --> 14:38.200
I think those clicks aren't all the result of mental illness.

14:38.200 --> 14:43.200
I think you have to be pretty mentally ill to like put a lot of arrows and things

14:43.200 --> 14:46.200
and freeze frames and do all the things that the people that were presenting the videos,

14:46.200 --> 14:49.200
but then there's people that they wanted it to be true.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.200
And the rhetoric about the, oh, the occupier-in-chief,

14:52.200 --> 14:54.200
and oh, he just wants this and he wants that.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.200
They were living in this Wizard of Oz where there was a wicked witch

14:57.200 --> 15:00.200
and we just got to get to the Emerald City of the truth

15:00.200 --> 15:03.200
and everyone's going to get what they want as though they're trying to take away

15:03.200 --> 15:05.200
and just going to throw the bucket of water.

15:05.200 --> 15:10.200
They're just not really acknowledging the fact that what they're doing in the present moment

15:10.200 --> 15:14.200
is haranguing the parents of murdered children.

15:14.200 --> 15:19.200
And it's like we're feeling that way right now.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.200
I am feeling that way.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.200
I'm feeling the way they're feeling.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.200
That doesn't mean that I'm as crazy as them.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.200
It doesn't mean that I'm as wrong as them.

15:28.200 --> 15:38.200
But it does mean that we have the ability to fucking like just abandon all everything that makes us good

15:38.200 --> 15:42.200
when we get excited, when we get righteous and stuff.

15:42.200 --> 15:46.200
And I was like looking at my reflection of that twisted wreckage

15:46.200 --> 15:48.200
and I have no point to any of you.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.200
So I was already feeling depressed, but now you're telling me,

15:51.200 --> 15:53.200
plus on top of that, get over myself?

15:53.200 --> 15:55.200
What are you telling me?

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
I'm not saying that.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.200
I'm just saying like, I don't know, man.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.200
I watched this documentary with this guy, Darryl Davis, who's like the guy.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.200
Did you guys see that?

16:02.200 --> 16:04.200
It was like, I can't remember what the title of it is.

16:04.200 --> 16:10.200
He's like a guy who like, he befriended, he's a black guy that befriended Ku Klux Klan people.

16:10.200 --> 16:15.200
Like for years and years, he's been like, I don't have enough time to talk about it.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.200
You should watch that documentary.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.200
Find it on Netflix or whatever.

16:18.200 --> 16:23.200
And sit through it because he kind of, it's like, there's a point like 45 minutes in where you're kind of like,

16:23.200 --> 16:32.200
I get it, BB King played good guitar, but like, it feels a little bit at a certain point.

16:32.200 --> 16:36.200
Like, like for the first half, like your things are being repeated over and over again.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.200
Then he goes to Baltimore.

16:38.200 --> 16:43.200
And like he, the shit is just happening like, like crazy shit.

16:43.200 --> 16:50.200
So there's millennial activists, millennial black activists sitting down at a table with him after you've already watched the,

16:50.200 --> 16:56.200
the polite whimsy of him sitting down with leaders of the KKK and skinheads and all these things.

16:56.200 --> 17:02.200
And you take from it what you will. And then he goes to Baltimore and it's, it gets fucking balloon animal.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.200
Like, it's crazy.

17:04.200 --> 17:08.200
Like, like you just, you walk away from the whole thing, I will warn you a little sad.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.200
I mean, because it's like, fuck, we're all fucked.

17:11.200 --> 17:18.200
But, but, but it also, it's like, it's not like, like, like, oh, just watch this documentary about how we're all fucked.

17:18.200 --> 17:26.200
It's more like, watch, like, watch this documentary about Daryl Davis that like, it puts so much shit under the microscope.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
I've talked enough.

17:28.200 --> 17:33.200
And talked enough. It's my show. Fuck you people.

17:33.200 --> 17:37.200
You haven't begun to talk. This is, this is your night.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.200
I'm obviously a little buzzed or something.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.200
If your next, if your next breath was going to be bringing our guest.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
Yes, I was going to bring out our guest.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.200
Can I, can I interject one little thing?

17:46.200 --> 17:55.200
Yeah. For those of you who have been wondering that, well, whether or not the three of us, or this show would never get back to a D&D game, or a Pathfinder role-playing game.

17:55.200 --> 17:59.200
We decided not to.

17:59.200 --> 18:07.200
We decided Dan's race monologues were enough for you people.

18:07.200 --> 18:15.200
But today we've actually generated characters. We're not playing tonight, but we have, we have, we have, we have a whole thing coming up.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.200
It's going to start, it's going to be a doozy.

18:17.200 --> 18:22.200
There was a little clerical error. The characters we rolled were less than white.

18:22.200 --> 18:33.200
We're going to re-roll some stats and, and make them as much as white.

18:33.200 --> 18:37.200
Oh boy.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.200
I want this episode to be called less than white just to see what happens for you.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.200
For your, for your, for your career.

18:44.200 --> 18:59.200
I mean, if, if, if my ironic, based in reality, because I'm a generation X foot, foot and mouth asshole racism, is that if we have a crucifixion of me, just, just do it next to the White House.

18:59.200 --> 19:04.200
That's all I ask. Just like, just, and just put racist above my head.

19:04.200 --> 19:09.200
Like, like, and, and, and just like, I just demand, does everybody just fucking like spit on my corpse?

19:09.200 --> 19:15.200
And, and, and I just want anybody that works in Washington to be like, what did he do wrong? Well, he was racist.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.200
And I just want that person's lunch to change.

19:19.200 --> 19:24.200
Because they're going to be like, he was right. Fuck.

19:24.200 --> 19:33.200
I heard his podcast. He got a little tipsy sometimes, but Jesus Christ, I'm an actual, I get out there and really do the hard racist work.

19:33.200 --> 19:38.200
I did, I did like a whistle stop thing. Yeah.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.200
I bought a weird hat. I sewed some things on my shoulder.

19:41.200 --> 19:48.200
I dressed as R2D2 to leave a town hall meeting under the auspices that it was early trick or treat.

19:48.200 --> 19:53.200
All right. So our next guest is all around screenwriter, TV, movies.

19:53.200 --> 20:00.200
Like I said, his, the most recent thing I was watching, maybe he's done more than this recently. Let's talk to him and find out.

20:00.200 --> 20:19.200
Please welcome our new friend, Tim Talbot.

20:19.200 --> 20:25.200
Uh, I got your name right and everything, right? Like I didn't, I'm a bad interviewer. Just, I don't know if I told you that backstage.

20:25.200 --> 20:30.200
I'm a bad interviewer, but, but, but bad interviewee. Okay. Good. This will be great.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.200
This will be awesome. This will go great.

20:32.200 --> 20:37.200
Um, so I'm going to put a pin in like how you got started because I think your first job was South Park, right?

20:37.200 --> 20:41.200
Like, first, yeah, like real kind of professional job.

20:41.200 --> 20:45.200
Well, I mean, before that, I actually got hired to write a TV movie for MTV.

20:45.200 --> 20:49.200
Oh, okay. Hey, Tim, I'm sorry, just, just for audio here, get, get right in that microphone.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.200
Get right in there. Okay. Yeah.

20:51.200 --> 21:00.200
Um, yeah, but like the, oh yeah, you're a Spencer, does it? Yeah.

21:00.200 --> 21:07.200
Um, yeah. So like the first real sort of kind of professional, um, for a network job was for South Park.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.200
Yeah. Like you, uh, what did you send in the script?

21:10.200 --> 21:12.200
Now I said I put a pin in it, but now I'm talking about it.

21:12.200 --> 21:20.200
So you, okay. No, actually what happened was when I first moved out here right out of college, I, um, became friends with a lot of people that were people's assistants.

21:20.200 --> 21:25.200
And one of them was a woman named Amy Cohen, who was George Clooney's assistant at the time.

21:25.200 --> 21:31.200
And George was like one of the guys that sent out that first spirit of Christmas take to everyone.

21:31.200 --> 21:35.200
And so through her, I met Matt and Trey's assistant.

21:35.200 --> 21:39.200
Um, and then just for like a couple of years, I was like in their group.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.200
So I was going to all their parties and all that kind of stuff.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.200
And, um, so they never read a word of it.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.200
It was like, oh, that guy's funny. Bring him in.

21:47.200 --> 21:53.200
You're clearly confident enough that you didn't insert any fake like, and then I won a talent contest.

21:53.200 --> 21:58.200
No, it was just like, I hung out with those guys at a party and that's the way they ran their room.

21:58.200 --> 22:05.200
I, I, I, everyone's story of like, if you're paying your rent with writing, you're one of the fortunate ones.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.200
Then people ask about your origin story.

22:08.200 --> 22:13.200
How did you go from being Tony Stark to having this whole thing with the Jarvis and everything?

22:13.200 --> 22:18.200
Like, and the answer is never as satisfying as well.

22:18.200 --> 22:25.200
I got blown up by my own Schrab.el and I had an awakening of the spirit that was brought to me by a magical person that was less than white in a cave.

22:25.200 --> 22:30.200
Um, I like, we never have that story.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.200
We don't, we are not able to impart to them.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.200
How do you, you cope with that really well?

22:34.200 --> 22:41.200
Cause you just told the story that was like, I ran a, I turned, I turned, I turned right on a green light and I slipped into an appeal.

22:41.200 --> 22:46.200
Well, no, before that though, I actually, um, you know, I, I, I wanted to be an editor when I moved out here.

22:46.200 --> 22:50.200
I went to film school and, and, uh, editing was the only job that I could stand.

22:50.200 --> 22:54.200
Like everything else was just, you know, you can't ever write what exactly what you want to write.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.200
Cause you went to film school.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.200
Yeah, I did.

22:56.200 --> 23:07.200
So how did you know, did you do, and when they teach you editing in film school, did they teach you that it's going to be like, there's a person behind you over your shoulder that isn't, that isn't possible.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.200
No.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.200
They're just teaching you the crap.

23:10.200 --> 23:17.200
No, they literally, the, the thing that was really kind of cool about the school I went to was that, uh, day one, it was like a very much like a tech school.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.200
So here's a camera, go start making shit.

23:19.200 --> 23:24.200
Um, and then I found that in the process of making shit, it was so frustrating.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.200
We couldn't get good actors.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.200
We couldn't, you know, the, the cinematography was never what you wanted.

23:28.200 --> 23:34.200
And then you finally get to the point where you have to edit your film and there's a pile of shit you got to make into China.

23:34.200 --> 23:37.200
And, um, for me, that was like as creative as writing.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.200
Right, right.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.200
Um, so I, yeah, I'm like one of those.

23:40.200 --> 23:45.200
I'm sorry, you became a, you, you got into editing after being asked to be a director and a filmmaker.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.200
And you said, no, I just, I just prefer the editing part or.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.200
Well, pretty much like when you're in film school, you do everything.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.200
Okay.

23:51.200 --> 24:00.200
And, and part of my whole thing was that I figured out that, um, if I'm going to be a director, um, I have to know the limitations of everyone else's job.

24:00.200 --> 24:05.200
So you crew on everybody else's movies and, and you just kind of come to, to like what you like.

24:05.200 --> 24:10.200
But with editing, for me, it was just everything about the process up until that point was such a disappointment.

24:10.200 --> 24:16.200
That finally to be locked in a room and just be like, well, now make this into something that you were not ashamed to show to people.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.200
Right.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.200
Was cool.

24:18.200 --> 24:23.200
And then when I moved to California, uh, I moved out here with like 20 bucks in my pocket and one friend from college.

24:23.200 --> 24:27.200
And I might as well have stayed on the East coast because I couldn't get my foot in the door anywhere.

24:27.200 --> 24:33.200
Um, and then I figured out that the only thing I could do without being hired to do it was to write a screenplay.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.200
Right.

24:34.200 --> 24:44.200
And, um, you know, I just started writing and got repped off the first screenplay and, and, and luckily I also met a trust fund kid from New Jersey who wanted to be a producer.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.200
Donald Trump.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.200
It was not Trump.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.200
Um, but he basically paid for me to learn how to write.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.200
So I wrote three scripts for this guy before I ever got hired for anything.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.200
That sounds familiar.

24:54.200 --> 24:58.200
I mean, I feel like I, yeah, we, we, we airbrush our backstories.

24:58.200 --> 25:04.200
Like I, I, I could get really specific about my path from Milwaukee to Los Angeles.

25:04.200 --> 25:10.200
It does involve like a little like low rent benefactors who are like, like, like, like there's like, it's, it's always very molecular and granular.

25:10.200 --> 25:19.200
Anyways, but, uh, but it's never, it's never a satisfying thing to say to a kid who's saying, how do I get where you are?

25:19.200 --> 25:20.200
Tell me.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.200
And you can never give them a straight answer.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.200
Well, there is a straight answer to that.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.200
And that's just don't leave.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.200
I mean, literally the people.

25:26.200 --> 25:30.200
You know, if you, if you literally just keep doing it, don't leave where you are.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.200
No, don't know.

25:31.200 --> 25:37.200
I'm saying if you come to California and you want to be a writer, you come to California and you keep writing and sooner or later you're going to get in.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.200
Right.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.200
There's no, there's no easy path.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.200
It's always a catch 22.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.200
Yeah.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.200
That's what, you know, always default to like, well, okay.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.200
Yeah.

25:44.200 --> 25:55.200
You just, you're going to have to like writing so much that you'd be willing to do it for 30 years and then get hit by a bus and die because I don't want your blood on my hands at the end of it.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.200
And I got to a point where I would have been fine doing that.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.200
And then all of a sudden I got lucky.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.200
All right.

26:01.200 --> 26:08.200
Anyways, but, but so, so we can talk about the early days of South Park later, but I kind of want to get to the Stanford prison experiment thing.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.200
Because I just started watching that movie.

26:10.200 --> 26:18.200
So, so I asked you in the green room, maybe we'll retread and we'll pretend I'm asking you for the first time.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.200
How accurate is this movie go?

26:20.200 --> 26:21.200
85%.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.200
It literally is.

26:23.200 --> 26:35.200
It's one of those things where, as I was telling you in the green room for years, they were trying to make this story and Hollywood in their wonderful way always like the story wasn't enough for them.

26:35.200 --> 26:39.200
They wanted to make it into more and make it into the stakes have to be life and death.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.200
It's got to be have like huge emotional stakes.

26:41.200 --> 26:52.200
You know, an earlier draft HBO was going to do that Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to that was about a guard and a prisoner that were best friends and there was a girl on the outside and a weird love triangle.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.200
And it's like, what the fuck is this?

26:54.200 --> 27:01.200
You know, and when I first got approached to work on the project, I was completely, I didn't believe it.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.200
I didn't take any psych classes in college or anything.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.200
I knew nothing about it.

27:05.200 --> 27:13.200
And I'm just like, there's nothing you can do to me that's going to make me believe after three days that, you know, a classroom with fake bars on the door is a prison I can't get out of.

27:13.200 --> 27:19.200
And it was only when I dove into sort of the research with doctors and Bardo that I realized, holy shit, this is fascinating.

27:19.200 --> 27:22.200
And this is human, this is like a real thing.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.200
So Bardo is the guy that ran the whole thing.

27:24.200 --> 27:28.200
Yeah, he's the guy that, he does not come off heroically in the movie.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.200
Not at all.

27:29.200 --> 27:36.200
But, but, but, but at the same time, it's like, you could say the same thing about DiCaprio as Howard Hughes and the aviator.

27:36.200 --> 27:40.200
He does not come off heroically and yet, but he does have a lot of urine.

27:40.200 --> 27:45.200
He's, he's a, he's the genius who thought of this experiment.

27:45.200 --> 27:49.200
And my favorite line of the movie, this isn't really a spoiler.

27:49.200 --> 28:00.200
I think this gets to the crux of why we all heard the phrase Stanford Prison Experiment in high school is, but it was like, everyone's arguing about what's going on.

28:00.200 --> 28:05.200
There's talking about the relationship between two guys, one's a prisoner, one's a guard.

28:05.200 --> 28:11.200
And then the Zimbardo character is sitting back in his hot curled hair and his Boogie Knight suit.

28:11.200 --> 28:15.200
And he, and he goes like, guys, guys, you're missing the larger point.

28:15.200 --> 28:19.200
The point is that the two guys you're talking about were separated by a coin toss.

28:19.200 --> 28:24.200
And that really was, that's why we continue to refer to the Stanford Prison Experiment.

28:24.200 --> 28:27.200
It's not because it was immaculately scientific.

28:27.200 --> 28:33.200
It's, it was, if anything, totally dramatic and fantastical.

28:33.200 --> 28:36.200
It was, they, they, they didn't, they didn't set out.

28:36.200 --> 28:40.200
I always pictured, I was telling you in the green room every time I heard about the Stanford Prison Experiment,

28:40.200 --> 28:45.200
which for anyone who's, you know, the headline of it that you hear about in high school is,

28:45.200 --> 28:51.200
okay, they did this college experiment where they took a group of volunteers, they made some of them randomly guards,

28:51.200 --> 28:53.200
and they made some of them randomly prisoners.

28:53.200 --> 29:01.200
And what happened over time very quickly is that they fell into roles of abusiveness that, that transcended any rules that they were given.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.200
The guards were abusive to the prisoners.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.200
The prisoners were abusive to each other.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.200
Abuse, abuse, abuse, abuse.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.200
It all happened even though it was all a big game.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.200
It just happened for real.

29:11.200 --> 29:21.200
And even as the movie represents, it, it spread upward to Zimbardo who started acting like the prison warden,

29:21.200 --> 29:28.200
started becoming paranoid about one of the escaped prisoners coming back to, but, you know, like he began,

29:28.200 --> 29:35.200
he himself became part of the experiment because it wasn't science, it was art, and it was, but it was very valid art

29:35.200 --> 29:43.200
that you could refer to very scientifically when you say, yeah, but circumstances fuck you up.

29:43.200 --> 29:52.200
If you're deprived of your freedom in any way, you are, you begin to behave like someone that is not free,

29:52.200 --> 29:56.200
and you start verifying all of these negative expectations of yourself.

29:56.200 --> 30:02.200
If you are given privilege and power, you start overreacting to threats to it,

30:02.200 --> 30:07.200
because you think that someone dropping a pencil means that you should go fuck yourself,

30:07.200 --> 30:11.200
and that you, you start seeing the merits and coming down hard and drawing a line in the sand,

30:11.200 --> 30:16.200
and it starts with guys going, why am I talking so much? You're on the show.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.200
What did you, what was your process like when you're getting this job?

30:19.200 --> 30:23.200
Like, I want to hear about the, like, like how much, how much reading did you have to do to write this screenplay?

30:23.200 --> 30:28.200
Well, I had to do a lot. I got all of, you know, we had, you know, Zimbardo's life rights,

30:28.200 --> 30:31.200
and he was open to us, so I got to talk to him whenever I needed to.

30:31.200 --> 30:35.200
I interviewed him and his wife together and separately.

30:35.200 --> 30:39.200
He sent me all the original paperwork from the experiment that they, they documented everything.

30:39.200 --> 30:42.200
I mean, everybody, that's one thing, you know, there's so much happened in those six days

30:42.200 --> 30:45.200
that you can't put it all in a movie.

30:45.200 --> 30:51.200
But one of the things they did is they had a standard set of questions that they asked all the prisoners every day.

30:51.200 --> 30:56.200
And you could just see them, you know, through, when you read this stuff, it's fascinating that they are being dehumanized.

30:56.200 --> 31:02.200
And even there's a bit in the movie where they're asked to write a letter home after two days,

31:02.200 --> 31:06.200
and half of the kids signed their number and not their name.

31:06.200 --> 31:10.200
Because it had been drilled into them so much over the previous couple of days.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.200
Because they thought they would get rebuked because their mail would be gone through,

31:13.200 --> 31:15.200
and they would, like, they'd get in trouble for not doing that?

31:15.200 --> 31:17.200
Well, they knew their mail would be gone through.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.200
No, they knew it would be gone through because they were not allowed to seal their envelopes.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.200
They had to hand them back, so they were going to be read.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.200
So they became a number just in case?

31:23.200 --> 31:29.200
Yeah, I think it was just more that the indoctrination of the first couple of days really started to work on them.

31:29.200 --> 31:34.200
When you're referred to as a number and not a name, over and over again, and you're sleep deprived,

31:34.200 --> 31:39.200
and you have to, like, rattle off your number a thousand times a day, it was just easier.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.200
It became sort of their identity.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.200
So you worked and met Zimbardo?

31:43.200 --> 31:44.200
Oh, yeah.

31:44.200 --> 31:50.200
And how does he look back on this, and what's it like having this rehashed through?

31:50.200 --> 31:56.200
Well, the good thing about him is that he absolutely 100% owns it.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
You know, he's like, I realized I fucked up.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.200
I fucked up by making myself part of the experiment.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.200
And it really took, you know, I mean, if you've seen the movie,

32:03.200 --> 32:08.200
it took someone from the outside coming in to really say,

32:08.200 --> 32:11.200
hey, you guys are totally fucking up here.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.200
You have to stop this, because nobody else saw it.

32:13.200 --> 32:17.200
They just saw, wow, we're getting a really cool, this is a real study.

32:17.200 --> 32:21.200
It's we're getting real information and didn't realize that they were hurting people in the process.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.200
But now, wait a minute.

32:23.200 --> 32:28.200
I mean, and I confess, I forgot about a Harmontown meeting that was happening at my house,

32:28.200 --> 32:30.200
so I haven't actually watched the end of the movie.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.200
So spoilers.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.200
I haven't gotten to the third act yet.

32:32.200 --> 32:36.200
The story we hear in high school is the experiment got out of control,

32:36.200 --> 32:41.200
but much like Frankenstein's experiment, mythically,

32:41.200 --> 32:46.200
the thing that made it a disaster is the valuable thing about it.

32:46.200 --> 32:50.200
I mean, does Zimbardo, does he look at it as like, yeah,

32:50.200 --> 32:52.200
that thing I did that was like groundbreaking,

32:52.200 --> 32:56.200
or is the whole thing just a cautionary tale and a carrion tragedy?

32:56.200 --> 32:57.200
I think it's closer to that.

32:57.200 --> 33:02.200
I think that one of the things is that when you first start reading about it and not talking to him directly,

33:02.200 --> 33:04.200
it's got its own life out there.

33:04.200 --> 33:09.200
He's got his own like media life and the media and reporters and stuff

33:09.200 --> 33:15.200
have built him up to be this guy that designed this experiment to generate that response.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.200
Right.

33:16.200 --> 33:20.200
Where the actual fact was he didn't expect anything from this.

33:20.200 --> 33:24.200
This was no different than any other experiment that they'd been doing at Stanford,

33:24.200 --> 33:28.200
other than the fact that it was a 24-hour day experiment and it was going to go for two weeks.

33:28.200 --> 33:31.200
What kind of data do you think he thought he was going to get?

33:31.200 --> 33:35.200
There's a clear point in your narrative where it's like, oh, shit, this is,

33:35.200 --> 33:40.200
and then the eyes get big, but what kind of data in his mind, like...

33:40.200 --> 33:45.200
I think, well, part of the Navy were one of the people that funded the experiment

33:45.200 --> 33:52.200
and they wanted to know what kind of mental effects incarceration would have on people like in submarines.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.200
How were they going to measure it, though?

33:54.200 --> 33:58.200
Like, were they going to have them recite the alphabet at the end of each day?

33:58.200 --> 34:03.200
No, I think a lot of it was just that daily questions that they had to answer.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.200
How much did he go in with...

34:05.200 --> 34:08.200
Did he have like a sociological point to prove going in?

34:08.200 --> 34:12.200
He thought he might be able... Like, you ever see the 7-up documentaries?

34:12.200 --> 34:14.200
The 7 and up?

34:14.200 --> 34:16.200
You watched the beginning of that.

34:16.200 --> 34:20.200
You kind of feel like he was going in trying to prove class things.

34:20.200 --> 34:22.200
Then it turns into something very different.

34:22.200 --> 34:24.200
Do you think he came in with a sociological point of view on this,

34:24.200 --> 34:28.200
or he really just said, let's just get raw, unadulterated data?

34:28.200 --> 34:33.200
I think he just basically wanted to see what...

34:33.200 --> 34:41.200
Basically, what he learned from it, I think, is what he was looking for, which is how the environment can change people.

34:41.200 --> 34:48.200
He constantly says, the whole idea about prisons is there are no bad apples, there are just bad barrels.

34:48.200 --> 34:51.200
So if you have an inherently... Because all these kids were inherently good,

34:51.200 --> 34:55.200
they were all screened to be all American normal kids.

34:55.200 --> 34:57.200
They all went through the movie. There's one Asian guy.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.200
There's one Asian guy.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.200
Is that based on reality?

35:00.200 --> 35:02.200
Yeah, that's based on reality.

35:02.200 --> 35:06.200
Was that just a sort of... When was this?

35:06.200 --> 35:07.200
This was in 1971.

35:07.200 --> 35:11.200
So was that just sort of like, oh, black kids aren't college kids?

35:11.200 --> 35:13.200
What was at play there?

35:13.200 --> 35:17.200
I honestly can't tell you except that this took place in August of 1971.

35:17.200 --> 35:21.200
I would say in Stanford at 71, that might have been a good representation of the student body.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.200
But these weren't Stanford students.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.200
Not all of them. Some of them were.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.200
But it was just an ad place in the paper.

35:26.200 --> 35:31.200
But it was during the summer, so a lot of kids that were still there for the summer came in and interviewed.

35:31.200 --> 35:35.200
And they interviewed quite a few people to find the 24 or whatever.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.200
But did you start... I kind of railroaded your answer.

35:38.200 --> 35:45.200
The faces that we see on screen and the ethnic spectrum that they represent, is that...

35:45.200 --> 35:46.200
That's accurate.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.200
Okay.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.200
So there was like one like...

35:48.200 --> 35:52.200
There was one Asian student and then one of the...

35:52.200 --> 35:56.200
Well, obviously Carlo Prescott, the guy that they brought into advise,

35:56.200 --> 36:00.200
was a black man who was in prison for 17 years before this.

36:00.200 --> 36:04.200
And then one of Zimbardo's grad assistants, a grad student, was also a black guy.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.200
Yeah.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.200
And he initiated...

36:06.200 --> 36:07.200
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting.

36:07.200 --> 36:11.200
Yeah, I mean, the more would be spoilers, I think, because the narrative...

36:11.200 --> 36:17.200
But you already know the real life story is that the experiment got out of control.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.200
But what I've always felt about hearing that,

36:19.200 --> 36:25.200
because I've probably referred to the Stanford Prison Experiment a thousand times in 20 years

36:25.200 --> 36:30.200
when talking about politics or anything, talking about particularly fascism,

36:30.200 --> 36:36.200
is like, well, it's a successful experiment, not from a scientific perspective,

36:36.200 --> 36:41.200
but from the fact that someone once did this thing.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.200
And it turned out...

36:42.200 --> 36:47.200
It changed the way that experimentation could be done in colleges now.

36:47.200 --> 36:51.200
I mean, literally, it's like they didn't have ethics committees back then.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.200
So ethically, this thing was one thing.

36:53.200 --> 36:58.200
Well, the Department of Justice or some government agency reviewed this whole thing.

36:58.200 --> 37:03.200
But when you say it that way, there's an unspoken supposition there

37:03.200 --> 37:13.200
that the information that came out of this experience was completely not valuable at all to future generations.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.200
No, it absolutely was.

37:14.200 --> 37:18.200
It was just that they found that the methods in which they did this were harmful.

37:18.200 --> 37:25.200
Yes. Is there a way to do an experiment like that without hurting the subjects?

37:25.200 --> 37:26.200
It doesn't seem like...

37:26.200 --> 37:27.200
Probably not.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.200
Right.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.200
But they didn't know that at the time.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.200
Well, it's more of a...

37:32.200 --> 37:35.200
But the thing is, in the movie, as it reveals, it gets a very organic process,

37:35.200 --> 37:40.200
it's like he set up a situation, he thought that the glibness of it...

37:40.200 --> 37:43.200
The thing that I always pictured was like this...

37:43.200 --> 37:51.200
Like you said, Jeff, you said like a set of an Elvis number where it's like you pictured Stanford like shelling out for fake prison cells.

37:51.200 --> 37:55.200
I pictured Yale House Rock where there was four tears of dudes dancing and...

37:55.200 --> 37:56.200
This movie takes place...

37:56.200 --> 37:58.200
If you can't find a partner, find a wooden chair.

37:58.200 --> 38:03.200
This story takes place in a hallway of Stanford College on summer break where a couple of offices,

38:03.200 --> 38:06.200
they carved the doors out and put bars in the doors.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.200
But some people were in charge of when the doors were unlocked and when they weren't.

38:09.200 --> 38:14.200
And they had burlap sacks that were like dresses, there was a deliberate attempt to feminize,

38:14.200 --> 38:20.200
which in 1971 was the equivalent of Zimbardo actually laying it out saying...

38:20.200 --> 38:25.200
Someone questions, he goes, feminize, and he's like, yes, to remove everything that they are.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.200
He's saying, you know, there's an unspoken thing there.

38:28.200 --> 38:35.200
It's like going waist deep into this thing and himself becoming infected by it, becoming the warden,

38:35.200 --> 38:41.200
losing his mind to the same extent that Sigmund Freud injecting cocaine into his own arm

38:41.200 --> 38:44.200
like did yield some shit.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.200
I mean, this is important.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.200
It's important to...

38:47.200 --> 38:48.200
No, it's definitely important.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.200
It just, again, now ethically they would not...

38:51.200 --> 38:54.200
You would not get this past any college ethics board.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.200
But it's like...

38:55.200 --> 39:01.200
But it's a case where ethics, which are the thing that are being looked at.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.200
Like the reason we're afraid...

39:03.200 --> 39:10.200
If we become really good at conducting Stanford prison experiments, we're not getting accurate data.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.200
Right.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.200
Like we're not...

39:13.200 --> 39:20.200
We don't want to become really, really good at making sure no one gets hurt during the Stanford prison experiment.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.200
We want to...

39:21.200 --> 39:28.200
Well, again, the accurate data is that if you conduct one, you become fucking Hitler overnight.

39:28.200 --> 39:34.200
If you put yourself in the position of judging what you're measuring and if the people...

39:34.200 --> 39:43.200
That everyone is intoxicated instantly by fascism, by hierarchical thinking and answering to a higher calling.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.200
Everybody dresses it in different ways.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.200
I'm here for my $15 a day.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.200
He's looking at it like, I'm going to publish a paper on this.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.200
He's not even sure what he's drinking by the time he's drunk on it.

39:54.200 --> 40:00.200
He's seeing images of students punching other students and he's thinking, I made this happen.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.200
And it's a live experiment.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.200
And it's a successful experiment.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.200
This is a live thing.

40:03.200 --> 40:09.200
And so, again, the paranoia comes in when the family members come to visit.

40:09.200 --> 40:12.200
He's terrified one of them is going to pull their kid out.

40:12.200 --> 40:18.200
To the point where there's a really great scene that Billy Crudup who plays Zimbardo in the movie

40:18.200 --> 40:24.200
handles some crud heads here.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.200
We got crud heads.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.200
We got big Zimbardo fans here.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.200
They come to every podcast.

40:29.200 --> 40:32.200
They want more Billy Crudup information.

40:32.200 --> 40:36.200
Unlike tonight, we always have to disappoint them.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.200
Shout out, Monica.

40:38.200 --> 40:46.200
One thing I will say about Billy Crudup is he has a sort of like a monologue at the end of the movie where he pulls the plug.

40:46.200 --> 40:49.200
We shot everything else before that.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.200
So all these kids have been working together for two and a half weeks.

40:52.200 --> 40:57.200
And he walked in on his first day and delivered like his last scene in the movie.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.200
And it was like, holy shit.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.200
This guy's good.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.200
Were you on the set the whole time?

41:03.200 --> 41:04.200
I wasn't.

41:04.200 --> 41:09.200
I was a writer on Chicago Fire for a couple of years and I was shooting an episode at the same time.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.200
So I was going back and forth between here and Chicago.

41:12.200 --> 41:20.200
It's true that the experiment, the Chicago Fire writing room, didn't you guys set a lot of fires in Chicago?

41:20.200 --> 41:22.200
No comment.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.200
Absolute power corrupts.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.200
Absolutely.

41:25.200 --> 41:31.200
I want to look at, because you've got a bigger career than that.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.200
We can talk about what it was like.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.200
So you were at South Park from the beginning.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.200
No.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.200
I was there for season five and six.

41:38.200 --> 41:45.200
All right, well, those are the worst seasons ever.

41:45.200 --> 41:51.200
No, but it sounded like just because of the way you're describing being friends with George Clooney and all that stuff that you were there on the very ground floor.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.200
But what was it like in those days?

41:54.200 --> 41:57.200
Were you full time?

41:57.200 --> 41:59.200
Yeah, well, I was a staff writer.

41:59.200 --> 42:07.200
So the way that they work, by the time I'd gotten there, their process had gotten to a point where basically Trey Parker was writing and directing every episode.

42:07.200 --> 42:15.200
And so they'd bring you like on a writer's retreat at the beginning of the season, you know, like we went up to Whistler and we'd ski half the day and then sit in a room.

42:15.200 --> 42:23.200
And, you know, your only real job was to be attentive to the media and like what's going on in society.

42:23.200 --> 42:27.200
So we'd sit in a room and we'd spitball stuff and then all of a sudden we'd have like five or six ideas for shows.

42:27.200 --> 42:34.200
And we come back to LA and in order to get the show done on time, they had to generate eight pages of script a day.

42:34.200 --> 42:38.200
And so Trey would go off and start these scripts and then whenever he got stuck, he'd call the writers in.

42:38.200 --> 42:43.200
And we'd just sit around, you know, you come in, they buy you lunch, you sit around a big table with some of the funniest people you've ever met,

42:43.200 --> 42:46.200
and you laugh until your face wants to fall off.

42:46.200 --> 42:51.200
And hopefully you throw something out that ends up in the show and then, you know, two days later it's on television.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.200
Right.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.200
You know, which is amazing for animation.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.200
Who else that we would know?

42:56.200 --> 42:59.200
I've had friends and Dan's had friends that have worked on that show throughout the years.

42:59.200 --> 43:02.200
Who was there back in those days that we might know?

43:02.200 --> 43:04.200
Well, Trey Parker, Matt Stone.

43:04.200 --> 43:06.200
Never heard of them.

43:06.200 --> 43:11.200
Kyle McCullough, David Goodman, Glasgow Phillips.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.200
Hack, hack, hack.

43:12.200 --> 43:15.200
No, I'm kidding.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.200
Who else?

43:16.200 --> 43:19.200
Nancy Pimentall was there for a little bit.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.200
She was there for, I worked with her for weeks.

43:21.200 --> 43:22.200
She's big with crewed up fans.

43:22.200 --> 43:26.200
Yeah.

43:26.200 --> 43:32.200
Well, that corroborates greatly with every, we do have a couple of friends here and there as the show's been on for so long.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.200
Almost everybody in LA knows, somebody that worked on South Park at some point.

43:34.200 --> 43:44.200
That is the legend, is that there's almost a feeling of guilt at how much Trey Parker is like,

43:44.200 --> 43:47.200
like he calls you in a room and then you guys talk and then you laugh and laugh,

43:47.200 --> 43:51.200
and then he, at some point he leaves the room and then he writes more script.

43:51.200 --> 43:54.200
Yeah, and those guys are there, you know, 20 hours a day.

43:54.200 --> 43:59.200
You know, we come in for two hours and laugh it up and leave, which, you know, it's a dream job.

43:59.200 --> 44:05.200
And I have to say though, when you first walk into that, I'm not necessarily first and foremost a comedy writer.

44:05.200 --> 44:08.200
You know, so I, they just thought I was funny.

44:08.200 --> 44:12.200
So that first day I'm sitting in there and half the staff are actors as well.

44:12.200 --> 44:17.200
So they were, they get up and they act out their character stuff and I'm like, I'm not that at all.

44:17.200 --> 44:23.200
And I sat there for probably the first hour of the first meeting, just going like, what am I doing here?

44:23.200 --> 44:27.200
What happened? And I realized that if you don't open your mouth and say something, they're just going to fire your ass.

44:27.200 --> 44:30.200
So I threw something out and it got a huge laugh.

44:30.200 --> 44:32.200
And then I was like, oh, that's what this job is.

44:32.200 --> 44:36.200
Now, to what extent, because this is the first time I've heard, because I've heard about those retreats.

44:36.200 --> 44:42.200
And I always imagine them with this sense of dread because they sounded like auditions.

44:42.200 --> 44:48.200
Like you went on the retreat and then some people that, that was vodka, don't worry about it.

44:48.200 --> 44:53.200
Some people that go on these retreats, everybody gets to have the time of their life.

44:53.200 --> 44:57.200
Some people going on the retreat, get the job. Some people don't.

44:57.200 --> 44:58.200
That was earlier on.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.200
You're making it sound more like you.

44:59.200 --> 45:04.200
Earlier it was more of an audition thing. By the time I was there, that was just, I came in the middle of the season.

45:04.200 --> 45:12.200
So I worked on three episodes, then went on a retreat, worked on six episodes, then went on another retreat, and worked on another six episodes.

45:12.200 --> 45:16.200
They actually generate a voluminous amount of their season on the retreat.

45:16.200 --> 45:19.200
Yeah, I mean, that's the basic structure.

45:19.200 --> 45:22.200
And it happens usually about three weeks before the season starts.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.200
So it's relatively topical.

45:24.200 --> 45:28.200
Did they structure it where you got to, as a staff writer, get your name on a script?

45:28.200 --> 45:29.200
Nope.

45:29.200 --> 45:32.200
That was later down the road?

45:32.200 --> 45:35.200
But my name's on every episode I worked on as a staff writer at the end.

45:35.200 --> 45:39.200
So that's more than almost every other television show staff writers don't even get.

45:39.200 --> 45:47.200
You don't have to say yes or no. You don't have to say which script. Is there a script that you feel very responsible for that you get a lot of stuff done on?

45:47.200 --> 45:51.200
Yeah, there was one, I'm trying to think of the name of the script.

45:51.200 --> 45:58.200
It was basically about, it grew out of a conversation between myself and Matt Stone about the Star Wars special editions.

45:58.200 --> 46:01.200
That we just fucking hated them so much.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.200
And E.T. was coming out.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.200
That's a walkie-talkie one.

46:05.200 --> 46:17.200
So right around that same time, we came up with the idea that the boys had to break into Lucasfilm or Skywalker Sound and get the print of Raiders of the Lost Ark back.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.200
Yeah, I think, oh, it's called Free Hat.

46:20.200 --> 46:24.200
That was one.

46:24.200 --> 46:31.200
And then the only other one that I can claim any responsibility for is the one where Kenny dies for real.

46:31.200 --> 46:34.200
I just thought, what would happen if we just killed him?

46:34.200 --> 46:39.200
There was a TV movie version of Brian's song that was on somewhere around there.

46:39.200 --> 46:44.200
So we just took that and made it into this whole like, oh my god, our friend is going to die.

46:44.200 --> 46:50.200
But you probably were gone by the time what Chef had to be done.

46:50.200 --> 46:52.200
Yeah, I was gone.

46:52.200 --> 47:12.200
If there should be an absolutely separate Emmy category, the complicated ratio between passion, relevance, manpower, because there's always been very few people working in that show and the speed with which they're working.

47:12.200 --> 47:22.200
And how incredibly funny and just, what words do you say?

47:22.200 --> 47:27.200
Balls out, like fucking brave, bold, like opinionated, like fuck this thing.

47:27.200 --> 47:42.200
How many of us in this room have like been swirling around with some thought in our head about some piece of pop culture or politics or something and then we get this like decidedly kind of admittedly maybe libertarian view from South Park.

47:42.200 --> 47:49.200
But it kind of like pushes us over into how to feel about something because it's done with this like grace and humor and what.

47:49.200 --> 47:56.200
The great thing about those guys and what was really intoxicating working with them is they have no tolerance for bullshit or hypocrisy.

47:56.200 --> 48:00.200
So if they see something, they have a point of view on it and they just come out and say it.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.200
They just don't give a shit.

48:01.200 --> 48:02.200
They just don't give a shit.

48:02.200 --> 48:04.200
They're just so ripe for corruption so long ago.

48:04.200 --> 48:07.200
Yeah, and they just, you know, I mean, they just haven't.

48:07.200 --> 48:16.200
I mean, you know, they're in a really wonderful place where they can do whatever they want and they've been able to because they were successful with the show right from the beginning.

48:16.200 --> 48:21.200
I feel spoiled because I only ever, like South Park's going to at some point not exist.

48:21.200 --> 48:26.200
It'll probably outlive me but the way I eat.

48:26.200 --> 48:33.200
There will be a day maybe when it's like gone and done and then there's going to be eulogies for it.

48:33.200 --> 48:37.200
Like there was for fucking whatever the hell that gossip rag was.

48:37.200 --> 48:43.200
All of a sudden we found out that it was important that, whatever, what the fuck was, Gawker was so important.

48:43.200 --> 48:46.200
Well, I imagine South Park's going to turn out to be pretty fucking important the day.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.200
It goes off air.

48:48.200 --> 49:00.200
Like I feel spoiled in the meantime because I've only ever just like randomly run back into it like an old lover and just always astounded at how still fucking funny it is.

49:00.200 --> 49:05.200
Like you just want to just like, oh, how is it still this funny?

49:05.200 --> 49:07.200
It's 48 years old.

49:07.200 --> 49:13.200
The cool thing is that they kind of mixed things up the last two seasons where they made them serialized.

49:13.200 --> 49:19.200
So as they had a storyline, I think that's the last episode I saw that ended the crescendoed in the divorce, the moving away.

49:19.200 --> 49:22.200
And I haven't watched it since because I've just spoiled South Park wise.

49:22.200 --> 49:25.200
I'm like, wow, someday I'll just be, yeah.

49:25.200 --> 49:28.200
But yeah, I mean, I've always been astounded by it.

49:28.200 --> 49:34.200
Like Cartman is probably one of the most important television characters in television.

49:34.200 --> 49:36.200
He's right up there with Archie Bunker for me.

49:36.200 --> 49:43.200
I always reference him in the same breath as Archie Bunker when you talk about like the importance of this in character.

49:43.200 --> 49:50.200
I don't mean the seasons of the episodes that don't like do it for me as much as other seasons or episodes is when they got Cartman wrong.

49:50.200 --> 49:56.200
When they got Cartman right, it made it pretty special because they made it really, really bad.

49:56.200 --> 49:58.200
Like really, really, really horrible.

49:58.200 --> 50:03.200
Right before I got there, they did the one where Cartman basically killed someone's parents and fed them to him.

50:03.200 --> 50:06.200
But that's a lot of people's favorite episodes.

50:06.200 --> 50:07.200
Scott, something must die. What's it called?

50:07.200 --> 50:08.200
Yeah, yeah.

50:08.200 --> 50:10.200
What's his last name?

50:10.200 --> 50:12.200
Scott Teneman must die.

50:12.200 --> 50:16.200
That just breaking his tears at the end.

50:16.200 --> 50:19.200
Like, oh, the sweet misery of your tears.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.200
That's a fucking doozy.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.200
If I remember that, that was all.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.200
Chevy chased his character on Community.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.200
Well, that was all it was ever doing.

50:28.200 --> 50:29.200
It was just ripping off Cartman.

50:29.200 --> 50:37.200
It was just the idea was like, well, there is a character who's just like, he's the voice of that petty child within you.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.200
But that includes talking to God.

50:39.200 --> 50:44.200
Like God is somebody that's going to ground you, make you take a time out.

50:44.200 --> 50:49.200
We have a word for someone that responds to God saying that with fuck you.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.200
That word is sometimes hero.

50:51.200 --> 51:00.200
Mythic on a mythic level to say fuck you to mortality, to say fuck you to the way you got out of bed in the morning.

51:00.200 --> 51:04.200
It's often the face of privilege and oppression and bigotry.

51:04.200 --> 51:08.200
But then every once in a while, it's like, yeah, don't go gentle into that good night.

51:08.200 --> 51:14.200
We root for Cartman because he's safely in the package of a reprehensible troll.

51:14.200 --> 51:23.200
But we get to like sap some of that toxin just enough to dab on our tongue and like get high a little bit because it's like in a safe container.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.200
And we've been learning that.

51:24.200 --> 51:26.200
I don't know if you heard me babbling.

51:26.200 --> 51:28.200
I was talking to the Daryl Davis documentary.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.200
Have you seen that?

51:29.200 --> 51:33.200
I saw like a news piece on him because I haven't seen the whole doc.

51:33.200 --> 51:41.200
He's basically dedicated his life to this sort of like tract of belief that it's like, you don't want these people in the shadows.

51:41.200 --> 51:45.200
You want them as much as it pains us.

51:45.200 --> 51:49.200
It's like what good comes from them hiding.

51:49.200 --> 51:58.200
They're as bad as they are and they're twice as bad because whatever butt hurt, fucking whatever birthday party they didn't get invited to, whatever they're fucking cranking about.

51:58.200 --> 52:10.200
Sorry, but it's better to talk to them at Denny's and it's like he has this like collection of KKK robes that are the slow erosion

52:10.200 --> 52:23.200
through friendship one-on-one of him sitting down with a dude who says he wants all this and that to be this and that way and being friendly to them.

52:23.200 --> 52:37.200
And because a friendship with him is completely incalculable to that philosophy, or maybe they just outgrow it, that would be an argument against what he's doing.

52:37.200 --> 52:41.200
But they eventually leave, they give him his robes.

52:41.200 --> 52:44.200
They don't outgrow it and their chapters fall away.

52:44.200 --> 52:52.200
This past year was developing a TV show that was about a guy that has to infiltrate a white supremacist organization.

52:52.200 --> 52:59.200
And doing a lot of research into that, you come to realize that a lot of those people, they don't hate you because you are a different color.

52:59.200 --> 53:01.200
They hate you because they don't know you.

53:01.200 --> 53:10.200
And that when people indoctrinate people into these hate groups, they basically are saying, look, it's not your fault that you're poor and broken stupid, it's their fault.

53:10.200 --> 53:16.200
So by shifting the blame, I mean half the people that are white supremacists just don't know any better.

53:16.200 --> 53:19.200
They've either been raised in that culture.

53:19.200 --> 53:32.200
No, I mean they literally don't. No, I'm telling you, it's literally- Look at this energy that's being generated right now in this room, which I'd prefer to pass on.

53:32.200 --> 53:39.200
But it's like that hot front meeting that cold front, that hurricane, watch this documentary.

53:39.200 --> 53:50.200
Because what you're feeling, one person is like very fidgety, they're like, yes, they're not saying, yeah, racists are misunderstood, you need to talk to them more.

53:50.200 --> 53:54.200
But then someone else is like, what the fuck are we doing? No, we don't need to understand them.

53:54.200 --> 54:04.200
There's a guy from the Southern Poverty Law Center in the documentary who's like, he's a white dude talking to a black dude who's his age and neither of them are heroes or villains.

54:04.200 --> 54:13.200
But he's like, look, one thing he says is you're dealing on a retail level, I'm dealing on a wholesale level, I don't fucking care whether you made a friend with a racist yesterday.

54:13.200 --> 54:18.200
Good for him, great. I want this shit illegal.

54:18.200 --> 54:31.200
And it's like, there are no villains in this story, but one thing that endures, because he goes to Baltimore and he's talking to millennial black activists who are fucking like, they're on point.

54:31.200 --> 54:41.200
You do not want to be talking down to them, they've been arrested a thousand times, maced a thousand times, they're in the trenches.

54:41.200 --> 55:00.200
If we're going to grant veterans of Iraq and things, if we're going to say that when those people speak that we owe it to them to not shit on them and dismiss them, then we definitely have to extend that to activists who work in urban environments where you're on the front lines.

55:00.200 --> 55:18.200
And these guys are smart and they're absolutely bewildered by this old baby boomer guy who's going like, I got this clan robe from the KKK and I got this Confederate flag and they're like, what the fuck are you talking about?

55:18.200 --> 55:34.200
How long have you been doing this? And he's like, I don't know how many, 50 years, I have no idea how long it's been. And you got 25 racist dudes from Memphis to give you their robes when they got tired of being racist?

55:34.200 --> 55:50.200
And they're like, this seems like a fetish. And they try on both sides. I think what you see is that Gerald Davis is like, the word fetish is not, it's like, wow, yeah.

55:50.200 --> 56:06.200
Because he's in his comfort zone when he's laying back and he's expressing this unbelievable amount of acquiescence. But then they're calling him out and going like, that's your comfort zone. That's you accruing this collection of shit in your garage.

56:06.200 --> 56:23.200
We're out here, nameless, faceless, taking, you know, it's a stun baton stuff. Then an older dude, baby boomer, I don't know if that's accurate, older black dude who's like, those guys, protector, mentor, those guys both get up, they can't take the interview anymore.

56:23.200 --> 56:40.200
They don't yell, they don't shout, but it breaks down. They get up and they leave. That guy comes over, he's got a gray beard, he's the same generation as this guy. He's urban, and he's been proud of those guys.

56:40.200 --> 56:58.200
And he's like, I can't shake your hand. But then that's the guy that almost spirals, he's shouting, he's like, get the fuck out of here and don't come back by the end of their conversation and doesn't want to hear Darrell's side of it because it's too offensive.

56:58.200 --> 57:15.200
The thing that I walked away from it from was this weird thing, why am I dumping this on you? The thing that was the most pronounced about it was the fact that those young guys who were so smart and so cool and they had given so much, one of the things he got them to say,

57:15.200 --> 57:37.200
and I don't mean got them to say the way you get Donald Trump to say that microwaves are cameras, I mean he took the conversation down a river that afforded us this glimpse around this curve of trees, one of the things he got them to say was that they didn't believe that white supremacists could change.

57:37.200 --> 57:53.200
Now that's a very, very interesting thing to admit to yourself because it puts you firmly on the side of a line in a world that we're either going to fix, save, abandon, tear up, fighting each other.

57:53.200 --> 58:08.200
It puts you on the side as just as you are and as righteous as you are, and as right as you may be, but it puts you firmly on the side of a war between people who think that we can do better and people who are like, fuck it, we're fighting.

58:08.200 --> 58:25.200
They said that, they said, no, I don't think they can change. I don't know if they really, he didn't give them a slide rule in 20 minutes to answer his question. I think maybe they would have said over 20 minutes like, well, people don't change through the actions that you're taking.

58:25.200 --> 58:40.200
People change, blah, blah, blah, and you fish rocks from the head or whatever, but in that moment they're like, no, you can't change them, they don't change them. And he says, of course he's aggravating them by saying, well, you sound like Donald Trump.

58:40.200 --> 58:56.200
Donald Trump hadn't been elected yet at the time of this interview, and then one of the guys goes like, I hope Donald Trump gets elected because it's like the wolf versus the fox. I know what Donald Trump stands for. I'm not voting anyway and all this shit, and you're like, fuck this, where have we all been?

58:56.200 --> 59:11.200
And at the end of the documentary, Donald Trump's elected. You have no idea where the fucking head is spinning. You're like, who wins, who loses, what is happening? You just feel like you're being flushed down a toilet, like spiritually, because you're just like, oh, we're all good people?

59:11.200 --> 59:29.200
When we look in the mirror, but we're all fucking like insane, and we're gonna rip our faces off in the mirror, and we're just gonna wake up and an octopus creature is gonna go, you failed. And the human simulation.

59:29.200 --> 59:44.200
Octopus 179, you win given the opportunity to be five different colors of chimp. You fuck up. That seems like an unfair test to put on anybody.

59:44.200 --> 01:00:08.200
To deprive them of anything other than what's actually being tested? Like they're inherent fucking intents, like, yeah, I mean, yes, I agree, it's unfair, but we come from a mythology as primates, we're like, oh, you're supposed to know the score. God's supposed to come down, tell you, don't eat the apple, and then I'll pay your rent.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:21.200
And if anything goes wrong, you just blame women, you know? Like, we're supposed to get a spreadsheet at the beginning of the test, while maybe everybody else feels gaslit in the sense that they didn't know what the test was.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:33.200
It was like, what's the chapter in Genesis when God comes back down after Eve gets made and says, I told him, don't eat the apple, I can't remember, I don't know, but it's not a newspaper anyway, it's a metaphor for...

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:43.200
Tim, just answer Dan's question. Brown.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:50.200
You really are the worst interviewee of all time. You just sit there and don't answer shit.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:01:08.200
You think working at South Park for their first three episodes earns you the right to sit there and say nothing? Well, I put my ass on the line about the shit I've gone through at Stanford.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:17.200
I wrote Monster House. Do you have any idea how much research I had to do to write Monster House?

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.200
Do you have any idea how Monster House is?

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.200
Yeah, actually my roommate from college was one of the animators on that.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200
Oh, yeah?

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.200
So you employed him.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:36.200
I created the job, but, you know, I thought that that was going to be a live-action script when we wrote it.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:44.200
Which is why I've actually made quite a bit of money on that movie, because it was written under live-action rules.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.200
So you get residuals.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.200
So every time they go to Blu-ray in Singapore or something, I get a check that's based on, oh, this was a WGA, blah, blah, blah.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200
Fascinating.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:01.200
But Tim, didn't you win some prestigious film writing award?

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.200
I was about to ask about that. The Walter Salt Award.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.200
Waldo Salt.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:15.200
Named after a famed writer who discovered salt. He wrote salt, right?

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:21.200
And he invented wearing striped red and white shirts and hiding in large crowds.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200
What is that award?

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.200
It was the screenwriting award at Sundance.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:35.200
I wrote this movie back in 2004. It took forever to get made because the company we had written it for went out of business

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.200
and we found out that they barred over a million dollars against our script.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:49.200
So our producer, a wonderful guy named Brent Emery, literally spent seven years chasing down 81 different chain of title issues

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.200
and settling up with everyone so that they would get some of their money back if we made the movie.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.200
And then it was like all of a sudden I got a call in June like, I think we're making this movie.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.200
And then in August we were shooting it.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.200
In November we got into Sundance and it premiered in January.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:10.200
But it's not a Sundance award for best blue bitty blue and a blue bitty blue. It's some guy's name.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.200
Waldo Salt is, I guess it's like an honorarium or whatever.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.200
It was set up by his family, I think, to honor independent screenwriting or whatever.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.200
But it's the one screenwriting award they do every year at Sundance.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.200
So that was pretty unexpected.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.200
Yeah, but you know Dan wrote Monster House.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.200
Where's my Waldo Salt?

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.200
Did you take it to Sundance?

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.200
I would have.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.200
Yeah, it's a story. It's a children's horror film.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.200
It's about a house that...

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.200
Hey Spencer, you've been awful quiet over there.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.200
No.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.200
Let's bring it back to the Stanford prison for a moment.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.200
If you had your pick and you couldn't, like if the coin were tossed,

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.200
what do you think you would have been better or worse at being the guard or being a prisoner?

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.200
I'm sure I would be a kick-ass guard.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.200
I mean, that's just my nature. I can be petty and mean and...

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.200
No, that means you'd be a worse guard.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.200
You would be a worse person as a guard.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.200
Yes.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.200
Our whole goal with the entire movie was just to have people walk out at the end

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.200
and ask that question to themselves.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.200
Do I have it within myself to turn into such an evil fucking person

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.200
if given the opportunity and having no repercussions?

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.200
And to that extent, I think the film works.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.200
It's funny that...

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.200
I'd never seen a movie or anything I'd written in front of a huge audience before.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.200
And at Sundance, we had like 1200 people at the first screening.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.200
And there's a title card that comes up that just says Day 2.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.200
And literally...

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.200
Everything that happened in the first day was so...

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.200
Everyone in the audience was like,

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:56.200
Holy shit that the air got sucked out of the room and it was one of the most...

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.200
The hair stood up on the back of my neck and I was like, oh my god.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.200
A movie just got a reaction and I had something to do with that.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:08.200
That happened to me and Cody, my girlfriend, when we were watching it today at Day 4.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.200
Wait, what? Day 4?

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.200
And I checked the progress indicator and that's part of the point.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.200
So is there... The answer to that question is yes, correct?

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.200
The people who are...

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.200
If you're made a guard by an institution,

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.200
guard in quotes meaning district manager,

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.200
if you're told that you're in charge of whether or not racism ends,

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.200
because you're the race that ends racism,

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:41.200
if you're told that you're the employee of the month,

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.200
if you're in charge of this parking spot,

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200
if you're in charge of anything,

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.200
any power that you're given by an institution,

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:52.200
it seeps into the cracks of your soul and you have two choices.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:59.200
You take on that role and actually surrender part of your empathy and individuality

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.200
in favor of serving that role better.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.200
That's the important thing is that the guys that early on,

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:12.200
who started as a joke because putting on the uniforms reminded them of Coolhand Luke,

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.200
and that guy goes, I'm going to do my impression of a character from Coolhand Luke.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.200
And then he comes out, he knows what to say to the president,

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:24.200
I want you to communicate well, and then the scientists are going, that guy's good.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.200
More importantly, nothing happens. He's now in charge.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.200
Everyone that's watching is going like, well, and then the shift changes

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.200
and they go, yeah, we did some fucked up shit today and nothing happened.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.200
Don't you think that's part of what it is?

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.200
Dan, you are famous for, you hate being told what to do.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.200
Let's say that you were, how old are these subjects back then, early 20s?

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.200
They were between 18 and 22.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.200
And let's say that you, Dan, found out you were the guard.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.200
You don't like being told what to do.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.200
You also don't like, well, you do like telling people what to do

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.200
because you're a showrunner, that's part of your job description.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.200
Like, what do you think you would be as a guard?

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.200
As a guard, I would be like, I would posture as a,

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.200
but I would be eclipsed by some guy who went fascistic.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.200
I would be eclipsed by the guy who like jumped into the role.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.200
Well, like a while back, I asked Spencer first.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.200
Like, I'm curious, Spencer, you're so neutral.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.200
Like, I can't picture you being,

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.200
turning into a shitty dominated prisoner or a fascistic bully guard.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.200
Yeah.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.200
But there are some people that did that.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.200
But that response makes me think, I don't want you as my guard.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.200
But there's an important thing here that you're getting to,

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.200
which is that there are...

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.200
At least it was, yeah.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.200
It was a complex subject.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.200
There's a way to be a prisoner as well,

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.200
and you have these narcissistic tendencies or things.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.200
Like, as a prisoner, they ask them,

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.200
would you rather be a prisoner or a guard?

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.200
And everyone wanted to be a prisoner because they thought it'd be less work.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:00.200
Because if you're a prisoner, you can just...

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.200
Just sleep.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.200
The most work is that you're defined...

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.200
You get three hots on the cot.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.200
You're always righteous.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.200
The truth is always on your side.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.200
You can't be a bad...

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.200
There's no such thing as a villainous prisoner.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.200
You don't have any power.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.200
We live in fear of being bad people, too.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.200
Nobody wanted to be a guard,

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.200
but then the people that excel at being guards

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.200
are exhibiting the same personalities

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.200
as the people who are rallying the prisoners.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.200
And that's when Zimbardo says,

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.200
these guys are swappable with a coin toss.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.200
That means in every revolution

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.200
in every third world country,

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.200
when you have guerrillas coming down

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.200
from the hills and liberating the poor,

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.200
and then one of them becomes a dictator,

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.200
and then you have the NSA interfering.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.200
People are handing you power, handing you rules.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.200
There's also a certain level of compliance

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.200
in certain people,

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.200
because part of what this showed

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.200
as well as what happened at Abu Ghraib

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.200
is also what happened in Nazi Germany.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.200
Is that if you're in a situation

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.200
where you feel you have zero power

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.200
and there's nothing you can do to change it,

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.200
like the people that are against you

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.200
are so massively in power,

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.200
you know, some people just, it's normalization.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.200
It's that shit that's happening now.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.200
People like on the Eastern Front

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.200
willfully were corralled

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.200
into a giant sand pit,

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.200
and they knew they were going to be killed,

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.200
and they did it meekly and mildly.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.200
Because that's what society told them is their role.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.200
Did any of the subjects go to the film,

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.200
like see the film?

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.200
I don't know.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.200
I know, you know, I was very happy

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.200
that Zimbardo and his wife

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.200
saw the movie right before we went to Sundance,

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.200
and he came to Sundance and spoke and did all that stuff.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.200
But I was very happy

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.200
because it's really weird telling somebody's story

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.200
and trying to get it right

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.200
and making sure not to also let him off the hook.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.200
You know, we, for dramatic effect,

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.200
you know, in reality,

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.200
we haven't gotten to the third act yet,

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.200
so I can't tell you.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.200
In reality, it ended a little bit differently

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.200
than it does in the movie.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.200
Because that woman, the triangle of woman, comes back.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.200
No.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.200
Leo DiCaprio comes through a skylight.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.200
That's how you got your funding.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.200
Traffic was a bitch!

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.200
Fucking California, man.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.200
But let's mash a really hot button right now,

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.200
but it's the elephant in the room,

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.200
which is really interesting,

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.200
is that prisons,

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.200
there were all dudes,

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.200
dudes running it,

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.200
dudes are the whole movie is all dudes,

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.200
dudes dealing with dude issues,

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.200
to the point where they're talking about

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.200
stripping dudes of their duteness,

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.200
their individuality,

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.200
and they're using it synonymously with the phrase feminization.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.200
Put them in dresses.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.200
Call them she, call them her, call them,

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.200
you know, and let's reduce them

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.200
of their individuality,

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.200
not their masculinity, their individuality

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.200
by feminizing them.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.200
1971.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.200
So like, the,

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.200
in 2017, casual Friday,

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.200
and somebody says to Becky in marketing,

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.200
like, you should wear a shorter skirt or something,

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.200
it's like, there's no bars on the windows,

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.200
there's no, the thing is,

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.200
this was a hallway at Stanford College.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.200
None of these kids during this entire story,

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.200
ever

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.200
accidentally started believing

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.200
they were in prison.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.200
They, what happened

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.200
was they were, they, they were

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.200
subjected long enough to

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.200
deprivation of this and enhancement

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.200
of that, that their behavior

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.200
changed, and it can happen

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.200
in a hallway. It can happen

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.200
with cubicles around you.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.200
Well, that's one of the great things about the way Kyle

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.200
Alvarez directed the movie, and

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.200
I thought he had a really good idea, which was

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.200
when you first get introduced

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.200
to the prison, it's all shown in a master shot.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.200
So you see, it's a fucking hallway in three classrooms

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.200
and a closet used as a whole.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.200
During the process

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.200
of the movie, the lens is closed down and down

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.200
and down to the point where, when things are

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.200
really going shitty, you're in

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.200
close on people, and there's a lot of

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.200
diffusion.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.200
So it makes it feel, it makes you feel claustrophobic.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.200
And then when Zambardo comes in

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.200
and ends it, you cut back to that master, you realize

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.200
that the, the place

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.200
hasn't changed, the situation has changed.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.200
Was there anybody, I mean, I, I read about this

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.200
a long time ago in, you know, in a psychology class

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.200
or something, and

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.200
you know, it's super fascinating, and

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.200
we all know about that, we say these words.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.200
But did anybody emerge from that

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.200
guard or prisoner in like, fuck this shit.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.200
I'm walking out of here, like, did anybody

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.200
like flex up and go, this is, this is dumb.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.200
No, that's the, that's the one thing

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.200
nobody ever directly asked to be let out.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.200
When they could at any point, they could just say,

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.200
you know what, fuck this, let me, let me go home,

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.200
you can't keep me here. Nobody did it

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.200
because the, the rules from above down

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.200
kept them feeling like, you know, it's, this

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.200
is one of the things that Zambardo and Stanley

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.200
Milgram have done in, in

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.200
a lot of different experiments.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.200
One of which that comes to mind is Stanley

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.200
Milgram did an experiment where he put an ad

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.200
on the paper for like a secretary and

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.200
rented an office in a high rise in New York

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.200
and hired two people

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.200
to be plants, basically, in the office.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.200
So when the woman would come in to

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.200
interview for the office, these two people were told

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.200
to stay still and don't react. The woman would

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.200
sit down and they'd start pumping smoke

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.200
into the room. And because the other two

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.200
people wouldn't react to it,

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.200
the third person, nine out of ten

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.200
times, wouldn't react to it. The fact that

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.200
the fucking building's on fire.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.200
I mean, that's how, how powerful society

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.200
can be. That's me. I mean, I think

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.200
I'd be that third person. I, I

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.200
truly feel like so defined by

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.200
what everyone is reacting to. I feel like

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.200
I wait way too long. I told a story

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.200
about going out to lunch

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.200
with my friend Dino and our

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.200
new CFO at my

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.200
studio and he started choking on a piece of

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.200
hanger steak and I was very disappointed

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.200
with my

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.200
reaction time.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.200
It's a man choking to death that was like

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.200
waiting for what? Bruce Willis

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.200
to like, come in. I don't know

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.200
man, but I, I, I, I, I

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.200
I'm afraid to find out what I'm made of. That's why

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.200
I bought a gun when Trump got elected. I don't

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.200
want to know what I'm made of because the answer is

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.200
nothing. I'm made of nothing. What are you, what

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.200
am I, John Claude Van Damme? I'm not made of

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.200
anything. I didn't earn anything.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.200
I, I, I, I, I spoken about on the show before

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.200
I'm sure. I, I got pulled over on a, on a warrant.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.200
I, I hit and run a sign and I got picked

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.200
up on a Saturday morning and spent all weekend

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.200
in jail at a, at a, in Whittier

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.200
and uh, Whittier, California. Yeah,

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.200
I'm not proud of it.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.200
Uh, but I got uh, you know,

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.200
handcuffed, put in the car, put in jail

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.200
and I was in the jail

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.200
like, probably like

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.200
six or seven or eight cells.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.200
Uh, they left me in my, they put me

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.200
in the, the tank, like the, the, the drunk

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.200
tank, like everyone else was three to a cell.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.200
Uh, so they, they, they

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.200
were like two guys in a cot and one guy on the floor

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.200
and I would have to deal with the drunks that were

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.200
let in every night or the both nights

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.200
and what was amazing

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.200
was I was a college kid.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.200
I was the only white guy in there

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.200
and I was treated as shitty as they were

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.200
and it was, you were instantly not a person

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.200
and I changed the way I talked

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.200
the way I made eye contact with the,

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.200
with the uh, with the officers there.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.200
You're instantly told that you're a piece of shit

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.200
and when you leave there, you still

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.200
think so. You don't leave there and go,

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.200
oh, I'm gonna walk home now. I got out of here finally

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.200
after being treated like garbage

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.200
and again, this, this, this wasn't

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.200
Peru and it wasn't, you know, this wasn't

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.200
Syria. It was, it was

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.200
California. But

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.200
Whittier. Yeah.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.200
Whittier is only nominally California.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.200
Uh, it's uh,

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.200
I'm not saying that like my, my story

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.200
is the worst story of all time, but I, I was

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.200
surprised how instantly I felt like completely

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.200
uh, not

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.200
in any sort of power

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.200
and, and instantly not in equal

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.200
with anybody there. You're, you're a

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.200
scumbag and you're dirt and I felt like that for

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.200
days afterwards and

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.200
Well, imagine that for 30 years.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.200
Yeah, I can't. Well, I, I, I'm fascinated

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.200
by and want shows about people being locked up.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.200
It's like, it's like, the time

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.200
passes, it doesn't pass

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.200
and when you leave there, you're not

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.200
better. You're, you're psychologically

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.200
like a little dizzy

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.200
and fucked up and, and, and probably a lot worse

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.200
if you, you know, had

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.200
to go through actual shit. I was just in a,

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.200
in a fucking drunk tank for 52 hours.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.200
It was a nightmare. Uh,

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.200
so like, uh, like what

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.200
I was thinking about the Stanford experiment

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.200
is like, they love fucking

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.200
with you the moment you're in there. They love it.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.200
Well, part of it is also boredom.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.200
They're doing eight hour shifts where they have nothing to do except

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:12.200
well, we can either sit in this room

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.200
or we can bring these guys out and make them do jumping jacks

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.200
and, and push them around and fuck them.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.200
And they get spit on and yelled at and harassment and stuff

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.200
and they just love having like, like it's a shit

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.200
job. It's noisy. It smells like crap.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.200
It's uh, the food is garbage. They're not

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.200
happy. They don't like their lives. They wanted

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.200
to be in a secret service with the FBI and they did.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.200
And it's, and it's a fucking bummer.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.200
And they do take a little bit

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.200
of just human glee

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.200
in knowing that they

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.200
fucked you around more than they got

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.200
fucked around that day. And I was

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.200
a

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.200
sophomore at USC at the time. I was, you know, like everything

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.200
going like the rest of the guys in there,

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.200
the only people that were nice to me were the

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.200
cholo gang bangers in there who fucking looked after me

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.200
and fucking like,

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.200
and they nicknamed me Hollywood.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.200
And

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.200
when I got

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.200
you'll go far in prison with the nickname like

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.200
well, well, I was

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.200
warned up what would happen if I had to go to

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.200
county to get processed out. Luckily, I just got

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.200
to get kicked out of the, of

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.200
woodier jail. Uh, but

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.200
I got handcuffed like ankles

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.200
and uh, and wrists to the

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.200
courthouse to walk down the street and we

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.200
get in there and it's a bunch of dudes that come in from county

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.200
and some guys are going away for attempted murder.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.200
Some guys are going away for like salt terrorist

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.200
terrorist, uh, threats, which means

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.200
like I just threatened to kill somebody in front of police

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.200
officer. Some are going to go away

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.200
for 20 years, some guys six months

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.200
and everybody was going up, like all the veteran

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.200
like cholo guys walking up to everybody like, hey man

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.200
you're going to get love, don't worry, like you get

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.200
six, you got six years, you'll be out in two and a half

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.200
homes and also you're going to be with my homie and

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.200
Chino, like I know this fucking guy, he's my cousin

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.200
and they were all going around and telling everybody

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.200
it's going to be okay, like you're going to be

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.200
looked after there, like I'll make sure you talk to

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.200
my friends so and so. And I had

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.200
to get, walked up to the

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.200
courthouse, uh, to

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.200
I saw one judge with the oldest dude in there

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.200
this, like with the teardrops and the whole

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.200
thing, this old school veteran and

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.200
he walked up and he goes, listen man, like

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.200
you're a good kid, like what are you doing in there?

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.200
I mean, I fucking didn't pay a fine and

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.200
I knocked over a sign and didn't have the money to pay

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.200
for the thing and had a bench warrant and I didn't pay

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.200
the fine because he had this judge fucking hates you, man, like he's a

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.200
asshole, like he hates me, he hates everybody

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.200
but we're going to go see this guy and we're handcuffed

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.200
walking to the elevator together, took up

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.200
and he goes, you don't say shit unless he talks to you

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.200
and if he talks to you, don't say anything but

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.200
the answer to his fucking question

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.200
and if he asks you anything else

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.200
say it's you're missing your fucking second day of your

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.200
second year at school and you're a good kid

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.200
and you shouldn't, and you don't belong here

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.200
and when I, when he

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.200
stood up to get his thing, I had to stand up and when I had

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.200
this, like the vice versa, and I got back down

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.200
and it all went cool, got back down

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.200
and they kicked me out, they called you to go, Jeff Davis

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.200
and all, I'm not joking,

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.200
I know everyone thinks I'm making up these fucking stories

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.200
and I, I don't care if you do

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.200
because this happened and I almost, and I

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.200
I will cry thinking about it

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.200
they were like 15, 20, 22

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.200
guys in there

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.200
the toughest guy in there was sleeping

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.200
as a pillow, he had the only roll of toilet paper

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.200
and that was his pillow so no one had toilet paper

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.200
everyone else being really nice to each other

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.200
they're all in the county blues and orange

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.200
and when they called my name, Jeff Davis

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.200
the fucking guys knew me, they went

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.200
Hollywood!

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.200
I was like, what does that mean?

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.200
I go in the county and they're like, no

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.200
that means you got love homes, that means you got love

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.200
and when I got, when they let me out

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.200
when they fucking let me out the door

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.200
the fucking dudes came up and hugged me

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.200
and the cops outside looked at me

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.200
they wanted to fucking beat my ass from the parking lot

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.200
so it's a story about

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.200
me being the coolest guy in the world

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.200
hahahaha

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:46.200
Hollywood!

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.200
I fucking make myself a drink

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.200
I can't believe I have a story

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.200
I haven't told in the show already

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.200
you told that story before

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.200
we have

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.200
we have 500 episodes

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200
it's fine

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200
it's fine

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.200
I told it better now

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.200
but the interesting thing about that

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.200
when I listen to that though

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.200
having watched Tim's

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.200
screenplay movie

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.200
I was going to say Tim's movie but I didn't want the

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.200
director to be like

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.200
send me a rabbit's head or something

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.200
whatever the directors do and you call

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.200
the writer's movie

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.200
there's a point in there where there's a

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.200
tension paid to breaking up the solidarity

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.200
within the ranks and when we talk about

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.200
the guards or pieces of shit

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.200
and the prisoners have all this solidarity

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.200
it's not even

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:36.200
it's like

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.200
my new eye on that is like

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.200
yeah but you can also put divisive energy

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.200
into a population

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.200
if you had been in a situation

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.200
if you had been in a

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.200
incarcerative

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.200
environment in which the administrative

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.200
powers that be

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.200
felt threatened

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.200
there might have been

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.200
a system in place

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.200
in which you were more pitted against

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.200
your fellow

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.200
inmates because they had already

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.200
perceived a threat

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.200
and put energy into it which they can

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.200
easily do in the most subtle of ways

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.200
drive a wedge between everybody

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.200
give them less toilet paper

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.200
for pillows give them

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.200
or give them one roll and give this guy

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.200
spaghetti and give that guy not spaghetti

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.200
and it's something that they

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.200
do very readily

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.200
in order to quell the potential

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.200
so I know I'm going to sound

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.200
like a fucking weird

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.200
apologist for the man

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.200
or whatever but I'm actually

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.200
now I'm looking at that

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.200
and going like instead of hearing that

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.200
it's like ah they have those fucking guards

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.200
I'm like thinking you know those guards

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.200
probably living in an environment that's like as close

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.200
as you can get to having an incarcerated group

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.200
and then they're in charge of guarding it

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.200
which is why they're so bitter

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.200
when those guys start getting happy

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.200
and Abu Ghraibing

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.200
because there's been a tension

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.200
actually deliberately put down into

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.200
making sure that for instance an environment

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.200
gets created where somebody wants to beat you up

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.200
like because you're just

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.200
in the same cell as them or they're

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.200
you know what I mean

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.200
in my little minute situation

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.200
it was a police station

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.200
and the people that were there were probably

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.200
going to county and then a lot of them

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.200
were going to be in county for a while

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.200
then probably go to federal prison

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.200
or

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.200
to come back to a county then back to a jail

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.200
like they were going to be in there for a long time

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.200
they told me like this is as good as it's going to get

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.200
and they warned me about what happens at the other stages

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.200
like here's

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.200
when you don't take a shit

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.200
and here's where you put things that you care about

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.200
not losing and

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.200
and here's like and they all told me like

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.200
you know the thing that you're like you're going to have to color up

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.200
with the white white power dudes and all that shit

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.200
and I was just like

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.200
I just my stomach was

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.200
just liquid the entire time

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.200
because

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.200
the good thing was that

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.200
I was vegetarian I just become vegetarian

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.200
and it was

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.200
bologna and cheese sandwiches they gave I gave them all my bologna

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.200
they gave me all the cheese

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.200
the reason I

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.200
I had a kick at that cheese was bullshit

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.200
but it was the best cheese sandwich you ever had

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.200
the reason I'm bringing this up because I'm trying to carry over

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.200
I'm constantly always talk about the Stanford

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.200
prison experiment what that experiment was

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.200
what it meant the fact that it didn't have to be

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.200
scientifically accurate the fact that it's less a cautionary

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.200
tale about science and how to get data and all

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.200
the stuff the fact that what it really means

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.200
is that you can be in

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.200
the Stanford prison experiment

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.200
and there can be

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.200
no bars around you

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.200
you can be in a three-piece suit you can have

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.200
a big mustache you can be the star of

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:38.200
your own biopic and you can be

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.200
in the Stanford prison experiment

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.200
you whenever you are

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:44.200
told which is every minute of

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:46.200
every day by Reddit

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.200
by commenters by everything

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.200
you're told by the ghost of your mother

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.200
that you have a role

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.200
and you're in an argument you're a libtard

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.200
you're a wing nut you're a right

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.200
right wingy left wingy I'm policing

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.200
I'm an apologist I'm a thing

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.200
I'm engaging with another

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.200
human being and as I

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.200
found out like buying

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.200
my fucking gun like a maniac

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.200
like the

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.200
and looking through Sandy Hook conspiracy theories

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:14.200
it's like I've had a plan this whole podcast to bring this

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.200
message home that like

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.200
walk out of here knowing that you're already

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.200
in a prison I mean you can't

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.200
just walk out of life you can't

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.200
walk out of America especially not now

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.200
you might not be let back

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.200
in like we're all

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.200
we're in an environment and the

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.200
environment is being run and I'm not saying

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.200
that means let's go throw a garbage can

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:36.200
through a window that won't do any good

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.200
it means that

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.200
if you know if you remind yourself

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.200
that you're in an environment that you're encased

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.200
in something you might

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.200
you might maintain your empathy

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.200
those guys that knew

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.200
the system that were saying Hollywood here's

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.200
the thing the judge does this and does that

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.200
like they were

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:56.200
they were wearing a mask they were saying

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.200
like we're in this system

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.200
the system is a system like

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.200
the real life exists outside of it

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.200
now while you're in here

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.200
don't fuck with that guy's toilet paper

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.200
try the soup instead of the salad you're gonna be

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.200
fine there's solidarity

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.200
there's empathy possible because everything's

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.200
been removed from them except

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.200
that there's been not an undue

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.200
amount of like divisive energy

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.200
placed on it

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.200
hopefully we could withstand that too

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.200
if you're looking at another human being

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.200
digitally or whatever you have

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.200
that temptation to go animal

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.200
because you filled as I have been

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.200
with that fucking outrage

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.200
where you're like I know what I'm

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.200
about and I know what I'm up against

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.200
and I'm gonna tell this piece of fucking

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.200
15 year old Canadian shit

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.200
how politics works

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.200
on Twitter

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.200
he might have been

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.200
one group that wouldn't

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.200
you have a 15 year old Canadian

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.200
daughter okay fine

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.200
I don't like

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.200
it

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.200
Venice Wayland whatever won't offend you

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.200
shut the fuck up

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.200
see it happen to me again

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.200
it's as easy as somebody

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.200
telling me I don't know what I'm doing

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.200
fuck off fuck off fuck you

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.200
I own a gun lady

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.200
it's at a gun store

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:14.200
it's at a gun store but I own it

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.200
see that you feel like a prisoner

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.200
but you're acting like a guard and that's

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.200
the whole point

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.200
because I've been given the microphone well I took it

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.200
with a lifetime of talent

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.200
they give them aviator

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.200
is that the title of the show

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.200
yes it is

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.200
we've got some good selection

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.200
they give them aviator glasses

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.200
everything's a fantasy

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.200
prison guards don't necessarily always wear aviator sunglasses

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.200
but it's a problem

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.200
it's an image of authority

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.200
it's like when you can't see behind

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.200
someone's eyes or when you can't see their eyes

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.200
empathy

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.200
everything about that the whole thing was

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.200
designed just to remove humanity

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.200
from the entire equation

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.200
when they interrogate suspects they take advantage

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.200
they'll turn into a game show

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.200
the prisoner's dilemma

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.200
you want them to rat on each other

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.200
you separate them

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.200
you make sure they can't see and touch each other

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:16.200
and you say to one

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:18.200
the other one says you did it

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.200
now what will you do

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.200
your empathy is put to the test

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.200
will you bother to walk

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.200
as a lamb to the slaughter

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.200
well this other piece of shit that you don't know

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.200
that I can tell you about is telling you

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.200
that you're the one that did it

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.200
you're the sensible thing to protect yourself

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.200
and just tell me that that other person

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.200
is a bad person

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.200
and that's the fucking internet

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.200
it divides 8

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.200
billion people

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.200
into individual cells

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.200
we cannot see or touch each other

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.200
and we are being told by headlines

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.200
and clickbait

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.200
that we don't understand each other

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.200
and that we are going to fuck each other over

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.200
but also

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.200
in bringing it back to like a prison environment

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.200
with the internet there's no accountability

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.200
which is again how

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.200
Abu Ghraib happened it's like you put a bunch of people

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.200
that don't have the proper training

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.200
in a position of authority without any supervision

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.200
and fucked up shit is going to happen

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.200
against people that have no hibis corpus

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.200
and no outside contact

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.200
it's a free for all

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.200
it's a giant frat party

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:22.200
it's nuts

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.200
you've been in rooms

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.200
that you probably can't talk about

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.200
like the last Jedi

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:30.200
I haven't seen you

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.200
no I haven't been in rooms

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.200
I was actually on the set of the last Jedi

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.200
but I was also on the set of Rogue One

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.200
well

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.200
the set was cool

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:44.200
I just talked to the set of Rogue One

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.200
and they said the set of the last Jedi

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.200
is a piece of shit

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:50.200
so either you fucking rat on them

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.200
and I don't know how that was

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.200
if you could have pulled that rabbit on that hat

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.200
there's nothing you can tell us

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.200
you can tell us about the emotional experience

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.200
of being on a Star Wars set

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:02.200
well the cool thing is

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.200
I went over there when they were prepping for

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.200
last Jedi or episode 8 or whatever they're calling it

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.200
I'd rather be a guard

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.200
it's so easy

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.200
it's so easy to be me

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.200
sometimes

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:28.200
you just have to wait 49 minutes

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.200
I say 3 words

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:32.200
it's great

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.200
sorry

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.200
you did the funniest thing on the show

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.200
and you said 3 sentences

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:54.200
it's a living

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.200
what kind of food did they get

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.200
in the Stanford experiment

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.200
shitty

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.200
but Dan had mentioned before

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.200
they also did

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.200
there were two cells that revolted

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.200
and one that acquiesced

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.200
so they gave them a special meal

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.200
they were constantly

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.200
using things against other prisoners

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.200
but they made that up on the fly

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.200
because of the actual instant need

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.200
that the experiment hadn't predicted

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.200
which was that the prisoners would

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:24.200
band together and revolt

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.200
so why don't we just outnumber them

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.200
and do this or that

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:30.200
now we divide you

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.200
now we give them soup and not you soup

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.200
we take people out of one cell

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.200
if the three of you have become friends

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.200
we're going to break you up and put you in different groups

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.200
the fact that we wouldn't see that lie happening

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.200
when we talk about race and gender

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:44.200
and everything else that divides us

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.200
we talk so fucking

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.200
rarely about income bracket

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.200
for a country that runs on the dollar

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.200
that's creating a middle class

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.200
by saying that you're the privileged

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.200
you create a giant underclass

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.200
of people of all shapes and sizes

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.200
that are all poor

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.200
which is the only thing that matters

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.200
so it's very obvious the tricks

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.200
when you look at prisons

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.200
you go like what do they do

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:10.200
and everybody might go

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.200
run!

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.200
they wouldn't be able to do much

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:16.200
but not that I'm advocating for that

01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.200
and I don't know what that would look like

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.200
I guess all of us using toilet paper

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.200
for pillows at the same time

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.200
just try it

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.200
or don't pay your income tax

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.200
I don't know

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.200
but the red beams

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.200
form on my chest

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.200
so Star Wars you were on the set

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.200
and it was interesting they had lightsabers

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.200
the coolest thing was I got to go in

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.200
the Millennium Falcon

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.200
which is meticulously recreated

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.200
what does that mean?

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.200
there are two versions of it

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.200
there's one that's like an exterior version

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.200
that they use like a full size one

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.200
out in the world or whatever

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:54.200
wait what do you mean?

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:56.200
they shot in Ireland and at one set

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.200
they had an exterior full size

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.200
what they built it like a building

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.200
so you can walk in and out of it

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.200
and see the cockpit from the outside

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.200
why would they even do that?

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.200
I would fire that line producer

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.200
CG that shit

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.200
well I mean

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.200
that's amazing I'm glad they did it

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.200
they did it for episode 7

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.200
and then that was what was still standing

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.200
was not the exterior but the interior

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.200
so you walk up basically the ramp of the Millennium Falcon

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.200
and then you're on, you're in the Millennium Falcon

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.200
the whole thing

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.200
all the way through like the holding area

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.200
where they play chess

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.200
and into the cockpit

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:34.200
and all that stuff

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.200
they just amortized that with doing a Netflix sitcom

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.200
they could just pay for that whole thing

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.200
with like six seasons of a workplace comedy

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.200
called Millennium Knights

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.200
apparently it cost

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.200
it cost a shit ton of money

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.200
because they went back and

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.200
when they made the original Millennium Falcon

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.200
half the stuff were all old airplane parts

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.200
and stuff like that

01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.200
and none of that existed anymore so they had to go in 3D print

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.200
from reference photos

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.200
all this shit so you walk in there and it's like

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.200
oh my god I just walked into my fucking childhood

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.200
to what level of detail

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.200
like every nook and cranny like everything

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:10.200
they could shoot anything there

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:12.200
yeah I mean you know if you watch Force Awakens

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:14.200
I mean there are shots where you walk

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.200
through the whole thing and that's there

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.200
that's what I'm saying

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.200
it shouldn't be a sitcom it should be like an Aaron Sorkin

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:22.200
like what

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.200
it's like a West Wing

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.200
there's nothing but walking and talking in the Falcon

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.200
what's your opinion

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.200
you can't say anything about where Star Wars is at

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.200
I'll lay my cards at the table

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.200
I'm 44 I

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.200
saw Phantom Menace

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:38.200
I started crying I got over it

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.200
you started crying I started laughing

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.200
I was like is this real?

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.200
maybe I was like a hollow

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.200
I said at the point where they went into the water

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:48.200
and the jubububu

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.200
planet

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.200
I was sitting next to Schrab

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.200
and I went oh my god

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:58.200
this is the worst movie ever

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.200
and Schrab was like shhh

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.200
but he didn't mean we're in a movie theater

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.200
he meant like stop

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.200
it might surprise us

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:08.200
was it Rob wanted someone else to be quiet

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.200
he was just we were just both there

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.200
as the same team we were like

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.200
we had been waiting for this moment our entire lives

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.200
I started weeping

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:18.200
during the

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.200
20th Century Fox logo

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.200
at the beginning of Phantom Menace

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.200
I had been waiting for that moment my entire

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:26.200
life that's not an exaggeration

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.200
I had been waiting for that moment

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.200
my entire life

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.200
I couldn't see Phantom Menace because I was in jail

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.200
motherfucker

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.200
Hollywood

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:38.200
Hollywood

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.200
Hollywood

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:42.200
Hollywood

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:44.200
Hollywood

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.200
Hollywood

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.200
you all seem to have a problem

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.200
understanding simple communication

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:52.200
now

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.200
now I see a couple of you

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.200
a black, a couple of you a white

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.200
you all need to understand

01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:00.200
that you are animals

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.200
now I'm going to give the white people free lasagna

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.200
cause y'all Garfield now

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.200
y'all black people gotta ask

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.200
do you hate Mondays

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.200
now

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:20.200
now try to rally them

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.200
they've been divided

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.200
stand up again see if it still works

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:28.200
if I do they're gonna start chanting Hollywood

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.200
I don't believe you

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.200
half of them are women

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.200
now hold on

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.200
hold on now

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:38.200
hold on

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:42.200
you all seem to have misunderstood

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.200
what I said earlier

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.200
some of y'all

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.200
seem to be doing some titty thinking

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.200
I think a good half y'all got titties

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.200
and vaginas

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.200
I wonder if maybe they need to get

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.200
some spaghetti on Wednesdays

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.200
well you can dangle your dicks

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:06.200
and the pudding on Thursday

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.200
I don't think I'd be very good guard

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.200
you'd be entertaining

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:22.200
that's alright

01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:24.200
it's okay

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.200
it's okay

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.200
shut up

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:36.200
y'all need to start seeing the monster house

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:38.200
there's plenty of things

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.200
eyes in the windows

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.200
door open up the carpets

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:44.200
a tongue

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.200
scooping up you

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.200
if you're black or you're a woman

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.200
scoop you up

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.200
trick or treat

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.200
you'd make a bad

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.200
warden we found that out

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.200
make a bad

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.200
Appalachian warden

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:06.200
your Strother Martin could use some work

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.200
I'm bad at everything

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.200
but here's the thing

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.200
I didn't ask for it

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:16.200
I don't need your bullshit

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.200
I'm not a populist autocrat

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.200
maybe you need to

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.200
go to jail

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.200
and come back with a nickname

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.200
and people will just chance it on site when they see you

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.200
what do you think your jail nickname would be

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.200
chowder

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.200
chowder?

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.200
did you just say that in the thickest

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.200
boston accent in the word

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.200
chowder

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.200
oh for monster house

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.200
no you haven't seen it

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.200
alright

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:50.200
I just resemble a person that should be called chowder

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.200
that has to be a monster house

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.200
reference of course

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.200
the blanks tear does not lie

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:58.200
no he said chowder from his fucking heart

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.200
because I'm

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.200
I get it

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.200
for the same reason I named that character chowder

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.200
there's no way he said

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.200
one of the three main characters from your movie

01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:10.200
there's an easy way

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:12.200
no it's like he's the

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.200
sad fat guy in the movie

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.200
and you having not seen the movie

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.200
you said the same thing I did

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:20.200
you named a sad fat guy from your heart

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.200
I have no ill will against you

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:26.200
now if you come in my window tonight

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.200
unless I'm

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.200
seeing wrong

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:32.200
you're dead

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.200
it would be a wicked retarded move

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.200
to trespass

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.200
no offense to the

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.200
actual wicked retarded

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:52.200
isn't your sister retarded

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.200
my sister

01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.200
well she's a cool person from Boston

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.200
no my sister is institutionalized in

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.200
Madison

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.200
would have bring it down Jeff

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.200
pretty fucked up

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.200
dragged my sister into it

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.200
no but that's not what that phrase means

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.200
it's more of a term of

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.200
endearment there

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.200
I agree that's why I said no offense to

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.200
Tim what are we

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.200
Tim don't listen to him

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.200
Tim face me for a moment

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.200
go ahead dude Jeff

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.200
go talk to Hollywood

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.200
what you're gonna see is Dan

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.200
for the next five or so minutes before we finish the show

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.200
is just still mad about people chanting Hollywood

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:38.200
so he's gonna

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.200
try everything he can

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.200
to sort of salvage some sort of

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:44.200
some dignity out of this whole thing

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:46.200
and he's gonna bring you down with that ship

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.200
that's fine

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.200
so

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.200
okay you can go back to Dan now

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:54.200
thank you

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.200
Tim I feel like what you just saw was

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:58.200
when they chanted Hollywood

01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:00.200
Jeff was stimulated on a level we didn't realize

01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.200
is that why he's sitting down

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:08.200
that's why this podium is so large

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.200
we could talk about

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.200
what's this script

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.200
that was on the blacklist balls out

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.200
for the

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:18.200
thank you

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.200
yeah balls out was this script that I wrote with

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:22.200
another guy named Malcolm Spellman

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.200
under the pseudonym of the

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.200
RoboTard 8000

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.200
so we

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.200
wrote the script it was during the writer strike

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.200
the last one

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.200
and we just were like fuck it let's write what we want to write

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:36.200
not anything

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:38.200
for anyone in particular and

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.200
we finished it we brought it to our

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.200
representatives and they were like no fucking way

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.200
we're not taking this script out it's too offensive

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.200
and literally

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.200
nobody would take it out

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.200
I had a couple of friends that we were commiserating with

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.200
and just said fuck it just throw it up on the internet

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.200
and see what happens the script itself

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.200
so I created a website that looks like

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.200
it was created by a differently

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.200
abled robot

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.200
and

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.200
and had some friends that were screenwriters

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.200
just give us like a blurb if they liked it

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.200
and all of a sudden it just took off

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.200
and as of like last week it's been

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.200
downloaded almost 200,000 times

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.200
which is insane

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.200
yeah

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.200
and it's the only script so far

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.200
that's ever gotten on the blacklist without

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.200
ever being sent out

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.200
you know people read it afterwards

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.200
but it never officially went out

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.200
for anyone to really buy

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.200
so is it like what's Jerry Lewis's one though

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.200
the day the clowns cried

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.200
yeah but we did actually

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:36.200
the blacklist podcast

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.200
we did a stage reading of it

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.200
oh really? yeah and recorded that actually

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.200
it's like oh well yeah this is a movie this does work

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.200
so that was kind of fun

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.200
the blacklist is the thing that I'm only familiar with

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.200
third hand like I've never actually

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.200
gone to anything

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.200
and seen anything

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.200
my studio has optioned a script

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.200
that was number one on the blacklist

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.200
I know that I can repeat that to people

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.200
but that's not how it was brought to me

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.200
now the blacklist yeah again it's one of those things

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:04.200
it's just a bit of a popularity contest

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.200
when it first started out it was literally this guy

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.200
Franklin Leonard just asked his friends

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:10.200
what was their favorite movie script

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.200
that they'd read and he put them all together

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.200
and made a list out of it and then now it's become

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.200
this sort of other entity

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.200
but you know the idea though

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.200
that we ended up pretty high on the blacklist

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.200
without ever like

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.200
you know our whole thing was like this is a

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:26.200
fucking balls out comedy you gotta send it to

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.200
everybody you send it to the entire town

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.200
and like 5% are gonna love it

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.200
and they wouldn't send it to anybody

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.200
so yeah

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.200
you know it's um

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.200
I should read it Dan

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.200
if you think describing

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.200
the conceit will just make it sound

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.200
through in this country

01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.200
no it'll sound stupid again the whole idea was

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.200
to just like we just were like fuck it

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.200
about every rule of screenwriting while adhering

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.200
to every rule of screenwriting

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:54.200
so it's basically it's about a guy

01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:56.200
who you know has been leading his life

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.200
the way society tells him to

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:00.200
which is you know if I do if I keep my head down

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.200
and do good work I'll get you know the white picket fence

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.200
and the house and the wife and the two kids

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.200
and he comes to a point where he realizes

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.200
that like nothing in his life is going his way

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.200
get struck by lightning

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:12.200
um has a moment where

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.200
he realizes that there's nothing after life

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:16.200
but the reality is it's actually

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.200
like the circle of light

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.200
opens up behind him he's just too dumb

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.200
to look around and he comes he wakes

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.200
back up and he's just like fuck it I want

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.200
I'm gonna make a list of things I want that girl

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.200
that car and that job and then because he got hit

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.200
by lightning because he realized there's no point

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:32.200
to anything there's no point to waiting in

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.200
for the following rules so he just

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.200
goes balls out basically

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.200
and just starts doing whatever is necessary

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.200
to get what he wants and then realizes of course

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.200
that he's president of the United States

01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.200
that he's president of the United States

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.200
that was awesome

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.200
the laugh meter got closed to show clothes

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.200
I know but we are

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.200
we're trying to we're trying to go on a

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.200
show a runtime diet

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:00.200
we're like come on we should really

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.200
cut these calories and

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.200
if they if they react loudly enough

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:06.200
we should just end the show like

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:12.200
guard versus prisoner

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.200
guard versus prisoner

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.200

some socks the socks weren't
