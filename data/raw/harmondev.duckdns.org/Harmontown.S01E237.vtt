{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.080\nThere we go. Welcome, one and all, from Hollywood, California, Meltdown, Comics, Nerd, Melty,\n\n00:16.080 --> 00:30.720\nTheater, Harmontown is now in session. Don't be alarmed that I'm not wearing a tie tonight,\n\n00:30.720 --> 00:51.880\njust think we're going to get loose. Speaking of loose, let's bring out Spencer Crittenden. Solo\n\n00:51.880 --> 01:08.520\ncups down. Speaking of tights, let's bring out Mr. Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n01:08.520 --> 01:26.840\nThank you for coming to my show. Thank you, I know you could have done something else\n\n01:26.840 --> 01:43.960\nfor me. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, I really thank you, I'm full\n\n01:43.960 --> 01:50.520\nof gratitude for you. Also, I should mention, special vocal guest, Jello Biafra, tonight,\n\n01:50.520 --> 02:00.200\nwas fantastic. Not familiar with his style. You sounded just like him. Yeah, I think our\n\n02:00.200 --> 02:07.880\nguest tonight is, he's a writer, and he wrote a movie, I'm not introducing him yet, it sounds\n\n02:07.880 --> 02:13.840\nlike an introduction, but he wrote a movie, I was just watching an iTunes, it's the Stanford\n\n02:13.840 --> 02:21.480\nprison experiment. To feel good film. I think just talking to him about writing and talking\n\n02:21.480 --> 02:26.040\nabout that movie and all of the thoughts about that is like enough, like I don't need to\n\n02:26.040 --> 02:29.920\nbabble too much, I don't have anything that wouldn't fit within the context of a conversation\n\n02:29.920 --> 02:33.600\nwith him. I say you and I and Spencer, we catch up briefly, we talk about where we're\n\n02:33.600 --> 02:39.600\nat. Do we do business? We have some business to talk about, we have some important business.\n\n02:39.600 --> 02:46.240\nI haven't picked up my gun yet. Ten day waiting period has turned into two months of normalization\n\n02:46.240 --> 02:50.000\non my part, apparently I'm normalizing. So someone's going to break into your house and\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:53.480\nyou're going to be like, oh Jesus Christ, I got a run to Burbank to get to that gun store.\n\n02:53.480 --> 02:57.960\nIt would be the story of my life, I had Batman security cameras installed all over my house,\n\n02:57.960 --> 03:04.440\nand then I was part of some weird, lost village. When he says Batman security cameras, they\n\n03:04.440 --> 03:09.560\nhave little bats on it, like the under-oos of security cameras. And then I was, my\n\n03:09.560 --> 03:16.400\nmailbox was part of some lost feel as wide, wet bandits, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, mailbox\n\n03:16.400 --> 03:23.880\nraiding, where some two guys wanted to look at my piles of furniture catalogs really bad.\n\n03:23.880 --> 03:30.840\nAlso, I could have had them on camera, I could have, but whatever. Yes, of course, someone's\n\n03:30.840 --> 03:37.960\ngoing to break in before I get my gun, so I don't get to deliciously shoot them. I can't,\n\n03:37.960 --> 03:44.120\nI don't. But in a pre-Trump universe, if somebody was just like breaking into your\n\n03:44.120 --> 03:47.240\nhouse because they were poor and needed the money, you'd probably say, hey, take what\n\n03:47.240 --> 03:51.040\nyou want, but now you're going to feel like you're under siege. I think it's more like\n\n03:51.040 --> 04:00.440\nin a post-Trump universe, if someone's breaking in, I'm going to go, are you just poor? Are\n\n04:00.440 --> 04:07.280\nyou just out of food and money? And I'll wait for, yes. You've just told everyone to listen\n\n04:07.280 --> 04:11.240\nto the show how to break into your house without being shot.\n\n04:11.240 --> 04:17.280\nWell, the timbre of your voice is going to matter. You better be able to fake a very\n\n04:17.280 --> 04:25.920\nauthentic Latino sounding. You're not allowed to be offended by that because I'm saying\n\n04:25.920 --> 04:36.080\nI won't shoot you if you're Latino. That's the opposite of racism. It's reverse racism.\n\n04:36.080 --> 04:48.040\nThat's fantastic. If you sound white, I will fucking pop a cap in you. And white people\n\n04:48.040 --> 04:57.040\ndon't act like you don't, sound different when you're coming through a window. White\n\n04:57.040 --> 05:03.800\npeople come in your window like this. Can I have a cup of sugar? Anyways.\n\n05:03.800 --> 05:09.840\nBlack people come through your window. It's in the way that you use it. They love Eric\n\n05:09.840 --> 05:20.480\nClapton, black people. Enty? Okay. Enty nodded. All right. Where was I? Where was I? You\n\n05:20.480 --> 05:23.640\nwere saying that all Latinos are poor and white people are rich.\n\n05:23.640 --> 05:34.560\nI was saying that our brothers of a different color are under threat and in a post-Trump\n\n05:34.560 --> 05:45.040\napocalypse universe, my gun has been purchased for the sanctity of guarding my Danadoo. Not\n\n05:45.040 --> 05:56.800\nso much from the Huypilloy as from the assertors of a newfound fascist state.\n\n05:56.800 --> 05:59.320\nYou haven't had a desire to go scoop up this gun and take it out to the range?\n\n05:59.320 --> 06:02.840\nBecause I've been like, well, he's not doing very good at taking over everything. He's\n\n06:02.840 --> 06:08.280\nhaving a bad time. He seems to be doing as badly as I would do. He's very grumpy and\n\n06:08.280 --> 06:14.480\nhe's self-destructing. I don't think the gun will be needed to protect my home because\n\n06:14.480 --> 06:20.040\nI think that the ice caps will melt. I think I should go shopping for a canoe paddle before.\n\n06:20.040 --> 06:24.040\nWhat would you have to see on Twitter or here in your news alerts that made you get right\n\n06:24.040 --> 06:28.200\ninto a car and get to the gun shop? I would have to see CNN's Brian Stelter would have\n\n06:28.200 --> 06:39.760\nto say, another great day. Trump Hile. The leader is good. The leader is all.\n\n06:39.760 --> 06:46.920\nYeah. I'm keeping my eye on the journalists, the activists, the prominent folks. I'm keeping\n\n06:46.920 --> 06:52.280\nmy eye on certain buoys. If I see them go like this, I'm like, okay, the Jaws shark\n\n06:52.280 --> 06:57.960\nis here. I don't know. I got to go pick up the gun. What are we talking about? Don't\n\n06:57.960 --> 07:03.080\nworry, kids. I'm going to get my gun. You've just told a couple million people that you're\n\n07:03.080 --> 07:08.560\ncurrently unarmed at home right now. And if you ask for sugar, you can go right through\n\n07:08.560 --> 07:15.120\nthe window. You just fuck that up. You just, I know if you ask for sugar, you're white\n\n07:15.120 --> 07:21.040\nand I will fucking kill you. Oh, well, okay. You told, you told Latinos that they could\n\n07:21.040 --> 07:25.840\nask for sugar and go through the window if they could put on a nice fucking it up. No,\n\n07:25.840 --> 07:29.520\nif you're white and you don't want to get shot, go, I, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, when\n\n07:29.520 --> 07:36.840\nyou're coming in the window. If anything, I'm trying to, yes, and his fucked up racist\n\n07:36.840 --> 07:46.560\npoint of view. I'm here. I really have gone too far tonight. I'm not going to be, it's\n\n07:46.560 --> 07:51.760\nfucked up to like what you do. You antagonize and you, on our cut, you sabotage. It's fun\n\n07:51.760 --> 07:55.800\nto fuck with you. I try to get up here and I try to speak my mind and try to share my\n\n07:55.800 --> 07:59.840\nthoughts with people and you're like, what about this? What about that? And I'm like,\n\n07:59.840 --> 08:03.520\nwhat are you talking about? What are you talking about? And then I try to explain myself and\n\n08:03.520 --> 08:11.520\nyou're like, aha, like, am I your enemy? These kids need wisdom. They need to know what\n\n08:11.520 --> 08:23.520\ncolor they're allowed to be if they're coming in my window. The answer is less than white.\n\n08:23.520 --> 08:37.560\nI mean, I'll let the audience handle that one. I think it's, I think it's more embarrassing\n\n08:37.560 --> 08:41.520\nthe amount of time someone said less than white and then I went less than white and\n\n08:41.520 --> 08:49.840\nthen the whole audience went, whoa. My white audience was like, bingo. We are, we are\n\n08:49.840 --> 09:01.520\ninstitutionally racist. Yeah, less than white. What are you going to do? It's how we see\n\n09:01.520 --> 09:07.560\nthe world. Fragility, we were talking about tonight and the ride over here. The thing\n\n09:07.560 --> 09:13.800\nthat made me buy a gun, the thing that I have in common with the people that we would probably,\n\n09:13.800 --> 09:19.800\nI'm assuming most of us liberal, would associate with our so-called enemy on the other side\n\n09:19.800 --> 09:24.000\nof the political spectrum. The thing we have in common, the thing that I have in common,\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.600\nspeak for myself is like fragility, the fact that I experienced things not going my way\n\n09:28.600 --> 09:33.640\nand then I went and bought fucking hardware that puts holes in people because it was like\n\n09:33.640 --> 09:38.120\nno matter, no matter the Al Gore's and dangling chads and the whatever is in the primaries\n\n09:38.120 --> 09:44.040\nand all this shit, I had the luxury of going like systems. And then, and like something\n\n09:44.040 --> 09:48.240\nreal happened that made me actually think this is going to change my schedule. This\n\n09:48.240 --> 09:52.760\nis going to change how I have to behave next Tuesday. I'm going to be held accountable\n\n09:52.760 --> 09:57.680\nto something and I went and bought a gun. It's called fragility and it doesn't matter\n\n09:57.680 --> 10:01.440\nhow right you are, how wrong you are, how smart you are, how logical you are. It's\n\n10:01.440 --> 10:05.800\nlike it's a thing that's associated with privilege. You've been privileged. You're\n\n10:05.800 --> 10:12.680\nmore fragile. You're going to be more reacting to things that are on a smaller scale than\n\n10:12.680 --> 10:18.800\nsomebody who's maybe put up with shit and had to be desensitized to it and realized\n\n10:18.800 --> 10:23.640\nthat, oh, there's a pick your battles thing or whatever you would call it. And it's like,\n\n10:23.640 --> 10:27.360\nthat's what we're learning firsthand. All of that talk, all that white privilege, all\n\n10:27.360 --> 10:32.000\nthat stuff that I would get offended by and be like, well, wait a minute, hold on a second.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:36.360\nIt's not logical. See, there's nothing logical about it. It's like a gut reaction. You find\n\n10:36.360 --> 10:43.260\nout what you're made of and it turns out to be glass, beautiful, pristine fucking sugar\n\n10:43.260 --> 10:49.880\nglass as soon as something goes wrong that fucks up with your picture of the universe.\n\n10:49.880 --> 10:57.040\nI bought a gun. I turned into a fucking Sandy Hook truther. In terms of my behavior, I was\n\n10:57.040 --> 10:58.360\njust like, I want my gun.\n\n10:58.360 --> 11:03.200\nYeah, we could have seen some bodies if that really happened, right?\n\n11:03.200 --> 11:09.200\nWe've waited this long to share with you something special about Spencer.\n\n11:09.200 --> 11:11.200\nNo, and you already like me. It's too late.\n\n11:11.200 --> 11:19.200\nI have to say, you already signed off on Spencer. He's a Sandy Hook truther.\n\n11:19.200 --> 11:24.200\nIf there's any person in podcast history that could maybe get you to sign off on that,\n\n11:24.200 --> 11:25.200\nwould it have to be Spencer?\n\n11:25.200 --> 11:31.200\nSpencer talked long enough, like five minutes, I'd be like, all right, maybe I guess, why\n\n11:31.200 --> 11:36.200\nwas that corner acting so weird?\n\n11:36.200 --> 11:40.920\nI went down a Sandy Hook hole today because I was listening to true crime podcasts and\n\n11:40.920 --> 11:45.200\nthen there was mention of Sandy Hook and then there was reference. When Sandy Hook happened,\n\n11:45.200 --> 11:52.200\nI was probably doing community and I was probably also just like the gross, you don't want to\n\n11:52.200 --> 11:59.200\nknow about it, like most of us, but now it's interesting. It's like the magma's cooled and\n\n11:59.200 --> 12:02.200\nthe stakes seem so much higher in this different spot.\n\n12:02.200 --> 12:06.200\nAnd it's like all these things are like, so from a true crime perspective, Sandy Hook\n\n12:06.200 --> 12:10.200\ngets mentioned and I started like, they started mentioning like the thing.\n\n12:10.200 --> 12:12.200\nI just started the today of all days.\n\n12:12.200 --> 12:15.200\nI like went there. I was like, what was all that business?\n\n12:15.200 --> 12:19.200\nWhy were people thinking it was fake and what was going on?\n\n12:19.200 --> 12:25.200\nAnd as I was going through it, I thought it was really interesting to note that like,\n\n12:25.200 --> 12:31.200\nit wasn't just like, it was like, you had to be a whack job to think that it was fake,\n\n12:31.200 --> 12:36.200\nbut you also, excuse me, I burped, you have to, you also had to be a whack job who was\n\n12:36.200 --> 12:43.200\nabsolutely convinced that Obama was like Hitler, like he was going to get you.\n\n12:43.200 --> 12:48.200\nHe was going to, you know, and I would personally speculate that that absolutely,\n\n12:48.200 --> 12:54.200\ngiven the total lack of empirical evidence that Obama was going to get us, like I have to,\n\n12:54.200 --> 12:59.200\nI'm sorry to play this card, but I have to assume you're a little itty bitty racist\n\n12:59.200 --> 13:02.200\nif you really thought from the moment that he got inaugurated that you're like,\n\n13:02.200 --> 13:04.200\nshit's going down.\n\n13:04.200 --> 13:09.200\nBecause if you weren't, if you didn't have that, I think it comes down to that.\n\n13:09.200 --> 13:12.200\nI do also think it came down to something other than emails,\n\n13:12.200 --> 13:17.200\nwhy you were choosing with all your logical fucking things,\n\n13:17.200 --> 13:20.200\nall your speeches that you made about why you're voting this way and that way,\n\n13:20.200 --> 13:24.200\nyou know, your very salient points about the status quo and how to shake things up\n\n13:24.200 --> 13:30.200\nand all these things like, you don't like the vagina, you don't like the black people.\n\n13:30.200 --> 13:33.200\nBecause I think there's other ways to rebel.\n\n13:33.200 --> 13:36.200\nBut what am I going to do? What am I going to say to some kid who's like,\n\n13:36.200 --> 13:38.200\nI'm going to stir things up.\n\n13:38.200 --> 13:43.200\nBut I just thought it was very interesting looking at three-year-old like cooled obsidian,\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:49.200\nlike people freaking out and recognizing the distorted shape of myself,\n\n13:49.200 --> 13:54.200\nlike seeing people that were so hysterical,\n\n13:54.200 --> 13:59.200\nthat were so convinced that they were living in the end times politically,\n\n13:59.200 --> 14:05.200\nthat in the very real moment of two dozen children being massacred,\n\n14:05.200 --> 14:12.200\nthat they would actually, that politics could interfere that greatly\n\n14:12.200 --> 14:16.200\nwith your fundamental human need for empathy,\n\n14:16.200 --> 14:21.200\nthat you would actually just skirt around it and start actually,\n\n14:21.200 --> 14:25.200\nyou would rather just live in an alternate universe.\n\n14:25.200 --> 14:30.200\nAnd I don't think every single person that flocked towards those YouTube videos\n\n14:30.200 --> 14:34.200\nthat are all the first thing that comes up when you Google Sandy Hook,\n\n14:34.200 --> 14:38.200\nI think those clicks aren't all the result of mental illness.\n\n14:38.200 --> 14:43.200\nI think you have to be pretty mentally ill to like put a lot of arrows and things\n\n14:43.200 --> 14:46.200\nand freeze frames and do all the things that the people that were presenting the videos,\n\n14:46.200 --> 14:49.200\nbut then there's people that they wanted it to be true.\n\n14:49.200 --> 14:52.200\nAnd the rhetoric about the, oh, the occupier-in-chief,\n\n14:52.200 --> 14:54.200\nand oh, he just wants this and he wants that.\n\n14:54.200 --> 14:57.200\nThey were living in this Wizard of Oz where there was a wicked witch\n\n14:57.200 --> 15:00.200\nand we just got to get to the Emerald City of the truth\n\n15:00.200 --> 15:03.200\nand everyone's going to get what they want as though they're trying to take away\n\n15:03.200 --> 15:05.200\nand just going to throw the bucket of water.\n\n15:05.200 --> 15:10.200\nThey're just not really acknowledging the fact that what they're doing in the present moment\n\n15:10.200 --> 15:14.200\nis haranguing the parents of murdered children.\n\n15:14.200 --> 15:19.200\nAnd it's like we're feeling that way right now.\n\n15:19.200 --> 15:21.200\nI am feeling that way.\n\n15:21.200 --> 15:23.200\nI'm feeling the way they're feeling.\n\n15:23.200 --> 15:26.200\nThat doesn't mean that I'm as crazy as them.\n\n15:26.200 --> 15:28.200\nIt doesn't mean that I'm as wrong as them.\n\n15:28.200 --> 15:38.200\nBut it does mean that we have the ability to fucking like just abandon all everything that makes us good\n\n15:38.200 --> 15:42.200\nwhen we get excited, when we get righteous and stuff.\n\n15:42.200 --> 15:46.200\nAnd I was like looking at my reflection of that twisted wreckage\n\n15:46.200 --> 15:48.200\nand I have no point to any of you.\n\n15:48.200 --> 15:51.200\nSo I was already feeling depressed, but now you're telling me,\n\n15:51.200 --> 15:53.200\nplus on top of that, get over myself?\n\n15:53.200 --> 15:55.200\nWhat are you telling me?\n\n15:55.200 --> 15:56.200\nI'm not saying that.\n\n15:56.200 --> 15:58.200\nI'm just saying like, I don't know, man.\n\n15:58.200 --> 16:01.200\nI watched this documentary with this guy, Darryl Davis, who's like the guy.\n\n16:01.200 --> 16:02.200\nDid you guys see that?\n\n16:02.200 --> 16:04.200\nIt was like, I can't remember what the title of it is.\n\n16:04.200 --> 16:10.200\nHe's like a guy who like, he befriended, he's a black guy that befriended Ku Klux Klan people.\n\n16:10.200 --> 16:15.200\nLike for years and years, he's been like, I don't have enough time to talk about it.\n\n16:15.200 --> 16:16.200\nYou should watch that documentary.\n\n16:16.200 --> 16:18.200\nFind it on Netflix or whatever.\n\n16:18.200 --> 16:23.200\nAnd sit through it because he kind of, it's like, there's a point like 45 minutes in where you're kind of like,\n\n16:23.200 --> 16:32.200\nI get it, BB King played good guitar, but like, it feels a little bit at a certain point.\n\n16:32.200 --> 16:36.200\nLike, like for the first half, like your things are being repeated over and over again.\n\n16:36.200 --> 16:38.200\nThen he goes to Baltimore.\n\n16:38.200 --> 16:43.200\nAnd like he, the shit is just happening like, like crazy shit.\n\n16:43.200 --> 16:50.200\nSo there's millennial activists, millennial black activists sitting down at a table with him after you've already watched the,\n\n16:50.200 --> 16:56.200\nthe polite whimsy of him sitting down with leaders of the KKK and skinheads and all these things.\n\n16:56.200 --> 17:02.200\nAnd you take from it what you will. And then he goes to Baltimore and it's, it gets fucking balloon animal.\n\n17:02.200 --> 17:04.200\nLike, it's crazy.\n\n17:04.200 --> 17:08.200\nLike, like you just, you walk away from the whole thing, I will warn you a little sad.\n\n17:08.200 --> 17:11.200\nI mean, because it's like, fuck, we're all fucked.\n\n17:11.200 --> 17:18.200\nBut, but, but it also, it's like, it's not like, like, like, oh, just watch this documentary about how we're all fucked.\n\n17:18.200 --> 17:26.200\nIt's more like, watch, like, watch this documentary about Daryl Davis that like, it puts so much shit under the microscope.\n\n17:26.200 --> 17:28.200\nI've talked enough.\n\n17:28.200 --> 17:33.200\nAnd talked enough. It's my show. Fuck you people.\n\n17:33.200 --> 17:37.200\nYou haven't begun to talk. This is, this is your night.\n\n17:37.200 --> 17:40.200\nI'm obviously a little buzzed or something.\n\n17:40.200 --> 17:43.200\nIf your next, if your next breath was going to be bringing our guest.\n\n17:43.200 --> 17:44.200\nYes, I was going to bring out our guest.\n\n17:44.200 --> 17:46.200\nCan I, can I interject one little thing?\n\n17:46.200 --> 17:55.200\nYeah. For those of you who have been wondering that, well, whether or not the three of us, or this show would never get back to a D&D game, or a Pathfinder role-playing game.\n\n17:55.200 --> 17:59.200\nWe decided not to.\n\n17:59.200 --> 18:07.200\nWe decided Dan's race monologues were enough for you people.\n\n18:07.200 --> 18:15.200\nBut today we've actually generated characters. We're not playing tonight, but we have, we have, we have, we have a whole thing coming up.\n\n18:15.200 --> 18:17.200\nIt's going to start, it's going to be a doozy.\n\n18:17.200 --> 18:22.200\nThere was a little clerical error. The characters we rolled were less than white.\n\n18:22.200 --> 18:33.200\nWe're going to re-roll some stats and, and make them as much as white.\n\n18:33.200 --> 18:37.200\nOh boy.\n\n18:37.200 --> 18:41.200\nI want this episode to be called less than white just to see what happens for you.\n\n18:41.200 --> 18:44.200\nFor your, for your, for your career.\n\n18:44.200 --> 18:59.200\nI mean, if, if, if my ironic, based in reality, because I'm a generation X foot, foot and mouth asshole racism, is that if we have a crucifixion of me, just, just do it next to the White House.\n\n18:59.200 --> 19:04.200\nThat's all I ask. Just like, just, and just put racist above my head.\n\n19:04.200 --> 19:09.200\nLike, like, and, and, and just like, I just demand, does everybody just fucking like spit on my corpse?\n\n19:09.200 --> 19:15.200\nAnd, and, and I just want anybody that works in Washington to be like, what did he do wrong? Well, he was racist.\n\n19:15.200 --> 19:19.200\nAnd I just want that person's lunch to change.\n\n19:19.200 --> 19:24.200\nBecause they're going to be like, he was right. Fuck.\n\n19:24.200 --> 19:33.200\nI heard his podcast. He got a little tipsy sometimes, but Jesus Christ, I'm an actual, I get out there and really do the hard racist work.\n\n19:33.200 --> 19:38.200\nI did, I did like a whistle stop thing. Yeah.\n\n19:38.200 --> 19:41.200\nI bought a weird hat. I sewed some things on my shoulder.\n\n19:41.200 --> 19:48.200\nI dressed as R2D2 to leave a town hall meeting under the auspices that it was early trick or treat.\n\n19:48.200 --> 19:53.200\nAll right. So our next guest is all around screenwriter, TV, movies.\n\n19:53.200 --> 20:00.200\nLike I said, his, the most recent thing I was watching, maybe he's done more than this recently. Let's talk to him and find out.\n\n20:00.200 --> 20:19.200\nPlease welcome our new friend, Tim Talbot.\n\n20:19.200 --> 20:25.200\nUh, I got your name right and everything, right? Like I didn't, I'm a bad interviewer. Just, I don't know if I told you that backstage.\n\n20:25.200 --> 20:30.200\nI'm a bad interviewer, but, but, but bad interviewee. Okay. Good. This will be great.\n\n20:30.200 --> 20:32.200\nThis will be awesome. This will go great.\n\n20:32.200 --> 20:37.200\nUm, so I'm going to put a pin in like how you got started because I think your first job was South Park, right?\n\n20:37.200 --> 20:41.200\nLike, first, yeah, like real kind of professional job.\n\n20:41.200 --> 20:45.200\nWell, I mean, before that, I actually got hired to write a TV movie for MTV.\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:49.200\nOh, okay. Hey, Tim, I'm sorry, just, just for audio here, get, get right in that microphone.\n\n20:49.200 --> 20:51.200\nGet right in there. Okay. Yeah.\n\n20:51.200 --> 21:00.200\nUm, yeah, but like the, oh yeah, you're a Spencer, does it? Yeah.\n\n21:00.200 --> 21:07.200\nUm, yeah. So like the first real sort of kind of professional, um, for a network job was for South Park.\n\n21:07.200 --> 21:10.200\nYeah. Like you, uh, what did you send in the script?\n\n21:10.200 --> 21:12.200\nNow I said I put a pin in it, but now I'm talking about it.\n\n21:12.200 --> 21:20.200\nSo you, okay. No, actually what happened was when I first moved out here right out of college, I, um, became friends with a lot of people that were people's assistants.\n\n21:20.200 --> 21:25.200\nAnd one of them was a woman named Amy Cohen, who was George Clooney's assistant at the time.\n\n21:25.200 --> 21:31.200\nAnd George was like one of the guys that sent out that first spirit of Christmas take to everyone.\n\n21:31.200 --> 21:35.200\nAnd so through her, I met Matt and Trey's assistant.\n\n21:35.200 --> 21:39.200\nUm, and then just for like a couple of years, I was like in their group.\n\n21:39.200 --> 21:42.200\nSo I was going to all their parties and all that kind of stuff.\n\n21:42.200 --> 21:45.200\nAnd, um, so they never read a word of it.\n\n21:45.200 --> 21:47.200\nIt was like, oh, that guy's funny. Bring him in.\n\n21:47.200 --> 21:53.200\nYou're clearly confident enough that you didn't insert any fake like, and then I won a talent contest.\n\n21:53.200 --> 21:58.200\nNo, it was just like, I hung out with those guys at a party and that's the way they ran their room.\n\n21:58.200 --> 22:05.200\nI, I, I, everyone's story of like, if you're paying your rent with writing, you're one of the fortunate ones.\n\n22:05.200 --> 22:08.200\nThen people ask about your origin story.\n\n22:08.200 --> 22:13.200\nHow did you go from being Tony Stark to having this whole thing with the Jarvis and everything?\n\n22:13.200 --> 22:18.200\nLike, and the answer is never as satisfying as well.\n\n22:18.200 --> 22:25.200\nI got blown up by my own Schrab.el and I had an awakening of the spirit that was brought to me by a magical person that was less than white in a cave.\n\n22:25.200 --> 22:30.200\nUm, I like, we never have that story.\n\n22:30.200 --> 22:32.200\nWe don't, we are not able to impart to them.\n\n22:32.200 --> 22:34.200\nHow do you, you cope with that really well?\n\n22:34.200 --> 22:41.200\nCause you just told the story that was like, I ran a, I turned, I turned, I turned right on a green light and I slipped into an appeal.\n\n22:41.200 --> 22:46.200\nWell, no, before that though, I actually, um, you know, I, I, I wanted to be an editor when I moved out here.\n\n22:46.200 --> 22:50.200\nI went to film school and, and, uh, editing was the only job that I could stand.\n\n22:50.200 --> 22:54.200\nLike everything else was just, you know, you can't ever write what exactly what you want to write.\n\n22:54.200 --> 22:55.200\nCause you went to film school.\n\n22:55.200 --> 22:56.200\nYeah, I did.\n\n22:56.200 --> 23:07.200\nSo how did you know, did you do, and when they teach you editing in film school, did they teach you that it's going to be like, there's a person behind you over your shoulder that isn't, that isn't possible.\n\n23:07.200 --> 23:08.200\nNo.\n\n23:08.200 --> 23:10.200\nThey're just teaching you the crap.\n\n23:10.200 --> 23:17.200\nNo, they literally, the, the thing that was really kind of cool about the school I went to was that, uh, day one, it was like a very much like a tech school.\n\n23:17.200 --> 23:19.200\nSo here's a camera, go start making shit.\n\n23:19.200 --> 23:24.200\nUm, and then I found that in the process of making shit, it was so frustrating.\n\n23:24.200 --> 23:25.200\nWe couldn't get good actors.\n\n23:25.200 --> 23:28.200\nWe couldn't, you know, the, the cinematography was never what you wanted.\n\n23:28.200 --> 23:34.200\nAnd then you finally get to the point where you have to edit your film and there's a pile of shit you got to make into China.\n\n23:34.200 --> 23:37.200\nAnd, um, for me, that was like as creative as writing.\n\n23:37.200 --> 23:38.200\nRight, right.\n\n23:38.200 --> 23:40.200\nUm, so I, yeah, I'm like one of those.\n\n23:40.200 --> 23:45.200\nI'm sorry, you became a, you, you got into editing after being asked to be a director and a filmmaker.\n\n23:45.200 --> 23:48.200\nAnd you said, no, I just, I just prefer the editing part or.\n\n23:48.200 --> 23:50.200\nWell, pretty much like when you're in film school, you do everything.\n\n23:50.200 --> 23:51.200\nOkay.\n\n23:51.200 --> 24:00.200\nAnd, and part of my whole thing was that I figured out that, um, if I'm going to be a director, um, I have to know the limitations of everyone else's job.\n\n24:00.200 --> 24:05.200\nSo you crew on everybody else's movies and, and you just kind of come to, to like what you like.\n\n24:05.200 --> 24:10.200\nBut with editing, for me, it was just everything about the process up until that point was such a disappointment.\n\n24:10.200 --> 24:16.200\nThat finally to be locked in a room and just be like, well, now make this into something that you were not ashamed to show to people.\n\n24:16.200 --> 24:17.200\nRight.\n\n24:17.200 --> 24:18.200\nWas cool.\n\n24:18.200 --> 24:23.200\nAnd then when I moved to California, uh, I moved out here with like 20 bucks in my pocket and one friend from college.\n\n24:23.200 --> 24:27.200\nAnd I might as well have stayed on the East coast because I couldn't get my foot in the door anywhere.\n\n24:27.200 --> 24:33.200\nUm, and then I figured out that the only thing I could do without being hired to do it was to write a screenplay.\n\n24:33.200 --> 24:34.200\nRight.\n\n24:34.200 --> 24:44.200\nAnd, um, you know, I just started writing and got repped off the first screenplay and, and, and luckily I also met a trust fund kid from New Jersey who wanted to be a producer.\n\n24:44.200 --> 24:45.200\nDonald Trump.\n\n24:45.200 --> 24:46.200\nIt was not Trump.\n\n24:46.200 --> 24:50.200\nUm, but he basically paid for me to learn how to write.\n\n24:50.200 --> 24:53.200\nSo I wrote three scripts for this guy before I ever got hired for anything.\n\n24:53.200 --> 24:54.200\nThat sounds familiar.\n\n24:54.200 --> 24:58.200\nI mean, I feel like I, yeah, we, we, we airbrush our backstories.\n\n24:58.200 --> 25:04.200\nLike I, I, I could get really specific about my path from Milwaukee to Los Angeles.\n\n25:04.200 --> 25:10.200\nIt does involve like a little like low rent benefactors who are like, like, like, like there's like, it's, it's always very molecular and granular.\n\n25:10.200 --> 25:19.200\nAnyways, but, uh, but it's never, it's never a satisfying thing to say to a kid who's saying, how do I get where you are?\n\n25:19.200 --> 25:20.200\nTell me.\n\n25:20.200 --> 25:22.200\nAnd you can never give them a straight answer.\n\n25:22.200 --> 25:24.200\nWell, there is a straight answer to that.\n\n25:24.200 --> 25:25.200\nAnd that's just don't leave.\n\n25:25.200 --> 25:26.200\nI mean, literally the people.\n\n25:26.200 --> 25:30.200\nYou know, if you, if you literally just keep doing it, don't leave where you are.\n\n25:30.200 --> 25:31.200\nNo, don't know.\n\n25:31.200 --> 25:37.200\nI'm saying if you come to California and you want to be a writer, you come to California and you keep writing and sooner or later you're going to get in.\n\n25:37.200 --> 25:38.200\nRight.\n\n25:38.200 --> 25:39.200\nThere's no, there's no easy path.\n\n25:39.200 --> 25:40.200\nIt's always a catch 22.\n\n25:40.200 --> 25:41.200\nYeah.\n\n25:41.200 --> 25:43.200\nThat's what, you know, always default to like, well, okay.\n\n25:43.200 --> 25:44.200\nYeah.\n\n25:44.200 --> 25:55.200\nYou just, you're going to have to like writing so much that you'd be willing to do it for 30 years and then get hit by a bus and die because I don't want your blood on my hands at the end of it.\n\n25:55.200 --> 25:58.200\nAnd I got to a point where I would have been fine doing that.\n\n25:58.200 --> 26:00.200\nAnd then all of a sudden I got lucky.\n\n26:00.200 --> 26:01.200\nAll right.\n\n26:01.200 --> 26:08.200\nAnyways, but, but so, so we can talk about the early days of South Park later, but I kind of want to get to the Stanford prison experiment thing.\n\n26:08.200 --> 26:10.200\nBecause I just started watching that movie.\n\n26:10.200 --> 26:18.200\nSo, so I asked you in the green room, maybe we'll retread and we'll pretend I'm asking you for the first time.\n\n26:18.200 --> 26:20.200\nHow accurate is this movie go?\n\n26:20.200 --> 26:21.200\n85%.\n\n26:21.200 --> 26:23.200\nIt literally is.\n\n26:23.200 --> 26:35.200\nIt's one of those things where, as I was telling you in the green room for years, they were trying to make this story and Hollywood in their wonderful way always like the story wasn't enough for them.\n\n26:35.200 --> 26:39.200\nThey wanted to make it into more and make it into the stakes have to be life and death.\n\n26:39.200 --> 26:41.200\nIt's got to be have like huge emotional stakes.\n\n26:41.200 --> 26:52.200\nYou know, an earlier draft HBO was going to do that Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to that was about a guard and a prisoner that were best friends and there was a girl on the outside and a weird love triangle.\n\n26:52.200 --> 26:54.200\nAnd it's like, what the fuck is this?\n\n26:54.200 --> 27:01.200\nYou know, and when I first got approached to work on the project, I was completely, I didn't believe it.\n\n27:01.200 --> 27:04.200\nI didn't take any psych classes in college or anything.\n\n27:04.200 --> 27:05.200\nI knew nothing about it.\n\n27:05.200 --> 27:13.200\nAnd I'm just like, there's nothing you can do to me that's going to make me believe after three days that, you know, a classroom with fake bars on the door is a prison I can't get out of.\n\n27:13.200 --> 27:19.200\nAnd it was only when I dove into sort of the research with doctors and Bardo that I realized, holy shit, this is fascinating.\n\n27:19.200 --> 27:22.200\nAnd this is human, this is like a real thing.\n\n27:22.200 --> 27:24.200\nSo Bardo is the guy that ran the whole thing.\n\n27:24.200 --> 27:28.200\nYeah, he's the guy that, he does not come off heroically in the movie.\n\n27:28.200 --> 27:29.200\nNot at all.\n\n27:29.200 --> 27:36.200\nBut, but, but, but at the same time, it's like, you could say the same thing about DiCaprio as Howard Hughes and the aviator.\n\n27:36.200 --> 27:40.200\nHe does not come off heroically and yet, but he does have a lot of urine.\n\n27:40.200 --> 27:45.200\nHe's, he's a, he's the genius who thought of this experiment.\n\n27:45.200 --> 27:49.200\nAnd my favorite line of the movie, this isn't really a spoiler.\n\n27:49.200 --> 28:00.200\nI think this gets to the crux of why we all heard the phrase Stanford Prison Experiment in high school is, but it was like, everyone's arguing about what's going on.\n\n28:00.200 --> 28:05.200\nThere's talking about the relationship between two guys, one's a prisoner, one's a guard.\n\n28:05.200 --> 28:11.200\nAnd then the Zimbardo character is sitting back in his hot curled hair and his Boogie Knight suit.\n\n28:11.200 --> 28:15.200\nAnd he, and he goes like, guys, guys, you're missing the larger point.\n\n28:15.200 --> 28:19.200\nThe point is that the two guys you're talking about were separated by a coin toss.\n\n28:19.200 --> 28:24.200\nAnd that really was, that's why we continue to refer to the Stanford Prison Experiment.\n\n28:24.200 --> 28:27.200\nIt's not because it was immaculately scientific.\n\n28:27.200 --> 28:33.200\nIt's, it was, if anything, totally dramatic and fantastical.\n\n28:33.200 --> 28:36.200\nIt was, they, they, they didn't, they didn't set out.\n\n28:36.200 --> 28:40.200\nI always pictured, I was telling you in the green room every time I heard about the Stanford Prison Experiment,\n\n28:40.200 --> 28:45.200\nwhich for anyone who's, you know, the headline of it that you hear about in high school is,\n\n28:45.200 --> 28:51.200\nokay, they did this college experiment where they took a group of volunteers, they made some of them randomly guards,\n\n28:51.200 --> 28:53.200\nand they made some of them randomly prisoners.\n\n28:53.200 --> 29:01.200\nAnd what happened over time very quickly is that they fell into roles of abusiveness that, that transcended any rules that they were given.\n\n29:01.200 --> 29:03.200\nThe guards were abusive to the prisoners.\n\n29:03.200 --> 29:05.200\nThe prisoners were abusive to each other.\n\n29:05.200 --> 29:06.200\nAbuse, abuse, abuse, abuse.\n\n29:06.200 --> 29:09.200\nIt all happened even though it was all a big game.\n\n29:09.200 --> 29:11.200\nIt just happened for real.\n\n29:11.200 --> 29:21.200\nAnd even as the movie represents, it, it spread upward to Zimbardo who started acting like the prison warden,\n\n29:21.200 --> 29:28.200\nstarted becoming paranoid about one of the escaped prisoners coming back to, but, you know, like he began,\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:35.200\nhe himself became part of the experiment because it wasn't science, it was art, and it was, but it was very valid art\n\n29:35.200 --> 29:43.200\nthat you could refer to very scientifically when you say, yeah, but circumstances fuck you up.\n\n29:43.200 --> 29:52.200\nIf you're deprived of your freedom in any way, you are, you begin to behave like someone that is not free,\n\n29:52.200 --> 29:56.200\nand you start verifying all of these negative expectations of yourself.\n\n29:56.200 --> 30:02.200\nIf you are given privilege and power, you start overreacting to threats to it,\n\n30:02.200 --> 30:07.200\nbecause you think that someone dropping a pencil means that you should go fuck yourself,\n\n30:07.200 --> 30:11.200\nand that you, you start seeing the merits and coming down hard and drawing a line in the sand,\n\n30:11.200 --> 30:16.200\nand it starts with guys going, why am I talking so much? You're on the show.\n\n30:16.200 --> 30:19.200\nWhat did you, what was your process like when you're getting this job?\n\n30:19.200 --> 30:23.200\nLike, I want to hear about the, like, like how much, how much reading did you have to do to write this screenplay?\n\n30:23.200 --> 30:28.200\nWell, I had to do a lot. I got all of, you know, we had, you know, Zimbardo's life rights,\n\n30:28.200 --> 30:31.200\nand he was open to us, so I got to talk to him whenever I needed to.\n\n30:31.200 --> 30:35.200\nI interviewed him and his wife together and separately.\n\n30:35.200 --> 30:39.200\nHe sent me all the original paperwork from the experiment that they, they documented everything.\n\n30:39.200 --> 30:42.200\nI mean, everybody, that's one thing, you know, there's so much happened in those six days\n\n30:42.200 --> 30:45.200\nthat you can't put it all in a movie.\n\n30:45.200 --> 30:51.200\nBut one of the things they did is they had a standard set of questions that they asked all the prisoners every day.\n\n30:51.200 --> 30:56.200\nAnd you could just see them, you know, through, when you read this stuff, it's fascinating that they are being dehumanized.\n\n30:56.200 --> 31:02.200\nAnd even there's a bit in the movie where they're asked to write a letter home after two days,\n\n31:02.200 --> 31:06.200\nand half of the kids signed their number and not their name.\n\n31:06.200 --> 31:10.200\nBecause it had been drilled into them so much over the previous couple of days.\n\n31:10.200 --> 31:13.200\nBecause they thought they would get rebuked because their mail would be gone through,\n\n31:13.200 --> 31:15.200\nand they would, like, they'd get in trouble for not doing that?\n\n31:15.200 --> 31:17.200\nWell, they knew their mail would be gone through.\n\n31:17.200 --> 31:19.200\nNo, they knew it would be gone through because they were not allowed to seal their envelopes.\n\n31:19.200 --> 31:21.200\nThey had to hand them back, so they were going to be read.\n\n31:21.200 --> 31:23.200\nSo they became a number just in case?\n\n31:23.200 --> 31:29.200\nYeah, I think it was just more that the indoctrination of the first couple of days really started to work on them.\n\n31:29.200 --> 31:34.200\nWhen you're referred to as a number and not a name, over and over again, and you're sleep deprived,\n\n31:34.200 --> 31:39.200\nand you have to, like, rattle off your number a thousand times a day, it was just easier.\n\n31:39.200 --> 31:40.200\nIt became sort of their identity.\n\n31:40.200 --> 31:43.200\nSo you worked and met Zimbardo?\n\n31:43.200 --> 31:44.200\nOh, yeah.\n\n31:44.200 --> 31:50.200\nAnd how does he look back on this, and what's it like having this rehashed through?\n\n31:50.200 --> 31:56.200\nWell, the good thing about him is that he absolutely 100% owns it.\n\n31:56.200 --> 31:58.200\nYou know, he's like, I realized I fucked up.\n\n31:58.200 --> 32:01.200\nI fucked up by making myself part of the experiment.\n\n32:01.200 --> 32:03.200\nAnd it really took, you know, I mean, if you've seen the movie,\n\n32:03.200 --> 32:08.200\nit took someone from the outside coming in to really say,\n\n32:08.200 --> 32:11.200\nhey, you guys are totally fucking up here.\n\n32:11.200 --> 32:13.200\nYou have to stop this, because nobody else saw it.\n\n32:13.200 --> 32:17.200\nThey just saw, wow, we're getting a really cool, this is a real study.\n\n32:17.200 --> 32:21.200\nIt's we're getting real information and didn't realize that they were hurting people in the process.\n\n32:21.200 --> 32:23.200\nBut now, wait a minute.\n\n32:23.200 --> 32:28.200\nI mean, and I confess, I forgot about a Harmontown meeting that was happening at my house,\n\n32:28.200 --> 32:30.200\nso I haven't actually watched the end of the movie.\n\n32:30.200 --> 32:31.200\nSo spoilers.\n\n32:31.200 --> 32:32.200\nI haven't gotten to the third act yet.\n\n32:32.200 --> 32:36.200\nThe story we hear in high school is the experiment got out of control,\n\n32:36.200 --> 32:41.200\nbut much like Frankenstein's experiment, mythically,\n\n32:41.200 --> 32:46.200\nthe thing that made it a disaster is the valuable thing about it.\n\n32:46.200 --> 32:50.200\nI mean, does Zimbardo, does he look at it as like, yeah,\n\n32:50.200 --> 32:52.200\nthat thing I did that was like groundbreaking,\n\n32:52.200 --> 32:56.200\nor is the whole thing just a cautionary tale and a carrion tragedy?\n\n32:56.200 --> 32:57.200\nI think it's closer to that.\n\n32:57.200 --> 33:02.200\nI think that one of the things is that when you first start reading about it and not talking to him directly,\n\n33:02.200 --> 33:04.200\nit's got its own life out there.\n\n33:04.200 --> 33:09.200\nHe's got his own like media life and the media and reporters and stuff\n\n33:09.200 --> 33:15.200\nhave built him up to be this guy that designed this experiment to generate that response.\n\n33:15.200 --> 33:16.200\nRight.\n\n33:16.200 --> 33:20.200\nWhere the actual fact was he didn't expect anything from this.\n\n33:20.200 --> 33:24.200\nThis was no different than any other experiment that they'd been doing at Stanford,\n\n33:24.200 --> 33:28.200\nother than the fact that it was a 24-hour day experiment and it was going to go for two weeks.\n\n33:28.200 --> 33:31.200\nWhat kind of data do you think he thought he was going to get?\n\n33:31.200 --> 33:35.200\nThere's a clear point in your narrative where it's like, oh, shit, this is,\n\n33:35.200 --> 33:40.200\nand then the eyes get big, but what kind of data in his mind, like...\n\n33:40.200 --> 33:45.200\nI think, well, part of the Navy were one of the people that funded the experiment\n\n33:45.200 --> 33:52.200\nand they wanted to know what kind of mental effects incarceration would have on people like in submarines.\n\n33:52.200 --> 33:54.200\nHow were they going to measure it, though?\n\n33:54.200 --> 33:58.200\nLike, were they going to have them recite the alphabet at the end of each day?\n\n33:58.200 --> 34:03.200\nNo, I think a lot of it was just that daily questions that they had to answer.\n\n34:03.200 --> 34:05.200\nHow much did he go in with...\n\n34:05.200 --> 34:08.200\nDid he have like a sociological point to prove going in?\n\n34:08.200 --> 34:12.200\nHe thought he might be able... Like, you ever see the 7-up documentaries?\n\n34:12.200 --> 34:14.200\nThe 7 and up?\n\n34:14.200 --> 34:16.200\nYou watched the beginning of that.\n\n34:16.200 --> 34:20.200\nYou kind of feel like he was going in trying to prove class things.\n\n34:20.200 --> 34:22.200\nThen it turns into something very different.\n\n34:22.200 --> 34:24.200\nDo you think he came in with a sociological point of view on this,\n\n34:24.200 --> 34:28.200\nor he really just said, let's just get raw, unadulterated data?\n\n34:28.200 --> 34:33.200\nI think he just basically wanted to see what...\n\n34:33.200 --> 34:41.200\nBasically, what he learned from it, I think, is what he was looking for, which is how the environment can change people.\n\n34:41.200 --> 34:48.200\nHe constantly says, the whole idea about prisons is there are no bad apples, there are just bad barrels.\n\n34:48.200 --> 34:51.200\nSo if you have an inherently... Because all these kids were inherently good,\n\n34:51.200 --> 34:55.200\nthey were all screened to be all American normal kids.\n\n34:55.200 --> 34:57.200\nThey all went through the movie. There's one Asian guy.\n\n34:57.200 --> 34:58.200\nThere's one Asian guy.\n\n34:58.200 --> 35:00.200\nIs that based on reality?\n\n35:00.200 --> 35:02.200\nYeah, that's based on reality.\n\n35:02.200 --> 35:06.200\nWas that just a sort of... When was this?\n\n35:06.200 --> 35:07.200\nThis was in 1971.\n\n35:07.200 --> 35:11.200\nSo was that just sort of like, oh, black kids aren't college kids?\n\n35:11.200 --> 35:13.200\nWhat was at play there?\n\n35:13.200 --> 35:17.200\nI honestly can't tell you except that this took place in August of 1971.\n\n35:17.200 --> 35:21.200\nI would say in Stanford at 71, that might have been a good representation of the student body.\n\n35:21.200 --> 35:22.200\nBut these weren't Stanford students.\n\n35:22.200 --> 35:24.200\nNot all of them. Some of them were.\n\n35:24.200 --> 35:26.200\nBut it was just an ad place in the paper.\n\n35:26.200 --> 35:31.200\nBut it was during the summer, so a lot of kids that were still there for the summer came in and interviewed.\n\n35:31.200 --> 35:35.200\nAnd they interviewed quite a few people to find the 24 or whatever.\n\n35:35.200 --> 35:38.200\nBut did you start... I kind of railroaded your answer.\n\n35:38.200 --> 35:45.200\nThe faces that we see on screen and the ethnic spectrum that they represent, is that...\n\n35:45.200 --> 35:46.200\nThat's accurate.\n\n35:46.200 --> 35:47.200\nOkay.\n\n35:47.200 --> 35:48.200\nSo there was like one like...\n\n35:48.200 --> 35:52.200\nThere was one Asian student and then one of the...\n\n35:52.200 --> 35:56.200\nWell, obviously Carlo Prescott, the guy that they brought into advise,\n\n35:56.200 --> 36:00.200\nwas a black man who was in prison for 17 years before this.\n\n36:00.200 --> 36:04.200\nAnd then one of Zimbardo's grad assistants, a grad student, was also a black guy.\n\n36:04.200 --> 36:05.200\nYeah.\n\n36:05.200 --> 36:06.200\nAnd he initiated...\n\n36:06.200 --> 36:07.200\nYeah, I mean, it's interesting.\n\n36:07.200 --> 36:11.200\nYeah, I mean, the more would be spoilers, I think, because the narrative...\n\n36:11.200 --> 36:17.200\nBut you already know the real life story is that the experiment got out of control.\n\n36:17.200 --> 36:19.200\nBut what I've always felt about hearing that,\n\n36:19.200 --> 36:25.200\nbecause I've probably referred to the Stanford Prison Experiment a thousand times in 20 years\n\n36:25.200 --> 36:30.200\nwhen talking about politics or anything, talking about particularly fascism,\n\n36:30.200 --> 36:36.200\nis like, well, it's a successful experiment, not from a scientific perspective,\n\n36:36.200 --> 36:41.200\nbut from the fact that someone once did this thing.\n\n36:41.200 --> 36:42.200\nAnd it turned out...\n\n36:42.200 --> 36:47.200\nIt changed the way that experimentation could be done in colleges now.\n\n36:47.200 --> 36:51.200\nI mean, literally, it's like they didn't have ethics committees back then.\n\n36:51.200 --> 36:53.200\nSo ethically, this thing was one thing.\n\n36:53.200 --> 36:58.200\nWell, the Department of Justice or some government agency reviewed this whole thing.\n\n36:58.200 --> 37:03.200\nBut when you say it that way, there's an unspoken supposition there\n\n37:03.200 --> 37:13.200\nthat the information that came out of this experience was completely not valuable at all to future generations.\n\n37:13.200 --> 37:14.200\nNo, it absolutely was.\n\n37:14.200 --> 37:18.200\nIt was just that they found that the methods in which they did this were harmful.\n\n37:18.200 --> 37:25.200\nYes. Is there a way to do an experiment like that without hurting the subjects?\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:26.200\nIt doesn't seem like...\n\n37:26.200 --> 37:27.200\nProbably not.\n\n37:27.200 --> 37:28.200\nRight.\n\n37:28.200 --> 37:30.200\nBut they didn't know that at the time.\n\n37:30.200 --> 37:32.200\nWell, it's more of a...\n\n37:32.200 --> 37:35.200\nBut the thing is, in the movie, as it reveals, it gets a very organic process,\n\n37:35.200 --> 37:40.200\nit's like he set up a situation, he thought that the glibness of it...\n\n37:40.200 --> 37:43.200\nThe thing that I always pictured was like this...\n\n37:43.200 --> 37:51.200\nLike you said, Jeff, you said like a set of an Elvis number where it's like you pictured Stanford like shelling out for fake prison cells.\n\n37:51.200 --> 37:55.200\nI pictured Yale House Rock where there was four tears of dudes dancing and...\n\n37:55.200 --> 37:56.200\nThis movie takes place...\n\n37:56.200 --> 37:58.200\nIf you can't find a partner, find a wooden chair.\n\n37:58.200 --> 38:03.200\nThis story takes place in a hallway of Stanford College on summer break where a couple of offices,\n\n38:03.200 --> 38:06.200\nthey carved the doors out and put bars in the doors.\n\n38:06.200 --> 38:09.200\nBut some people were in charge of when the doors were unlocked and when they weren't.\n\n38:09.200 --> 38:14.200\nAnd they had burlap sacks that were like dresses, there was a deliberate attempt to feminize,\n\n38:14.200 --> 38:20.200\nwhich in 1971 was the equivalent of Zimbardo actually laying it out saying...\n\n38:20.200 --> 38:25.200\nSomeone questions, he goes, feminize, and he's like, yes, to remove everything that they are.\n\n38:25.200 --> 38:28.200\nHe's saying, you know, there's an unspoken thing there.\n\n38:28.200 --> 38:35.200\nIt's like going waist deep into this thing and himself becoming infected by it, becoming the warden,\n\n38:35.200 --> 38:41.200\nlosing his mind to the same extent that Sigmund Freud injecting cocaine into his own arm\n\n38:41.200 --> 38:44.200\nlike did yield some shit.\n\n38:44.200 --> 38:46.200\nI mean, this is important.\n\n38:46.200 --> 38:47.200\nIt's important to...\n\n38:47.200 --> 38:48.200\nNo, it's definitely important.\n\n38:48.200 --> 38:51.200\nIt just, again, now ethically they would not...\n\n38:51.200 --> 38:54.200\nYou would not get this past any college ethics board.\n\n38:54.200 --> 38:55.200\nBut it's like...\n\n38:55.200 --> 39:01.200\nBut it's a case where ethics, which are the thing that are being looked at.\n\n39:01.200 --> 39:03.200\nLike the reason we're afraid...\n\n39:03.200 --> 39:10.200\nIf we become really good at conducting Stanford prison experiments, we're not getting accurate data.\n\n39:10.200 --> 39:11.200\nRight.\n\n39:11.200 --> 39:13.200\nLike we're not...\n\n39:13.200 --> 39:20.200\nWe don't want to become really, really good at making sure no one gets hurt during the Stanford prison experiment.\n\n39:20.200 --> 39:21.200\nWe want to...\n\n39:21.200 --> 39:28.200\nWell, again, the accurate data is that if you conduct one, you become fucking Hitler overnight.\n\n39:28.200 --> 39:34.200\nIf you put yourself in the position of judging what you're measuring and if the people...\n\n39:34.200 --> 39:43.200\nThat everyone is intoxicated instantly by fascism, by hierarchical thinking and answering to a higher calling.\n\n39:43.200 --> 39:46.200\nEverybody dresses it in different ways.\n\n39:46.200 --> 39:48.200\nI'm here for my $15 a day.\n\n39:48.200 --> 39:51.200\nHe's looking at it like, I'm going to publish a paper on this.\n\n39:51.200 --> 39:54.200\nHe's not even sure what he's drinking by the time he's drunk on it.\n\n39:54.200 --> 40:00.200\nHe's seeing images of students punching other students and he's thinking, I made this happen.\n\n40:00.200 --> 40:01.200\nAnd it's a live experiment.\n\n40:01.200 --> 40:02.200\nAnd it's a successful experiment.\n\n40:02.200 --> 40:03.200\nThis is a live thing.\n\n40:03.200 --> 40:09.200\nAnd so, again, the paranoia comes in when the family members come to visit.\n\n40:09.200 --> 40:12.200\nHe's terrified one of them is going to pull their kid out.\n\n40:12.200 --> 40:18.200\nTo the point where there's a really great scene that Billy Crudup who plays Zimbardo in the movie\n\n40:18.200 --> 40:24.200\nhandles some crud heads here.\n\n40:24.200 --> 40:25.200\nWe got crud heads.\n\n40:25.200 --> 40:27.200\nWe got big Zimbardo fans here.\n\n40:27.200 --> 40:29.200\nThey come to every podcast.\n\n40:29.200 --> 40:32.200\nThey want more Billy Crudup information.\n\n40:32.200 --> 40:36.200\nUnlike tonight, we always have to disappoint them.\n\n40:36.200 --> 40:38.200\nShout out, Monica.\n\n40:38.200 --> 40:46.200\nOne thing I will say about Billy Crudup is he has a sort of like a monologue at the end of the movie where he pulls the plug.\n\n40:46.200 --> 40:49.200\nWe shot everything else before that.\n\n40:49.200 --> 40:52.200\nSo all these kids have been working together for two and a half weeks.\n\n40:52.200 --> 40:57.200\nAnd he walked in on his first day and delivered like his last scene in the movie.\n\n40:57.200 --> 40:59.200\nAnd it was like, holy shit.\n\n40:59.200 --> 41:01.200\nThis guy's good.\n\n41:01.200 --> 41:03.200\nWere you on the set the whole time?\n\n41:03.200 --> 41:04.200\nI wasn't.\n\n41:04.200 --> 41:09.200\nI was a writer on Chicago Fire for a couple of years and I was shooting an episode at the same time.\n\n41:09.200 --> 41:12.200\nSo I was going back and forth between here and Chicago.\n\n41:12.200 --> 41:20.200\nIt's true that the experiment, the Chicago Fire writing room, didn't you guys set a lot of fires in Chicago?\n\n41:20.200 --> 41:22.200\nNo comment.\n\n41:22.200 --> 41:24.200\nAbsolute power corrupts.\n\n41:24.200 --> 41:25.200\nAbsolutely.\n\n41:25.200 --> 41:31.200\nI want to look at, because you've got a bigger career than that.\n\n41:31.200 --> 41:33.200\nWe can talk about what it was like.\n\n41:33.200 --> 41:35.200\nSo you were at South Park from the beginning.\n\n41:35.200 --> 41:36.200\nNo.\n\n41:36.200 --> 41:38.200\nI was there for season five and six.\n\n41:38.200 --> 41:45.200\nAll right, well, those are the worst seasons ever.\n\n41:45.200 --> 41:51.200\nNo, but it sounded like just because of the way you're describing being friends with George Clooney and all that stuff that you were there on the very ground floor.\n\n41:51.200 --> 41:54.200\nBut what was it like in those days?\n\n41:54.200 --> 41:57.200\nWere you full time?\n\n41:57.200 --> 41:59.200\nYeah, well, I was a staff writer.\n\n41:59.200 --> 42:07.200\nSo the way that they work, by the time I'd gotten there, their process had gotten to a point where basically Trey Parker was writing and directing every episode.\n\n42:07.200 --> 42:15.200\nAnd so they'd bring you like on a writer's retreat at the beginning of the season, you know, like we went up to Whistler and we'd ski half the day and then sit in a room.\n\n42:15.200 --> 42:23.200\nAnd, you know, your only real job was to be attentive to the media and like what's going on in society.\n\n42:23.200 --> 42:27.200\nSo we'd sit in a room and we'd spitball stuff and then all of a sudden we'd have like five or six ideas for shows.\n\n42:27.200 --> 42:34.200\nAnd we come back to LA and in order to get the show done on time, they had to generate eight pages of script a day.\n\n42:34.200 --> 42:38.200\nAnd so Trey would go off and start these scripts and then whenever he got stuck, he'd call the writers in.\n\n42:38.200 --> 42:43.200\nAnd we'd just sit around, you know, you come in, they buy you lunch, you sit around a big table with some of the funniest people you've ever met,\n\n42:43.200 --> 42:46.200\nand you laugh until your face wants to fall off.\n\n42:46.200 --> 42:51.200\nAnd hopefully you throw something out that ends up in the show and then, you know, two days later it's on television.\n\n42:51.200 --> 42:52.200\nRight.\n\n42:52.200 --> 42:54.200\nYou know, which is amazing for animation.\n\n42:54.200 --> 42:56.200\nWho else that we would know?\n\n42:56.200 --> 42:59.200\nI've had friends and Dan's had friends that have worked on that show throughout the years.\n\n42:59.200 --> 43:02.200\nWho was there back in those days that we might know?\n\n43:02.200 --> 43:04.200\nWell, Trey Parker, Matt Stone.\n\n43:04.200 --> 43:06.200\nNever heard of them.\n\n43:06.200 --> 43:11.200\nKyle McCullough, David Goodman, Glasgow Phillips.\n\n43:11.200 --> 43:12.200\nHack, hack, hack.\n\n43:12.200 --> 43:15.200\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n43:15.200 --> 43:16.200\nWho else?\n\n43:16.200 --> 43:19.200\nNancy Pimentall was there for a little bit.\n\n43:19.200 --> 43:21.200\nShe was there for, I worked with her for weeks.\n\n43:21.200 --> 43:22.200\nShe's big with crewed up fans.\n\n43:22.200 --> 43:26.200\nYeah.\n\n43:26.200 --> 43:32.200\nWell, that corroborates greatly with every, we do have a couple of friends here and there as the show's been on for so long.\n\n43:32.200 --> 43:34.200\nAlmost everybody in LA knows, somebody that worked on South Park at some point.\n\n43:34.200 --> 43:44.200\nThat is the legend, is that there's almost a feeling of guilt at how much Trey Parker is like,\n\n43:44.200 --> 43:47.200\nlike he calls you in a room and then you guys talk and then you laugh and laugh,\n\n43:47.200 --> 43:51.200\nand then he, at some point he leaves the room and then he writes more script.\n\n43:51.200 --> 43:54.200\nYeah, and those guys are there, you know, 20 hours a day.\n\n43:54.200 --> 43:59.200\nYou know, we come in for two hours and laugh it up and leave, which, you know, it's a dream job.\n\n43:59.200 --> 44:05.200\nAnd I have to say though, when you first walk into that, I'm not necessarily first and foremost a comedy writer.\n\n44:05.200 --> 44:08.200\nYou know, so I, they just thought I was funny.\n\n44:08.200 --> 44:12.200\nSo that first day I'm sitting in there and half the staff are actors as well.\n\n44:12.200 --> 44:17.200\nSo they were, they get up and they act out their character stuff and I'm like, I'm not that at all.\n\n44:17.200 --> 44:23.200\nAnd I sat there for probably the first hour of the first meeting, just going like, what am I doing here?\n\n44:23.200 --> 44:27.200\nWhat happened? And I realized that if you don't open your mouth and say something, they're just going to fire your ass.\n\n44:27.200 --> 44:30.200\nSo I threw something out and it got a huge laugh.\n\n44:30.200 --> 44:32.200\nAnd then I was like, oh, that's what this job is.\n\n44:32.200 --> 44:36.200\nNow, to what extent, because this is the first time I've heard, because I've heard about those retreats.\n\n44:36.200 --> 44:42.200\nAnd I always imagine them with this sense of dread because they sounded like auditions.\n\n44:42.200 --> 44:48.200\nLike you went on the retreat and then some people that, that was vodka, don't worry about it.\n\n44:48.200 --> 44:53.200\nSome people that go on these retreats, everybody gets to have the time of their life.\n\n44:53.200 --> 44:57.200\nSome people going on the retreat, get the job. Some people don't.\n\n44:57.200 --> 44:58.200\nThat was earlier on.\n\n44:58.200 --> 44:59.200\nYou're making it sound more like you.\n\n44:59.200 --> 45:04.200\nEarlier it was more of an audition thing. By the time I was there, that was just, I came in the middle of the season.\n\n45:04.200 --> 45:12.200\nSo I worked on three episodes, then went on a retreat, worked on six episodes, then went on another retreat, and worked on another six episodes.\n\n45:12.200 --> 45:16.200\nThey actually generate a voluminous amount of their season on the retreat.\n\n45:16.200 --> 45:19.200\nYeah, I mean, that's the basic structure.\n\n45:19.200 --> 45:22.200\nAnd it happens usually about three weeks before the season starts.\n\n45:22.200 --> 45:24.200\nSo it's relatively topical.\n\n45:24.200 --> 45:28.200\nDid they structure it where you got to, as a staff writer, get your name on a script?\n\n45:28.200 --> 45:29.200\nNope.\n\n45:29.200 --> 45:32.200\nThat was later down the road?\n\n45:32.200 --> 45:35.200\nBut my name's on every episode I worked on as a staff writer at the end.\n\n45:35.200 --> 45:39.200\nSo that's more than almost every other television show staff writers don't even get.\n\n45:39.200 --> 45:47.200\nYou don't have to say yes or no. You don't have to say which script. Is there a script that you feel very responsible for that you get a lot of stuff done on?\n\n45:47.200 --> 45:51.200\nYeah, there was one, I'm trying to think of the name of the script.\n\n45:51.200 --> 45:58.200\nIt was basically about, it grew out of a conversation between myself and Matt Stone about the Star Wars special editions.\n\n45:58.200 --> 46:01.200\nThat we just fucking hated them so much.\n\n46:01.200 --> 46:03.200\nAnd E.T. was coming out.\n\n46:03.200 --> 46:05.200\nThat's a walkie-talkie one.\n\n46:05.200 --> 46:17.200\nSo right around that same time, we came up with the idea that the boys had to break into Lucasfilm or Skywalker Sound and get the print of Raiders of the Lost Ark back.\n\n46:17.200 --> 46:20.200\nYeah, I think, oh, it's called Free Hat.\n\n46:20.200 --> 46:24.200\nThat was one.\n\n46:24.200 --> 46:31.200\nAnd then the only other one that I can claim any responsibility for is the one where Kenny dies for real.\n\n46:31.200 --> 46:34.200\nI just thought, what would happen if we just killed him?\n\n46:34.200 --> 46:39.200\nThere was a TV movie version of Brian's song that was on somewhere around there.\n\n46:39.200 --> 46:44.200\nSo we just took that and made it into this whole like, oh my god, our friend is going to die.\n\n46:44.200 --> 46:50.200\nBut you probably were gone by the time what Chef had to be done.\n\n46:50.200 --> 46:52.200\nYeah, I was gone.\n\n46:52.200 --> 47:12.200\nIf there should be an absolutely separate Emmy category, the complicated ratio between passion, relevance, manpower, because there's always been very few people working in that show and the speed with which they're working.\n\n47:12.200 --> 47:22.200\nAnd how incredibly funny and just, what words do you say?\n\n47:22.200 --> 47:27.200\nBalls out, like fucking brave, bold, like opinionated, like fuck this thing.\n\n47:27.200 --> 47:42.200\nHow many of us in this room have like been swirling around with some thought in our head about some piece of pop culture or politics or something and then we get this like decidedly kind of admittedly maybe libertarian view from South Park.\n\n47:42.200 --> 47:49.200\nBut it kind of like pushes us over into how to feel about something because it's done with this like grace and humor and what.\n\n47:49.200 --> 47:56.200\nThe great thing about those guys and what was really intoxicating working with them is they have no tolerance for bullshit or hypocrisy.\n\n47:56.200 --> 48:00.200\nSo if they see something, they have a point of view on it and they just come out and say it.\n\n48:00.200 --> 48:01.200\nThey just don't give a shit.\n\n48:01.200 --> 48:02.200\nThey just don't give a shit.\n\n48:02.200 --> 48:04.200\nThey're just so ripe for corruption so long ago.\n\n48:04.200 --> 48:07.200\nYeah, and they just, you know, I mean, they just haven't.\n\n48:07.200 --> 48:16.200\nI mean, you know, they're in a really wonderful place where they can do whatever they want and they've been able to because they were successful with the show right from the beginning.\n\n48:16.200 --> 48:21.200\nI feel spoiled because I only ever, like South Park's going to at some point not exist.\n\n48:21.200 --> 48:26.200\nIt'll probably outlive me but the way I eat.\n\n48:26.200 --> 48:33.200\nThere will be a day maybe when it's like gone and done and then there's going to be eulogies for it.\n\n48:33.200 --> 48:37.200\nLike there was for fucking whatever the hell that gossip rag was.\n\n48:37.200 --> 48:43.200\nAll of a sudden we found out that it was important that, whatever, what the fuck was, Gawker was so important.\n\n48:43.200 --> 48:46.200\nWell, I imagine South Park's going to turn out to be pretty fucking important the day.\n\n48:46.200 --> 48:48.200\nIt goes off air.\n\n48:48.200 --> 49:00.200\nLike I feel spoiled in the meantime because I've only ever just like randomly run back into it like an old lover and just always astounded at how still fucking funny it is.\n\n49:00.200 --> 49:05.200\nLike you just want to just like, oh, how is it still this funny?\n\n49:05.200 --> 49:07.200\nIt's 48 years old.\n\n49:07.200 --> 49:13.200\nThe cool thing is that they kind of mixed things up the last two seasons where they made them serialized.\n\n49:13.200 --> 49:19.200\nSo as they had a storyline, I think that's the last episode I saw that ended the crescendoed in the divorce, the moving away.\n\n49:19.200 --> 49:22.200\nAnd I haven't watched it since because I've just spoiled South Park wise.\n\n49:22.200 --> 49:25.200\nI'm like, wow, someday I'll just be, yeah.\n\n49:25.200 --> 49:28.200\nBut yeah, I mean, I've always been astounded by it.\n\n49:28.200 --> 49:34.200\nLike Cartman is probably one of the most important television characters in television.\n\n49:34.200 --> 49:36.200\nHe's right up there with Archie Bunker for me.\n\n49:36.200 --> 49:43.200\nI always reference him in the same breath as Archie Bunker when you talk about like the importance of this in character.\n\n49:43.200 --> 49:50.200\nI don't mean the seasons of the episodes that don't like do it for me as much as other seasons or episodes is when they got Cartman wrong.\n\n49:50.200 --> 49:56.200\nWhen they got Cartman right, it made it pretty special because they made it really, really bad.\n\n49:56.200 --> 49:58.200\nLike really, really, really horrible.\n\n49:58.200 --> 50:03.200\nRight before I got there, they did the one where Cartman basically killed someone's parents and fed them to him.\n\n50:03.200 --> 50:06.200\nBut that's a lot of people's favorite episodes.\n\n50:06.200 --> 50:07.200\nScott, something must die. What's it called?\n\n50:07.200 --> 50:08.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n50:08.200 --> 50:10.200\nWhat's his last name?\n\n50:10.200 --> 50:12.200\nScott Teneman must die.\n\n50:12.200 --> 50:16.200\nThat just breaking his tears at the end.\n\n50:16.200 --> 50:19.200\nLike, oh, the sweet misery of your tears.\n\n50:19.200 --> 50:21.200\nThat's a fucking doozy.\n\n50:21.200 --> 50:24.200\nIf I remember that, that was all.\n\n50:24.200 --> 50:26.200\nChevy chased his character on Community.\n\n50:26.200 --> 50:28.200\nWell, that was all it was ever doing.\n\n50:28.200 --> 50:29.200\nIt was just ripping off Cartman.\n\n50:29.200 --> 50:37.200\nIt was just the idea was like, well, there is a character who's just like, he's the voice of that petty child within you.\n\n50:37.200 --> 50:39.200\nBut that includes talking to God.\n\n50:39.200 --> 50:44.200\nLike God is somebody that's going to ground you, make you take a time out.\n\n50:44.200 --> 50:49.200\nWe have a word for someone that responds to God saying that with fuck you.\n\n50:49.200 --> 50:51.200\nThat word is sometimes hero.\n\n50:51.200 --> 51:00.200\nMythic on a mythic level to say fuck you to mortality, to say fuck you to the way you got out of bed in the morning.\n\n51:00.200 --> 51:04.200\nIt's often the face of privilege and oppression and bigotry.\n\n51:04.200 --> 51:08.200\nBut then every once in a while, it's like, yeah, don't go gentle into that good night.\n\n51:08.200 --> 51:14.200\nWe root for Cartman because he's safely in the package of a reprehensible troll.\n\n51:14.200 --> 51:23.200\nBut we get to like sap some of that toxin just enough to dab on our tongue and like get high a little bit because it's like in a safe container.\n\n51:23.200 --> 51:24.200\nAnd we've been learning that.\n\n51:24.200 --> 51:26.200\nI don't know if you heard me babbling.\n\n51:26.200 --> 51:28.200\nI was talking to the Daryl Davis documentary.\n\n51:28.200 --> 51:29.200\nHave you seen that?\n\n51:29.200 --> 51:33.200\nI saw like a news piece on him because I haven't seen the whole doc.\n\n51:33.200 --> 51:41.200\nHe's basically dedicated his life to this sort of like tract of belief that it's like, you don't want these people in the shadows.\n\n51:41.200 --> 51:45.200\nYou want them as much as it pains us.\n\n51:45.200 --> 51:49.200\nIt's like what good comes from them hiding.\n\n51:49.200 --> 51:58.200\nThey're as bad as they are and they're twice as bad because whatever butt hurt, fucking whatever birthday party they didn't get invited to, whatever they're fucking cranking about.\n\n51:58.200 --> 52:10.200\nSorry, but it's better to talk to them at Denny's and it's like he has this like collection of KKK robes that are the slow erosion\n\n52:10.200 --> 52:23.200\nthrough friendship one-on-one of him sitting down with a dude who says he wants all this and that to be this and that way and being friendly to them.\n\n52:23.200 --> 52:37.200\nAnd because a friendship with him is completely incalculable to that philosophy, or maybe they just outgrow it, that would be an argument against what he's doing.\n\n52:37.200 --> 52:41.200\nBut they eventually leave, they give him his robes.\n\n52:41.200 --> 52:44.200\nThey don't outgrow it and their chapters fall away.\n\n52:44.200 --> 52:52.200\nThis past year was developing a TV show that was about a guy that has to infiltrate a white supremacist organization.\n\n52:52.200 --> 52:59.200\nAnd doing a lot of research into that, you come to realize that a lot of those people, they don't hate you because you are a different color.\n\n52:59.200 --> 53:01.200\nThey hate you because they don't know you.\n\n53:01.200 --> 53:10.200\nAnd that when people indoctrinate people into these hate groups, they basically are saying, look, it's not your fault that you're poor and broken stupid, it's their fault.\n\n53:10.200 --> 53:16.200\nSo by shifting the blame, I mean half the people that are white supremacists just don't know any better.\n\n53:16.200 --> 53:19.200\nThey've either been raised in that culture.\n\n53:19.200 --> 53:32.200\nNo, I mean they literally don't. No, I'm telling you, it's literally- Look at this energy that's being generated right now in this room, which I'd prefer to pass on.\n\n53:32.200 --> 53:39.200\nBut it's like that hot front meeting that cold front, that hurricane, watch this documentary.\n\n53:39.200 --> 53:50.200\nBecause what you're feeling, one person is like very fidgety, they're like, yes, they're not saying, yeah, racists are misunderstood, you need to talk to them more.\n\n53:50.200 --> 53:54.200\nBut then someone else is like, what the fuck are we doing? No, we don't need to understand them.\n\n53:54.200 --> 54:04.200\nThere's a guy from the Southern Poverty Law Center in the documentary who's like, he's a white dude talking to a black dude who's his age and neither of them are heroes or villains.\n\n54:04.200 --> 54:13.200\nBut he's like, look, one thing he says is you're dealing on a retail level, I'm dealing on a wholesale level, I don't fucking care whether you made a friend with a racist yesterday.\n\n54:13.200 --> 54:18.200\nGood for him, great. I want this shit illegal.\n\n54:18.200 --> 54:31.200\nAnd it's like, there are no villains in this story, but one thing that endures, because he goes to Baltimore and he's talking to millennial black activists who are fucking like, they're on point.\n\n54:31.200 --> 54:41.200\nYou do not want to be talking down to them, they've been arrested a thousand times, maced a thousand times, they're in the trenches.\n\n54:41.200 --> 55:00.200\nIf we're going to grant veterans of Iraq and things, if we're going to say that when those people speak that we owe it to them to not shit on them and dismiss them, then we definitely have to extend that to activists who work in urban environments where you're on the front lines.\n\n55:00.200 --> 55:18.200\nAnd these guys are smart and they're absolutely bewildered by this old baby boomer guy who's going like, I got this clan robe from the KKK and I got this Confederate flag and they're like, what the fuck are you talking about?\n\n55:18.200 --> 55:34.200\nHow long have you been doing this? And he's like, I don't know how many, 50 years, I have no idea how long it's been. And you got 25 racist dudes from Memphis to give you their robes when they got tired of being racist?\n\n55:34.200 --> 55:50.200\nAnd they're like, this seems like a fetish. And they try on both sides. I think what you see is that Gerald Davis is like, the word fetish is not, it's like, wow, yeah.\n\n55:50.200 --> 56:06.200\nBecause he's in his comfort zone when he's laying back and he's expressing this unbelievable amount of acquiescence. But then they're calling him out and going like, that's your comfort zone. That's you accruing this collection of shit in your garage.\n\n56:06.200 --> 56:23.200\nWe're out here, nameless, faceless, taking, you know, it's a stun baton stuff. Then an older dude, baby boomer, I don't know if that's accurate, older black dude who's like, those guys, protector, mentor, those guys both get up, they can't take the interview anymore.\n\n56:23.200 --> 56:40.200\nThey don't yell, they don't shout, but it breaks down. They get up and they leave. That guy comes over, he's got a gray beard, he's the same generation as this guy. He's urban, and he's been proud of those guys.\n\n56:40.200 --> 56:58.200\nAnd he's like, I can't shake your hand. But then that's the guy that almost spirals, he's shouting, he's like, get the fuck out of here and don't come back by the end of their conversation and doesn't want to hear Darrell's side of it because it's too offensive.\n\n56:58.200 --> 57:15.200\nThe thing that I walked away from it from was this weird thing, why am I dumping this on you? The thing that was the most pronounced about it was the fact that those young guys who were so smart and so cool and they had given so much, one of the things he got them to say,\n\n57:15.200 --> 57:37.200\nand I don't mean got them to say the way you get Donald Trump to say that microwaves are cameras, I mean he took the conversation down a river that afforded us this glimpse around this curve of trees, one of the things he got them to say was that they didn't believe that white supremacists could change.\n\n57:37.200 --> 57:53.200\nNow that's a very, very interesting thing to admit to yourself because it puts you firmly on the side of a line in a world that we're either going to fix, save, abandon, tear up, fighting each other.\n\n57:53.200 --> 58:08.200\nIt puts you on the side as just as you are and as righteous as you are, and as right as you may be, but it puts you firmly on the side of a war between people who think that we can do better and people who are like, fuck it, we're fighting.\n\n58:08.200 --> 58:25.200\nThey said that, they said, no, I don't think they can change. I don't know if they really, he didn't give them a slide rule in 20 minutes to answer his question. I think maybe they would have said over 20 minutes like, well, people don't change through the actions that you're taking.\n\n58:25.200 --> 58:40.200\nPeople change, blah, blah, blah, and you fish rocks from the head or whatever, but in that moment they're like, no, you can't change them, they don't change them. And he says, of course he's aggravating them by saying, well, you sound like Donald Trump.\n\n58:40.200 --> 58:56.200\nDonald Trump hadn't been elected yet at the time of this interview, and then one of the guys goes like, I hope Donald Trump gets elected because it's like the wolf versus the fox. I know what Donald Trump stands for. I'm not voting anyway and all this shit, and you're like, fuck this, where have we all been?\n\n58:56.200 --> 59:11.200\nAnd at the end of the documentary, Donald Trump's elected. You have no idea where the fucking head is spinning. You're like, who wins, who loses, what is happening? You just feel like you're being flushed down a toilet, like spiritually, because you're just like, oh, we're all good people?\n\n59:11.200 --> 59:29.200\nWhen we look in the mirror, but we're all fucking like insane, and we're gonna rip our faces off in the mirror, and we're just gonna wake up and an octopus creature is gonna go, you failed. And the human simulation.\n\n59:29.200 --> 59:44.200\nOctopus 179, you win given the opportunity to be five different colors of chimp. You fuck up. That seems like an unfair test to put on anybody.\n\n59:44.200 --> 01:00:08.200\nTo deprive them of anything other than what's actually being tested? Like they're inherent fucking intents, like, yeah, I mean, yes, I agree, it's unfair, but we come from a mythology as primates, we're like, oh, you're supposed to know the score. God's supposed to come down, tell you, don't eat the apple, and then I'll pay your rent.\n\n01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:21.200\nAnd if anything goes wrong, you just blame women, you know? Like, we're supposed to get a spreadsheet at the beginning of the test, while maybe everybody else feels gaslit in the sense that they didn't know what the test was.\n\n01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:33.200\nIt was like, what's the chapter in Genesis when God comes back down after Eve gets made and says, I told him, don't eat the apple, I can't remember, I don't know, but it's not a newspaper anyway, it's a metaphor for...\n\n01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:43.200\nTim, just answer Dan's question. Brown.\n\n01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:50.200\nYou really are the worst interviewee of all time. You just sit there and don't answer shit.\n\n01:00:50.200 --> 01:01:08.200\nYou think working at South Park for their first three episodes earns you the right to sit there and say nothing? Well, I put my ass on the line about the shit I've gone through at Stanford.\n\n01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:17.200\nI wrote Monster House. Do you have any idea how much research I had to do to write Monster House?\n\n01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.200\nDo you have any idea how Monster House is?\n\n01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.200\nYeah, actually my roommate from college was one of the animators on that.\n\n01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200\nOh, yeah?\n\n01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.200\nSo you employed him.\n\n01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:36.200\nI created the job, but, you know, I thought that that was going to be a live-action script when we wrote it.\n\n01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:44.200\nWhich is why I've actually made quite a bit of money on that movie, because it was written under live-action rules.\n\n01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.200\nSo you get residuals.\n\n01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.200\nSo every time they go to Blu-ray in Singapore or something, I get a check that's based on, oh, this was a WGA, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200\nFascinating.\n\n01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:01.200\nBut Tim, didn't you win some prestigious film writing award?\n\n01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.200\nI was about to ask about that. The Walter Salt Award.\n\n01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.200\nWaldo Salt.\n\n01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:15.200\nNamed after a famed writer who discovered salt. He wrote salt, right?\n\n01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:21.200\nAnd he invented wearing striped red and white shirts and hiding in large crowds.\n\n01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200\nWhat is that award?\n\n01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.200\nIt was the screenwriting award at Sundance.\n\n01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:35.200\nI wrote this movie back in 2004. It took forever to get made because the company we had written it for went out of business\n\n01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.200\nand we found out that they barred over a million dollars against our script.\n\n01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:49.200\nSo our producer, a wonderful guy named Brent Emery, literally spent seven years chasing down 81 different chain of title issues\n\n01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.200\nand settling up with everyone so that they would get some of their money back if we made the movie.\n\n01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.200\nAnd then it was like all of a sudden I got a call in June like, I think we're making this movie.\n\n01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.200\nAnd then in August we were shooting it.\n\n01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.200\nIn November we got into Sundance and it premiered in January.\n\n01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:10.200\nBut it's not a Sundance award for best blue bitty blue and a blue bitty blue. It's some guy's name.\n\n01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.200\nWaldo Salt is, I guess it's like an honorarium or whatever.\n\n01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.200\nIt was set up by his family, I think, to honor independent screenwriting or whatever.\n\n01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.200\nBut it's the one screenwriting award they do every year at Sundance.\n\n01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.200\nSo that was pretty unexpected.\n\n01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.200\nYeah, but you know Dan wrote Monster House.\n\n01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.200\nWhere's my Waldo Salt?\n\n01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.200\nDid you take it to Sundance?\n\n01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.200\nI would have.\n\n01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.200\nYeah, it's a story. It's a children's horror film.\n\n01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.200\nIt's about a house that...\n\n01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.200\nHey Spencer, you've been awful quiet over there.\n\n01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.200\nNo.\n\n01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.200\nLet's bring it back to the Stanford prison for a moment.\n\n01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.200\nIf you had your pick and you couldn't, like if the coin were tossed,\n\n01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.200\nwhat do you think you would have been better or worse at being the guard or being a prisoner?\n\n01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.200\nI'm sure I would be a kick-ass guard.\n\n01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.200\nI mean, that's just my nature. I can be petty and mean and...\n\n01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.200\nNo, that means you'd be a worse guard.\n\n01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.200\nYou would be a worse person as a guard.\n\n01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.200\nYes.\n\n01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.200\nOur whole goal with the entire movie was just to have people walk out at the end\n\n01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.200\nand ask that question to themselves.\n\n01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.200\nDo I have it within myself to turn into such an evil fucking person\n\n01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.200\nif given the opportunity and having no repercussions?\n\n01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.200\nAnd to that extent, I think the film works.\n\n01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.200\nIt's funny that...\n\n01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.200\nI'd never seen a movie or anything I'd written in front of a huge audience before.\n\n01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.200\nAnd at Sundance, we had like 1200 people at the first screening.\n\n01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.200\nAnd there's a title card that comes up that just says Day 2.\n\n01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.200\nAnd literally...\n\n01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.200\nEverything that happened in the first day was so...\n\n01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.200\nEveryone in the audience was like,\n\n01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:56.200\nHoly shit that the air got sucked out of the room and it was one of the most...\n\n01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.200\nThe hair stood up on the back of my neck and I was like, oh my god.\n\n01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.200\nA movie just got a reaction and I had something to do with that.\n\n01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:08.200\nThat happened to me and Cody, my girlfriend, when we were watching it today at Day 4.\n\n01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.200\nWait, what? Day 4?\n\n01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.200\nAnd I checked the progress indicator and that's part of the point.\n\n01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.200\nSo is there... The answer to that question is yes, correct?\n\n01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.200\nThe people who are...\n\n01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.200\nIf you're made a guard by an institution,\n\n01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.200\nguard in quotes meaning district manager,\n\n01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.200\nif you're told that you're in charge of whether or not racism ends,\n\n01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.200\nbecause you're the race that ends racism,\n\n01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:41.200\nif you're told that you're the employee of the month,\n\n01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.200\nif you're in charge of this parking spot,\n\n01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200\nif you're in charge of anything,\n\n01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.200\nany power that you're given by an institution,\n\n01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:52.200\nit seeps into the cracks of your soul and you have two choices.\n\n01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:59.200\nYou take on that role and actually surrender part of your empathy and individuality\n\n01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.200\nin favor of serving that role better.\n\n01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.200\nThat's the important thing is that the guys that early on,\n\n01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:12.200\nwho started as a joke because putting on the uniforms reminded them of Coolhand Luke,\n\n01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.200\nand that guy goes, I'm going to do my impression of a character from Coolhand Luke.\n\n01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.200\nAnd then he comes out, he knows what to say to the president,\n\n01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:24.200\nI want you to communicate well, and then the scientists are going, that guy's good.\n\n01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.200\nMore importantly, nothing happens. He's now in charge.\n\n01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.200\nEveryone that's watching is going like, well, and then the shift changes\n\n01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.200\nand they go, yeah, we did some fucked up shit today and nothing happened.\n\n01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.200\nDon't you think that's part of what it is?\n\n01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.200\nDan, you are famous for, you hate being told what to do.\n\n01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.200\nLet's say that you were, how old are these subjects back then, early 20s?\n\n01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.200\nThey were between 18 and 22.\n\n01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.200\nAnd let's say that you, Dan, found out you were the guard.\n\n01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.200\nYou don't like being told what to do.\n\n01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.200\nYou also don't like, well, you do like telling people what to do\n\n01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.200\nbecause you're a showrunner, that's part of your job description.\n\n01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.200\nLike, what do you think you would be as a guard?\n\n01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.200\nAs a guard, I would be like, I would posture as a,\n\n01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.200\nbut I would be eclipsed by some guy who went fascistic.\n\n01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.200\nI would be eclipsed by the guy who like jumped into the role.\n\n01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.200\nWell, like a while back, I asked Spencer first.\n\n01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.200\nLike, I'm curious, Spencer, you're so neutral.\n\n01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.200\nLike, I can't picture you being,\n\n01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.200\nturning into a shitty dominated prisoner or a fascistic bully guard.\n\n01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.200\nYeah.\n\n01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.200\nBut there are some people that did that.\n\n01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.200\nBut that response makes me think, I don't want you as my guard.\n\n01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.200\nBut there's an important thing here that you're getting to,\n\n01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.200\nwhich is that there are...\n\n01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.200\nAt least it was, yeah.\n\n01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.200\nIt was a complex subject.\n\n01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.200\nThere's a way to be a prisoner as well,\n\n01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.200\nand you have these narcissistic tendencies or things.\n\n01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.200\nLike, as a prisoner, they ask them,\n\n01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.200\nwould you rather be a prisoner or a guard?\n\n01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.200\nAnd everyone wanted to be a prisoner because they thought it'd be less work.\n\n01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:00.200\nBecause if you're a prisoner, you can just...\n\n01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.200\nJust sleep.\n\n01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.200\nThe most work is that you're defined...\n\n01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.200\nYou get three hots on the cot.\n\n01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.200\nYou're always righteous.\n\n01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.200\nThe truth is always on your side.\n\n01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.200\nYou can't be a bad...\n\n01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.200\nThere's no such thing as a villainous prisoner.\n\n01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.200\nYou don't have any power.\n\n01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.200\nWe live in fear of being bad people, too.\n\n01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.200\nNobody wanted to be a guard,\n\n01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.200\nbut then the people that excel at being guards\n\n01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.200\nare exhibiting the same personalities\n\n01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.200\nas the people who are rallying the prisoners.\n\n01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.200\nAnd that's when Zimbardo says,\n\n01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.200\nthese guys are swappable with a coin toss.\n\n01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.200\nThat means in every revolution\n\n01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.200\nin every third world country,\n\n01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.200\nwhen you have guerrillas coming down\n\n01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.200\nfrom the hills and liberating the poor,\n\n01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.200\nand then one of them becomes a dictator,\n\n01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.200\nand then you have the NSA interfering.\n\n01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.200\nPeople are handing you power, handing you rules.\n\n01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.200\nThere's also a certain level of compliance\n\n01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.200\nin certain people,\n\n01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.200\nbecause part of what this showed\n\n01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.200\nas well as what happened at Abu Ghraib\n\n01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.200\nis also what happened in Nazi Germany.\n\n01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.200\nIs that if you're in a situation\n\n01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.200\nwhere you feel you have zero power\n\n01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.200\nand there's nothing you can do to change it,\n\n01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.200\nlike the people that are against you\n\n01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.200\nare so massively in power,\n\n01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.200\nyou know, some people just, it's normalization.\n\n01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.200\nIt's that shit that's happening now.\n\n01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.200\nPeople like on the Eastern Front\n\n01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.200\nwillfully were corralled\n\n01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.200\ninto a giant sand pit,\n\n01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.200\nand they knew they were going to be killed,\n\n01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.200\nand they did it meekly and mildly.\n\n01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.200\nBecause that's what society told them is their role.\n\n01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.200\nDid any of the subjects go to the film,\n\n01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.200\nlike see the film?\n\n01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.200\nI know, you know, I was very happy\n\n01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.200\nthat Zimbardo and his wife\n\n01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.200\nsaw the movie right before we went to Sundance,\n\n01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.200\nand he came to Sundance and spoke and did all that stuff.\n\n01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.200\nBut I was very happy\n\n01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.200\nbecause it's really weird telling somebody's story\n\n01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.200\nand trying to get it right\n\n01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.200\nand making sure not to also let him off the hook.\n\n01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.200\nYou know, we, for dramatic effect,\n\n01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.200\nyou know, in reality,\n\n01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.200\nwe haven't gotten to the third act yet,\n\n01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.200\nso I can't tell you.\n\n01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.200\nIn reality, it ended a little bit differently\n\n01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.200\nthan it does in the movie.\n\n01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.200\nBecause that woman, the triangle of woman, comes back.\n\n01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.200\nNo.\n\n01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.200\nLeo DiCaprio comes through a skylight.\n\n01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.200\nThat's how you got your funding.\n\n01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.200\nTraffic was a bitch!\n\n01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.200\nFucking California, man.\n\n01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.200\nBut let's mash a really hot button right now,\n\n01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.200\nbut it's the elephant in the room,\n\n01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.200\nwhich is really interesting,\n\n01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.200\nis that prisons,\n\n01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.200\nthere were all dudes,\n\n01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.200\ndudes running it,\n\n01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.200\ndudes are the whole movie is all dudes,\n\n01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.200\ndudes dealing with dude issues,\n\n01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.200\nto the point where they're talking about\n\n01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.200\nstripping dudes of their duteness,\n\n01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.200\ntheir individuality,\n\n01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.200\nand they're using it synonymously with the phrase feminization.\n\n01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.200\nPut them in dresses.\n\n01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.200\nCall them she, call them her, call them,\n\n01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.200\nyou know, and let's reduce them\n\n01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.200\nof their individuality,\n\n01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.200\nnot their masculinity, their individuality\n\n01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.200\nby feminizing them.\n\n01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.200\n1971.\n\n01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.200\nSo like, the,\n\n01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.200\nin 2017, casual Friday,\n\n01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.200\nand somebody says to Becky in marketing,\n\n01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.200\nlike, you should wear a shorter skirt or something,\n\n01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.200\nit's like, there's no bars on the windows,\n\n01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.200\nthere's no, the thing is,\n\n01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.200\nthis was a hallway at Stanford College.\n\n01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.200\nNone of these kids during this entire story,\n\n01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.200\never\n\n01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.200\naccidentally started believing\n\n01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.200\nthey were in prison.\n\n01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.200\nThey, what happened\n\n01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.200\nwas they were, they, they were\n\n01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.200\nsubjected long enough to\n\n01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.200\ndeprivation of this and enhancement\n\n01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.200\nof that, that their behavior\n\n01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.200\nchanged, and it can happen\n\n01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.200\nin a hallway.

01:21:08.200\nand put energy into it which they can\n\n01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.200\neasily do in the most subtle of ways\n\n01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.200\ndrive a wedge between

--> 01:21:50.200\nand then they're in charge of guarding it\n\n01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.200\nwhich is why they're so bitter\n\n01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.200\nwhen those guys start getting happy\n\n01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.200\nand Abu Ghraibing\n\n01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.200\nbecause there's been a tension\n\n01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.200\nactually deliberately put down

the outside\n\n01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.200\nwhy would they even do that?\n\n01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.200\nI would fire that line producer\n\n01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.200\nCG that

01:40:18.200\nthank you\n\n01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.200\nyeah balls out was this script that I wrote with\n\n01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:22.200\nanother guy named Malcolm Spellman\n\n01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.200\nunder the pseudonym of the\n\n01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.200\nRoboTard 8000\n\n01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.200\nso we\n\n01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.200\nwrote the script it was during the writer strike\n\n01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.200\nthe last one\n\n01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.200\nand we just were like fuck it let's write what we want to write\n\n01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:36.200\nnot anything\n\n01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:38.200\nfor anyone in particular and\n\n01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.200\nwe finished it we brought it to our\n\n01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.200\nrepresentatives and they were like no fucking way\n\n01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.200\nwe're not taking this script out it's too offensive\n\n01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.200\nand literally\n\n01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.200\nnobody would take it out\n\n01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.200\nI had a couple of friends that we were commiserating with\n\n01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.200\nand just said fuck it just throw it up on the internet\n\n01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.200\nand see what happens the script itself\n\n01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.200\nso I created a website that looks like\n\n01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.200\nit was created by a differently\n\n01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.200\nabled robot\n\n01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.200\nand\n\n01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.200\nand had some friends that were screenwriters\n\n01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.200\njust give us like a blurb if they liked it\n\n01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.200\nand all of a sudden it just took off\n\n01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.200\nand as of like last week it's been\n\n01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.200\ndownloaded almost 200,000 times\n\n01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.200\nwhich is insane\n\n01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.200\nyeah\n\n01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.200\nand it's the only script so far\n\n01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.200\nthat's ever gotten on the blacklist without\n\n01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.200\never being sent out\n\n01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.200\nyou know people read it afterwards\n\n01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.200\nbut it never officially went out\n\n01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.200\nfor anyone to really buy\n\n01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.200\nso is it like what's Jerry Lewis's one though\n\n01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.200\nthe day the clowns cried\n\n01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.200\nyeah but we did actually\n\n01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:36.200\nthe blacklist podcast\n\n01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.200\nwe did a stage reading of it\n\n01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.200\noh really? yeah and recorded that actually\n\n01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.200\nit's like oh well yeah this is a movie this does work\n\n01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.200\nso that was kind of fun\n\n01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.200\nthe blacklist is the thing that I'm only familiar with\n\n01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.200\nthird hand like I've never actually\n\n01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.200\ngone to anything\n\n01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.200\nand seen anything\n\n01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.200\nmy studio has optioned a script\n\n01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.200\nthat was number one on the blacklist\n\n01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.200\nI know that I can repeat that to people\n\n01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.200\nbut that's not how it was brought to me\n\n01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.200\nnow the blacklist yeah again it's one of those things\n\n01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:04.200\nit's just a bit of a popularity contest\n\n01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.200\nwhen it first started out it was literally this guy\n\n01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.200\nFranklin Leonard just asked his friends\n\n01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:10.200\nwhat was their favorite movie script\n\n01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.200\nthat they'd read and he put them all together\n\n01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.200\nand made a list out of it and then now it's become\n\n01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.200\nthis sort of other entity\n\n01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.200\nbut you know the idea though\n\n01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.200\nthat we ended up pretty high on the blacklist\n\n01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.200\nwithout ever like\n\n01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.200\nyou know our whole thing was like this is a\n\n01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:26.200\nfucking balls out comedy you gotta send it to\n\n01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.200\neverybody you send it to the entire town\n\n01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.200\nand like 5% are gonna love it\n\n01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.200\nand they wouldn't send it to anybody\n\n01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.200\nso yeah\n\n01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.200\nyou know it's um\n\n01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.200\nI should read it Dan\n\n01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.200\nif you think describing\n\n01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.200\nthe conceit will just make it sound\n\n01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.200\nthrough in this country\n\n01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.200\nno it'll sound stupid again the whole idea was\n\n01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.200\nto just like we just were like fuck it\n\n01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.200\nabout every rule of screenwriting while adhering\n\n01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.200\nto every rule of screenwriting\n\n01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:54.200\nso it's basically it's about a guy\n\n01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:56.200\nwho you know has been leading his life\n\n01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.200\nthe way society tells him to\n\n01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:00.200\nwhich is you know if I do if I keep my head down\n\n01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.200\nand do good work I'll get you know the white picket fence\n\n01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.200\nand the house and the wife and the two kids\n\n01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.200\nand he comes to a point where he realizes\n\n01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.200\nthat like nothing in his life is going his way\n\n01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.200\nget struck by lightning\n\n01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:12.200\num has a moment where\n\n01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.200\nhe realizes that there's nothing after life\n\n01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:16.200\nbut the reality is it's actually\n\n01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.200\nlike the circle of light\n\n01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.200\nopens up behind him he's just too dumb\n\n01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.200\nto look around and he comes he wakes\n\n01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.200\nback up and he's just like fuck it I want\n\n01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.200\nI'm gonna make a list of things I want that girl\n\n01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.200\nthat car and that job and then because he got hit\n\n01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.200\nby lightning because he realized there's no point\n\n01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:32.200\nto anything there's no point to waiting in\n\n01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.200\nfor the following rules so he just\n\n01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.200\ngoes balls out basically\n\n01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.200\nand just starts doing whatever is necessary\n\n01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.200\nto get what he wants and then realizes of course\n\n01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.200\nthat he's president of the United States\n\n01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.200\nthat he's president of the United States\n\n01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.200\nthat was awesome\n\n01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.200\nthe laugh meter got closed to show clothes\n\n01:43:52.200
