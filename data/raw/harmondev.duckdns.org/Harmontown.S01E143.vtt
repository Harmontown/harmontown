00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Convicts, and NerdMeltfeeder, Harmontown, now in session.

00:15.000 --> 00:32.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, the eponymous Dan Harmon.

00:32.000 --> 00:41.000
Doritos! Doritos! It's a crunchy, salty, cheesy snack.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
You've just taken to bringing your Doritos half eaten on stage with you now.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
We've got financial troubles, Jeff. We need to start advertising or else.

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
We are in more dire straits than a person that doesn't drive a Honda.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
Do you want to do your Doritos jingle now or do you want to save it for later?

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Let's do it now. Let's get it out of the way.

01:07.000 --> 01:18.000
I know Doritos, I don't mean get it out of the way. It's bad to advertise. Let's give people the opportunity to learn about Doritos at the top of the show.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Dan, when I think about getting Doritos out of the way, I think I'm getting them off the table and into my mouth.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Right. And that's the name of this song, Into My Mouth.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Dan Harmon Doritos ad. Take one.

01:30.000 --> 01:41.000
Into My Mouth. Into My Mouth.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
You got a corn chip and something towards how to go into my mouth.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Little triangles of joy. Juicy triangles of joy.

01:53.000 --> 02:04.000
What I call them, juicy. They're never juicy. Doritos in my mouth.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
And fuck the queen. Fuck the queen.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Just in keeping with genre, Doritos is not of any opinion about the monarchy.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
But in staying in genre, fuck the queen.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Doritos in your mouth.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I guess, speaking of getting out of the way, we should just do our Honda ad. You mentioned Honda.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
We should just do Honda.

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
The power of dreams. The power of dreams.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
You know what I mean when you drive a machine that gets you in your heart.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
Honda is a machine that you have been taught.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
Or at least within the margins of insurance.

02:52.000 --> 03:01.000
So thank you to those guys. You know make sure you tweet them and let them know.

03:01.000 --> 03:11.240
But in the margins of insurance.

03:11.240 --> 03:15.080
So thank you to those guys, you know, make sure you tweet them and let them know.

03:15.080 --> 03:19.320
But I love Harmontown and I love your thing because as you know, as fans of something,

03:19.320 --> 03:25.720
your job is to keep us alive, otherwise you failed.

03:25.720 --> 03:31.560
How do we justify these incredibly lucrative sponsors like Doritos and Honda and still

03:31.560 --> 03:33.680
be charging people for our new subscriptions?

03:33.680 --> 03:35.040
How does that work?

03:35.040 --> 03:40.320
You get, everyone's getting Doritos that subscribes.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.760
You get Doritos.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.560
There's a person, if you're a student, there's a person coming to your school and he's like

03:47.560 --> 03:53.360
a clown but he's got orange triangles.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.440
He's being workshopped right now, he doesn't have a name yet, he's the untitled Doritos

03:57.440 --> 03:58.440
spokesmodel.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.800
I think the working title is Juicy, the Doritos Clown.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.760
They're working on stuff based on just like people's feelings about things, like right

04:05.760 --> 04:11.240
now they're thinking of calling him just like outrage, just based on his name is Outrage,

04:11.240 --> 04:17.200
the Doritos Happy Person, and he's going to come to your school and he's going to give

04:17.200 --> 04:19.800
you shit if you're a student.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.880
He's going to give you shit, like get on your case or something?

04:21.880 --> 04:22.880
He's going to get on your case.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.240
He's going to be like, do your homework, bitch!

04:26.240 --> 04:30.360
And then he'll apologize because that's his gimmick.

04:30.360 --> 04:36.080
Ronald McDonald did magic tricks, outraged the happy triangle.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.080
He apologized.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.480
Outraged the happy triangle?

04:39.480 --> 04:43.320
He apologizes for everything.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.360
I like outrage the happy triangle a lot.

04:45.360 --> 04:51.560
All right, so you probably have noticed already that I'm on painkillers and that I combined

04:51.560 --> 04:55.280
it with drinking and that I've been signing stuff for the Rick and Morty signing.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.000
Deanna, are you drunk during a show?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah, sorry, Jeff.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.240
Jeff's got high standards for this stuff.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.480
I would like to apologize.

05:02.480 --> 05:06.120
I was rotten as a fucking chop last week.

05:06.120 --> 05:10.920
It was what my therapist calls informed consent, that's the phrase she always uses, informed

05:10.920 --> 05:11.920
consent.

05:11.920 --> 05:12.920
We knew you were going to be drunk.

05:12.920 --> 05:13.920
I warned you.

05:13.920 --> 05:14.920
I warned you three days in advance.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.440
Like, should we do a show on his show?

05:16.440 --> 05:19.680
Yeah, I didn't say don't come to the show if you're drunk.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.680
If I had my wits about me, I would have called in sick because I was worthless.

05:22.680 --> 05:28.680
I really owe you all an apology or thank you because I was, oh, you're welcome.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.680
Yeah.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.760
Whatever you want, you got it from everybody.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.760
I remember licking a lot of balls and shadow running on that.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.880
It felt like maybe a...

05:37.880 --> 05:40.520
The thing is, sadly, I wasn't in a blackout.

05:40.520 --> 05:45.320
I remember every bit of that show and that's what really breaks my heart.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.120
I'm on painkillers because I had a biopsy.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.760
Deanna, I was talking about...

05:48.760 --> 05:50.360
I was talking about myself.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.840
Sorry, Graeme.

05:51.840 --> 05:52.840
I have...

05:52.840 --> 05:53.840
I have...

05:53.840 --> 05:58.960
For those who would listen for free to the show, I just revealed a stab wound inflicted

05:58.960 --> 06:07.400
on me by government-funded assassins called doctors who examined me for that sound I

06:07.400 --> 06:09.400
make when I laugh.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.400
Wait.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.400
Wait.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.400
I'll cure it.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.400
Wait.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.400
Okay.

06:14.400 --> 06:22.720
There it is.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.720
It's like a bicycle spoke.

06:23.720 --> 06:28.040
I'm pretty sure if any of us tried it that hard three times, we'd make the same sound.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.400
Let's all try it at once.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.120
One, two, three.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.360
Oh, yeah.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.640
There's a couple.

06:35.640 --> 06:40.240
I went in for that sound and then that sound, they said, like, well, let's take some x-rays

06:40.240 --> 06:43.440
and then they're like, well, your lymph nodes are enlarged so we should check out your lymph

06:43.440 --> 06:44.960
nodes and large blah blah blah.

06:44.960 --> 06:45.960
We're gonna do this test.

06:45.960 --> 06:46.960
You should meet the specialist.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.360
Well, the specialist says you should do this test.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.000
Well, this test indicates to the specialist that you should see a specialist specialist

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
and you should go to this guy.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Let's go to that.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.160
And so like a million dollars later, I'm sure.

06:56.160 --> 07:01.320
Like they're just like, oh, we're gonna need to go inside to your chest and like pull out

07:01.320 --> 07:04.000
some stuff from your lungs and we're gonna do a biopsy.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
And I was like, well, what's wrong?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.520
And he's like, well, you put it off so much that if it was cancer, you'd be dead by now.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.520
So that's...

07:09.520 --> 07:10.520
You're fine.

07:10.520 --> 07:15.840
And I was like, okay, good to know that, yes, okay, good.

07:15.840 --> 07:16.840
And also like...

07:16.840 --> 07:20.000
And I was like, and then we'll find out why I make the sound when I laugh and the doctor

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
was like, what?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
No, no.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
No, that sound you just make now.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.320
It was like a Louis CK bit, like he's just like, no, you just shitty.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.680
You just make that sound now.

07:31.680 --> 07:32.680
That's never...

07:32.680 --> 07:34.040
That's not a disease.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.160
That's not inhibiting your ability to live.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.080
We don't care about that sound you make.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.720
What are you doing?

07:39.720 --> 07:46.760
Why are you cutting me open to get cells, to verify that you don't have something?

07:46.760 --> 07:48.560
They're just spending money.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.200
Are you just giving each other money?

07:50.200 --> 07:51.800
Did they give you the all clear?

07:51.800 --> 07:52.800
No.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.800
They're never gonna...

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
They're just...

07:54.800 --> 08:00.240
We're all just this nation of people who are just like, we're like cattle that are also

08:00.240 --> 08:03.240
wearing farmer hats.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.360
Like we're a farm of farmers.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.240
We're a farmer farm.

08:09.240 --> 08:15.240
Get that in your paperback, Orwell.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.360
Fuck animal farm.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.040
What about farmer farm?

08:20.040 --> 08:26.440
Blown mind, for rent.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.120
They gave me pain killers because it hurts because they stabbed me in the throat while

08:29.120 --> 08:30.120
I was sleeping.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.120
Show them the wound.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.120
Show them the thing.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.120
Find the camera.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.120
Find the camera.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.120
It's fine.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.120
I'm not complaining.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.600
We have a lot of Harmontown fans who are like, oh, my leg is in where my arm should

08:38.600 --> 08:39.600
be.

08:39.600 --> 08:49.680
We are a community of misfits, including the medical misfits who walk around like...

08:49.680 --> 08:52.280
So how big is the incision in your throat?

08:52.280 --> 08:53.280
I don't know.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.600
It's like the size of a Capri Sun straw.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.600
They just...

08:56.600 --> 08:57.600
I don't know.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
I haven't looked under here.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.600
It just hurt.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.600
I woke up and it was like...

09:00.600 --> 09:02.600
And they put like a little endoscope kind of thing?

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
Yeah.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.280
They put something down there to collect cells out of my lymph nodes.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.080
And it's got little grabby bits on there?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.800
Look, cell-sized grabby bits.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
Yeah.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.800
Is it scoop?

09:10.800 --> 09:11.800
Yeah.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.800
I guess.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.800
But then you wake up and it's like...

09:13.800 --> 09:17.280
If you wake up and it feels like somebody just took a cheese grater to the inside of

09:17.280 --> 09:18.280
your...

09:18.280 --> 09:21.800
Like a cylindrical cheese grater that just went like this.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.920
Again, I'm not complaining because, again, like childbirth.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.520
I mean, it's just not a thing.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.000
This was my first surgery.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.240
It wasn't even barely a surgery.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.040
It was like a fucking scoppy.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.480
It was an outpatient thing.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.480
So...

09:38.480 --> 09:42.240
As George Collins said, your first surgery, they call it a procedure.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.240
Right.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.240
Yeah.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.120
This was like welcome to the club.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.120
And I was like...

09:47.120 --> 09:49.760
It was really like...

09:49.760 --> 09:54.600
I don't want to spend my last...

09:54.600 --> 09:57.520
I don't want to spend my last moments with these people.

09:57.520 --> 10:02.000
You know when you get on an airplane and you're like, oh, God, I know it's not likely to die

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
at an airplane.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.240
Like, the terrifying thing is that if you do, you die with these people.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.640
These people.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.960
These shitty people.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.600
These shitty Reese Witherspoons.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.600
Like, like...

10:12.600 --> 10:15.760
You're not going to get at this point in time, could you put your thing on the bugabullo?

10:15.760 --> 10:17.760
Oh, we're dying.

10:17.760 --> 10:18.760
Bye.

10:18.760 --> 10:19.760
I'm your last person.

10:19.760 --> 10:20.760
Bye.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.760
I'm the face of God.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.760
Bye.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.760
Bye, bye, bye.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.760
I must...

10:25.760 --> 10:26.760
I'm a person in a costume.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.760
I'm a fucking bureaucratic idiot.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.760
I'm a parasite.

10:30.760 --> 10:31.760
Bye.

10:31.760 --> 10:36.240
At this point in time, at this point in time, we'd like to remind you, we'd like to remind

10:36.240 --> 10:37.240
you.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.680
Everything that an airline tells you, they'd like to remind you.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.560
We'd like to remind you is subliminal code for you're a piece of shit.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.800
You forgot something.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.400
I didn't forget shit.

10:47.400 --> 10:52.160
It ain't hard to get on a metal tube and get launched into the air and then land.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.160
I didn't forget anything.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.960
I'm a fucking genius.

10:55.960 --> 10:59.800
I'd like to remind you, I'm a fucking human being, not force majeure.

10:59.800 --> 11:04.360
At this point in time, I'd like to remind you that we do have a really full flight.

11:04.360 --> 11:08.360
I don't know how that happened.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.520
Fucking hate airlines.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.520
They're a criminal organization.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.840
It's a fucking cartel.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.360
Look up the definition of cartel.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.440
I've been over this.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.160
Look it up.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.040
Look up the word cartel in the dictionary and then look at what airline companies are.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.000
Have you ever been on a plane when you looked around and the people around you and thought,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.640
no, this is a good plane to go down.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.600
No, because it's always staffed with these people.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.520
You've got one guy in the front that's like, I'm this guy at this point in time.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.320
I'm looking to remind you at this point in time.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.800
I'm talking about the other passengers, not the staff.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.800
The fuck other passengers?

11:40.800 --> 11:41.800
I mean, they're random.

11:41.800 --> 11:47.600
What do you look over and are like, oh my god, that's Jennifer Jason Lee.

11:47.600 --> 11:53.680
And she's like, hey, let's die.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.680
I will see you at Jennifer Jason Lee and raise you a George Tikai.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.680
As I got on.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.200
I would love to die with George Tikai.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.200
It's pronounced T-K.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.200
T-K.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.200
Mr. T-K.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.200
We had Sulu on our flight and everyone's like, fuck it.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.200
We're not dying under any circumstances.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
Sulu's got to.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.480
I would follow George T-K anywhere, including death.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.760
Did I ever say on the show what he said, what he got on the plane right in front of me?

12:15.760 --> 12:24.280
He was checking in to get on board and there was a kind of a very out gay black guy who

12:24.280 --> 12:26.560
was the guy that was working the tickets and checking you in.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.560
He was like, OK, thank you, Mr. Proups, thank you, Mr. Sonson.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.560
And he goes, oh, Mr. T-K, what a pleasure.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.200
And he goes, oh, thank you.

12:34.200 --> 12:39.080
And the guy said, Mr. T-K, I had the pleasure of seeing you on a episode of Big Bang Theory

12:39.080 --> 12:40.560
last night or something like that on some show.

12:40.560 --> 12:47.200
And he goes, oh, that's very good news because I can expect a residual.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
He's the man.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
He's great.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.400
And then he got on the plane and he had kind of a cough in his boyfriend or like companion

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
or whoever.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.400
Husband.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.400
Husband?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.400
Is that right?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.400
He's being attended to.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.400
And it was lovely.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.920
And everyone on the plane was like, this is the best.

13:00.920 --> 13:01.920
They're a very cute couple.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.920
And I've said this.

13:02.920 --> 13:03.920
I've said this on the show.

13:03.920 --> 13:04.920
I just want to reiterate.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.400
George K. is an American hero.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.400
Here's why.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.640
Betrayed by his country twice, twice in one lifetime.

13:10.640 --> 13:15.480
Like two times given the excuse to give up on this country because he was born in Japanese

13:15.480 --> 13:18.800
America and locked up at a camp.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.160
He didn't let that make him jaded.

13:21.160 --> 13:25.120
And then during his acting career, he had to be in the closet because you had to be

13:25.120 --> 13:26.480
in the closet back then.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.760
You just had to.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.120
And still, you know, like, and then to have like gay marriage challenge and all that stuff.

13:33.120 --> 13:37.760
It's like, he never, he never just went, did the easy thing, which is like fun for all

13:37.760 --> 13:38.760
of us.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.760
It's just be like, fuck society.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
Fuck this.

13:40.760 --> 13:45.800
Like he would like always like meets it with this like ardor and goes like, well, I'd prefer

13:45.800 --> 13:48.640
if it was something like this and I'm going to, I'm going to read you.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.120
I'd like you to listen to this letter I'm going to read.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.520
Like he's, he's a, he's a good, good activist, a good guy.

13:54.520 --> 13:59.040
Like like you, you, you, I've never been fucked over by society once and I hate it.

13:59.040 --> 14:03.760
Like I, I don't do, I don't, I've never, I've never had anything but privilege shoved up

14:03.760 --> 14:09.960
my ass with a silver turkey baster like, like, and I am sick of everybody and they can go

14:09.960 --> 14:11.960
fuck themselves.

14:11.960 --> 14:12.960
Maybe that's the key.

14:12.960 --> 14:17.360
Maybe you need to have a little bit of, of, of people shitting on you from birth in order

14:17.360 --> 14:23.000
for you to realize like how, how lucky you are to be an American and how worth it is.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.680
Even when the dream is kind of sitting over there like a pile of shit, like that, that

14:27.680 --> 14:30.560
it's still worth something because like the dream exists.

14:30.560 --> 14:34.080
I think you, you also do have to be sort of a special person to rise up from that.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.280
Are you calling it retarded?

14:36.280 --> 14:38.280
It's fucked up, dude.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.280
I'm on painkillers.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.280
I'm sorry.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.200
What, what, what brand of painkiller are you on?

14:42.200 --> 14:43.200
What's, what's, what's.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.200
Retardinal.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.200
Retardinal.

14:45.200 --> 14:50.200
They rarely give you, they rarely prescribe retardinal.

14:50.200 --> 14:54.640
I know, they said, they said, you're going to be in stupid pain.

14:54.640 --> 14:59.640
My sisters, my sisters retarded, fuck you.

14:59.640 --> 15:07.200
Try having a retarded sister.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.200
I love the, the fake high road.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.200
You think it was hard to listen to me talk like that?

15:12.200 --> 15:18.000
Try having a retarded sister.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
What are you on exactly?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.680
What are you called?

15:21.680 --> 15:25.760
And, and I'm almost certain you're not supposed to have Kettle One alongside it.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.080
I know, I looked it up, it says, it doesn't have a seat of benefit in it, so it's not

15:29.080 --> 15:33.480
like bad for your liver to, like, I have been drinking with these painkillers, but I am

15:33.480 --> 15:34.480
in pain.

15:34.480 --> 15:43.080
They did stab me in my sleep for money, like, and then I, so then I wake up in the morning,

15:43.080 --> 15:49.080
like, oh boy, it's so complicated.

15:49.080 --> 15:54.080
All right, we have some special guests here tonight, but, and special in the, in the aforementioned

15:54.080 --> 15:55.080
sense.

15:55.080 --> 16:04.400
Our next guest brought to you by Retardinal.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.400
What was I talking about?

16:05.400 --> 16:10.440
Oh, you want to, it was, it's, it's some pill, like, is it, is it narcole or, or, or, or,

16:10.440 --> 16:11.440
narcole, narcole.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
Narcole?

16:12.440 --> 16:17.560
Which just seems like a generic, narcole, narcole is like, like, super duper painkiller,

16:17.560 --> 16:18.560
like, that's heavy duty.

16:18.560 --> 16:22.320
But then there's, on the bottle, it says hydro something, it doesn't matter, it doesn't,

16:22.320 --> 16:23.320
really doesn't matter.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.760
It feels good, feels great.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.640
And I was in pain, so I took the pill, and then I drank, and so here you have me.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.920
So, just deal with it, as Dr. Phil would say.

16:32.920 --> 16:38.360
As the great Dr. Phil would say, I just want to talk about a couple things, okay?

16:38.360 --> 16:39.360
Great.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.360
Do you mind?

16:40.360 --> 16:46.000
Okay, thank you for coming tonight, Game of Thrones is on tonight, thank you.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.880
That makes you all heroes.

16:48.880 --> 16:54.800
You are all, like, if you were on Game of Thrones, you'd all be the big, tall lesbian

16:54.800 --> 16:55.800
lady.

16:55.800 --> 17:01.680
In my eyes, my favorite character.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.680
What's her name?

17:02.680 --> 17:04.280
I can't, I don't know her name, Brie.

17:04.280 --> 17:05.280
It's Brie, right?

17:05.280 --> 17:06.280
Yeah.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.280
Brie.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.280
Yeah.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.280
It's possible to have watched it and be here right now, right?

17:09.280 --> 17:14.960
And raise a show of hands or applause if people watched it already?

17:14.960 --> 17:15.960
By the same people?

17:15.960 --> 17:16.960
Applause?

17:16.960 --> 17:17.960
Was it good?

17:17.960 --> 17:22.960
It's Game of Thrones, it's beyond that, you can't, you can't, like, Tim.

17:22.960 --> 17:28.560
It's Game of Thrones is a little salty, like, like, forget that.

17:28.560 --> 17:35.280
Game of Thrones is always juicy, which is why it's brought to you by Doritos.

17:35.280 --> 17:49.280
When you have a orange triangle and it's covered in powder that dehydrates you and sends chemicals

17:49.280 --> 17:56.400
to your brain that make you crave the soft drinks manufactured by the same company.

17:56.400 --> 18:03.400
Because we're all slaves and fuck the queen, but also Doritos.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.600
How come the fuck the queen part never makes it in until the music is over?

18:06.600 --> 18:10.080
It's just, it's there for, it's just genre, like, it's like Doritos is going for a new

18:10.080 --> 18:18.800
campaign this year that's like, it's fuck the queen of your hunger.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.600
But they don't, they don't want to mickey mouse it.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.720
Like they don't want it to be in the songs, but it's just like fuck the, fuck the queen

18:24.720 --> 18:25.720
of your hunger.

18:25.720 --> 18:31.680
It's like a punk, like, you're punk, you hate the queen, you're hungry, but you don't want

18:31.680 --> 18:32.680
to fuck.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.440
Because Frito Lays was always God save the queen of your hunger.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.640
They were, they were royalists and that didn't, that, we're done.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.640
Yeah, they love it.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.640
Yeah.

18:40.640 --> 18:44.000
It's like go, go see the, yeah, this is the crown jewel of your hunger.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.280
This is like, their new campaign is like Doritos, you're going to start seeing these commercials

18:47.280 --> 18:48.360
on the internet.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.080
They call them web commercials.

18:51.080 --> 18:56.360
There's like fancy British people and they're like, would you pass me the Salisbury steak,

18:56.360 --> 19:03.760
please Lord Governor, oh yes I will, then all righty, and then Roch, Rocho Randy Savage

19:03.760 --> 19:07.600
comes through the wall and goes like, what the fuck are you doing?

19:07.600 --> 19:10.920
Did you say Nacho Randy Savage?

19:10.920 --> 19:16.680
He's, he's, he's not, he's, did I even hear that or did you say Nacho Randy Savage?

19:16.680 --> 19:21.840
I misspoke, but the truth is that he is now, he's sold out to Doritos?

19:21.840 --> 19:22.840
Yes.

19:22.840 --> 19:23.840
He's now Nacho Randy Savage.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.440
Like when Sergeant Slaughter joined GI Joe, but like, that breaks your heart.

19:27.440 --> 19:31.560
Yeah, he's now Nacho, yeah, I mean, I, yeah, it does break your heart.

19:31.560 --> 19:35.080
I can't believe he's sold out like that.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.080
I can't believe it.

19:36.080 --> 19:43.080
I used to think Macho Randy Savage, I guess I'm talking about pre Slim Jim Randy Savage.

19:43.080 --> 19:49.520
Yeah, but they, yeah, the American psycho Christian Bale, like they're very good as teeth fixed.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.520
Okay.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.520
All right.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.520
Anyways, Game of Thrones, thanks for being here.

19:52.520 --> 19:55.880
Game of Thrones fans and Harmontown fans, you've made a sacrifice that should surely

19:55.880 --> 19:56.880
be rewarded.

19:56.880 --> 19:57.880
I'm sure.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.360
I'm going to get an Apple watch.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.360
Fuck you.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.360
I don't care.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.360
Stop yelling at me.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.360
I don't care.

20:03.360 --> 20:07.800
If Apple made Kleenex, I would get it, I would blow my nose in it, and then it would

20:07.800 --> 20:08.800
go like, okay.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.800
Did the Apple Kleenex work?

20:09.800 --> 20:10.800
Like, I don't have a car.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.800
Fuck you.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.800
I don't care.

20:12.800 --> 20:17.640
I'm not, there's no other company that bothers to like try to like design shit with the consumer

20:17.640 --> 20:18.640
in mind.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.120
Like I'm, it's, and it is for like rich, shitty people.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.520
What does the Apple watch, because I've only seen like images of it.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.040
It's just sort of like, it truly is useless.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.080
It's of course it's useless.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.080
So is Twitter.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.240
Like remember when everyone was like joking about Twitter, like what, what purpose does

20:32.240 --> 20:33.240
Twitter serve?

20:33.240 --> 20:34.240
I don't know.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.640
But like, I know that like, like when I, you know, our watches, we don't wear watches

20:37.640 --> 20:40.480
anymore because we have these phones, but it's like you dig in your pocket, you pull

20:40.480 --> 20:41.760
out these things.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.240
Remember before watches, they had these pocket watches.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.280
That's where we are now.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.560
Your phone has become a pocket watch.

20:47.560 --> 20:54.000
So now we have to go forward into the eighties and have a tinier phone on our wrist that

20:54.000 --> 20:56.400
can just let us know what time it is.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.960
And if we have any text messages without having to pull our phone out of our pocket, I'm getting

20:59.960 --> 21:00.960
one.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.960
Fuck you.

21:01.960 --> 21:02.960
I'm going to get one.

21:02.960 --> 21:07.400
I'm going to wear it discreetly, like under, under long sleeves during the winter because

21:07.400 --> 21:08.880
I am a little embarrassed.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.160
I don't want to, I don't want to be the only guy.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.280
Have you ever seen somebody walking around with them currently?

21:13.280 --> 21:16.280
No, they're just, they're just, they just came out.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.280
So I haven't seen them yet.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.280
I can't wear a watch.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.680
So you may have one right now?

21:19.680 --> 21:20.680
No?

21:20.680 --> 21:21.680
Okay.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.680
See, they're hot.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.680
They're hot.

21:23.680 --> 21:24.680
I can't wear a watch.

21:24.680 --> 21:25.680
I get too fidgety.

21:25.680 --> 21:29.120
And I'm also, when I was in, like it was in the eighties, like junior high school or high

21:29.120 --> 21:32.640
school, I think the last time I wore a watch was I was a freshman in high school and I would

21:32.640 --> 21:36.520
just fidget the whole time and constantly look at my watch and constantly.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.720
That's what you're supposed to do.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.120
It's called using your watch.

21:39.120 --> 21:43.560
Yeah, but I was, I was, I think I have a bit of OCD where I like, I kept looking at it

21:43.560 --> 21:48.080
and I would divide my day up into ever decreasing like fractions of time.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.800
That's what you're supposed to do.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.400
Says big watch.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.880
Let's bring out big watch.

21:58.880 --> 22:07.240
All right, let's bring out, let's, let's bring them out.

22:07.240 --> 22:12.040
Let's just bring them out like the way you bring a bull out at a rodeo.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.240
Out of a giant metal gate?

22:13.240 --> 22:20.240
Let's bring out Rick and Morty creator, Justin Reiland.

22:20.240 --> 22:33.240
Got you by a return and all.

22:33.240 --> 22:38.360
Anywhere you are, I think if you stick closer to me, then it works better.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.360
All right.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.360
Okay.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.360
Wow.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.360
Oh man.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.680
I got a scythe for sore eyes over there.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.680
How are you, Mr. Reiland?

22:45.680 --> 22:46.680
I'm good.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.680
Haven't seen you in a while.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.680
But you don't age at all.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.320
You look just as boyish and whistful as I've ever seen you.

22:51.320 --> 22:56.560
I just sort of build fat slowly, but surely I build fat against my body.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.640
You look hard as a rock.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.640
All right.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.360
Justin, I have a question for you.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.360
Yeah.

23:04.360 --> 23:05.360
And I'm not joking.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.360
How do you keep your hair so soft and manageable?

23:08.360 --> 23:14.400
I don't wash it for a few days in a row, and then I'll sleep on it, and then I'll spray

23:14.400 --> 23:23.240
it with that dry shampoo spray, and then I'll wash it, and then I won't wash it for three

23:23.240 --> 23:26.120
or four days.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.720
The cycle repeats and continues.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.800
But why are we talking about that?

23:31.800 --> 23:35.440
We're really snapping into this news about your hygiene.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.440
Are you into this?

23:36.440 --> 23:37.440
Excessive.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.440
Are you curious?

23:38.440 --> 23:39.440
Excessive.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.680
This is juicy news we're hearing right now.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.520
Man, what am I doing?

23:44.520 --> 23:45.520
How you been?

23:45.520 --> 23:46.520
I'm good.

23:46.520 --> 23:49.000
I went on an emotional weather report from Justin Royal.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Are you still crazy?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Are you still crazy, Justin?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
You're still mentally ill?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Yes.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I'm fucking depressed.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Hmm.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Yeah.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Yeah.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Hey, hey.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Don't fall for it.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Jesus Christ.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.600
Happier as I've ever been.

24:04.600 --> 24:09.600
If a manic depressive tells you he's depressed, you don't say, ah, you say, okay.

24:09.600 --> 24:10.600
Bullshit.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.600
Bullshit.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.600
I'll wait.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.600
Bullshit.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.600
Bullshit.

24:14.600 --> 24:21.840
It's like a person who got off for being criminally insane, and then I have to stand

24:21.840 --> 24:22.840
trial.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.600
Oh, I'm so crazy.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.600
Bullshit.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.680
No, but I'm seriously fucking depressed.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.680
You're fucked up.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.880
You're a crazy person.

24:30.880 --> 24:31.880
I'm not that crazy.

24:31.880 --> 24:36.320
Justin, when you say, you mean you're capital D depressed, or is there something on your

24:36.320 --> 24:37.320
mind right now?

24:37.320 --> 24:38.880
Ah, I'm lowercase D depressed, lowercase.

24:38.880 --> 24:42.800
Is there something on your mind right now that is currently depressing to you, or depressing

24:42.800 --> 24:43.800
you?

24:43.800 --> 24:52.080
Yeah, there is, but his, the sign in the window that said he was here was like so complicated.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.400
Like, what did it say?

24:53.400 --> 24:56.800
Robin Williams has been on the show, and it didn't have like all the caveats.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.680
What was that on the, what was on the window?

24:58.680 --> 24:59.680
What, I don't even know.

24:59.680 --> 25:00.840
Justin, run us here.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.280
It said things we weren't allowed to talk about.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.280
Like on the sign.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.280
What?

25:05.280 --> 25:06.280
Yeah.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.280
Rylan is here, but don't tip the ship for him.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.280
Jesus Christ, fuck, I'm sorry.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.040
Can I see that?

25:12.040 --> 25:13.040
Can I see that, please?

25:13.040 --> 25:14.920
Is this your writing, sir?

25:14.920 --> 25:20.160
Yeah, this was, this was, let the court see.

25:20.160 --> 25:24.400
I wrote this, let me see what I wrote, Rylan is here.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.680
By the way, this is fucking, your assistant told me to do this.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
What's the ship?

25:28.680 --> 25:29.680
What is the ship?

25:29.680 --> 25:34.840
Tip the ship, I don't know, I'm pretty drunk.

25:34.840 --> 25:37.240
I'm pretty drunk right now, and I'm sorry.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.240
I can't believe the fuck.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.240
I took it for him.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.400
Jesus Christ, fuck, I'm sorry.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.400
Yeah, okay, so let me explain this.

25:43.400 --> 25:53.120
So, so, so, so what I was going for here was like, what, what, okay, do you want some

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
paint color?

25:54.120 --> 25:55.120
Spencer?

25:55.120 --> 25:56.120
No, no, no.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.120
I have more.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.120
Yes, yes, but no.

25:58.120 --> 26:03.960
But no, Spencer came, came to me and he said, just go stand in the little window and look

26:03.960 --> 26:04.960
at Dan.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.760
And I'm like, I don't want to do, do that.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.760
He's like doing his bed.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.840
He's like, that's like the opening routine for, I practiced it for days.

26:11.840 --> 26:15.880
I'm not going to stand there like a weirdo and like, leer at him.

26:15.880 --> 26:20.040
And then he looks at me and goes, oh yeah, just put a, but just put a sign, put a novel

26:20.040 --> 26:22.040
on a piece of paper and hold it up.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.440
So, so I said, so I said, so, so he's like, why don't you write down like that you're

26:25.440 --> 26:26.440
here?

26:26.440 --> 26:27.640
And I'm like, okay.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.920
And I, I was really drunk and I wrote this and I still am.

26:30.920 --> 26:37.360
And I wrote, Royland is here, but don't tip the ship for him, which means don't stop what

26:37.360 --> 26:38.360
you're doing.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.880
Oh, I thought it meant don't talk about your relationship.

26:40.880 --> 26:41.880
No.

26:41.880 --> 26:47.760
No, because you said, you said not to talk about your relationship tonight.

26:47.760 --> 26:51.440
No, I know, I know, but no, all it meant was like, don't, don't rock the boat.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.440
Don't.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.440
Yeah.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.440
His relationship.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.440
He's been doing the Harmontown for a while.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.440
Don't, don't.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.440
Right.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.400
Don't, you know, don't mean, don't do anything on my account.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.400
Exactly.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.400
Right.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.400
Yeah.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.920
And then, and then later I wrote Jesus Christ, fuck, I'm sorry.

27:05.920 --> 27:06.920
All right.

27:06.920 --> 27:10.640
And that's just a larger extension of my, where I'm at right now, psychologically.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.640
What is it?

27:11.640 --> 27:12.640
What's, what's, what's the depressing news?

27:12.640 --> 27:13.640
Yeah.

27:13.640 --> 27:14.640
What's going on in your relationship?

27:14.640 --> 27:15.640
What's going on?

27:15.640 --> 27:16.640
We don't want to get into that shit today.

27:16.640 --> 27:17.640
We don't want to get into that today.

27:17.640 --> 27:21.160
Harmony town is about plumbing the rude depths.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.160
I know.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.560
Are you having a good love life?

27:24.560 --> 27:25.560
I am.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.760
I love my girlfriend, fiance.

27:27.760 --> 27:28.760
My fiance girlfriend.

27:28.760 --> 27:29.760
Right.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.760
I love her.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.760
When you're going to tie that knot, you'd propose you're like an 89.

27:32.760 --> 27:36.400
You know, I'm going for a 10, I'm going for a 10-year engagement.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.400
I am.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.400
I'm going for it.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.400
Like the Will Ferrell movie?

27:39.400 --> 27:41.400
What was the, the Paul Rudd, the Mark Russelo?

27:41.400 --> 27:42.400
Yeah.

27:42.400 --> 27:48.680
I'm going, I'm going for the 10-year engagement because I think that, you know, screen printed

27:48.680 --> 27:54.480
leggings of fucking, what the fuck are you wearing, dude?

27:54.480 --> 27:57.200
It's Anatoly's wearing special pants.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.200
Are these Anatoly?

27:58.200 --> 27:59.200
God damn you.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.200
Anatoly, come stand up and show everybody your special pants.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.200
Yeah.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.600
Somebody like, cameraman zoom in on this.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.240
Holy fucking shit.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.960
The guy that played, what's the guy from Jinx?

28:10.960 --> 28:14.480
What's the fucking Bobby Durst?

28:14.480 --> 28:15.480
He's got Ryan Gosling.

28:15.480 --> 28:20.560
He's got fucking Ryan Gosling, AKA Bobby Durst fucking pants on.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.480
His bones are deco posh with Ryan Gosling's face.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.200
And he just flexed them a little bit.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.200
Anatoly, Anatoly, turn around.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.360
His bones are like, turn around Mr. Junior's pecs.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.480
Show them some Russian Ryan Gosling cock.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.480
There we are.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.480
There we are.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.480
That's the stuff.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.480
That's, we just changed our rating.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.480
And our religion.

28:41.480 --> 28:44.840
Yeah, this is the Anatoly I like.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.840
I don't, I don't like the aloof Anatoly.

28:48.840 --> 28:49.840
The one where you're wearing the mask.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.840
Don't be aloof about me pointing out your aloofness.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.840
Yeah.

28:53.840 --> 28:58.040
I like the, I like the, I like the out there figure skating, Anatoly.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.040
Anatoly, grab a mic.

28:59.040 --> 29:02.880
I like the guy that like wears like a Hello Kitty like hood.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.880
And then, and then you go like, what's going on with the Hello Kitty?

29:04.880 --> 29:08.720
And then he goes, what do you mean?

29:08.720 --> 29:09.720
What the fuck?

29:09.720 --> 29:10.720
What?

29:10.720 --> 29:11.720
Why?

29:11.720 --> 29:12.720
I don't know.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.720
I don't know what the fuck.

29:13.720 --> 29:14.720
Ryan Gosling is really fucking attractive.

29:14.720 --> 29:15.720
You're right.

29:15.720 --> 29:16.720
You're right.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.720
Maybe.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.720
I know.

29:18.720 --> 29:19.720
And Anatoly can ask you a personal question.

29:19.720 --> 29:27.560
What does one acquire a pair of, so the sink, it's called internet?

29:27.560 --> 29:30.560
There's a sink called the internet.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.560
What is this?

29:31.560 --> 29:32.560
See, I don't like it.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.560
I don't like it.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.560
I don't, I don't, I don't like this generation.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.560
I don't like it.

29:36.560 --> 29:42.560
See, I mean, I mean, see, back in my day, when I wanted to pick up some, some Ralph Machio

29:42.560 --> 29:47.960
tights, I had to walk into a store and physically purchase them over the counter.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.360
And then you have to hurry it home.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.360
You just carry it home like all the way.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.360
Yeah.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.640
And now you have to just sit home and just push the button and you have one.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.640
Where's the, where's the pride in what you're doing, Anatoly?

29:57.640 --> 30:02.080
Where's the, where's the, where's the pride and ownership of buying your Ryan Gosling

30:02.080 --> 30:03.080
price anonymously?

30:03.080 --> 30:04.080
Who needs pride?

30:04.080 --> 30:05.080
It's not about pride.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.080
Like a thief.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.080
It's not fucking about pride.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.080
It should be about pride.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.080
No, nothing's about pride.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.080
It's about ease of purchase.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.080
Wow.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.080
Yeah.

30:13.080 --> 30:17.080
I, I, yeah, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

30:17.080 --> 30:18.420
like, nothing is about pride.

30:18.420 --> 30:19.620
He's right.

30:19.620 --> 30:23.860
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

30:23.860 --> 30:31.480
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

30:31.480 --> 30:43.660
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

30:43.660 --> 30:45.200
I, I, I, I, I, I

30:45.200 --> 30:46.200
Yeah.

30:46.200 --> 30:52.200
Over the line, Jeff. Over the line.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.200
I'm a journalist, Dan. I'm a journalist.

30:55.200 --> 30:59.200
How can you have no respect to Ryan Gosling, dude? No.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.200
It's fucking Ryan Gosling.

31:00.200 --> 31:03.200
No, I didn't. I don't show the respect that you were showing it.

31:03.200 --> 31:10.200
I always get Ryan Gosling confused with the other guy, the Brian Gosling.

31:10.200 --> 31:16.200
No. That's his name. Oh, Gyllenhaal, the little Gyllenhaal.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.200
Jake Gyllenhaal.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.200
Jake Gyllenhaal.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.200
I can't tell the difference between those two.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.200
Yeah, because their beards are shapeshifting. You never know what beard they're going to have.

31:22.200 --> 31:26.200
Yeah, I just thought that they both came from the same silly putty egg, and they're both like,

31:26.200 --> 31:31.200
like one of them you went like this, and one of them you went like that.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.200
And they're both like always upset.

31:34.200 --> 31:41.200
You know what they have in common, though? All girls we know want to bone them.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.200
All right.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.200
I mean, that's everybody. That's everybody.

31:47.200 --> 31:52.200
Really? You're going to fucking put me up on a witch stick and burn me?

31:52.200 --> 31:54.200
That's a witch, witch, witch stick?

31:54.200 --> 31:57.200
Dan and I have a mutual friend named, this actor named Daniel Gillies.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.200
He's wonderful, and he's on like those vampire shows and stuff, and he's fantastic.

32:00.200 --> 32:05.200
And he's friends with Ryan Gosling, and for...

32:05.200 --> 32:06.200
Name drop.

32:06.200 --> 32:12.200
No, no, no, this is me dropping Ryan Gosling's name on behalf of somebody else.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.200
I'm kidding.

32:13.200 --> 32:18.200
For Daniel's birthday party, Ryan Gosling did something that I thought was incredibly groovy.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.200
He showed up at the...

32:19.200 --> 32:21.200
With Jake Gyllenhaal.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.200
And he's like...

32:23.200 --> 32:27.200
And they just started fucking right in front of everybody.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.200
And they were tights with Daniel's picture all over them.

32:30.200 --> 32:34.200
He came to his birthday party with Jake Gyllenhaal, and they took hostages.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.200
And then both of them kept saying like,

32:37.200 --> 32:41.200
No, I'm Ryan Gosling to all the party guests.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.200
All the party guests had to figure out who to shoot.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.200
They all had guns for some reason.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.200
And they had hostages, which doesn't make any sense.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.200
As you walked into the party, you got a loaded gun.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.200
Yeah, you got a firearm.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.200
All right, what did he really do?

32:53.200 --> 32:58.200
He showed up at the, what's it called, the Chateau Marmont, and Daniel got to swinging like Balcony,

32:58.200 --> 33:00.200
like one of the great rooms up there.

33:00.200 --> 33:06.200
And Ryan Gosling comes in on his own, but behind him, I think a 10 or 12 piece mariachi band.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.200
That was his gift.

33:07.200 --> 33:13.200
And they played for half an hour, and they fucking boned out, and that was his gift.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.200
There was 30 minutes of mariachi music.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.200
Can I hear that song?

33:16.200 --> 33:19.200
He brought it for his gift to Daniel.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.200
I brought you music from these guys.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.200
Oh, oh, oh, it was Daniel's birthday.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.200
Jeff, can you tell me that song again?

33:25.200 --> 33:27.200
My name is Dan Harmon.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.200
No, no, no, Jeff, Jeff, the song that they played when they came in?

33:30.200 --> 33:31.200
I just, you want to hear it?

33:35.200 --> 33:36.200
I can't sing.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.200
I want more, though.

33:37.200 --> 33:42.200
I want chorus verse chorus verse of that song.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.200
Anna Tully, do you miss the Cold War?

33:44.200 --> 33:45.200
Thank you, Dan.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.200
I do, I do.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.200
I was thinking about it today.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.200
I was talking to my assistant, Steve Levy, about it.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.200
We were like, holy shit, man.

33:54.200 --> 33:58.200
So we're just marveling at that 50 year plan we had before we got into World War II.

33:58.200 --> 34:05.200
And it was like, fuck, man, for 50 years, like the bad guys were just other white people with a backwards alphabet.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.200
It was fucking amazing.

34:07.200 --> 34:17.200
And like barely any bloodshed for 50 years, just a bunch of cool movies about how we all had film in our pens.

34:17.200 --> 34:21.200
And now it's just like, fucking day of the goddamn dead.

34:21.200 --> 34:25.200
Anna Tully, like in Russia during the Cold War, I mean, how old are you first off?

34:25.200 --> 34:26.200
You're quite young.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.200
25.

34:27.200 --> 34:29.200
25, so you might be too young to answer this well.

34:29.200 --> 34:34.200
But were there, again, the 80s for us, there were great movies where the Russians were always the great bad guys.

34:34.200 --> 34:40.200
We saw the decade end when it seems the world would collide with the blink of an eye.

34:40.200 --> 34:47.200
The show brought to you by retard and all.

34:54.200 --> 34:56.200
I was doing that song, that song.

34:56.200 --> 34:57.200
Remember that song?

34:57.200 --> 34:58.200
Oh, yeah.

34:58.200 --> 35:05.200
Woman on the radio said that fruity pebbles were allowed in Germany.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.200
Keep going.

35:06.200 --> 35:13.200
Right, right now, watching the world wake up from history.

35:13.200 --> 35:18.200
Skritti Polini, who are those guys?

35:18.200 --> 35:22.200
In Russia, were there great movies where the Americans were the bad guys?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.200
Was that a thing too?

35:23.200 --> 35:25.200
No, it wasn't like really big.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.200
No, I don't think so.

35:26.200 --> 35:29.200
You guys were just stabbing each other for blue jeans the whole time.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.200
That was the big secret.

35:30.200 --> 35:36.200
We were like, oh no, the Russians, and they were like, don't tell them, give me some bread.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.200
No.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.200
Offensive?

35:38.200 --> 35:39.200
Probably.

35:39.200 --> 35:46.200
Yeah, that's fucked up.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.200
Yeah, but it was bad over there the whole time.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.200
Always was.

35:49.200 --> 35:52.200
They sold counterfeit watches and stuff.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.200
I mean, that's all they did.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.200
Right?

35:55.200 --> 35:56.200
Right?

35:56.200 --> 35:57.200
Bro?

35:57.200 --> 36:06.200
My joke is that, you know, the joke was, like Dan was going, you know, hardcore.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.200
Yeah.

36:07.200 --> 36:14.200
And I was like, oh yeah, I'm going to go hardcore, but also racist.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.200
Dustin, to continue that.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.200
Against Russian people.

36:17.200 --> 36:20.200
Everything I know about Russia, I learned from the movie Red Heat with Jim Belushi and

36:20.200 --> 36:23.200
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.200
That was a hard hitting documentary.

36:26.200 --> 36:31.200
Dustin, I think that you should take advantage of what we're being racist about Russians.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.200
Yeah.

36:32.200 --> 36:36.200
To use this Russian intellectual here to explain your depression and what's going on in your

36:36.200 --> 36:37.200
life right now.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.200
I'm just fucking depressed.

36:38.200 --> 36:39.200
Yeah, sir.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.200
Like, I want to kill myself.

36:41.200 --> 36:50.200
But I'm too scared to do that because I am so frightened of what would happen if I did

36:50.200 --> 36:51.200
kill myself.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.200
You know what I mean?

36:52.200 --> 36:56.200
I'm one of those fucking people.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.200
You chalk me up into that category.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.200
Jethophobes.

37:01.200 --> 37:07.200
The people that want to die, but then are so scared of what happens when you die that

37:07.200 --> 37:09.200
they're afraid to kill themselves.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.200
That's me, ladies and gentlemen.

37:11.200 --> 37:14.200
All right, Anatoly, how do you deal with that?

37:14.200 --> 37:19.200
How do you deal with that shit with your fucking Frank Gosling pants?

37:19.200 --> 37:21.200
How do you deal with that shit?

37:21.200 --> 37:22.200
Okay.

37:22.200 --> 37:27.200
I want Ryan Gosling to suck on my people.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.200
I'm talking.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.200
I'm talking.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.200
I'm talking.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.200
It's funny.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.200
Sorry, sorry.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.200
That's fucked up.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.200
I'm sorry.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.200
That's fucked up.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.200
That's mean and I'm sorry and I did not mean to offend you.

37:38.200 --> 37:39.200
All right.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.200
Go, Anatoly.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.200
You have the floor.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.200
The floor, okay.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.200
Then I can have a floor to move my religion.

37:45.200 --> 37:48.200
It's about what happened after you die.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.200
Okay.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.200
Nothing will happen.

37:50.200 --> 37:55.200
Pretty Russian.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.200
Nothing will happen.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.200
Lights out, baby.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.200
What you're saying is blackness.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.200
Blackness.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.200
Blackness.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.200
But blackness is a thing.

38:03.200 --> 38:06.200
I'm telling you, man, I don't think that's true.

38:06.200 --> 38:10.200
I think that when you kill yourself and die or if you die in a car crash or if you fucking

38:10.200 --> 38:17.200
whatever, however you die, I think that you are reborn in, okay, so I'm kind of hung up

38:17.200 --> 38:22.200
on this because, so let's say Harmon, you make babies with Aaron, right?

38:22.200 --> 38:27.200
Poop out a bunch of babies and those little babies find, let's say they're girls.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.200
Okay.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.200
Just follow me.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.200
So they're girls and they find these boys and the boys are like, I'm gonna fuck and

38:32.200 --> 38:33.200
fuck that bitch.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.200
Okay.

38:34.200 --> 38:38.200
So then the boys fuck your girls and they make little babies and they poop those out,

38:38.200 --> 38:39.200
right?

38:39.200 --> 38:40.200
Okay.

38:40.200 --> 38:47.200
So they go on and, you know, the fucking circle of life continues and you die.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.200
Okay.

38:48.200 --> 38:57.200
So my theory is maybe that you will be reborn in your own lineage way down the road when

38:57.200 --> 39:03.200
the fucking water's gone, when we're fucking, the planet's burning up and the NASA space

39:03.200 --> 39:06.200
station is like, oh shit, we gotta hurry up.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.200
But how can it be me if I'm not able to go like, it's me.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.200
You wiped.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.200
Like it'll be you.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.200
Well, then if you're wiped, then you don't exist.

39:12.200 --> 39:17.000
No, you do though, because it'll be you, but you're, all your memories will be wiped.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.200
So you'll get pooped out of the vagina.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.400
But who cares about that guy?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.200
You will because you're gonna have to fucking live it.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.600
No, I won't because my memory will be wiped.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.600
Yeah, but you will because you'll be fucking living it.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.800
No, you might as well say that about all life.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.200
That is true about all life.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.200
That's the beautiful thing is life.

39:31.200 --> 39:34.200
I'm not saying you're gonna come back as a blade of grass.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.200
I'm saying.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.200
As another guy who is the equivalent of a blade of grass.

39:37.200 --> 39:41.200
You're gonna come back as Dan Harmon's great, great, great, great grandson.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.200
But he's not gonna.

39:42.200 --> 39:46.200
And it's gonna be little Danny Harmon pooping out of his vagina.

39:46.200 --> 39:50.200
And he's gonna be like, oh, tell him how bodies work.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.200
Here I go.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.200
But I know.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.200
But like, I put this.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.200
Oh, I love life.

39:54.200 --> 39:59.200
And then when you get to like age 20, you're gonna be like, what the fuck is going on?

39:59.200 --> 40:01.200
Like you did in this life.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.200
And then you're gonna start to go, what the fuck?

40:03.200 --> 40:04.200
I'm 20.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.200
Okay.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.200
You're 25, 30, 40.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.200
Bullshit.

40:07.200 --> 40:11.200
But that guy never says, I had a podcast.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.200
Did I mention a podcast?

40:13.200 --> 40:18.200
No, I'm saying that your identity is based on the idea that you would have anything to do.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.200
You know what you'll have in that day?

40:19.200 --> 40:22.200
You'll be like, I have a scrubby schmast.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.200
It'll be some weird thing.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.200
You're not even listening to me.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.200
I'm sorry.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.200
I want to listen.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.200
Tell me.

40:29.200 --> 40:31.200
I want to understand what you were saying.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.200
You promise you'll listen?

40:32.200 --> 40:33.200
Yeah, I swear.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.200
I swear.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.200
All right.

40:35.200 --> 40:43.200
If you're reincarnated, but the only part that's not reincarnated is all memory of your previous life.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.200
Okay.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.200
That's not reincarnation.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.200
That's biology.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.200
Yes.

40:47.200 --> 40:50.200
Of course, my cum goes into a thing and then the cum changes.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.200
No, but that's not what I'm saying, though.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.200
Okay.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.200
Sorry.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.200
It's semen.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.200
Get ready.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.200
So what are-

40:57.200 --> 40:59.200
Atoms, molecules, cosmic light.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.200
What I'm saying is that-

41:00.200 --> 41:01.200
Cum is gross.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.200
I'm saying that, you know, you and Aaron have a baby.

41:03.200 --> 41:07.200
That baby goes on whether it's a boy and girl and appropriate-

41:07.200 --> 41:08.200
I didn't-

41:08.200 --> 41:09.200
You don't have-

41:09.200 --> 41:11.200
You don't have to-

41:11.200 --> 41:14.200
I don't want to be gloob about this, but you don't have to walk me through this again.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.200
All right, fine.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.200
I know how life works, and I know-

41:17.200 --> 41:19.200
Okay, so that's 70 years from now.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.200
That's one possibility, by the way.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.200
One possibility.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.200
By the way, that's exactly what happens.

41:24.200 --> 41:29.200
Everybody says who's fortunate enough to live long enough to see grandparents and grandchildren,

41:29.200 --> 41:34.200
and they say you are- you're the spitting image of, and you have the personality of your great-

41:34.200 --> 41:37.200
Holy shit, you are that motherfucker.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.200
One of the-

41:38.200 --> 41:39.200
Maybe.

41:39.200 --> 41:45.200
One of the progenitors of my family was like a philosophy major and a curmudgeon and a hermit,

41:45.200 --> 41:48.200
and like he lost all his money in the stock market,

41:48.200 --> 41:51.200
and he was the only other Harmon that went to school or whatever,

41:51.200 --> 41:53.200
like I never met him, but he was like a guy,

41:53.200 --> 41:56.200
and he just- he was so long dead before I was ever around,

41:56.200 --> 41:59.200
but then a couple of old people were able to say before they died,

41:59.200 --> 42:02.200
you're just like, so it's a-

42:02.200 --> 42:04.200
It is reincarnation in that sense,

42:04.200 --> 42:07.200
like I am like that guy because there's a fiber there.

42:07.200 --> 42:13.200
So then the, you know, the whole thing of like reproducing and pooping out babies,

42:13.200 --> 42:18.200
and well maybe fuck some other people and keep fucking and shitting out babies,

42:18.200 --> 42:20.200
it's a little bit, you know, I mean-

42:20.200 --> 42:22.200
It's very accurate, yes.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.200
That's how life works.

42:24.200 --> 42:29.200
But Justin, your fear you said is that if you are reincarnated as a poop baby

42:29.200 --> 42:32.200
three generations from now and there's no water and the planet is all crappy,

42:32.200 --> 42:34.200
what if in the future life-

42:34.200 --> 42:38.200
Listen, I don't want nothing to do with it.

42:38.200 --> 42:41.200
You won't have anything to do with it.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.200
It's not you.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.200
So I'm not having children, okay?

42:44.200 --> 42:46.200
That's why I'm not shitting babies out.

42:46.200 --> 42:49.200
You're still gonna have just as much to do with it without having children

42:49.200 --> 42:51.200
because one of their babies is gonna be you.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.200
So let's talk about the other thing, right?

42:53.200 --> 42:57.200
So you have babies, you poop them out, and then, you know,

42:57.200 --> 43:01.200
let's say in this crazy, weird, magical version of reality,

43:01.200 --> 43:05.200
your life, you'll be reincarnated as one of these babies,

43:05.200 --> 43:08.200
like so many lines, there are so many things online.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.200
So what's the opposite of that?

43:09.200 --> 43:12.200
The opposite of that is you say, I'm not gonna have, I'm gonna bisect me,

43:12.200 --> 43:14.200
I'm not gonna have any fucking kids.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.200
So then what happens?

43:15.200 --> 43:19.200
Well then you're in fucking heaven and there's 700 virgins-

43:19.200 --> 43:20.200
What?

43:20.200 --> 43:24.200
It will fuck you.

43:24.200 --> 43:29.200
You know what I mean?

43:29.200 --> 43:31.200
Justin!

43:31.200 --> 43:33.200
Totally crazy people think that.

43:33.200 --> 43:38.200
Justin, those are your two, your main two theories of course.

43:38.200 --> 43:42.200
700, I love the idea that you're just-

43:42.200 --> 43:45.200
700 virgin women.

43:45.200 --> 43:52.200
We'll have sex with you if your parents refuse to procreate.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.200
Justin, it sounds to me like-

43:53.200 --> 43:54.200
I'm just kidding.

43:54.200 --> 43:57.200
It sounds to me like possibly that you're more afraid of not leaving.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.200
Man, I'm just fucking afraid of everything.

43:59.200 --> 44:02.200
You do want children, you do want to leave someone behind.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.200
That's what I'm believing in.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.200
I don't know if I can care for another human being, I'm scared.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.200
I'm just really scared.

44:08.200 --> 44:13.200
Well you shouldn't have kids, no one wants you to have kids.

44:13.200 --> 44:17.200
A lot of people are bummed out you have dogs.

44:17.200 --> 44:23.200
I talked to a guy tonight that's bummed out you have Legos.

44:23.200 --> 44:28.200
I have to say that I love my dogs and I take care of them so well.

44:28.200 --> 44:33.200
I've rescued and saved dogs, but I get it, you know.

44:33.200 --> 44:36.200
He's a good dog owner, he's a very good dog owner.

44:36.200 --> 44:39.200
Are you worried about your dogs pooping out babies?

44:39.200 --> 44:41.200
No, no, no.

44:41.200 --> 44:43.200
I want to check in with the booth.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.200
Do we have friends back there that are-

44:45.200 --> 44:46.200
Yeah we do?

44:46.200 --> 44:47.200
Oh god, for God's sake.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.200
Anatoly, go sit down.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.200
Please.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.200
Thank you everybody.

44:50.200 --> 44:51.200
Thank you Anatoly.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.200
Fuck out of here.

44:52.200 --> 44:54.200
Thank you Ryan Gosling.

44:54.200 --> 45:00.200
I don't know what you guys want.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.200
What do you want from me?

45:01.200 --> 45:02.200
What do you want?

45:02.200 --> 45:03.200
What do you want?

45:03.200 --> 45:04.200
That's you.

45:04.200 --> 45:07.200
What the fuck?

45:07.200 --> 45:08.200
What do you want?

45:08.200 --> 45:09.200
What do you want from me?

45:09.200 --> 45:11.200
I don't know what to want.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.200
I dress up like a Christmas tree.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.200
What do you want?

45:14.200 --> 45:15.200
What do you want?

45:15.200 --> 45:16.200
That's you.

45:16.200 --> 45:17.200
Oh shit.

45:17.200 --> 45:18.200
What do you want from me?

45:18.200 --> 45:19.200
Oh fuck.

45:19.200 --> 45:20.200
Uh oh.

45:20.200 --> 45:21.200
No, you're not supposed to be able to-

45:21.200 --> 45:22.200
You asked for it.

45:22.200 --> 45:23.200
Respond.

45:23.200 --> 45:24.200
Oh no.

45:24.200 --> 45:25.200
Our audience is-

45:25.200 --> 45:26.200
They're learning how to think.

45:26.200 --> 45:27.200
They're using tools.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.200
It's like when the velociraptor doorknob.

45:28.200 --> 45:40.200
How did that Jurassic World movie go?

45:40.200 --> 45:45.200
People are saying like I was pretty spot on with my predictions about Jurassic World.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.200
We should have a screening here.

45:47.200 --> 45:48.200
Yeah, yeah.

45:48.200 --> 45:54.200
That Chris Pratt is like the guy who really he understands velociraptors and they him.

45:54.200 --> 45:59.200
Hey man, I know Chris Pratt that motherfucker ain't jokin' around.

45:59.200 --> 46:00.200
I'll tell you one thing.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.200
He don't eat no fat.

46:02.200 --> 46:03.200
Justin.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.200
And his wife didn't eat no lean.

46:05.200 --> 46:06.200
Justin, can I say something?

46:06.200 --> 46:07.200
Do me a favor.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.200
Will you do me a favor?

46:09.200 --> 46:11.200
Do you consider me a pal and a friend?

46:11.200 --> 46:12.200
I love you, yeah.

46:12.200 --> 46:13.200
I love you.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.200
Will you do me a favor?

46:14.200 --> 46:15.200
Just for me.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.200
Yeah.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.200
Don't kill yourself because I love you.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.200
Oh, I have two days from now.

46:20.200 --> 46:25.200
You're gonna find my body hangin' from a noose, baby.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.200
Nah, just kidding.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.200
I have something important to say about that and I've said it before.

46:29.200 --> 46:35.200
We have a young audience and there are hipsters and stuff and people have like we all go through

46:35.200 --> 46:36.200
a bunch of shit.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.200
You go through a bunch of shit, different phases of your life.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.200
No one wants to be told you're going through a phase.

46:40.200 --> 46:42.200
Your feelings are your actual feelings.

46:42.200 --> 46:45.200
The most important thing you can do is talk to somebody about them.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.200
You have to talk to somebody about them.

46:47.200 --> 46:50.200
You have a friend or a family member that you trust.

46:50.200 --> 46:51.200
You don't have to call them.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.200
What is this, Dr. Phil?

46:52.200 --> 46:54.200
What am I on a fuckin' daytime talk show?

46:54.200 --> 46:58.200
It's the important thing that you need to say to anybody who is ever having these thoughts.

46:58.200 --> 47:01.200
The most dangerous thing you can do is let them bounce around in your head.

47:01.200 --> 47:05.200
Rest assured, I have three therapists that have been given to me their numbers.

47:05.200 --> 47:08.200
I have not called any of them yet.

47:08.200 --> 47:11.200
I don't know if I will, maybe I will.

47:11.200 --> 47:16.200
Or maybe I'll fuck it, blow my goddamn brains out.

47:16.200 --> 47:19.200
If you do, if we do find you hanging from a news two days from now.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.200
No, no, I just want to let everyone know I would never do that.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.200
I'm too scared of death.

47:23.200 --> 47:27.200
I'm too scared of the whole death thing to be able to actually kill myself.

47:27.200 --> 47:31.200
So, no matter how suicidal I get, I will never kill myself.

47:31.200 --> 47:35.200
And that is my promise to you.

47:35.200 --> 47:40.200
You fuckin' pussy.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.200
What a stunt.

47:42.200 --> 47:47.200
Justin Roiland. He didn't bounce to not kill himself.

47:47.200 --> 47:50.200
Emotional terrorist.

47:50.200 --> 47:53.200
Is it our old family friend? Is he here?

47:53.200 --> 47:57.200
Okay, not old. I mean, his relationship with our show is old.

47:57.200 --> 47:58.200
What do we got?

47:58.200 --> 48:02.200
Curtis Armstrong's down!

48:02.200 --> 48:06.200
Curtis Armstrong brought to you by Honda.

48:06.200 --> 48:10.200
Dorito Armstrong!

48:10.200 --> 48:12.200
No, you can stay there.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.200
Thank you!

48:26.200 --> 48:27.200
Curtis, hello.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.200
Nice to be here.

48:29.200 --> 48:32.200
Curtis, what did I do to deserve a nice yellow tulip?

48:32.200 --> 48:34.200
Well, I'll tell you.

48:34.200 --> 48:39.200
When somebody kisses your balls,

48:39.200 --> 48:42.200
the way you did me,

48:42.200 --> 48:45.200
you go out and you buy them a nice gift.

48:45.200 --> 48:49.200
You see, ladies, is it that hard?

48:49.200 --> 48:52.200
We learned a little bit from Curtis Armstrong.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.200
It had never happened to me before,

48:54.200 --> 48:58.200
and I've been thinking about it all week.

48:58.200 --> 49:02.200
So, today on my way here, I stopped to get you a tulip.

49:02.200 --> 49:05.200
Well, that's lovely. Tulips are among my favorite flowers, Curtis.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.200
They're among your favorite flowers?

49:06.200 --> 49:07.200
Yes.

49:07.200 --> 49:10.200
Your romance, I think you said you were going to come with your wife tonight, right?

49:10.200 --> 49:11.200
I was going to.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.200
Your wife?

49:12.200 --> 49:13.200
She didn't come.

49:13.200 --> 49:17.200
I've always been meaning to ask you about your love life.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.200
You're married.

49:20.200 --> 49:23.200
I'm married for 22 years.

49:23.200 --> 49:28.200
Do you have kids or anything?

49:28.200 --> 49:31.200
We have one child, a girl who's 19.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.200
Did you poop her out?

49:33.200 --> 49:34.200
You say 19?

49:34.200 --> 49:35.200
I didn't.

49:35.200 --> 49:37.200
I was present for it.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.200
Were you there physically?

49:38.200 --> 49:39.200
Did you watch the whole?

49:39.200 --> 49:40.200
I was there physically.

49:40.200 --> 49:41.200
You saw the whole flimflap?

49:41.200 --> 49:42.200
The whole thing.

49:42.200 --> 49:47.200
I was even in the hazmat suit that you have to wear during the process.

49:47.200 --> 49:48.200
You were right there.

49:48.200 --> 49:49.200
You were there with the boots.

49:49.200 --> 49:53.200
Hey, in all seriousness, when you were there watching the baby come out,

49:53.200 --> 49:55.200
did it change your sex life afterwards?

49:55.200 --> 49:57.200
No, it didn't change my...

49:57.200 --> 49:59.200
I mean, we didn't have much of a sex life before then,

49:59.200 --> 50:01.200
so it didn't change that much.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.200
You had some?

50:02.200 --> 50:04.200
We had some.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.200
Did it get better?

50:06.200 --> 50:08.200
Yeah, it actually, I think, it did, actually.

50:08.200 --> 50:10.200
Because you were like, come on, anything goes down there.

50:10.200 --> 50:12.200
No, yeah.

50:12.200 --> 50:14.200
Hot dog in a hallway.

50:14.200 --> 50:16.200
There was a...

50:16.200 --> 50:19.200
The doctor was doing the process,

50:19.200 --> 50:23.200
and it was one of those moments that as a father,

50:23.200 --> 50:26.200
and you're going through this, many of you will go through this.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.200
Many of you may have.

50:28.200 --> 50:29.200
All of you will go through this.

50:29.200 --> 50:30.200
More of you than should.

50:30.200 --> 50:31.200
No, not all of you.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.200
8 billion of us.

50:32.200 --> 50:35.200
And every one of you will go through it.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.200
For God's sakes, will you adopt a China person?

50:37.200 --> 50:38.200
Yeah.

50:38.200 --> 50:40.200
Many people may.

50:40.200 --> 50:42.200
Will marry a Chinese girl and go through...

50:42.200 --> 50:44.200
What we went through.

50:44.200 --> 50:48.200
And what I remember most vividly from this moment

50:48.200 --> 50:51.200
was the moment where I was standing there watching

50:51.200 --> 50:54.200
and the doctors there ready to receive,

50:54.200 --> 50:59.200
and suddenly this thing started to appear.

50:59.200 --> 51:02.200
And I said, oh honey!

51:02.200 --> 51:04.200
I see her!

51:04.200 --> 51:05.200
She's coming!

51:05.200 --> 51:09.200
And the doctor said, that's a hemorrhoid.

51:09.200 --> 51:15.200
And we had another nine hours of labor to go.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.200
And the hemorrhoid came out and was coming.

51:17.200 --> 51:20.200
The hemorrhoid was like, oh, come on.

51:20.200 --> 51:21.200
You're like the worst...

51:21.200 --> 51:23.200
That changes you.

51:23.200 --> 51:25.200
That changes you.

51:25.200 --> 51:27.200
Because you think...

51:27.200 --> 51:29.200
The hemorrhoid was so...

51:29.200 --> 51:30.200
Wrong direction.

51:30.200 --> 51:31.200
Well, you know what I mean?

51:31.200 --> 51:32.200
For a moment...

51:32.200 --> 51:33.200
Choke guy.

51:33.200 --> 51:34.200
No, I was...

51:34.200 --> 51:35.200
I mean...

51:35.200 --> 51:38.200
So are there vaginal hemorrhoids?

51:38.200 --> 51:53.200
This segment brought to you by Dorito.

51:53.200 --> 51:55.200
You got questions.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.200
Dorito's here to snap into them.

51:57.200 --> 52:01.200
Crispy, crispy, inanimate old questions.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.200
All right.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.200
Thank you.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.200
There was a hemorrhoid...

52:04.200 --> 52:06.200
I mean, hemorrhoids are in your butt.

52:06.200 --> 52:09.200
I mean, I was actually looking for something that wasn't there yet.

52:09.200 --> 52:11.200
And I saw what I thought it was.

52:11.200 --> 52:12.200
It was like an illusion.

52:12.200 --> 52:13.200
It was an illusion.

52:13.200 --> 52:14.200
It was me.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.200
You were projecting.

52:15.200 --> 52:16.200
You were projecting into her butt.

52:16.200 --> 52:17.200
I was projecting.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.200
But it did change me, though.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.200
I mean...

52:20.200 --> 52:22.200
Your story just changed me.

52:22.200 --> 52:23.200
Yeah.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.200
So you have one 19-year-old...

52:25.200 --> 52:26.200
I have one 19...

52:26.200 --> 52:28.200
Wonderful 19-year-old who's...

52:28.200 --> 52:31.200
What has that been like from year one to year 19?

52:31.200 --> 52:32.200
Take us through it.

52:32.200 --> 52:33.200
From what?

52:33.200 --> 52:35.200
I mean, you only have one.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.200
That's the fast version.

52:36.200 --> 52:38.200
That's kind of unusual.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.200
Yeah, I guess so.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.200
Yeah, it was great.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.200
Everything has been...

52:41.200 --> 52:43.200
She is so astonishing.

52:43.200 --> 52:45.200
And she lives in London.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.200
And she's studying psycholinguistics.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.200
Jesus.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.200
And she...

52:49.200 --> 52:52.200
And she lives in London.

52:52.200 --> 52:57.200
I'm so glad I met you.

52:57.200 --> 53:00.200
Thought I had a chance.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.200
But she lives in London.

53:03.200 --> 53:04.200
She'll be back, though.

53:04.200 --> 53:05.200
Oh.

53:08.200 --> 53:09.200
I love Curtis.

53:09.200 --> 53:11.200
I'm meeting all of our friends.

53:11.200 --> 53:13.200
I guess that's great.

53:13.200 --> 53:16.200
And she's not involved.

53:16.200 --> 53:17.200
Oh, nice.

53:17.200 --> 53:18.200
You are kind of, though, right?

53:18.200 --> 53:19.200
Politics?

53:19.200 --> 53:20.200
No, yeah.

53:20.200 --> 53:23.200
No, don't turn him under your daughter.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.200
No, I wouldn't really.

53:25.200 --> 53:27.200
I wouldn't either, god damn it.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.200
Who am I?

53:28.200 --> 53:29.200
No, if you were in my shoes,

53:29.200 --> 53:32.200
you wouldn't introduce you to...

53:32.200 --> 53:34.200
My daughter, either.

53:34.200 --> 53:35.200
Right.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.200
So anyway, there she is.

53:36.200 --> 53:37.200
And she's doing...

53:37.200 --> 53:38.200
She's working.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.200
And she's...

53:39.200 --> 53:41.200
Is your wife British?

53:41.200 --> 53:42.200
No, no, no.

53:42.200 --> 53:43.200
She just...

53:43.200 --> 53:44.200
She was over there doing...

53:44.200 --> 53:46.200
You know a magazine called Mojo Magazine?

53:46.200 --> 53:47.200
Music Magazine?

53:47.200 --> 53:48.200
You know that?

53:48.200 --> 53:51.200
So she was doing an internship there last summer.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.200
And she was going to go to NYU.

53:53.200 --> 53:57.200
She wound up hearing that King's College had a great program.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.200
So she applied and they took her.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.200
Psycholinguistics.

54:00.200 --> 54:02.200
That's not so groovy.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.200
Did I say psycho?

54:03.200 --> 54:05.200
I think you said psycho maybe.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.200
I think it's just the company.

54:13.200 --> 54:16.200
19 year old daughter.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.200
Psycholinguistics.

54:20.200 --> 54:21.200
I know.

54:21.200 --> 54:23.200
High apacea, Armstrong.

54:23.200 --> 54:24.200
I would never do that.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.200
High apacea?

54:25.200 --> 54:27.200
I would never make a joke like that.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.200
You just did make a joke.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.200
I would never in my life.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.200
You made a joke exactly like that.

54:34.200 --> 54:40.200
But you're deceived because I would never make a joke like that.

54:40.200 --> 54:41.200
My mistake.

54:41.200 --> 54:42.200
I stand corrected.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.200
You know what?

54:43.200 --> 54:44.200
It's okay.

54:44.200 --> 54:46.200
We're going to get through this.

54:46.200 --> 54:47.200
Anyone?

54:47.200 --> 54:48.200
Anyone?

54:48.200 --> 54:49.200
It's 9-Eleven.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.200
9-Eleven.

54:50.200 --> 54:54.200
We have some sociolinguistic people here.

54:54.200 --> 54:55.200
I misspoke.

54:55.200 --> 54:58.200
I meant sociolinguistics, which is a whole other branch.

54:58.200 --> 55:00.200
She's sociolinguistics.

55:00.200 --> 55:02.200
You misspoke with psycholinguistics.

55:02.200 --> 55:04.200
Yes, I was thinking of something else.

55:04.200 --> 55:05.200
Sociolinguistics means what?

55:05.200 --> 55:07.200
I don't know what that means.

55:07.200 --> 55:09.200
I know what sociolinguistics means.

55:09.200 --> 55:12.200
It sounds like a form of verbal anthropology.

55:12.200 --> 55:14.200
It is kind of that.

55:14.200 --> 55:16.200
It's the structure of language.

55:16.200 --> 55:19.200
I could be more fascinated with that.

55:19.200 --> 55:22.200
My friendship with Jeff is kind of based on Noam Chomsky

55:22.200 --> 55:25.200
because he was a political dissident and a linguist.

55:25.200 --> 55:30.200
When I met Jeff, it was the 90s and we were both a couple of young,

55:30.200 --> 55:32.200
full of piss and vinegar.

55:32.200 --> 55:35.200
I only knew Noam Chomsky because of his linguistic work.

55:35.200 --> 55:39.200
Jeff had read all this crazy political shit that he had written.

55:39.200 --> 55:42.200
I didn't even know about his political outspokenness.

55:42.200 --> 55:46.200
I'm a verbal thinker.

55:46.200 --> 55:48.200
I'm very fascinated with language.

55:48.200 --> 55:51.200
It's something that she got from high school.

55:51.200 --> 55:53.200
She became interested in it.

55:53.200 --> 55:57.200
Her senior year in high school, half of her day was spent in high school.

55:57.200 --> 56:01.200
Half of it was at LACC studying sociolinguistics.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.200
LACC? What college?

56:03.200 --> 56:05.200
That's L.A. Community College.

56:05.200 --> 56:06.200
In Hollywood?

56:06.200 --> 56:08.200
Was she in a dorm?

56:08.200 --> 56:10.200
No. Nobody's in a dorm.

56:10.200 --> 56:15.200
I saw that movie with Seth Rogen.

56:15.200 --> 56:18.200
The crazy dorm movie.

56:18.200 --> 56:20.200
Anyone? Am I the only one?

56:20.200 --> 56:22.200
Am I the only human being in the world?

56:22.200 --> 56:24.200
It's ever seen.

56:24.200 --> 56:26.200
I'm sorry.

56:26.200 --> 56:29.200
Some things that fascinated me about linguistics in no necessary order.

56:29.200 --> 56:31.200
I'm just going to shotgun them all.

56:31.200 --> 56:34.200
Breathe deeply and you'll come out of this in no time.

56:34.200 --> 56:36.200
Help me. Help.

56:36.200 --> 56:40.200
Number one is that when people have kids, they always tell you at two years old,

56:40.200 --> 56:43.200
the kid just starts fucking talking.

56:43.200 --> 56:48.200
And we all have this instinctive baby talk thing that we do,

56:48.200 --> 56:52.200
which is another thing that's fascinating because people write different books and go,

56:52.200 --> 56:54.200
don't baby talk, do baby talk.

56:54.200 --> 56:56.200
It's fucking instinctive.

56:56.200 --> 56:58.200
You do it to dogs.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.200
When you look at something cute, you kind of like,

57:00.200 --> 57:02.200
oh, you, who is that?

57:02.200 --> 57:06.200
And what you're doing is I think you're making, you're showing it, you're trying.

57:06.200 --> 57:08.200
Except I never did that with her.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.200
I never did that with her.

57:09.200 --> 57:11.200
Well, now she's in London.

57:11.200 --> 57:13.200
I mean, now I definitely wouldn't do it with her,

57:13.200 --> 57:15.200
but I didn't do it with her when she was...

57:15.200 --> 57:19.200
Get her on the phone and let's have him do it to her tonight on the show.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.200
For the first time ever.

57:20.200 --> 57:23.200
You raised your daughter so coldly she had to move to England just to fit in.

57:23.200 --> 57:25.200
That's right. Exactly.

57:25.200 --> 57:27.200
That's exactly right.

57:27.200 --> 57:29.200
You have to baby talk him.

57:29.200 --> 57:31.200
I didn't. I made that mistake.

57:31.200 --> 57:33.200
But it actually turned out okay.

57:33.200 --> 57:36.200
Because then suddenly she didn't talk for a long time.

57:36.200 --> 57:38.200
And then suddenly she just started talking like...

57:38.200 --> 57:40.200
They just one day they just...

57:40.200 --> 57:43.200
Every parent I've ever talked to says like, look, you do what you do.

57:43.200 --> 57:45.200
You hope your kid will talk.

57:45.200 --> 57:47.200
That's exactly right.

57:47.200 --> 57:51.200
And then one day you come home and you just hear a voice from the corner of the room

57:51.200 --> 57:53.200
go like, you want fries with that?

57:53.200 --> 57:54.200
Yeah, exactly.

57:54.200 --> 57:55.200
What the fuck?

57:55.200 --> 57:57.200
Shit in the hell?

57:57.200 --> 57:58.200
That's exactly right.

57:58.200 --> 57:59.200
My niece lives...

57:59.200 --> 58:01.200
My brother and his wife live nearby.

58:01.200 --> 58:02.200
They live in Eagle Rock.

58:02.200 --> 58:04.200
Or the time was Glendale.

58:04.200 --> 58:06.200
And my niece didn't talk.

58:06.200 --> 58:07.200
And then one day...

58:07.200 --> 58:09.200
I didn't go to their house for a couple months.

58:09.200 --> 58:12.200
I went to the house and my niece is like...

58:12.200 --> 58:13.200
She's got out of the bath.

58:13.200 --> 58:14.200
And she was going...

58:14.200 --> 58:15.200
Shake, shake, shake.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.200
Shake, shake, shake.

58:16.200 --> 58:17.200
Shake your booty.

58:17.200 --> 58:18.200
What the fuck?

58:18.200 --> 58:21.200
Like last time I saw you, you didn't say things.

58:21.200 --> 58:22.200
But now you're singing.

58:22.200 --> 58:24.200
The way that they inflect when they're doing their...

58:24.200 --> 58:30.200
At the young age when they start doing their impressions of how they see adult communication.

58:30.200 --> 58:31.200
You punch them in the face.

58:31.200 --> 58:34.200
This six-year-old girl who like leans up in the doorway and goes,

58:34.200 --> 58:36.200
why don't you come up and see me sometime.

58:36.200 --> 58:39.200
They do weird shit.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.200
And you have these like anecdotes of like,

58:41.200 --> 58:44.200
oh god, when you were a kid, you did this thing at the party.

58:44.200 --> 58:45.200
It was so funny.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.200
And it was...

58:46.200 --> 58:52.200
But it's because they're more capable of doing like clearer impressions of adult communication

58:52.200 --> 58:56.200
than we are as adults because we actually learn the meaning of life.

58:56.200 --> 59:00.200
And they're actually just full bore like trying...

59:00.200 --> 59:03.200
They're doing the equivalent of a parrot or...

59:03.200 --> 59:05.200
But beyond a parrot because they're not just making noise.

59:05.200 --> 59:06.200
They're...

59:06.200 --> 59:07.200
They're smarter than parrots.

59:07.200 --> 59:11.200
They're intuiting and also like they're actually communicating more effectively.

59:11.200 --> 59:14.200
And you just get these chills down your spine.

59:14.200 --> 59:19.200
These kids like they roll their eyes at you and they make it very clear they're over you.

59:19.200 --> 59:24.200
And like they intone things just perfectly to...

59:24.200 --> 59:26.200
And you're like, wait, what the fuck are you...

59:26.200 --> 59:27.200
Why are you...

59:27.200 --> 59:31.200
You need to be 32 before you have those feelings about crayons.

59:31.200 --> 59:36.200
What do you mean you've had it up to here with these crayons?

59:36.200 --> 59:40.200
You said it like Willy Loman.

59:40.200 --> 59:43.200
That is so true.

59:43.200 --> 59:44.200
But that's the...

59:44.200 --> 59:45.200
Let me tell you a guess.

59:45.200 --> 59:50.200
The amazing thing to me is that verbal communication for us is biological.

59:50.200 --> 59:53.200
Verbal communication we've all seen now with Jody Foster.

59:53.200 --> 59:56.200
Verbal communication would happen in a vacuum.

59:56.200 --> 59:57.200
That would...

59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.200
If you were raised by wolves as a human being you would teach language to the wolves.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.200
You would start to adopt the wolf language. People speak.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.200
That's what we do.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.200
We speak verbally.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.200
But what we don't do naturally is written language.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.200
Which is what our entire society is based on.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:24.200
Is the secondary unnatural mimetic evolution of language as transcribable thing.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:29.200
We think because when we're kids we're learning to speak and write at the same time.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.200
And we're learning to read.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.200
Which means interacting with written language and making it come out of our mouths.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:43.200
We grow up feeling like verbal language is somehow secondary.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.200
That written language is like this really important thing.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.200
It's sort of like this dumb thing that would go away in one nuclear blast.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:56.200
But verbal language is like here to stay so much so that if you walk 30 yards that way.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.200
People are going goop-a-goop-a-goop-a-goop-a-goop.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.200
And you can't understand what the hell they're saying.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:08.200
Because humans actually just naturally hold our breath and use our forebrain and flex it.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.200
And go like express shit.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.200
And we use it to geolocate and we use it to socially interact.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.200
It lost me man.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.200
I was hanging on for a while.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.200
I'm going to go to London and I'm going to enroll in your daughter's class.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:31.200
I'm telling you that you're the first person I've met who actually sounds like my daughter.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.200
That's like talking to my daughter.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.200
And I don't understand her any more than I do you.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.200
Can you introduce him to your daughter?

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.200
I would love to sit in the room and just watch them.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.200
I would love that.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.200
But you should bring her by.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:49.200
I'll tell you, you're very lucky because I've been here what four times is my fourth time.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.200
I've never mentioned my daughter.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.200
Because if I do, I'll go on.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.200
Well, it's because I'm a bad person.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.200
I don't think I've even asked you if you were married for the first three times.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.200
Until now actually.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:07.200
But also, I grew up in the 80s when it's like, well, what if you were married to a goat?

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.200
What if that was your own business?

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200
That'd be really great.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.200
If he was married to a goat.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.200
I would love that.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.200
I mean, I would respect it and understand it.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.200
What would be so good about it?

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.200
I mean, it would be awesome.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.200
I'd be like, wow, tell me about that.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.200
And also, I'm totally cool with it.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.200
Because I'm a libertarian.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.200
And everybody is...

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.200
The libertarians love...

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.200
They love people that fuck goats.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.200
They love to let it all hang out.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.200
If you're happy, fuck a goat.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.200
Can I charge you to fuck a goat?

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.200
And I wouldn't have judged you for it.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.200
I would have been like, that's cool.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.200
Tell me about it.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.200
That's interesting.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.200
Why weren't you as interested when he was just married to a human woman?

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.200
Because who isn't?

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.200
You go to fucking Subway.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.200
You go to fucking Starbucks.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.200
There's a bunch of married people.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.200
And all the public places in between.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.200
Rouse, Vons.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.200
From Starbucks to Subway.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.200
I'm Justin Reiland, taking you on a tour of America.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.200
BBC Two.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.200
From paper cups with one logo on them

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.200
to paper cups with another logo.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.200
These are the four Micah tables

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.200
from restaurant to restaurant

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.200
of our great world.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.200
Here we found a person that's fucking

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.200
an emu.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.200
Or what was it?

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.200
Goat. Goat. Goat. Goat. Goat.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.200
A goat.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.200
He also happened to star in

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.200
a bunch of famous movies.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.200
Am I...is that...

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.200
Curtis? Yeah.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.200
Yeah, he was in some stuff.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.200
I know, I just didn't know if that was like something that...

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.200
he's sensitive about.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.200
That I was talking about?

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.200
Listen, I'm so scared of everything.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200
I'm scared of it.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.200
I'm scared of offending everyone.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.200
You know what? I've done everything I can

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.200
to make you feel comfortable with me.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.200
There's nothing else I've been getting you.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.200
You have. You have.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.200
Curtis, are you in therapy?

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200
No, not anymore. I was.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200
Have you ever taken it?

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200
Oh yeah.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200
Oh God.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.200
Did it help you learn how to interact with people?

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.200
I noticed on this show, you're very, very gracious.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.200
Maybe you were born that way, but...

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.200
No, I was born that way.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.200
It didn't really help me learn to communicate with people.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.200
It just allowed me to express myself

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.200
in a way that...

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.200
Do you want some vodka?

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.200
I would like some, thank you, since you're up.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.200
You seem very able to diffuse, like,

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.200
even the most fundamentally...

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.200
You're a sensitive person.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.200
You have a good antenna,

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.200
and you're very aware of other people's state.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.200
You sense the other very well.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.200
Well, thank you. Thank you.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.200
I try.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.200
But that's probably...

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.200
Thank you so much.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.200
That's perfect.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.200
When you were a young boy, or a younger man,

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.200
did that sensitivity get you in trouble?

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.200
Was it hard on you?

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.200
To be sensitive?

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.200
Yeah, because I feel like...

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.200
Absolutely, because it was, you know,

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.200
obviously being sensitive is a sign of weakness.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.200
The drama of the gifted child.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.200
Yeah, I wasn't a gifted child.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.200
Sure you were.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200
I was sensitive, but I wasn't gifted.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200
Of course you were a gifted child.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200
Well, don't be a fucking idiot.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.200
Okay.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.200
Of course you were a gifted child.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.200
You're right, I'm sorry.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.200
You may not...

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.200
You didn't know it.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.200
Of course you're gifted.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.200
You're an exceptional person.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.200
You grew into a person who...

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.200
Oh, easy on him.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.200
Who's possessive of an ability that not everybody has.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.200
He's like everyone in Hollywood.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200
He had talent.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.200
He was in the right place at the right time.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.200
And, you know, he had what the fucking movie people

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.200
needed him to have.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.200
There was a book I read in the 90s which is probably longer.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.200
That's as good a description as any I've ever heard.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200
Not very eloquent, but...

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200
When he was taking time out of that rampant goat fucking,

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.200
he was like...

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.200
When I could do that.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.200
Probably everybody in this audience would qualify as gifted

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.200
at a certain level, like what we've learned in the 2000s

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.200
is that everybody's gifted in some way or another.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.200
But in the 90s I read this book that was written by a therapist

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.200
who had realized that all therapists were fucked up

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.200
and that there needed to be a book telling therapists,

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.200
like, look, you're fucked up.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.200
That's why you're a therapist.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.200
Like, get you like a tone with that shit before you go

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.200
to help people.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.200
It was called the drama of the gifted child.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.200
And it was about...

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.200
But gifted, you could swap out like intuitive.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.200
Like empathic.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.200
Like being a kid and before you have the word power

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.200
to express it, understanding that mom's mad about this,

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:33.200
dad's jealous of that, and this person feels left out,

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.200
and this party is a wreck and like you're six years old

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.200
and you get these thoughts racing around in your head

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.200
because you're gifted.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.200
You're picking up on things.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.200
And then you're going to grow up to be a journalist,

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.200
a therapist, an actor, a director, a painter.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.200
I just have to tell you one thing.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:55.200
What's amazing was before I decided I wanted to be an actor,

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.200
I only wanted to be one other thing,

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.200
and that was a journalist.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.200
When I was like nine, I decided I wanted to be a journalist

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.200
and I was going to be a journalist until I became an actor.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.200
Is it because you saw the people on TV that were journalists?

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.200
Yeah, I think so. Me too.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200
Me too.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.200
It was like My Girl Friday and movies like that.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.200
I was like, I was watching Jack Clugman on The Odd Couple

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.200
and I was like, oh, I want to do that.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.200
You can get paid to not shower.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.200
Yeah, absolutely.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.200
Absolutely.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.200
And like Lou Grant and like the archetype of like the guy

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.200
was like the five o'clock shadow.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.200
Yeah.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.200
And like no shower and like he's typing, typing, typing,

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.200
and then like some fucking senator's going to pay.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.200
Yeah.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.200
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.200
Can I ask you this?

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.200
I'm going to make him pay with my fingers.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.200
The best was The Night Stalker.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.200
Yeah.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.200
By then I was already an actor.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.200
But I said, but The Night Stalker was perfect

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.200
because not only was he cool and wore a seersucker suit

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.200
and a pork pie hat and smoked cigars and was a journalist,

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:50.200
but he dealt with vampires and werewolves and shit like that.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.200
Was Night Stalker your first movie?

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.200
Was Night Stalker your first movie?

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200
I'm an actor.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.200
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.200
I'm sorry. Listen, I just want to know how old were you when you,

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.200
you know, you said you wanted to be an actor?

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.200
Yes.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.200
I was in, it was like...

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200
And what was your first...

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.200
I was in...

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.200
Give me a year and what was your first movie?

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200
Fuck!

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.200
Give me a year and what was your first movie?

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.200
I'm not prepared.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.200
I keep forgetting.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.200
I get sprung these questions without preparation.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.200
We're all wasting everyone's time.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200
I know.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.200
I'm aware of that.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.200
They're all staring at me, waiting for a date.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.200
So my, I decided...

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.200
1969.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.200
Really?

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.200
Yeah.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.200
He was, he was Barbarella.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.200
Yeah.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.200
1969.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.200
Are you serious?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.200
No.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.200
Did you know...

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.200
Chris...

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.200
No.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.200
He used to be Jane Fonda when he first started.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.200
I know who he is.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.200
Okay, well you, okay.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.200
So you know...

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.200
No, I'm just saying like he wanted to be a journalist and then he was like,

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.200
you know...

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.200
I wanted to be an actor.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.200
I wanted to be a journalist when I was eight.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.200
I feel like Justin is...

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.200
So when you were trying to make Kurt is crazy.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.200
I think he's trying to undo early therapy.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.200
Nice.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.200
I want to know about Chris.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.200
What year was he eight years old?

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.200
Okay, eight years old.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.200
You were...

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.200
I was bad at math, but I was born in 53.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.200
It was the year 1953.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.200
Curtis.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.200
That was one.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.200
Was eight years...

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.200
Oh, you were one.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.200
I was one in 53.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.200
The year was 1953.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.200
Eight years later.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.200
Curtis was one years old.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.200
Curtis, I'm sorry.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:16.200
He had admirations and dreams to be a journalist.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.200
I mean...

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.200
But maybe if things didn't work out, he'd do a movie.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.200
Maybe.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.200
We don't know.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.200
He wants to be a journalist.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.200
Curtis.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.200
Justin needed the amount of information to do this.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.200
What year?

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.200
I need to know.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.200
The year was any number, I could say.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.200
I might need...

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.200
I am what...

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200
Curtis wanted to be an actor.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.200
You could have done that with any information.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.200
I want a little more information, please.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.200
Thank you.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.200
Curtis.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.200
Hi.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.200
Okay.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.200
What was your first movie?

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.200
Risky Business.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200
With Tom Cruise?

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200
Yes, but that was like...

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.200
What year did that movie come out?

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.200
83.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200
1983.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200
1983.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.200
Business with Robert Mitchell.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200
Here we are.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.200
Both.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.200
I'm on top of the world.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.200
Curtis.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.200
In Risky Business.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.200
What?

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.200
Rubbing elbows with Tom Cruise.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.200
Dancing.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.200
Prancing.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.200
And living the life.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.200
I'm Curtis.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200
It's 19...

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.200
Is this you trying to be a journalist?

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.200
I'm doing a little bit of Robert Lee's...

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.200
Isn't it a newsreel?

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.200
What is that?

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.200
A little bit of like, you know, fact...

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.200
It's Edward R. Murrow you're doing.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.200
Here's Mutton, you're right, Hitler.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.200
I just want to know, man, who's there?

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.200
I want to walk through the...

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.200
So you did Risky Business.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.200
He did fucking Risky...

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.200
Yeah, he was in Risky Business.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:34.200
This is old news.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.200
Yeah, yeah, we've been over this.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.200
He's an old friend of the show.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.200
Don't worry about it.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.200
I've been here before.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.200
Amazing.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.200
I can't believe this is only your fourth show because you feel like a seasoned friend of the family here.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.200
You've been here a million times.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.200
I love it.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.200
He's our long lost brother.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.200
I've been here before.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.200
So how many steps to...

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.200
I'm so happy.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.200
12.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.200
There's a movie.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.200
I love coming here.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.200
I love having you.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.200
You know, what's it called?

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.200
Like three.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.200
It all happened.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.200
There was a big explosion.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.200
He was in Risky Business for a second.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.200
Risky Business, Revenge of the Nerds.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.200
Oh, so literally, Risky Business straight to Revenge of the Nerds.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.200
Right.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.200
Which is fucking amazing.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.200
And then...

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200
And then...

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.200
Well, then...

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.200
Well, that's my opinion.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.200
Then...

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.200
If you disagree...

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.200
No, it's all right.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200
I don't have an opinion.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.200
Then Better Off Dead.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.200
This show brought to you by IMDb.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.200
Okay, fine.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.200
I'm sorry.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.200
I'm sorry.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.200
And four episodes ago.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.200
Four episodes ago.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.200
I'm sorry.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200
I'm gonna stop.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.200
I'm gonna stop.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.200
You did the actor studio thing with him.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.200
All right.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.200
The...

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.200
Let's bring out Spencer.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.200
Because I feel like...

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.200
Spencer!

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.200
Hey, guys.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.200
Oh, man.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:47.800
How's everybody loving Justin, man?

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.200
I am digging this.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.000
What are your thoughts about Justin?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I love it.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.800
I'm just glad he feels comfortable or he appears to feel comfortable.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.000
I ate somebody's weed chocolate and it's starting to hit me.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Yeah.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I'm not.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I'm not.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I'm so glad there's actually a reason.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I'm not.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I'm not.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I'm not kidding right now.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.500
No, I did give you a big chocolate bar.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.500
You didn't eat the whole thing.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.000
No, I ate like a quarter of it.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
But that's a lot.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I bet it hasn't.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I think you're supposed to do that.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
And it's hitting me right now, but I'm hanging in there.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
You're lying.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I don't believe it.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I know.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I know.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I know.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
You've never seen him.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
No, I do.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I know.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.080
I watch this guy when I was a baby.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080
Not to make you feel old.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.080
Not at all.

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.080
Not at all.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.080
But it's true.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.080
I'm just trying to make sure you're okay.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.080
Can I tell you a fun story?

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.000
You guys want to hear a really seriously fucked up story?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Yeah.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Mike, if it's okay with you.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Okay.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Buckle your fun belts, everybody.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:58.000
All right, so my cousin, really hot like fucking, by the way, I was, I was like, I was like

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
six years old.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I was six years old.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Make a story interesting in four words.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I'm just trying to be honest.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:08.280
so my response that's that's a lot older than I came out many years earlier but

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:15.120
I'm just wondering what so what I said obviously was yeah let's go see fucking

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.720
revenge of the nerds too I just got raped and then but I didn't say that I

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.720
didn't say that but I did think to myself when we're what and my dad was like

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.760
no we're not gonna watch revenge of the nerds to you raped no he didn't know

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.960
okay he didn't know you know you know but I was like wow man this is gonna be

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:40.320
awesome by the way seriously wait can I just say you realize your story is the

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:48.360
definition of front-loaded you can't all true unless there's a treasure ship

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:53.400
involved everything I said was true up until the very end of it and then I

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:59.880
started to you know your story begins with your cousin raping you and goes into

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:05.600
like a diary entry about seeing a movie and popcorn was like five dollars all

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:11.480
true it was all true it was all true up until the very end of course it's true

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.240
it's boring I don't like what do you mean she's not man go back to the first

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:21.680
part or like that that's what's all true right the first ball the best part is

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.120
true right and then like when it got boring was when I was like I need a

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:35.600
punchline to this story we really put myself out there what my mom's knees

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:41.880
raped me when I was six what I need a punchline but you don't need a punchline

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:45.440
you can just we went to go see revenge of the nerds too so that's why it ties

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:53.320
into Curtis here wow it was so great I love that movie part two was so good

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.960

Deadline recently that there's too much diversity we're living in the world of

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:54.720
diversity overload was that that that was the one about Empire yes there's an

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:59.800
article and in Deadline that said like the people love black people on the

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:04.920
television but is it too much of a good thing

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:14.480
like wow look at me man seriously my favorite thing in the world is always

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:20.400
really yeah the as as a fat white old straight man my I have always loved in

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.200
comic sections the culture of like any degree of like forward movement being

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:29.200
met with like the slippery slope argument like what's next I don't like

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:56.440
diabolical I think the most ironic thing you could you know I was fucking like the

01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:00.360
most ironic thing I want to do but holes blow people's mind by putting in like

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.720
an amazing performance as this female character who's like our Dan what if I

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:10.280

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.200
creative than that we've done the we've done the thing where people play a

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.120
character and then they they spend their their whole episode like cutting things

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:43.160
me some sort of advantage amongst all of you guys against each other but if you

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:48.960

weapons oh just yep yeah we got to make sure the burger of your information is

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:05.960
edible so as a distraction might I suggest that I do a bit of a performance

01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:10.400
ordering a burger for him so that he feels that there's some enticement

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:16.680
yeah where do you order a burger from though because you're in gasworks park

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:25.120
right now I'm using mind link all right look can I ask a question Arturo yeah

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.640

gonna we're gonna leave you in our care we're gonna go try to get jellyfish to

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:42.040
the extent that we have difficulty doing so you will die so now you're on our

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.960
team so you tell us everything we need to know to make it a quick mission and

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.960

talking about me right now no is that my schizophrenia I'm sorry is that my

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:49.440
schizophrenia you guys talking about I have to ask is it my schizophrenia it

01:36:49.440 --> 01:37:00.960
is no one's ever asked that it's not it's your sanity rest assured my doctors

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.160
about to get rich I say that we that we tie a script we tie him up and gag him

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:08.320
but we keep him in the van with us in case we need him as collateral in some

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:12.520
way listen I won't hurt anyone here I know the voices are totally you're not

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:20.240
the one you're talking about they're trolling me all right all right so we're

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:27.120
back at the burger joint we got we got Spaguli tied up in the van we're gonna

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.200
what do you do he was just he was sharing something it wasn't it wasn't

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:35.000
about the game that's not for you guys it was something else like that's like I've

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.960
been really honest and open with this crowd but like I went I went like three

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:48.080
layers above that for Curtis just now yeah she wasn't that hot that's very

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:54.080
superficial that's very superficial this had to do with tinfoil hats and like

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.640
alien people and all that kind of shit like reptile fucking people on the news

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:05.360
you know so what Dan said I said is really offensive I was talking about

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:11.280
reptile eyes like reptile eyes and you know all right sorry I'm so sorry hey

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.240
guys I have I have a spell of improved invisibility I can make myself

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:18.800
completely invisible to people and to detectors you can give me the key I'll

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.720
go in there bang bang boom but then how do we get him out of there without being

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.640
seen on the way out who's saying this this is me I'm not a rare joke from

01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:40.400
horticulture by the way I like you're seeing this he's like Borat yeah we're

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:44.720
all together right I'm sure we're behind the back door of burgers I did we're

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:48.160
like we're trying to form a game plan yes I think that's great you're enhanced

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.640
invisibility okay but once I get him once I'm in there and I got to get him out

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:56.160
through the thing like how do I get him out without the turrets going off on the

01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.480
whole I feel like we need to go in the front like okay so magic people weren't

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.480
getting stopped at the front right so actually people with magic abilities

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:10.080
should go in the front take out these motherfuckers people who have hardware

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:13.960
should go in the back because every time someone with guns goes on the front

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:22.720
I have hardware yes doctor I want to do the best doctor and Eve and and horticulture

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.240
should go in the front like like like take them out with like spells and

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:33.720
telekinesis I I'll go in the back with with but I also have I have a maximum

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:38.760
capabilities with with I didn't mean to offend you I'm just saying like I'm

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:42.960
saying like listen it's gonna require anyone of us to do this anyone that has

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.160
the ability to like hurt someone with their mind I'll walk in and I'll go in

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:50.680
there and just stun bolt or stun ball the entire room and just knock everybody

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.000
out and I'll come in the back and I mean it's a restaurant like how I'll be right

01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.920
there okay I want doctor friend and someone else with me in the front so in

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.400
case my spell doesn't work that would I'm not I have smoke bombs I have smoke

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:09.560
bombs so I'm gonna come in behind you and I'll throw the smoke bomb if we need

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.360
to okay let me be third so that I can close this to the vehicle because I can

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:18.360
keep it running and then jump in it okay good so you're so so horticurs gonna be

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.400
out back with the vehicle ready to rock right he's our eyes and ears on the

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:25.320
inside in case we need it we're down to the last couple of minutes we have to

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.680
do this now okay now we started late fuck this okay we're going until we're done

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.800

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:38.080
this world oh in this world yeah either based on I'll tell you what I'm afraid of

and look for and I say hey I walk up to the counter and I know I want to have

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.040
everybody where I can see how big is the room by the way it's a you know like

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.720
McDonald's size okay cool so my thumb ball should be enough to hit the whole

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.520
thing probably not the whole room no you can probably hit about half of it all

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:13.360
right so I walk in the front door and I look around and then what do I see you

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.040
see right up at the front is the security guard he's wearing an armor plate

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.120
and you also see about three customers just kind of spread around tables and

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:26.040
then there's two fry cooks kind of milling about the auto fooders all

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:29.400
right I put my hand on them and I have shot gloves and I just try to stand them

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:36.400
and knock them out who the security guard at the door all right stay in the

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:43.320
pocket son yeah be ready to go doctor I'm ready because because we're shadow

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:51.080
running it's not called shadow picnic you you grab the guy right on this body

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:56.680
part and he starts to convulse wildly with electrical energy he's he's shaking

01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:00.600
around you should talk into the microphone so we get all here he's

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:03.880
conspiring sorry I'm sorry I'm just saying now we know shit's going down

my comrades okay yeah he doesn't go down though he's not unconscious he's just

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:20.080
okay then I then I finished the job I had continue continue it really is

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:25.360
literally what he would say it was actually just pulling an audible I push

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:28.600
him Spencer towards everyone else that looks like a threat would they all be

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:32.600
in one area enough for my stun ball to affect it wait what do you do I want to

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.480
push this guy because he's not knocked out I want to just kind of use him while

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:39.240
he stunned and push him in toward the crowd and then stun ball the whole the

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:44.360
whole room sure objection objection you can push him can my character step in

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:48.880

in there into the room and cast a force 5 stun ball on the whole ball of wax all

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.400
right well before you can do that you start pushing them and then two of the

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:19.040
fry cooks draw guns on you perhaps more emphatically than that gunfire cuts through

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:24.480
the the burger tyrant but obscured by the smoke you managed to dodge all hits I

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.480
use my nimble cart like a gymnastic ability cartwheel away from all that

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:35.960
stuff and then where they were force 5 stun ball how do you go racist but

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:45.240
effective all right it hits all of them yeah they don't they don't get

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:50.200
unconscious they punched as if in the face and they stumble back several steps

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:57.560
