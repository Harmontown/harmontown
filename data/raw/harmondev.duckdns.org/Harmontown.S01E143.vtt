{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Convicts, and NerdMeltfeeder, Harmontown, now in session.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:32.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, the eponymous Dan Harmon.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:41.000\nDoritos! Doritos! It's a crunchy, salty, cheesy snack.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:44.000\nYou've just taken to bringing your Doritos half eaten on stage with you now.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:50.000\nWe've got financial troubles, Jeff. We need to start advertising or else.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:59.000\nWe are in more dire straits than a person that doesn't drive a Honda.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:04.000\nDo you want to do your Doritos jingle now or do you want to save it for later?\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:07.000\nLet's do it now. Let's get it out of the way.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:18.000\nI know Doritos, I don't mean get it out of the way. It's bad to advertise. Let's give people the opportunity to learn about Doritos at the top of the show.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:23.000\nDan, when I think about getting Doritos out of the way, I think I'm getting them off the table and into my mouth.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:27.000\nRight. And that's the name of this song, Into My Mouth.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:30.000\nDan Harmon Doritos ad. Take one.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:41.000\nInto My Mouth. Into My Mouth.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:48.000\nYou got a corn chip and something towards how to go into my mouth.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nLittle triangles of joy. Juicy triangles of joy.\n\n01:53.000 --> 02:04.000\nWhat I call them, juicy. They're never juicy. Doritos in my mouth.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:08.000\nAnd fuck the queen. Fuck the queen.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:12.000\nJust in keeping with genre, Doritos is not of any opinion about the monarchy.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:15.000\nBut in staying in genre, fuck the queen.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:17.000\nDoritos in your mouth.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:20.000\nI guess, speaking of getting out of the way, we should just do our Honda ad. You mentioned Honda.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:24.000\nWe should just do Honda.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:33.000\nThe power of dreams. The power of dreams.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nYou know what I mean when you drive a machine that gets you in your heart.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:45.000\nHonda is a machine that you have been taught.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:52.000\nOr at least within the margins of insurance.\n\n02:52.000 --> 03:01.000\nSo thank you to those guys. You know make sure you tweet them and let them know.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:11.240\nBut in the margins of insurance.\n\n03:11.240 --> 03:15.080\nSo thank you to those guys, you know, make sure you tweet them and let them know.\n\n03:15.080 --> 03:19.320\nBut I love Harmontown and I love your thing because as you know, as fans of something,\n\n03:19.320 --> 03:25.720\nyour job is to keep us alive, otherwise you failed.\n\n03:25.720 --> 03:31.560\nHow do we justify these incredibly lucrative sponsors like Doritos and Honda and still\n\n03:31.560 --> 03:33.680\nbe charging people for our new subscriptions?\n\n03:33.680 --> 03:35.040\nHow does that work?\n\n03:35.040 --> 03:40.320\nYou get, everyone's getting Doritos that subscribes.\n\n03:40.320 --> 03:43.760\nYou get Doritos.\n\n03:43.760 --> 03:47.560\nThere's a person, if you're a student, there's a person coming to your school and he's like\n\n03:47.560 --> 03:53.360\na clown but he's got orange triangles.\n\n03:53.360 --> 03:57.440\nHe's being workshopped right now, he doesn't have a name yet, he's the untitled Doritos\n\n03:57.440 --> 03:58.440\nspokesmodel.\n\n03:58.440 --> 04:01.800\nI think the working title is Juicy, the Doritos Clown.\n\n04:01.800 --> 04:05.760\nThey're working on stuff based on just like people's feelings about things, like right\n\n04:05.760 --> 04:11.240\nnow they're thinking of calling him just like outrage, just based on his name is Outrage,\n\n04:11.240 --> 04:17.200\nthe Doritos Happy Person, and he's going to come to your school and he's going to give\n\n04:17.200 --> 04:19.800\nyou shit if you're a student.\n\n04:19.800 --> 04:21.880\nHe's going to give you shit, like get on your case or something?\n\n04:21.880 --> 04:22.880\nHe's going to get on your case.\n\n04:22.880 --> 04:26.240\nHe's going to be like, do your homework, bitch!\n\n04:26.240 --> 04:30.360\nAnd then he'll apologize because that's his gimmick.\n\n04:30.360 --> 04:36.080\nRonald McDonald did magic tricks, outraged the happy triangle.\n\n04:36.080 --> 04:37.080\nHe apologized.\n\n04:37.080 --> 04:39.480\nOutraged the happy triangle?\n\n04:39.480 --> 04:43.320\nHe apologizes for everything.\n\n04:43.320 --> 04:45.360\nI like outrage the happy triangle a lot.\n\n04:45.360 --> 04:51.560\nAll right, so you probably have noticed already that I'm on painkillers and that I combined\n\n04:51.560 --> 04:55.280\nit with drinking and that I've been signing stuff for the Rick and Morty signing.\n\n04:55.280 --> 04:57.000\nDeanna, are you drunk during a show?\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nYeah, sorry, Jeff.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.240\nJeff's got high standards for this stuff.\n\n05:00.240 --> 05:02.480\nI would like to apologize.\n\n05:02.480 --> 05:06.120\nI was rotten as a fucking chop last week.\n\n05:06.120 --> 05:10.920\nIt was what my therapist calls informed consent, that's the phrase she always uses, informed\n\n05:10.920 --> 05:11.920\nconsent.\n\n05:11.920 --> 05:12.920\nWe knew you were going to be drunk.\n\n05:12.920 --> 05:13.920\nI warned you.\n\n05:13.920 --> 05:14.920\nI warned you three days in advance.\n\n05:14.920 --> 05:16.440\nLike, should we do a show on his show?\n\n05:16.440 --> 05:19.680\nYeah, I didn't say don't come to the show if you're drunk.\n\n05:19.680 --> 05:22.680\nIf I had my wits about me, I would have called in sick because I was worthless.\n\n05:22.680 --> 05:28.680\nI really owe you all an apology or thank you because I was, oh, you're welcome.\n\n05:28.680 --> 05:29.680\nYeah.\n\n05:29.680 --> 05:32.760\nWhatever you want, you got it from everybody.\n\n05:32.760 --> 05:35.760\nI remember licking a lot of balls and shadow running on that.\n\n05:35.760 --> 05:37.880\nIt felt like maybe a...\n\n05:37.880 --> 05:40.520\nThe thing is, sadly, I wasn't in a blackout.\n\n05:40.520 --> 05:45.320\nI remember every bit of that show and that's what really breaks my heart.\n\n05:45.320 --> 05:47.120\nI'm on painkillers because I had a biopsy.\n\n05:47.120 --> 05:48.760\nDeanna, I was talking about...\n\n05:48.760 --> 05:50.360\nI was talking about myself.\n\n05:50.360 --> 05:51.840\nSorry, Graeme.\n\n05:51.840 --> 05:52.840\nI have...\n\n05:52.840 --> 05:53.840\nI have...\n\n05:53.840 --> 05:58.960\nFor those who would listen for free to the show, I just revealed a stab wound inflicted\n\n05:58.960 --> 06:07.400\non me by government-funded assassins called doctors who examined me for that sound I\n\n06:07.400 --> 06:09.400\nmake when I laugh.\n\n06:09.400 --> 06:10.400\nWait.\n\n06:10.400 --> 06:11.400\nWait.\n\n06:11.400 --> 06:12.400\nI'll cure it.\n\n06:12.400 --> 06:13.400\nWait.\n\n06:13.400 --> 06:14.400\nOkay.\n\n06:14.400 --> 06:22.720\nThere it is.\n\n06:22.720 --> 06:23.720\nIt's like a bicycle spoke.\n\n06:23.720 --> 06:28.040\nI'm pretty sure if any of us tried it that hard three times, we'd make the same sound.\n\n06:28.040 --> 06:30.400\nLet's all try it at once.\n\n06:30.400 --> 06:32.120\nOne, two, three.\n\n06:32.120 --> 06:33.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n06:33.360 --> 06:35.640\nThere's a couple.\n\n06:35.640 --> 06:40.240\nI went in for that sound and then that sound, they said, like, well, let's take some x-rays\n\n06:40.240 --> 06:43.440\nand then they're like, well, your lymph nodes are enlarged so we should check out your lymph\n\n06:43.440 --> 06:44.960\nnodes and large blah blah blah.\n\n06:44.960 --> 06:45.960\nWe're gonna do this test.\n\n06:45.960 --> 06:46.960\nYou should meet the specialist.\n\n06:46.960 --> 06:48.360\nWell, the specialist says you should do this test.\n\n06:48.360 --> 06:51.000\nWell, this test indicates to the specialist that you should see a specialist specialist\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nand you should go to this guy.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:53.000\nLet's go to that.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.160\nAnd so like a million dollars later, I'm sure.\n\n06:56.160 --> 07:01.320\nLike they're just like, oh, we're gonna need to go inside to your chest and like pull out\n\n07:01.320 --> 07:04.000\nsome stuff from your lungs and we're gonna do a biopsy.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nAnd I was like, well, what's wrong?\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.520\nAnd he's like, well, you put it off so much that if it was cancer, you'd be dead by now.\n\n07:08.520 --> 07:09.520\nSo that's...\n\n07:09.520 --> 07:10.520\nYou're fine.\n\n07:10.520 --> 07:15.840\nAnd I was like, okay, good to know that, yes, okay, good.\n\n07:15.840 --> 07:16.840\nAnd also like...\n\n07:16.840 --> 07:20.000\nAnd I was like, and then we'll find out why I make the sound when I laugh and the doctor\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nwas like, what?\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nNo, no.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nNo, that sound you just make now.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:29.320\nIt was like a Louis CK bit, like he's just like, no, you just shitty.\n\n07:29.320 --> 07:31.680\nYou just make that sound now.\n\n07:31.680 --> 07:32.680\nThat's never...\n\n07:32.680 --> 07:34.040\nThat's not a disease.\n\n07:34.040 --> 07:36.160\nThat's not inhibiting your ability to live.\n\n07:36.160 --> 07:38.080\nWe don't care about that sound you make.\n\n07:38.080 --> 07:39.720\nWhat are you doing?\n\n07:39.720 --> 07:46.760\nWhy are you cutting me open to get cells, to verify that you don't have something?\n\n07:46.760 --> 07:48.560\nThey're just spending money.\n\n07:48.560 --> 07:50.200\nAre you just giving each other money?\n\n07:50.200 --> 07:51.800\nDid they give you the all clear?\n\n07:51.800 --> 07:52.800\nNo.\n\n07:52.800 --> 07:53.800\nThey're never gonna...\n\n07:53.800 --> 07:54.800\nThey're just...\n\n07:54.800 --> 08:00.240\nWe're all just this nation of people who are just like, we're like cattle that are also\n\n08:00.240 --> 08:03.240\nwearing farmer hats.\n\n08:03.240 --> 08:06.360\nLike we're a farm of farmers.\n\n08:06.360 --> 08:09.240\nWe're a farmer farm.\n\n08:09.240 --> 08:15.240\nGet that in your paperback, Orwell.\n\n08:15.240 --> 08:16.360\nFuck animal farm.\n\n08:16.360 --> 08:20.040\nWhat about farmer farm?\n\n08:20.040 --> 08:26.440\nBlown mind, for rent.\n\n08:26.440 --> 08:29.120\nThey gave me pain killers because it hurts because they stabbed me in the throat while\n\n08:29.120 --> 08:30.120\nI was sleeping.\n\n08:30.120 --> 08:31.120\nShow them the wound.\n\n08:31.120 --> 08:32.120\nShow them the thing.\n\n08:32.120 --> 08:33.120\nFind the camera.\n\n08:33.120 --> 08:34.120\nFind the camera.\n\n08:34.120 --> 08:35.120\nIt's fine.\n\n08:35.120 --> 08:36.120\nI'm not complaining.\n\n08:36.120 --> 08:38.600\nWe have a lot of Harmontown fans who are like, oh, my leg is in where my arm should\n\n08:38.600 --> 08:39.600\nbe.\n\n08:39.600 --> 08:49.680\nWe are a community of misfits, including the medical misfits who walk around like...\n\n08:49.680 --> 08:52.280\nSo how big is the incision in your throat?\n\n08:52.280 --> 08:53.280\nI don't know.\n\n08:53.280 --> 08:55.600\nIt's like the size of a Capri Sun straw.\n\n08:55.600 --> 08:56.600\nThey just...\n\n08:56.600 --> 08:57.600\nI don't know.\n\n08:57.600 --> 08:58.600\nI haven't looked under here.\n\n08:58.600 --> 08:59.600\nIt just hurt.\n\n08:59.600 --> 09:00.600\nI woke up and it was like...\n\n09:00.600 --> 09:02.600\nAnd they put like a little endoscope kind of thing?\n\n09:02.600 --> 09:03.600\nYeah.\n\n09:03.600 --> 09:05.280\nThey put something down there to collect cells out of my lymph nodes.\n\n09:05.280 --> 09:07.080\nAnd it's got little grabby bits on there?\n\n09:07.080 --> 09:08.800\nLook, cell-sized grabby bits.\n\n09:08.800 --> 09:09.800\nYeah.\n\n09:09.800 --> 09:10.800\nIs it scoop?\n\n09:10.800 --> 09:11.800\nYeah.\n\n09:11.800 --> 09:12.800\nI guess.\n\n09:12.800 --> 09:13.800\nBut then you wake up and it's like...\n\n09:13.800 --> 09:17.280\nIf you wake up and it feels like somebody just took a cheese grater to the inside of\n\n09:17.280 --> 09:18.280\nyour...\n\n09:18.280 --> 09:21.800\nLike a cylindrical cheese grater that just went like this.\n\n09:21.800 --> 09:24.920\nAgain, I'm not complaining because, again, like childbirth.\n\n09:24.920 --> 09:28.520\nI mean, it's just not a thing.\n\n09:28.520 --> 09:31.000\nThis was my first surgery.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.240\nIt wasn't even barely a surgery.\n\n09:32.240 --> 09:35.040\nIt was like a fucking scoppy.\n\n09:35.040 --> 09:37.480\nIt was an outpatient thing.\n\n09:37.480 --> 09:38.480\nSo...\n\n09:38.480 --> 09:42.240\nAs George Collins said, your first surgery, they call it a procedure.\n\n09:42.240 --> 09:43.240\nRight.\n\n09:43.240 --> 09:44.240\nYeah.\n\n09:44.240 --> 09:46.120\nThis was like welcome to the club.\n\n09:46.120 --> 09:47.120\nAnd I was like...\n\n09:47.120 --> 09:49.760\nIt was really like...\n\n09:49.760 --> 09:54.600\nI don't want to spend my last...\n\n09:54.600 --> 09:57.520\nI don't want to spend my last moments with these people.\n\n09:57.520 --> 10:02.000\nYou know when you get on an airplane and you're like, oh, God, I know it's not likely to die\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:03.000\nat an airplane.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:07.240\nLike, the terrifying thing is that if you do, you die with these people.\n\n10:07.240 --> 10:08.640\nThese people.\n\n10:08.640 --> 10:09.960\nThese shitty people.\n\n10:09.960 --> 10:11.600\nThese shitty Reese Witherspoons.\n\n10:11.600 --> 10:12.600\nLike, like...\n\n10:12.600 --> 10:15.760\nYou're not going to get at this point in time, could you put your thing on the bugabullo?\n\n10:15.760 --> 10:17.760\nOh, we're dying.\n\n10:17.760 --> 10:18.760\nBye.\n\n10:18.760 --> 10:19.760\nI'm your last person.\n\n10:19.760 --> 10:20.760\nBye.\n\n10:20.760 --> 10:22.760\nI'm the face of God.\n\n10:22.760 --> 10:23.760\nBye.\n\n10:23.760 --> 10:24.760\nBye, bye, bye.\n\n10:24.760 --> 10:25.760\nI must...\n\n10:25.760 --> 10:26.760\nI'm a person in a costume.\n\n10:26.760 --> 10:28.760\nI'm a fucking bureaucratic idiot.\n\n10:28.760 --> 10:30.760\nI'm a parasite.\n\n10:30.760 --> 10:31.760\nBye.\n\n10:31.760 --> 10:36.240\nAt this point in time, at this point in time, we'd like to remind you, we'd like to remind\n\n10:36.240 --> 10:37.240\nyou.\n\n10:37.240 --> 10:40.680\nEverything that an airline tells you, they'd like to remind you.\n\n10:40.680 --> 10:44.560\nWe'd like to remind you is subliminal code for you're a piece of shit.\n\n10:44.560 --> 10:45.800\nYou forgot something.\n\n10:45.800 --> 10:47.400\nI didn't forget shit.\n\n10:47.400 --> 10:52.160\nIt ain't hard to get on a metal tube and get launched into the air and then land.\n\n10:52.160 --> 10:54.160\nI didn't forget anything.\n\n10:54.160 --> 10:55.960\nI'm a fucking genius.\n\n10:55.960 --> 10:59.800\nI'd like to remind you, I'm a fucking human being, not force majeure.\n\n10:59.800 --> 11:04.360\nAt this point in time, I'd like to remind you that we do have a really full flight.\n\n11:04.360 --> 11:08.360\nI don't know how that happened.\n\n11:08.360 --> 11:10.520\nFucking hate airlines.\n\n11:10.520 --> 11:12.520\nThey're a criminal organization.\n\n11:12.520 --> 11:14.840\nIt's a fucking cartel.\n\n11:14.840 --> 11:16.360\nLook up the definition of cartel.\n\n11:16.360 --> 11:17.440\nI've been over this.\n\n11:17.440 --> 11:19.160\nLook it up.\n\n11:19.160 --> 11:23.040\nLook up the word cartel in the dictionary and then look at what airline companies are.\n\n11:23.040 --> 11:26.000\nHave you ever been on a plane when you looked around and the people around you and thought,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.640\nno, this is a good plane to go down.\n\n11:27.640 --> 11:30.600\nNo, because it's always staffed with these people.\n\n11:30.600 --> 11:34.520\nYou've got one guy in the front that's like, I'm this guy at this point in time.\n\n11:34.520 --> 11:37.320\nI'm looking to remind you at this point in time.\n\n11:37.320 --> 11:39.800\nI'm talking about the other passengers, not the staff.\n\n11:39.800 --> 11:40.800\nThe fuck other passengers?\n\n11:40.800 --> 11:41.800\nI mean, they're random.\n\n11:41.800 --> 11:47.600\nWhat do you look over and are like, oh my god, that's Jennifer Jason Lee.\n\n11:47.600 --> 11:53.680\nAnd she's like, hey, let's die.\n\n11:53.680 --> 11:56.680\nI will see you at Jennifer Jason Lee and raise you a George Tikai.\n\n11:56.680 --> 11:57.680\nAs I got on.\n\n11:57.680 --> 12:00.200\nI would love to die with George Tikai.\n\n12:00.200 --> 12:01.200\nIt's pronounced T-K.\n\n12:01.200 --> 12:02.200\nT-K.\n\n12:02.200 --> 12:03.200\nMr. T-K.\n\n12:03.200 --> 12:05.200\nWe had Sulu on our flight and everyone's like, fuck it.\n\n12:05.200 --> 12:07.200\nWe're not dying under any circumstances.\n\n12:07.200 --> 12:08.200\nSulu's got to.\n\n12:08.200 --> 12:11.480\nI would follow George T-K anywhere, including death.\n\n12:11.480 --> 12:15.760\nDid I ever say on the show what he said, what he got on the plane right in front of me?\n\n12:15.760 --> 12:24.280\nHe was checking in to get on board and there was a kind of a very out gay black guy who\n\n12:24.280 --> 12:26.560\nwas the guy that was working the tickets and checking you in.\n\n12:26.560 --> 12:28.560\nHe was like, OK, thank you, Mr. Proups, thank you, Mr. Sonson.\n\n12:28.560 --> 12:31.560\nAnd he goes, oh, Mr. T-K, what a pleasure.\n\n12:31.560 --> 12:34.200\nAnd he goes, oh, thank you.\n\n12:34.200 --> 12:39.080\nAnd the guy said, Mr. T-K, I had the pleasure of seeing you on a episode of Big Bang Theory\n\n12:39.080 --> 12:40.560\nlast night or something like that on some show.\n\n12:40.560 --> 12:47.200\nAnd he goes, oh, that's very good news because I can expect a residual.\n\n12:47.200 --> 12:48.200\nHe's the man.\n\n12:48.200 --> 12:49.200\nHe's great.\n\n12:49.200 --> 12:52.400\nAnd then he got on the plane and he had kind of a cough in his boyfriend or like companion\n\n12:52.400 --> 12:53.400\nor whoever.\n\n12:53.400 --> 12:54.400\nHusband.\n\n12:54.400 --> 12:55.400\nHusband?\n\n12:55.400 --> 12:56.400\nIs that right?\n\n12:56.400 --> 12:57.400\nHe's being attended to.\n\n12:57.400 --> 12:58.400\nAnd it was lovely.\n\n12:58.400 --> 13:00.920\nAnd everyone on the plane was like, this is the best.\n\n13:00.920 --> 13:01.920\nThey're a very cute couple.\n\n13:01.920 --> 13:02.920\nAnd I've said this.\n\n13:02.920 --> 13:03.920\nI've said this on the show.\n\n13:03.920 --> 13:04.920\nI just want to reiterate.\n\n13:04.920 --> 13:06.400\nGeorge K. is an American hero.\n\n13:06.400 --> 13:07.400\nHere's why.\n\n13:07.400 --> 13:10.640\nBetrayed by his country twice, twice in one lifetime.\n\n13:10.640 --> 13:15.480\nLike two times given the excuse to give up on this country because he was born in Japanese\n\n13:15.480 --> 13:18.800\nAmerica and locked up at a camp.\n\n13:18.800 --> 13:21.160\nHe didn't let that make him jaded.\n\n13:21.160 --> 13:25.120\nAnd then during his acting career, he had to be in the closet because you had to be\n\n13:25.120 --> 13:26.480\nin the closet back then.\n\n13:26.480 --> 13:29.760\nYou just had to.\n\n13:29.760 --> 13:33.120\nAnd still, you know, like, and then to have like gay marriage challenge and all that stuff.\n\n13:33.120 --> 13:37.760\nIt's like, he never, he never just went, did the easy thing, which is like fun for all\n\n13:37.760 --> 13:38.760\nof us.\n\n13:38.760 --> 13:39.760\nIt's just be like, fuck society.\n\n13:39.760 --> 13:40.760\nFuck this.\n\n13:40.760 --> 13:45.800\nLike he would like always like meets it with this like ardor and goes like, well, I'd prefer\n\n13:45.800 --> 13:48.640\nif it was something like this and I'm going to, I'm going to read you.\n\n13:48.640 --> 13:51.120\nI'd like you to listen to this letter I'm going to read.\n\n13:51.120 --> 13:54.520\nLike he's, he's a, he's a good, good activist, a good guy.\n\n13:54.520 --> 13:59.040\nLike like you, you, you, I've never been fucked over by society once and I hate it.\n\n13:59.040 --> 14:03.760\nLike I, I don't do, I don't, I've never, I've never had anything but privilege shoved up\n\n14:03.760 --> 14:09.960\nmy ass with a silver turkey baster like, like, and I am sick of everybody and they can go\n\n14:09.960 --> 14:11.960\nfuck themselves.\n\n14:11.960 --> 14:12.960\nMaybe that's the key.\n\n14:12.960 --> 14:17.360\nMaybe you need to have a little bit of, of, of people shitting on you from birth in order\n\n14:17.360 --> 14:23.000\nfor you to realize like how, how lucky you are to be an American and how worth it is.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:27.680\nEven when the dream is kind of sitting over there like a pile of shit, like that, that\n\n14:27.680 --> 14:30.560\nit's still worth something because like the dream exists.\n\n14:30.560 --> 14:34.080\nI think you, you also do have to be sort of a special person to rise up from that.\n\n14:34.080 --> 14:36.280\nAre you calling it retarded?\n\n14:36.280 --> 14:38.280\nIt's fucked up, dude.\n\n14:38.280 --> 14:39.280\nI'm on painkillers.\n\n14:39.280 --> 14:40.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n14:40.280 --> 14:42.200\nWhat, what, what brand of painkiller are you on?\n\n14:42.200 --> 14:43.200\nWhat's, what's, what's.\n\n14:43.200 --> 14:44.200\nRetardinal.\n\n14:44.200 --> 14:45.200\nRetardinal.\n\n14:45.200 --> 14:50.200\nThey rarely give you, they rarely prescribe retardinal.\n\n14:50.200 --> 14:54.640\nI know, they said, they said, you're going to be in stupid pain.\n\n14:54.640 --> 14:59.640\nMy sisters, my sisters retarded, fuck you.\n\n14:59.640 --> 15:07.200\nTry having a retarded sister.\n\n15:07.200 --> 15:08.200\nI love the, the fake high road.\n\n15:08.200 --> 15:12.200\nYou think it was hard to listen to me talk like that?\n\n15:12.200 --> 15:18.000\nTry having a retarded sister.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nWhat are you on exactly?\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.680\nWhat are you called?\n\n15:21.680 --> 15:25.760\nAnd, and I'm almost certain you're not supposed to have Kettle One alongside it.\n\n15:25.760 --> 15:29.080\nI know, I looked it up, it says, it doesn't have a seat of benefit in it, so it's not\n\n15:29.080 --> 15:33.480\nlike bad for your liver to, like, I have been drinking with these painkillers, but I am\n\n15:33.480 --> 15:34.480\nin pain.\n\n15:34.480 --> 15:43.080\nThey did stab me in my sleep for money, like, and then I, so then I wake up in the morning,\n\n15:43.080 --> 15:49.080\nlike, oh boy, it's so complicated.\n\n15:49.080 --> 15:54.080\nAll right, we have some special guests here tonight, but, and special in the, in the aforementioned\n\n15:54.080 --> 15:55.080\nsense.\n\n15:55.080 --> 16:04.400\nOur next guest brought to you by Retardinal.\n\n16:04.400 --> 16:05.400\nWhat was I talking about?\n\n16:05.400 --> 16:10.440\nOh, you want to, it was, it's, it's some pill, like, is it, is it narcole or, or, or, or,\n\n16:10.440 --> 16:11.440\nnarcole, narcole.\n\n16:11.440 --> 16:12.440\nNarcole?\n\n16:12.440 --> 16:17.560\nWhich just seems like a generic, narcole, narcole is like, like, super duper painkiller,\n\n16:17.560 --> 16:18.560\nlike, that's heavy duty.\n\n16:18.560 --> 16:22.320\nBut then there's, on the bottle, it says hydro something, it doesn't matter, it doesn't,\n\n16:22.320 --> 16:23.320\nreally doesn't matter.\n\n16:23.320 --> 16:25.760\nIt feels good, feels great.\n\n16:25.760 --> 16:29.640\nAnd I was in pain, so I took the pill, and then I drank, and so here you have me.\n\n16:29.640 --> 16:32.920\nSo, just deal with it, as Dr. Phil would say.\n\n16:32.920 --> 16:38.360\nAs the great Dr. Phil would say, I just want to talk about a couple things, okay?\n\n16:38.360 --> 16:39.360\nGreat.\n\n16:39.360 --> 16:40.360\nDo you mind?\n\n16:40.360 --> 16:46.000\nOkay, thank you

you'd all be the big, tall lesbian\n\n16:54.800 --> 16:55.800\nlady.\n\n16:55.800 --> 17:01.680\nIn my eyes, my favorite character.\n\n17:01.680 --> 17:02.680\nWhat's her name?\n\n17:02.680 --> 17:04.280\nI can't, I don't know her name, Brie.\n\n17:04.280 --> 17:05.280\nIt's Brie, right?\n\n17:05.280 --> 17:06.280\nYeah.\n\n17:06.280 --> 17:07.280\nBrie.\n\n17:07.280 --> 17:08.280\nYeah.\n\n17:08.280 --> 17:09.280\nIt's possible to have watched it and be here right now, right?\n\n17:09.280 --> 17:14.960\nAnd raise a show of hands or applause if people watched it already?\n\n17:14.960 --> 17:15.960\nBy the same people?\n\n17:15.960 --> 17:16.960\nApplause?\n\n17:16.960 --> 17:17.960\nWas it good?\n\n17:17.960 --> 17:22.960\nIt's Game of Thrones, it's beyond that, you can't, you can't, like, Tim.\n\n17:22.960 --> 17:28.560\nIt's Game of Thrones is a little salty, like, like, forget that.\n\n17:28.560 --> 17:35.280\nGame of Thrones is always juicy, which is why it's brought to you by Doritos.\n\n17:35.280 --> 17:49.280\nWhen you have a orange triangle and it's covered in powder that dehydrates you and sends chemicals\n\n17:49.280 --> 17:56.400\nto your brain that make you crave the soft drinks manufactured by the same company.\n\n17:56.400 --> 18:03.400\nBecause we're all slaves and fuck the queen, but also Doritos.\n\n18:03.400 --> 18:06.600\nHow come the fuck the queen part never makes it in until the music is over?\n\n18:06.600 --> 18:10.080\nIt's just, it's there for, it's just genre, like, it's like Doritos is going for a new\n\n18:10.080 --> 18:18.800\ncampaign this year that's like, it's fuck the queen of your hunger.\n\n18:18.800 --> 18:21.600\nBut they don't, they don't want to mickey mouse it.\n\n18:21.600 --> 18:24.720\nLike they don't want it to be in the songs, but it's just like fuck the, fuck the queen\n\n18:24.720 --> 18:25.720\nof your hunger.\n\n18:25.720 --> 18:31.680\nIt's like a punk, like, you're punk, you hate the queen, you're hungry, but you don't want\n\n18:31.680 --> 18:32.680\nto fuck.\n\n18:32.680 --> 18:36.440\nBecause Frito Lays was always God save the queen of your hunger.\n\n18:36.440 --> 18:38.640\nThey were, they were royalists and that didn't, that, we're done.\n\n18:38.640 --> 18:39.640\nYeah, they love it.\n\n18:39.640 --> 18:40.640\nYeah.\n\n18:40.640 --> 18:44.000\nIt's like go, go see the, yeah, this is the crown jewel of your hunger.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:47.280\nThis is like, their new campaign is like Doritos, you're going to start seeing these commercials\n\n18:47.280 --> 18:48.360\non the internet.\n\n18:48.360 --> 18:51.080\nThey call them web commercials.\n\n18:51.080 --> 18:56.360\nThere's like fancy British people and they're like, would you pass me the Salisbury steak,\n\n18:56.360 --> 19:03.760\nplease Lord Governor, oh yes I will, then all righty, and then Roch, Rocho Randy Savage\n\n19:03.760 --> 19:07.600\ncomes through the wall and goes like, what the fuck are you doing?\n\n19:07.600 --> 19:10.920\nDid you say Nacho Randy Savage?\n\n19:10.920 --> 19:16.680\nHe's, he's, he's not, he's, did I even hear that or did you say Nacho Randy Savage?\n\n19:16.680 --> 19:21.840\nI misspoke, but the truth is that he is now, he's sold out to Doritos?\n\n19:21.840 --> 19:22.840\nYes.\n\n19:22.840 --> 19:23.840\nHe's now Nacho Randy Savage.\n\n19:23.840 --> 19:27.440\nLike when Sergeant Slaughter joined GI Joe, but like, that breaks your heart.\n\n19:27.440 --> 19:31.560\nYeah, he's now Nacho, yeah, I mean, I, yeah, it does break your heart.\n\n19:31.560 --> 19:35.080\nI can't believe he's sold out like that.\n\n19:35.080 --> 19:36.080\nI can't believe it.\n\n19:36.080 --> 19:43.080\nI used to think Macho Randy Savage, I guess I'm talking about pre Slim Jim Randy Savage.\n\n19:43.080 --> 19:49.520\nYeah, but they, yeah, the American psycho Christian Bale, like they're very good as teeth fixed.\n\n19:49.520 --> 19:50.520\nOkay.\n\n19:50.520 --> 19:51.520\nAll right.\n\n19:51.520 --> 19:52.520\nAnyways, Game of Thrones, thanks for being here.\n\n19:52.520 --> 19:55.880\nGame of Thrones fans and Harmontown fans, you've made a sacrifice that should surely\n\n19:55.880 --> 19:56.880\nbe rewarded.\n\n19:56.880 --> 19:57.880\nI'm sure.\n\n19:57.880 --> 19:59.360\nI'm going to get an Apple watch.\n\n19:59.360 --> 20:00.360\nFuck you.\n\n20:00.360 --> 20:01.360\nI don't care.\n\n20:01.360 --> 20:02.360\nStop yelling at me.\n\n20:02.360 --> 20:03.360\nI don't care.\n\n20:03.360 --> 20:07.800\nIf Apple made Kleenex, I would get it, I would blow my nose in it, and then it would\n\n20:07.800 --> 20:08.800\ngo like, okay.\n\n20:08.800 --> 20:09.800\nDid the Apple Kleenex work?\n\n20:09.800 --> 20:10.800\nLike, I don't have a car.\n\n20:10.800 --> 20:11.800\nFuck you.\n\n20:11.800 --> 20:12.800\nI don't care.\n\n20:12.800 --> 20:17.640\nI'm not, there's no other company that bothers to like try to like design shit with the consumer\n\n20:17.640 --> 20:18.640\nin mind.\n\n20:18.640 --> 20:21.120\nLike I'm, it's, and it is for like rich, shitty people.\n\n20:21.120 --> 20:23.520\nWhat does the Apple watch, because I've only seen like images of it.\n\n20:23.520 --> 20:26.040\nIt's just sort of like, it truly is useless.\n\n20:26.040 --> 20:28.080\nIt's of course it's useless.\n\n20:28.080 --> 20:29.080\nSo is Twitter.\n\n20:29.080 --> 20:32.240\nLike remember when everyone was like joking about Twitter, like what, what purpose does\n\n20:32.240 --> 20:33.240\nTwitter serve?\n\n20:33.240 --> 20:34.240\nI don't know.\n\n20:34.240 --> 20:37.640\nBut like, I know that like, like when I, you know, our watches, we don't wear watches\n\n20:37.640 --> 20:40.480\nanymore because we have these phones, but it's like you dig in your pocket, you pull\n\n20:40.480 --> 20:41.760\nout these things.\n\n20:41.760 --> 20:44.240\nRemember before watches, they had these pocket watches.\n\n20:44.240 --> 20:45.280\nThat's where we are now.\n\n20:45.280 --> 20:47.560\nYour phone has become a pocket watch.\n\n20:47.560 --> 20:54.000\nSo now we have to go forward into the eighties and have a tinier phone on our wrist that\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.400\ncan just let us know what time it is.\n\n20:56.400 --> 20:59.960\nAnd if we have any text messages without having to pull our phone out of our pocket, I'm getting\n\n20:59.960 --> 21:00.960\none.\n\n21:00.960 --> 21:01.960\nFuck you.\n\n21:01.960 --> 21:02.960\nI'm going to get one.\n\n21:02.960 --> 21:07.400\nI'm going to wear it discreetly, like under, under long sleeves during the winter because\n\n21:07.400 --> 21:08.880\nI am a little embarrassed.\n\n21:08.880 --> 21:11.160\nI don't want to, I don't want to be the only guy.\n\n21:11.160 --> 21:13.280\nHave you ever seen somebody walking around with them currently?\n\n21:13.280 --> 21:16.280\nNo, they're just, they're just, they just came out.\n\n21:16.280 --> 21:17.280\nSo I haven't seen them yet.\n\n21:17.280 --> 21:18.280\nI can't wear a watch.\n\n21:18.280 --> 21:19.680\nSo you may have one right now?\n\n21:19.680 --> 21:20.680\nNo?\n\n21:20.680 --> 21:21.680\nOkay.\n\n21:21.680 --> 21:22.680\nSee, they're hot.\n\n21:22.680 --> 21:23.680\nThey're hot.\n\n21:23.680 --> 21:24.680\nI can't wear a watch.\n\n21:24.680 --> 21:25.680\nI get too fidgety.\n\n21:25.680 --> 21:29.120\nAnd I'm also, when I was in, like it was in the eighties, like junior high school or high\n\n21:29.120 --> 21:32.640\nschool, I think the last time I wore a watch was I was a freshman in high school and I would\n\n21:32.640 --> 21:36.520\njust fidget the whole time and constantly look at my watch and constantly.\n\n21:36.520 --> 21:37.720\nThat's what you're supposed to do.\n\n21:37.720 --> 21:39.120\nIt's called using your watch.\n\n21:39.120 --> 21:43.560\nYeah, but I was, I was, I think I have a bit of OCD where I like, I kept looking at it\n\n21:43.560 --> 21:48.080\nand I would divide my day up into ever decreasing like fractions of time.\n\n21:48.080 --> 21:51.800\nThat's what you're supposed to do.\n\n21:51.800 --> 21:55.400\nSays big watch.\n\n21:55.400 --> 21:58.880\nLet's bring out big watch.\n\n21:58.880 --> 22:07.240\nAll right, let's bring out, let's, let's bring them out.\n\n22:07.240 --> 22:12.040\nLet's just bring them out like the way you bring a bull out at a rodeo.\n\n22:12.040 --> 22:13.240\nOut of a giant metal gate?\n\n22:13.240 --> 22:20.240\nLet's bring out Rick and Morty creator, Justin Reiland.\n\n22:20.240 --> 22:33.240\nGot you by a return and all.\n\n22:33.240 --> 22:38.360\nAnywhere you are, I think if you stick closer to me, then it works better.\n\n22:38.360 --> 22:39.360\nAll right.\n\n22:39.360 --> 22:40.360\nOkay.\n\n22:40.360 --> 22:41.360\nWow.\n\n22:41.360 --> 22:42.360\nOh man.\n\n22:42.360 --> 22:44.680\nI got a scythe for sore eyes over there.\n\n22:44.680 --> 22:45.680\nHow are you, Mr. Reiland?\n\n22:45.680 --> 22:46.680\nI'm good.\n\n22:46.680 --> 22:47.680\nHaven't seen you in a while.\n\n22:47.680 --> 22:48.680\nBut you don't age at all.\n\n22:48.680 --> 22:51.320\nYou look just as boyish and whistful as I've ever seen you.\n\n22:51.320 --> 22:56.560\nI just sort of build fat slowly, but surely I build fat against my body.\n\n22:56.560 --> 22:58.640\nYou look hard as a rock.\n\n22:58.640 --> 23:00.640\nAll right.\n\n23:00.640 --> 23:03.360\nJustin, I have a question for you.\n\n23:03.360 --> 23:04.360\nYeah.\n\n23:04.360 --> 23:05.360\nAnd I'm not joking.\n\n23:05.360 --> 23:08.360\nHow do you keep your hair so soft and manageable?\n\n23:08.360 --> 23:14.400\nI don't wash it for a few days in a row, and then I'll sleep on it, and then I'll spray\n\n23:14.400 --> 23:23.240\nit with that dry shampoo spray, and then I'll wash it, and then I won't wash it for three\n\n23:23.240 --> 23:26.120\nor four days.\n\n23:26.120 --> 23:28.720\nThe cycle repeats and continues.\n\n23:28.720 --> 23:31.800\nBut why are we talking about that?\n\n23:31.800 --> 23:35.440\nWe're really snapping into this news about your hygiene.\n\n23:35.440 --> 23:36.440\nAre you into this?\n\n23:36.440 --> 23:37.440\nExcessive.\n\n23:37.440 --> 23:38.440\nAre you curious?\n\n23:38.440 --> 23:39.440\nExcessive.\n\n23:39.440 --> 23:41.680\nThis is juicy news we're hearing right now.\n\n23:41.680 --> 23:44.520\nMan, what am I doing?\n\n23:44.520 --> 23:45.520\nHow you been?\n\n23:45.520

crazy, Justin?\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nYeah.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nYou're still mentally ill?\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:54.000\nYes.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:55.000\nI'm fucking depressed.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nHmm.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nYeah.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nYeah.\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nHey, hey.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nDon't fall for it.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.600\nHappier as I've ever been.\n\n24:04.600 --> 24:09.600\nIf a manic depressive tells you he's depressed, you don't say, ah, you say, okay.\n\n24:09.600 --> 24:10.600\nBullshit.\n\n24:10.600 --> 24:11.600\nBullshit.\n\n24:11.600 --> 24:12.600\nI'll wait.\n\n24:12.600 --> 24:13.600\nBullshit.\n\n24:13.600 --> 24:14.600\nBullshit.\n\n24:14.600 --> 24:21.840\nIt's like a person who got off for being criminally insane, and then I have to stand\n\n24:21.840 --> 24:22.840\ntrial.\n\n24:22.840 --> 24:24.600\nOh, I'm so crazy.\n\n24:24.600 --> 24:25.600\nBullshit.\n\n24:25.600 --> 24:28.680\nNo, but I'm seriously fucking depressed.\n\n24:28.680 --> 24:29.680\nYou're fucked up.\n\n24:29.680 --> 24:30.880\nYou're a crazy person.\n\n24:30.880 --> 24:31.880\nI'm not that crazy.\n\n24:31.880 --> 24:36.320\nJustin, when you say, you mean you're capital D depressed, or is there something on your\n\n24:36.320 --> 24:37.320\nmind right now?\n\n24:37.320 --> 24:38.880\nAh, I'm lowercase D depressed, lowercase.\n\n24:38.880 --> 24:42.800\nIs there something on your mind right now that is currently depressing to you, or depressing\n\n24:42.800 --> 24:43.800\nyou?\n\n24:43.800 --> 24:52.080\nYeah, there is, but his, the sign in the window that said he was here was like so complicated.\n\n24:52.080 --> 24:53.400\nLike, what did it say?\n\n24:53.400 --> 24:56.800\nRobin Williams has been on the show, and it didn't have like all the caveats.\n\n24:56.800 -->

things we weren't allowed to talk about.\n\n25:03.280 --> 25:04.280\nLike on the sign.\n\n25:04.280 --> 25:05.280\nWhat?\n\n25:05.280 --> 25:06.280\nYeah.\n\n25:06.280 --> 25:08.280\nRylan is here, but don't tip the ship for him.\n\n25:08.280 --> 25:10.280\nJesus Christ, fuck, I'm sorry.\n\n25:10.280 --> 25:12.040\nCan I see that?\n\n25:12.040 --> 25:13.040\nCan I see that, please?\n\n25:13.040

ship?\n\n25:29.680 --> 25:34.840\nTip the ship, I don't know, I'm pretty drunk.\n\n25:34.840 --> 25:37.240\nI'm pretty drunk right now, and I'm sorry.\n\n25:37.240 --> 25:38.240\nI can't believe the fuck.\n\n25:38.240 --> 25:39.240\nI took it for him.\n\n25:39.240 --> 25:41.400\nJesus Christ, fuck, I'm sorry.\n\n25:41.400 --> 25:43.400\nYeah, okay, so let me explain this.\n\n25:43.400 --> 25:53.120\nSo, so, so, so what I was going for here was like, what, what, okay, do you want some\n\n25:53.120 --> 25:54.120\npaint color?\n\n25:54.120 --> 25:55.120\nSpencer?\n\n25:55.120 -->

the little window and look\n\n26:03.960 --> 26:04.960\nat Dan.\n\n26:04.960 --> 26:07.760\nAnd I'm like, I don't want to do, do that.\n\n26:07.760 --> 26:08.760\nHe's like doing his bed.\n\n26:08.760 --> 26:11.840\nHe's like, that's like the opening routine for, I practiced it for days.\n\n26:11.840 --> 26:15.880\nI'm not going to stand there like a weirdo and like, leer at him.\n\n26:15.880 --> 26:20.040\nAnd then he looks at me and goes, oh yeah, just put a, but just put a sign, put a novel\n\n26:20.040 --> 26:22.040\non a piece of paper and hold it up.\n\n26:22.040 --> 26:25.440\nSo, so I

about your relationship tonight.\n\n26:47.760 --> 26:51.440\nNo, I know, I know, but no, all it meant was like, don't, don't rock the boat.\n\n26:51.440 --> 26:52.440\nDon't.\n\n26:52.440 -->

extension of my, where I'm at right now, psychologically.\n\n27:10.640 --> 27:11.640\nWhat is it?\n\n27:11.640 --> 27:12.640\nWhat's, what's, what's the depressing news?\n\n27:12.640 -->

Machio\n\n29:42.560 --> 29:47.960\ntights, I had to walk into a store and physically purchase them over the counter.\n\n29:47.960 --> 29:50.360\nAnd then you have to hurry it home.\n\n29:50.360 --> 29:52.360\nYou just carry it home like all the way.\n\n29:52.360 --> 29:53.360\nYeah.\n\n29:53.360 --> 29:55.640\nAnd now you have to just sit home and just push the button and you have one.\n\n29:55.640 --> 29:57.640\nWhere's the, where's the pride in what you're doing, Anatoly?\n\n29:57.640 --> 30:02.080\nWhere's the, where's the, where's the pride and ownership of buying your Ryan Gosling\n\n30:02.080 --> 30:03.080\nprice anonymously?\n\n30:03.080 --> 30:04.080\nWho needs pride?\n\n30:04.080 --> 30:05.080\nIt's not about pride.\n\n30:05.080 --> 30:06.080\nLike a thief.\n\n30:06.080 --> 30:07.080\nIt's not fucking about pride.\n\n30:07.080 --> 30:08.080\nIt should be about pride.\n\n30:08.080 --> 30:09.080\nNo, nothing's about pride.\n\n30:09.080 --> 30:11.080\nIt's about ease of purchase.\n\n30:11.080 --> 30:12.080\nWow.\n\n30:12.080 --> 30:13.080\nYeah.\n\n30:13.080 --> 30:17.080\nI, I, yeah, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n30:17.080 --> 30:18.420\nlike, nothing is about pride.\n\n30:18.420 --> 30:19.620\nHe's right.\n\n30:19.620 --> 30:23.860\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n30:23.860 --> 30:31.480\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n30:31.480 --> 30:43.660\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,\n\n30:43.660 --> 30:45.200\nI, I, I, I, I, I\n\n30:45.200 --> 30:46.200\nYeah.\n\n30:46.200 --> 30:52.200\nOver the line, Jeff. Over the line.\n\n30:52.200 --> 30:55.200\nI'm a journalist, Dan. I'm a journalist.\n\n30:55.200 --> 30:59.200\nHow can you have no respect to Ryan Gosling, dude? No.\n\n30:59.200 --> 31:00.200\nIt's fucking Ryan Gosling.\n\n31:00.200 --> 31:03.200\nNo, I didn't. I don't show the respect that you were showing it.\n\n31:03.200 --> 31:10.200\nI always get Ryan Gosling confused with the other guy, the Brian Gosling.\n\n31:10.200 --> 31:16.200\nNo. That's his name. Oh, Gyllenhaal, the little Gyllenhaal.\n\n31:16.200 --> 31:17.200\nJake Gyllenhaal.\n\n31:17.200 --> 31:18.200\nJake Gyllenhaal.\n\n31:18.200 --> 31:19.200\nI can't tell the difference between those two.\n\n31:19.200 --> 31:22.200\nYeah, because their beards are shapeshifting. You never know what beard they're going to have.\n\n31:22.200 --> 31:26.200\nYeah, I just thought that they both came from the same silly putty egg, and they're both like,\n\n31:26.200 --> 31:31.200\nlike one of them you went like this, and one of them you went like that.\n\n31:31.200 --> 31:34.200\nAnd they're both like always upset.\n\n31:34.200 --> 31:41.200\nYou know what they have in common, though? All girls we know want to bone them.\n\n31:41.200 --> 31:43.200\nAll right.\n\n31:43.200 --> 31:47.200\nI mean, that's everybody. That's everybody.\n\n31:47.200 --> 31:52.200\nReally? You're going to fucking put me up on a witch stick and burn me?\n\n31:52.200 --> 31:54.200\nThat's a witch, witch, witch stick?\n\n31:54.200 --> 31:57.200\nDan and I have a mutual friend named, this actor named Daniel Gillies.\n\n31:57.200 --> 32:00.200\nHe's wonderful, and he's on like those vampire shows and stuff, and he's fantastic.\n\n32:00.200 --> 32:05.200\nAnd he's friends with Ryan Gosling, and for...\n\n32:05.200 --> 32:06.200\nName drop.\n\n32:06.200 --> 32:12.200\nNo, no, no, this is me dropping Ryan Gosling's name on behalf of somebody else.\n\n32:12.200 --> 32:13.200\nI'm kidding.\n\n32:13.200 --> 32:18.200\nFor Daniel's birthday party, Ryan Gosling did something that I thought was incredibly groovy.\n\n32:18.200 --> 32:19.200\nHe showed up at the...\n\n32:19.200 --> 32:21.200\nWith Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\n32:21.200 --> 32:23.200\nAnd he's like...\n\n32:23.200 --> 32:27.200\nAnd they just started fucking right in front of everybody.\n\n32:27.200 --> 32:30.200\nAnd they were tights with Daniel's picture all over them.\n\n32:30.200 --> 32:34.200\nHe came to his birthday party with Jake Gyllenhaal, and they took hostages.\n\n32:34.200 --> 32:37.200\nAnd then both of them kept saying like,\n\n32:37.200 --> 32:41.200\nNo, I'm Ryan Gosling to all the party guests.\n\n32:41.200 --> 32:44.200\nAll the party guests had to figure out who to shoot.\n\n32:44.200 --> 32:46.200\nThey all had guns for some reason.\n\n32:46.200 --> 32:48.200\nAnd they had hostages, which doesn't make any sense.\n\n32:48.200 --> 32:51.200\nAs you walked into the party, you got a loaded gun.\n\n32:51.200 --> 32:52.200\nYeah, you got a firearm.\n\n32:52.200 --> 32:53.200\nAll right, what did he really do?\n\n32:53.200 --> 32:58.200\nHe showed up at the, what's it called, the Chateau Marmont, and Daniel got to swinging like Balcony,\n\n32:58.200 --> 33:00.200\nlike one of the great rooms up there.\n\n33:00.200 --> 33:06.200\nAnd Ryan Gosling comes in on his own, but behind him, I think a 10 or 12 piece mariachi band.\n\n33:06.200 --> 33:07.200\nThat was his gift.\n\n33:07.200 --> 33:13.200\nAnd they played for half an hour, and they fucking boned out, and that was his gift.\n\n33:13.200 --> 33:15.200\nThere was 30 minutes of mariachi music.\n\n33:15.200 --> 33:16.200\nCan I hear that song?\n\n33:16.200 --> 33:19.200\nHe brought it for his gift to Daniel.\n\n33:19.200 --> 33:21.200\nI brought you music from these guys.\n\n33:21.200 --> 33:23.200\nOh, oh, oh, it was Daniel's birthday.\n\n33:23.200 --> 33:25.200\nJeff, can you tell me that song again?\n\n33:25.200 --> 33:27.200\nMy name is Dan Harmon.\n\n33:27.200 --> 33:30.200\nNo, no, no, Jeff, Jeff, the song that they played when they came in?\n\n33:30.200 --> 33:31.200\nI just, you want to hear it?\n\n33:35.200 --> 33:36.200\nI can't sing.\n\n33:36.200 --> 33:37.200\nI want more, though.\n\n33:37.200 --> 33:42.200\nI want chorus verse chorus verse of that song.\n\n33:42.200 --> 33:44.200\nAnna Tully, do you miss the Cold War?\n\n33:44.200 --> 33:45.200\nThank you, Dan.\n\n33:47.200 --> 33:49.200\nI do, I do.\n\n33:49.200 --> 33:51.200\nI was thinking about it today.\n\n33:51.200 --> 33:53.200\nI was talking to my assistant, Steve Levy, about it.\n\n33:53.200 --> 33:54.200\nWe were like, holy shit, man.\n\n33:54.200 --> 33:58.200\nSo we're just marveling at that 50 year plan we had before we got into World War II.\n\n33:58.200 --> 34:05.200\nAnd it was like, fuck, man, for 50 years, like the bad guys were just other white people with a backwards alphabet.\n\n34:05.200 --> 34:07.200\nIt was fucking amazing.\n\n34:07.200 --> 34:17.200\nAnd like barely any bloodshed for 50 years, just a bunch of cool movies about how we all had film in our pens.\n\n34:17.200 --> 34:21.200\nAnd now it's just like, fucking day of the goddamn dead.\n\n34:21.200 --> 34:25.200\nAnna Tully, like in Russia during the Cold War, I mean, how old are you first off?\n\n34:25.200 --> 34:26.200\nYou're quite young.\n\n34:26.200 --> 34:27.200\n25.\n\n34:27.200 --> 34:29.200\n25, so you might be too young to answer this well.\n\n34:29.200 --> 34:34.200\nBut were there, again, the 80s for us, there were great movies where the Russians were always the great bad guys.\n\n34:34.200 --> 34:40.200\nWe saw the decade end when it seems the world would collide with the blink of an eye.\n\n34:40.200 --> 34:47.200\nThe show brought to you by retard and all.\n\n34:54.200 --> 34:56.200\nI was doing that song, that song.\n\n34:56.200 --> 34:57.200\nRemember that song?\n\n34:57.200 --> 34:58.200\nOh, yeah.\n\n34:58.200 --> 35:05.200\nWoman on the radio said that fruity pebbles were allowed in Germany.\n\n35:05.200 --> 35:06.200\nKeep going.\n\n35:06.200 --> 35:13.200\nRight, right now, watching the world wake up from history.\n\n35:13.200 --> 35:18.200\nSkritti Polini, who are those guys?\n\n35:18.200 --> 35:22.200\nIn Russia, were there great movies where the Americans were the bad guys?\n\n35:22.200 --> 35:23.200\nWas that a thing too?\n\n35:23.200 --> 35:25.200\nNo, it wasn't like really big.\n\n35:25.200 --> 35:26.200\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n35:26.200 --> 35:29.200\nYou guys were just stabbing each other for blue jeans the whole time.\n\n35:29.200 --> 35:30.200\nThat was the big secret.\n\n35:30.200 --> 35:36.200\nWe were like, oh no, the Russians, and they were like, don't tell them, give me some bread.\n\n35:36.200 --> 35:37.200\nNo.\n\n35:37.200 --> 35:38.200\nOffensive?\n\n35:38.200 --> 35:39.200\nProbably.\n\n35:39.200 --> 35:46.200\nYeah, that's fucked up.\n\n35:46.200 --> 35:48.200\nYeah, but it was bad over there the whole time.\n\n35:48.200 --> 35:49.200\nAlways was.\n\n35:49.200 --> 35:52.200\nThey sold counterfeit watches and stuff.\n\n35:52.200 --> 35:54.200\nI mean, that's all they did.\n\n35:54.200 --> 35:55.200\nRight?\n\n35:55.200 --> 35:56.200\nRight?\n\n35:56.200 --> 35:57.200\nBro?\n\n35:57.200 --> 36:06.200\nMy joke is that, you know, the joke was, like Dan was going, you know, hardcore.\n\n36:06.200 --> 36:07.200\nYeah.\n\n36:07.200 --> 36:14.200\nAnd I was like, oh yeah, I'm going to go hardcore, but also racist.\n\n36:14.200 --> 36:16.200\nDustin, to continue that.\n\n36:16.200 --> 36:17.200\nAgainst Russian people.\n\n36:17.200 --> 36:20.200\nEverything I know about Russia, I learned from the movie Red Heat with Jim Belushi and\n\n36:20.200 --> 36:23.200\nArnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n36:23.200 --> 36:26.200\nThat was a hard hitting documentary.\n\n36:26.200 --> 36:31.200\nDustin, I think that you should take advantage of what we're being racist about Russians.\n\n36:31.200 --> 36:32.200\nYeah.\n\n36:32.200 --> 36:36.200\nTo use this Russian intellectual here to explain your depression and what's going on in your\n\n36:36.200 --> 36:37.200\nlife right now.\n\n36:37.200 --> 36:38.200\nI'm just fucking depressed.\n\n36:38.200 --> 36:39.200\nYeah, sir.\n\n36:39.200 --> 36:41.200\nLike, I want to kill myself.\n\n36:41.200 --> 36:50.200\nBut I'm too scared to do that because I am so frightened of what would happen if I did\n\n36:50.200 --> 36:51.200\nkill myself.\n\n36:51.200 --> 36:52.200\nYou know what I mean?\n\n36:52.200 --> 36:56.200\nI'm one of those fucking people.\n\n36:56.200 --> 36:58.200\nYou chalk me up into that category.\n\n36:58.200 --> 37:01.200\nJethophobes.\n\n37:01.200 --> 37:07.200\nThe people that want to die, but then are so scared of what happens when you die that\n\n37:07.200 --> 37:09.200\nthey're afraid to kill themselves.\n\n37:09.200 --> 37:11.200\nThat's me, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n37:11.200 --> 37:14.200\nAll right, Anatoly, how do you deal with that?\n\n37:14.200 --> 37:19.200\nHow do you deal with that shit with your fucking Frank Gosling pants?\n\n37:19.200 --> 37:21.200\nHow do you deal with that shit?\n\n37:21.200 --> 37:22.200\nOkay.\n\n37:22.200 --> 37:27.200\nI want Ryan Gosling to suck on my people.\n\n37:27.200 --> 37:28.200\nI'm talking.\n\n37:28.200 --> 37:29.200\nI'm talking.\n\n37:29.200 --> 37:30.200\nI'm talking.\n\n37:30.200 --> 37:31.200\nIt's funny.\n\n37:31.200 --> 37:32.200\nSorry, sorry.\n\n37:32.200 --> 37:33.200\nThat's fucked up.\n\n37:33.200 --> 37:34.200\nI'm sorry.\n\n37:34.200 --> 37:35.200\nThat's fucked up.\n\n37:35.200 --> 37:38.200\nThat's mean and I'm sorry and I did not mean to offend you.\n\n37:38.200 --> 37:39.200\nAll right.\n\n37:39.200 --> 37:40.200\nGo, Anatoly.\n\n37:40.200 --> 37:41.200\nYou have the floor.\n\n37:41.200 --> 37:42.200\nThe floor, okay.\n\n37:42.200 --> 37:45.200\nThen I can have a floor to move my religion.\n\n37:45.200 --> 37:48.200\nIt's about what happened after you die.\n\n37:48.200 --> 37:49.200\nOkay.\n\n37:49.200 --> 37:50.200\nNothing will happen.\n\n37:50.200 --> 37:55.200\nPretty Russian.\n\n37:55.200 --> 37:57.200\nNothing will happen.\n\n37:57.200 --> 37:58.200\nLights out, baby.\n\n37:58.200 --> 37:59.200\nWhat you're saying is blackness.\n\n37:59.200 --> 38:00.200\nBlackness.\n\n38:00.200 --> 38:01.200\nBlackness.\n\n38:01.200 --> 38:03.200\nBut blackness is a thing.\n\n38:03.200 --> 38:06.200\nI'm telling you, man, I don't think that's true.\n\n38:06.200 --> 38:10.200\nI think that when you kill yourself and die or if you die in a car crash or if you fucking\n\n38:10.200 --> 38:17.200\nwhatever, however you die, I think that you are reborn in, okay, so I'm kind of hung up\n\n38:17.200 --> 38:22.200\non this because, so let's say Harmon, you make babies with Aaron, right?\n\n38:22.200 --> 38:27.200\nPoop out a bunch of babies and those little babies find, let's say they're girls.\n\n38:27.200 --> 38:28.200\nOkay.\n\n38:28.200 --> 38:29.200\nJust follow me.\n\n38:29.200 --> 38:32.200\nSo they're girls and they find these boys and the boys are like, I'm gonna fuck and\n\n38:32.200 --> 38:33.200\nfuck that bitch.\n\n38:33.200 --> 38:34.200\nOkay.\n\n38:34.200 --> 38:38.200\nSo then the boys fuck your girls and they make little babies and they poop those out,\n\n38:38.200 --> 38:39.200\nright?\n\n38:39.200 --> 38:40.200\nOkay.\n\n38:40.200 --> 38:47.200\nSo they go on and, you know, the fucking circle of life continues and you die.\n\n38:47.200 --> 38:48.200\nOkay.\n\n38:48.200 --> 38:57.200\nSo my theory is maybe that you will be reborn in your own lineage way down the road when\n\n38:57.200 --> 39:03.200\nthe fucking water's gone, when we're fucking, the planet's burning up and the NASA space\n\n39:03.200 --> 39:06.200\nstation is like, oh shit, we gotta hurry up.\n\n39:06.200 --> 39:09.200\nBut how can it be me if I'm not able to go like, it's me.\n\n39:09.200 --> 39:10.200\nYou wiped.\n\n39:10.200 --> 39:11.200\nLike it'll be you.\n\n39:11.200 --> 39:12.200\nWell, then if you're wiped, then you don't exist.\n\n39:12.200 --> 39:17.000\nNo, you do though, because it'll be you, but you're, all your memories will be wiped.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:18.200\nSo you'll get pooped out of the vagina.\n\n39:18.200 --> 39:20.400\nBut who cares about that guy?\n\n39:20.400 --> 39:22.200\nYou will because you're gonna have to fucking live it.\n\n39:22.200 --> 39:23.600\nNo, I won't because my memory will be wiped.\n\n39:23.600 --> 39:26.600\nYeah, but you will because you'll be fucking living it.\n\n39:26.600 --> 39:28.800\nNo, you might as well say that about all life.\n\n39:28.800 --> 39:30.200\nThat is true about all life.\n\n39:30.200 --> 39:31.200\nThat's the beautiful thing is life.\n\n39:31.200 --> 39:34.200\nI'm not saying you're gonna come back as a blade of grass.\n\n39:34.200 --> 39:35.200\nI'm saying.\n\n39:35.200 --> 39:37.200\nAs another guy who is the equivalent of a blade of grass.\n\n39:37.200 --> 39:41.200\nYou're gonna come back as Dan Harmon's great, great, great, great grandson.\n\n39:41.200 --> 39:42.200\nBut he's not gonna.\n\n39:42.200 --> 39:46.200\nAnd it's gonna be little Danny Harmon pooping out of his vagina.\n\n39:46.200 --> 39:50.200\nAnd he's gonna be like, oh, tell him how bodies work.\n\n39:50.200 --> 39:51.200\nHere I go.\n\n39:51.200 --> 39:52.200\nBut I know.\n\n39:52.200 --> 39:53.200\nBut like, I put this.\n\n39:53.200 --> 39:54.200\nOh, I love life.\n\n39:54.200 --> 39:59.200\nAnd then when you get to like age 20, you're gonna be like, what the fuck is going on?\n\n39:59.200 --> 40:01.200\nLike you did in this life.\n\n40:01.200 --> 40:03.200\nAnd then you're gonna start to go, what the fuck?\n\n40:03.200 --> 40:04.200\nI'm 20.\n\n40:04.200 --> 40:05.200\nOkay.\n\n40:05.200 --> 40:06.200\nYou're 25, 30, 40.\n\n40:06.200 --> 40:07.200\nBullshit.\n\n40:07.200 --> 40:11.200\nBut that guy never says, I had a podcast.\n\n40:11.200 --> 40:13.200\nDid I mention a podcast?\n\n40:13.200 --> 40:18.200\nNo, I'm saying that your identity is based on the idea that you would have anything to do.\n\n40:18.200 --> 40:19.200\nYou know what you'll have in that day?\n\n40:19.200 --> 40:22.200\nYou'll be like, I have a scrubby schmast.\n\n40:22.200 --> 40:24.200\nIt'll be some weird thing.\n\n40:24.200 --> 40:26.200\nYou're not even listening to me.\n\n40:26.200 --> 40:27.200\nI'm sorry.\n\n40:27.200 --> 40:28.200\nI want to listen.\n\n40:28.200 --> 40:29.200\nTell me.\n\n40:29.200 --> 40:31.200\nI want to understand what you were saying.\n\n40:31.200 --> 40:32.200\nYou promise you'll listen?\n\n40:32.200 --> 40:33.200\nYeah, I swear.\n\n40:33.200 --> 40:34.200\nI swear.\n\n40:34.200 --> 40:35.200\nAll right.\n\n40:35.200 --> 40:43.200\nIf you're reincarnated, but the only part that's not reincarnated is all memory of your previous life.\n\n40:43.200 --> 40:44.200\nOkay.\n\n40:44.200 --> 40:45.200\nThat's not reincarnation.\n\n40:45.200 --> 40:46.200\nThat's biology.\n\n40:46.200 --> 40:47.200\nYes.\n\n40:47.200 --> 40:50.200\nOf course, my cum goes into a thing and then the cum changes.\n\n40:50.200 --> 40:52.200\nNo, but that's not what I'm saying, though.\n\n40:52.200 --> 40:53.200\nOkay.\n\n40:53.200 --> 40:54.200\nSorry.\n\n40:54.200 --> 40:55.200\nIt's semen.\n\n40:55.200 --> 40:56.200\nGet ready.\n\n40:56.200 --> 40:57.200\nSo what are-\n\n40:57.200 --> 40:59.200\nAtoms, molecules, cosmic light.\n\n40:59.200 --> 41:00.200\nWhat I'm saying is that-\n\n41:00.200 --> 41:01.200\nCum is gross.\n\n41:01.200 --> 41:03.200\nI'm saying that, you know, you and Aaron have a baby.\n\n41:03.200 --> 41:07.200\nThat baby goes on whether it's a boy and girl and appropriate-\n\n41:07.200 --> 41:08.200\nI didn't-\n\n41:08.200 --> 41:09.200\nYou don't have-\n\n41:09.200 --> 41:11.200\nYou don't have to-\n\n41:11.200 --> 41:14.200\nI don't want to be gloob about this, but you don't have to walk me through this again.\n\n41:14.200 --> 41:15.200\nAll right, fine.\n\n41:15.200 --> 41:17.200\nI know how life works, and I know-\n\n41:17.200 --> 41:19.200\nOkay, so that's 70 years from now.\n\n41:19.200 --> 41:21.200\nThat's one possibility, by the way.\n\n41:21.200 --> 41:22.200\nOne possibility.\n\n41:22.200 --> 41:24.200\nBy the way, that's exactly what happens.\n\n41:24.200 --> 41:29.200\nEverybody says who's fortunate enough to live long enough to see grandparents and grandchildren,\n\n41:29.200 --> 41:34.200\nand they say you are- you're the spitting image of, and you have the personality of your great-\n\n41:34.200 --> 41:37.200\nHoly shit, you are that motherfucker.\n\n41:37.200 --> 41:38.200\nOne of the-\n\n41:38.200 --> 41:39.200\nMaybe.\n\n41:39.200 --> 41:45.200\nOne of the progenitors of my family was like a philosophy major and a curmudgeon and a hermit,\n\n41:45.200 --> 41:48.200\nand like he lost all his money in the stock market,\n\n41:48.200 --> 41:51.200\nand he was the only other Harmon that went to school or whatever,\n\n41:51.200 --> 41:53.200\nlike I never met him, but he was like a guy,\n\n41:53.200 --> 41:56.200\nand he just- he was so long dead before I was ever around,\n\n41:56.200 --> 41:59.200\nbut then a couple of old people were able to say before they died,\n\n41:59.200 --> 42:02.200\nyou're just like, so it's a-\n\n42:02.200 --> 42:04.200\nIt is reincarnation in that sense,\n\n42:04.200 --> 42:07.200\nlike I am like that guy because there's a fiber there.\n\n42:07.200 --> 42:13.200\nSo then the, you know, the whole thing of like reproducing and pooping out babies,\n\n42:13.200 --> 42:18.200\nand well maybe fuck some other people and keep fucking and shitting out babies,\n\n42:18.200 --> 42:20.200\nit's a little bit, you know, I mean-\n\n42:20.200 --> 42:22.200\nIt's very accurate, yes.\n\n42:22.200 --> 42:24.200\nThat's how life works.\n\n42:24.200 --> 42:29.200\nBut Justin, your fear you said is that if you are reincarnated as a poop baby\n\n42:29.200 --> 42:32.200\nthree generations from now and there's no water and the planet is all crappy,\n\n42:32.200 --> 42:34.200\nwhat if in the future life-\n\n42:34.200 --> 42:38.200\nListen, I don't want nothing to do with it.\n\n42:38.200 --> 42:41.200\nYou won't have anything to do with it.\n\n42:41.200 --> 42:42.200\nIt's not you.\n\n42:42.200 --> 42:44.200\nSo I'm not having children, okay?\n\n42:44.200 --> 42:46.200\nThat's why I'm not shitting babies out.\n\n42:46.200 --> 42:49.200\nYou're still gonna have just as much to do with it without having children\n\n42:49.200 --> 42:51.200\nbecause one of their babies is gonna be you.\n\n42:51.200 --> 42:53.200\nSo let's talk about the other thing, right?\n\n42:53.200 --> 42:57.200\nSo you have babies, you poop them out, and then, you know,\n\n42:57.200 --> 43:01.200\nlet's say in this crazy, weird, magical version of reality,\n\n43:01.200 --> 43:05.200\nyour life, you'll be reincarnated as one of these babies,\n\n43:05.200 --> 43:08.200\nlike so many lines, there are so many things online.\n\n43:08.200 --> 43:09.200\nSo what's the opposite of that?\n\n43:09.200 --> 43:12.200\nThe opposite of that is you say, I'm not gonna have, I'm gonna bisect me,\n\n43:12.200 --> 43:14.200\nI'm not gonna have any fucking kids.\n\n43:14.200 --> 43:15.200\nSo then what happens?\n\n43:15.200 --> 43:19.200\nWell then you're in fucking heaven and there's 700 virgins-\n\n43:19.200 --> 43:20.200\nWhat?\n\n43:20.200 --> 43:24.200\nIt will fuck you.\n\n43:24.200 --> 43:29.200\nYou know what I mean?\n\n43:29.200 --> 43:31.200\nJustin!\n\n43:31.200 --> 43:33.200\nTotally crazy people think that.\n\n43:33.200 --> 43:38.200\nJustin, those are your two, your main two theories of course.\n\n43:38.200 --> 43:42.200\n700, I love the idea that you're just-\n\n43:42.200 --> 43:45.200\n700 virgin women.\n\n43:45.200 --> 43:52.200\nWe'll have sex with you if your parents refuse to procreate.\n\n43:52.200 --> 43:53.200\nJustin, it sounds to me like-\n\n43:53.200 --> 43:54.200\nI'm just kidding.\n\n43:54.200 --> 43:57.200\nIt sounds to me like possibly that you're more afraid of not leaving.\n\n43:57.200 --> 43:59.200\nMan, I'm just fucking afraid of everything.\n\n43:59.200 --> 44:02.200\nYou do want children, you do want to leave someone behind.\n\n44:02.200 --> 44:04.200\nThat's what I'm believing in.\n\n44:04.200 --> 44:07.200\nI don't know if I can care for another human being, I'm scared.\n\n44:07.200 --> 44:08.200\nI'm just really scared.\n\n44:08.200 --> 44:13.200\nWell you shouldn't have kids, no one wants you to have kids.\n\n44:13.200 --> 44:17.200\nA lot of people are bummed out you have dogs.\n\n44:17.200 --> 44:23.200\nI talked to a guy tonight that's bummed out you have Legos.\n\n44:23.200 --> 44:28.200\nI have to say that I love my dogs and I take care of them so well.\n\n44:28.200 --> 44:33.200\nI've rescued and saved dogs, but I get it, you know.\n\n44:33.200 --> 44:36.200\nHe's a good dog owner, he's a very good dog owner.\n\n44:36.200 --> 44:39.200\nAre you worried about your dogs pooping out babies?\n\n44:39.200 --> 44:41.200\nNo, no, no.\n\n44:41.200 --> 44:43.200\nI want to check in with the booth.\n\n44:43.200 --> 44:45.200\nDo we have friends back there that are-\n\n44:45.200 --> 44:46.200\nYeah we do?\n\n44:46.200 --> 44:47.200\nOh god, for God's sake.\n\n44:47.200 --> 44:48.200\nAnatoly, go sit down.\n\n44:48.200 --> 44:49.200\nPlease.\n\n44:49.200 --> 44:50.200\nThank you everybody.\n\n44:50.200 --> 44:51.200\nThank you Anatoly.\n\n44:51.200 --> 44:52.200\nFuck out of here.\n\n44:52.200 --> 44:54.200\nThank you Ryan Gosling.\n\n44:54.200 --> 45:00.200\nI don't know what you guys want.\n\n45:00.200 --> 45:01.200\nWhat do you want from me?\n\n45:01.200 --> 45:02.200\nWhat do you want?\n\n45:02.200 --> 45:03.200\nWhat do you want?\n\n45:03.200 --> 45:04.200\nThat's you.\n\n45:04.200 --> 45:07.200\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:07.200 --> 45:08.200\nWhat do you want?\n\n45:08.200 --> 45:09.200\nWhat do you want from me?\n\n45:09.200 --> 45:11.200\nI don't know what to want.\n\n45:11.200 --> 45:13.200\nI dress up like a Christmas tree.\n\n45:13.200 --> 45:14.200\nWhat do you want?\n\n45:14.200 --> 45:15.200\nWhat do you want?\n\n45:15.200 --> 45:16.200\nThat's you.\n\n45:16.200 --> 45:17.200\nOh shit.\n\n45:17.200 --> 45:18.200\nWhat do you want from me?\n\n45:18.200 --> 45:19.200\nOh fuck.\n\n45:19.200 --> 45:20.200\nUh oh.\n\n45:20.200 --> 45:21.200\nNo, you're not supposed to be able to-\n\n45:21.200 --> 45:22.200\nYou asked for it.\n\n45:22.200 --> 45:23.200\nRespond.\n\n45:23.200 --> 45:24.200\nOh no.\n\n45:24.200 --> 45:25.200\nOur audience is-\n\n45:25.200 --> 45:26.200\nThey're learning how to think.\n\n45:26.200 --> 45:27.200\nThey're using tools.\n\n45:27.200 --> 45:28.200\nIt's like when the velociraptor doorknob.\n\n45:28.200 --> 45:40.200\nHow did that Jurassic World movie go?\n\n45:40.200 --> 45:45.200\nPeople are saying like I was pretty spot on with my predictions about Jurassic World.\n\n45:45.200 --> 45:47.200\nWe should have a screening here.\n\n45:47.200 --> 45:48.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n45:48.200 --> 45:54.200\nThat Chris Pratt is like the guy who really he understands velociraptors and they him.\n\n45:54.200 --> 45:59.200\nHey man, I know Chris Pratt that motherfucker ain't jokin' around.\n\n45:59.200 --> 46:00.200\nI'll tell you one thing.\n\n46:00.200 --> 46:02.200\nHe don't eat no fat.\n\n46:02.200 --> 46:03.200\nJustin.\n\n46:03.200 --> 46:05.200\nAnd his wife didn't eat no lean.\n\n46:05.200 --> 46:06.200\nJustin, can I say something?\n\n46:06.200 --> 46:07.200\nDo me a favor.\n\n46:07.200 --> 46:09.200\nWill you do me a favor?\n\n46:09.200 --> 46:11.200\nDo you consider me a pal and a friend?\n\n46:11.200 --> 46:12.200\nI love you, yeah.\n\n46:12.200 --> 46:13.200\nI love you.\n\n46:13.200 --> 46:14.200\nWill you do me a favor?\n\n46:14.200 --> 46:15.200\nJust for me.\n\n46:15.200 --> 46:16.200\nYeah.\n\n46:16.200 --> 46:17.200\nDon't kill yourself because I love you.\n\n46:17.200 --> 46:20.200\nOh, I have two days from now.\n\n46:20.200 --> 46:25.200\nYou're gonna find my body hangin' from a noose, baby.\n\n46:25.200 --> 46:26.200\nNah, just kidding.\n\n46:26.200 --> 46:29.200\nI have something important to say about that and I've said it before.\n\n46:29.200 --> 46:35.200\nWe have a young audience and there are hipsters and stuff and people have like we all go through\n\n46:35.200 --> 46:36.200\na bunch of shit.\n\n46:36.200 --> 46:38.200\nYou go through a bunch of shit, different phases of your life.\n\n46:38.200 --> 46:40.200\nNo one wants to be told you're going through a phase.\n\n46:40.200 --> 46:42.200\nYour feelings are your actual feelings.\n\n46:42.200 --> 46:45.200\nThe most important thing you can do is talk to somebody about them.\n\n46:45.200 --> 46:47.200\nYou have to talk to somebody about them.\n\n46:47.200 --> 46:50.200\nYou have a friend or a family member that you trust.\n\n46:50.200 --> 46:51.200\nYou don't have to call them.\n\n46:51.200 --> 46:52.200\nWhat is this, Dr. Phil?\n\n46:52.200 --> 46:54.200\nWhat am I on a fuckin' daytime talk show?\n\n46:54.200 --> 46:58.200\nIt's the important thing that you need to say to anybody who is ever having these thoughts.\n\n46:58.200 --> 47:01.200\nThe most dangerous thing you can do is let them bounce around in your head.\n\n47:01.200 --> 47:05.200\nRest assured, I have three therapists that have been given to me their numbers.\n\n47:05.200 --> 47:08.200\nI have not called any of them yet.\n\n47:08.200 --> 47:11.200\nI don't know if I will, maybe I will.\n\n47:11.200 --> 47:16.200\nOr maybe I'll fuck it, blow my goddamn brains out.\n\n47:16.200 --> 47:19.200\nIf you do, if we do find you hanging from a news two days from now.\n\n47:19.200 --> 47:21.200\nNo, no, I just want to let everyone know I would never do that.\n\n47:21.200 --> 47:23.200\nI'm too scared of death.\n\n47:23.200 --> 47:27.200\nI'm too scared of the whole death thing to be able to actually kill myself.\n\n47:27.200 --> 47:31.200\nSo, no matter how suicidal I get, I will never kill myself.\n\n47:31.200 --> 47:35.200\nAnd that is my promise to you.\n\n47:35.200 --> 47:40.200\nYou fuckin' pussy.\n\n47:40.200 --> 47:42.200\nWhat a stunt.\n\n47:42.200 --> 47:47.200\nJustin Roiland. He didn't bounce to not kill himself.\n\n47:47.200 --> 47:50.200\nEmotional terrorist.\n\n47:50.200 --> 47:53.200\nIs it our old family friend? Is he here?\n\n47:53.200 --> 47:57.200\nOkay, not old. I mean, his relationship with our show is old.\n\n47:57.200 --> 47:58.200\nWhat do we got?\n\n47:58.200 --> 48:02.200\nCurtis Armstrong's down!\n\n48:02.200 --> 48:06.200\nCurtis Armstrong brought to you by Honda.\n\n48:06.200 --> 48:10.200\nDorito Armstrong!\n\n48:10.200 --> 48:12.200\nNo, you can stay there.\n\n48:25.200 --> 48:26.200\nThank you!\n\n48:26.200 --> 48:27.200\nCurtis, hello.\n\n48:27.200 --> 48:29.200\nNice to be here.\n\n48:29.200 --> 48:32.200\nCurtis, what did I do to deserve a nice yellow tulip?\n\n48:32.200 --> 48:34.200\nWell, I'll tell you.\n\n48:34.200 --> 48:39.200\nWhen somebody kisses your balls,\n\n48:39.200 --> 48:42.200\nthe way you did me,\n\n48:42.200 --> 48:45.200\nyou go out and you buy them a nice gift.\n\n48:45.200 --> 48:49.200\nYou see, ladies, is it that hard?\n\n48:49.200 --> 48:52.200\nWe learned a little bit from Curtis Armstrong.\n\n48:52.200 --> 48:54.200\nIt had never happened to me before,\n\n48:54.200 --> 48:58.200\nand I've been thinking about it all week.\n\n48:58.200 --> 49:02.200\nSo, today on my way here, I stopped to get you a tulip.\n\n49:02.200 --> 49:05.200\nWell, that's lovely. Tulips are among my favorite flowers, Curtis.\n\n49:05.200 --> 49:06.200\nThey're among your favorite flowers?\n\n49:06.200 --> 49:07.200\nYes.\n\n49:07.200 --> 49:10.200\nYour romance, I think you said you were going to come with your wife tonight, right?\n\n49:10.200 --> 49:11.200\nI was going to.\n\n49:11.200 --> 49:12.200\nYour wife?\n\n49:12.200 --> 49:13.200\nShe didn't come.\n\n49:13.200 --> 49:17.200\nI've always been meaning to ask you about your love life.\n\n49:17.200 --> 49:20.200\nYou're married.\n\n49:20.200 --> 49:23.200\nI'm married for 22 years.\n\n49:23.200 --> 49:28.200\nDo you have kids or anything?\n\n49:28.200 --> 49:31.200\nWe have one child, a girl who's 19.\n\n49:31.200 --> 49:33.200\nDid you poop her out?\n\n49:33.200 --> 49:34.200\nYou say 19?\n\n49:34.200 --> 49:35.200\nI didn't.\n\n49:35.200 --> 49:37.200\nI was present for it.\n\n49:37.200 --> 49:38.200\nWere you there physically?\n\n49:38.200 --> 49:39.200\nDid you watch the whole?\n\n49:39.200 --> 49:40.200\nI was there physically.\n\n49:40.200 --> 49:41.200\nYou saw the whole flimflap?\n\n49:41.200 --> 49:42.200\nThe whole thing.\n\n49:42.200 --> 49:47.200\nI was even in the hazmat suit that you have to wear during the process.\n\n49:47.200 --> 49:48.200\nYou were right there.\n\n49:48.200 --> 49:49.200\nYou were there with the boots.\n\n49:49.200 --> 49:53.200\nHey, in all seriousness, when you were there watching the baby come out,\n\n49:53.200 --> 49:55.200\ndid it change your sex life afterwards?\n\n49:55.200 --> 49:57.200\nNo, it didn't change my...\n\n49:57.200 --> 49:59.200\nI mean, we didn't have much of a sex life before then,\n\n49:59.200 --> 50:01.200\nso it didn't change that much.\n\n50:01.200 --> 50:02.200\nYou had some?\n\n50:02.200 --> 50:04.200\nWe had some.\n\n50:04.200 --> 50:06.200\nDid it get better?\n\n50:06.200 --> 50:08.200\nYeah, it actually, I think, it did, actually.\n\n50:08.200 --> 50:10.200\nBecause you were like, come on, anything goes down there.\n\n50:10.200 --> 50:12.200\nNo, yeah.\n\n50:12.200 --> 50:14.200\nHot dog in a hallway.\n\n50:14.200 --> 50:16.200\nThere was a...\n\n50:16.200 --> 50:19.200\nThe doctor was doing the process,\n\n50:19.200 --> 50:23.200\nand it was one of those moments that as a father,\n\n50:23.200 --> 50:26.200\nand you're going through this, many of you will go through this.\n\n50:26.200 --> 50:28.200\nMany of you may have.\n\n50:28.200 --> 50:29.200\nAll of you will go through this.\n\n50:29.200 --> 50:30.200\nMore of you than should.\n\n50:30.200 --> 50:31.200\nNo, not all of you.\n\n50:31.200 --> 50:32.200\n8 billion of us.\n\n50:32.200 --> 50:35.200\nAnd every one of you will go through it.\n\n50:35.200 --> 50:37.200\nFor God's sakes, will you adopt a China person?\n\n50:37.200 --> 50:38.200\nYeah.\n\n50:38.200 --> 50:40.200\nMany people may.\n\n50:40.200 --> 50:42.200\nWill marry a Chinese girl and go through...\n\n50:42.200 --> 50:44.200\nWhat we went through.\n\n50:44.200 --> 50:48.200\nAnd what I remember most vividly from this moment\n\n50:48.200 --> 50:51.200\nwas the moment where I was standing there watching\n\n50:51.200 --> 50:54.200\nand the doctors there ready to receive,\n\n50:54.200 --> 50:59.200\nand suddenly this thing started to appear.\n\n50:59.200 --> 51:02.200\nAnd I said, oh honey!\n\n51:02.200 --> 51:04.200\nI see her!\n\n51:04.200 --> 51:05.200\nShe's coming!\n\n51:05.200 --> 51:09.200\nAnd the doctor said, that's a hemorrhoid.\n\n51:09.200 --> 51:15.200\nAnd we had another nine hours of labor to go.\n\n51:15.200 --> 51:17.200\nAnd the hemorrhoid came out and was coming.\n\n51:17.200 --> 51:20.200\nThe hemorrhoid was like, oh, come on.\n\n51:20.200 --> 51:21.200\nYou're like the worst...\n\n51:21.200 --> 51:23.200\nThat changes you.\n\n51:23.200 --> 51:25.200\nThat changes you.\n\n51:25.200 --> 51:27.200\nBecause you think...\n\n51:27.200 --> 51:29.200\nThe hemorrhoid was so...\n\n51:29.200 --> 51:30.200\nWrong direction.\n\n51:30.200 --> 51:31.200\nWell, you know what I mean?\n\n51:31.200 --> 51:32.200\nFor a moment...\n\n51:32.200 --> 51:33.200\nChoke guy.\n\n51:33.200 --> 51:34.200\nNo, I was...\n\n51:34.200 --> 51:35.200\nI mean...\n\n51:35.200 --> 51:38.200\nSo are there vaginal hemorrhoids?\n\n51:38.200 --> 51:53.200\nThis segment brought to you by Dorito.\n\n51:53.200 --> 51:55.200\nYou got questions.\n\n51:55.200 --> 51:57.200\nDorito's here to snap into them.\n\n51:57.200 --> 52:01.200\nCrispy, crispy, inanimate old questions.\n\n52:01.200 --> 52:02.200\nAll right.\n\n52:02.200 --> 52:03.200\nThank you.\n\n52:03.200 --> 52:04.200\nThere was a hemorrhoid...\n\n52:04.200 --> 52:06.200\nI mean, hemorrhoids are in your butt.\n\n52:06.200 --> 52:09.200\nI mean, I was actually looking for something that wasn't there yet.\n\n52:09.200 --> 52:11.200\nAnd I saw what I thought it was.\n\n52:11.200 --> 52:12.200\nIt was like an illusion.\n\n52:12.200 --> 52:13.200\nIt was an illusion.\n\n52:13.200 --> 52:14.200\nIt was me.\n\n52:14.200 --> 52:15.200\nYou were projecting.\n\n52:15.200 --> 52:16.200\nYou were projecting into her butt.\n\n52:16.200 --> 52:17.200\nI was projecting.\n\n52:17.200 --> 52:19.200\nBut it did change me, though.\n\n52:19.200 --> 52:20.200\nI mean...\n\n52:20.200 --> 52:22.200\nYour story just changed me.\n\n52:22.200 --> 52:23.200\nYeah.\n\n52:23.200 --> 52:25.200\nSo you have one 19-year-old...\n\n52:25.200 --> 52:26.200\nI have one 19...\n\n52:26.200 --> 52:28.200\nWonderful 19-year-old who's...\n\n52:28.200 --> 52:31.200\nWhat has that been like from year one to year 19?\n\n52:31.200 --> 52:32.200\nTake us through it.\n\n52:32.200 --> 52:33.200\nFrom what?\n\n52:33.200 --> 52:35.200\nI mean, you only have one.\n\n52:35.200 --> 52:36.200\nThat's the fast version.\n\n52:36.200 --> 52:38.200\nThat's kind of unusual.\n\n52:38.200 --> 52:39.200\nYeah, I guess so.\n\n52:39.200 --> 52:40.200\nYeah, it was great.\n\n52:40.200 --> 52:41.200\nEverything has been...\n\n52:41.200 --> 52:43.200\nShe is so astonishing.\n\n52:43.200 --> 52:45.200\nAnd she lives in London.\n\n52:45.200 --> 52:47.200\nAnd she's studying psycholinguistics.\n\n52:47.200 --> 52:48.200\nJesus.\n\n52:48.200 --> 52:49.200\nAnd she...\n\n52:49.200 --> 52:52.200\nAnd she lives in London.\n\n52:52.200 --> 52:57.200\nI'm so glad I met you.\n\n52:57.200 --> 53:00.200\nThought I had a chance.\n\n53:00.200 --> 53:03.200\nBut she lives in London.\n\n53:03.200 --> 53:04.200\nShe'll be back, though.\n\n53:04.200 --> 53:05.200\nOh.\n\n53:08.200 --> 53:09.200\nI love Curtis.\n\n53:09.200 --> 53:11.200\nI'm meeting all of our friends.\n\n53:11.200 --> 53:13.200\nI guess that's great.\n\n53:13.200 --> 53:16.200\nAnd she's not involved.\n\n53:16.200 --> 53:17.200\nOh, nice.\n\n53:17.200 --> 53:18.200\nYou are kind of, though, right?\n\n53:18.200 --> 53:19.200\nPolitics?\n\n53:19.200 --> 53:20.200\nNo, yeah.\n\n53:20.200 --> 53:23.200\nNo, don't turn him under your daughter.\n\n53:23.200 --> 53:25.200\nNo, I wouldn't really.\n\n53:25.200 --> 53:27.200\nI wouldn't either, god damn it.\n\n53:27.200 --> 53:28.200\nWho am I?\n\n53:28.200 --> 53:29.200\nNo, if you were in my shoes,\n\n53:29.200 --> 53:32.200\nyou wouldn't introduce you to...\n\n53:32.200 --> 53:34.200\nMy daughter, either.\n\n53:34.200 --> 53:35.200\nRight.\n\n53:35.200 --> 53:36.200\nSo anyway, there she is.\n\n53:36.200 --> 53:37.200\nAnd she's doing...\n\n53:37.200 --> 53:38.200\nShe's working.\n\n53:38.200 --> 53:39.200\nAnd she's...\n\n53:39.200 --> 53:41.200\nIs your wife British?\n\n53:41.200 --> 53:42.200\nNo, no, no.\n\n53:42.200 --> 53:43.200\nShe just...\n\n53:43.200 --> 53:44.200\nShe was over there doing...\n\n53:44.200 --> 53:46.200\nYou know a magazine called Mojo Magazine?\n\n53:46.200 --> 53:47.200\nMusic Magazine?\n\n53:47.200 --> 53:48.200\nYou know that?\n\n53:48.200 --> 53:51.200\nSo she was doing an internship there last summer.\n\n53:51.200 --> 53:53.200\nAnd she was going to go to NYU.\n\n53:53.200 --> 53:57.200\nShe wound up hearing that King's College had a great program.\n\n53:57.200 --> 53:59.200\nSo she applied and they took her.\n\n53:59.200 --> 54:00.200\nPsycholinguistics.\n\n54:00.200 --> 54:02.200\nThat's not so groovy.\n\n54:02.200 --> 54:03.200\nDid I say psycho?\n\n54:03.200 --> 54:05.200\nI think you said psycho maybe.\n\n54:05.200 --> 54:07.200\nI think it's just the company.\n\n54:13.200 --> 54:16.200\n19 year old daughter.\n\n54:18.200 --> 54:20.200\nPsycholinguistics.\n\n54:20.200 --> 54:21.200\nI know.\n\n54:21.200 --> 54:23.200\nHigh apacea, Armstrong.\n\n54:23.200 --> 54:24.200\nI would never do that.\n\n54:24.200 --> 54:25.200\nHigh apacea?\n\n54:25.200 --> 54:27.200\nI would never make a joke like that.\n\n54:27.200 --> 54:29.200\nYou just did make a joke.\n\n54:29.200 --> 54:31.200\nI would never in my life.\n\n54:31.200 --> 54:34.200\nYou made a joke exactly like that.\n\n54:34.200 --> 54:40.200\nBut you're deceived because I would never make a joke like that.\n\n54:40.200 --> 54:41.200\nMy mistake.\n\n54:41.200 --> 54:42.200\nI stand corrected.\n\n54:42.200 --> 54:43.200\nYou know what?\n\n54:43.200 --> 54:44.200\nIt's okay.\n\n54:44.200 --> 54:46.200\nWe're going to get through this.\n\n54:46.200 --> 54:47.200\nAnyone?\n\n54:47.200 --> 54:48.200\nAnyone?\n\n54:48.200 --> 54:49.200\nIt's 9-Eleven.\n\n54:49.200 --> 54:50.200\n9-Eleven.\n\n54:50.200 --> 54:54.200\nWe have some sociolinguistic people here.\n\n54:54.200 --> 54:55.200\nI misspoke.\n\n54:55.200 --> 54:58.200\nI meant sociolinguistics, which is a whole other branch.\n\n54:58.200 --> 55:00.200\nShe's sociolinguistics.\n\n55:00.200 --> 55:02.200\nYou misspoke with psycholinguistics.\n\n55:02.200 --> 55:04.200\nYes, I was thinking of something else.\n\n55:04.200 --> 55:05.200\nSociolinguistics means what?\n\n55:05.200 --> 55:07.200\nI don't know what that means.\n\n55:07.200 --> 55:09.200\nI know what sociolinguistics means.\n\n55:09.200 --> 55:12.200\nIt sounds like a form of verbal anthropology.\n\n55:12.200 --> 55:14.200\nIt is kind of that.\n\n55:14.200 --> 55:16.200\nIt's the structure of language.\n\n55:16.200 --> 55:19.200\nI could be more fascinated with that.\n\n55:19.200 --> 55:22.200\nMy friendship with Jeff is kind of based on Noam Chomsky\n\n55:22.200 --> 55:25.200\nbecause he was a political dissident and a linguist.\n\n55:25.200 --> 55:30.200\nWhen I met Jeff, it was the 90s and we were both a couple of young,\n\n55:30.200 --> 55:32.200\nfull of piss and vinegar.\n\n55:32.200 --> 55:35.200\nI only knew Noam Chomsky because of his linguistic work.\n\n55:35.200 --> 55:39.200\nJeff had read all this crazy political shit that he had written.\n\n55:39.200 --> 55:42.200\nI didn't even know about his political outspokenness.\n\n55:42.200 --> 55:46.200\nI'm a verbal thinker.\n\n55:46.200 --> 55:48.200\nI'm very fascinated with language.\n\n55:48.200 --> 55:51.200\nIt's something that she got from high school.\n\n55:51.200 --> 55:53.200\nShe became interested in it.\n\n55:53.200 --> 55:57.200\nHer senior year in high school, half of her day was spent in high school.\n\n55:57.200 --> 56:01.200\nHalf of it was at LACC studying sociolinguistics.\n\n56:01.200 --> 56:03.200\nLACC? What college?\n\n56:03.200 --> 56:05.200\nThat's L.A. Community College.\n\n56:05.200 --> 56:06.200\nIn Hollywood?\n\n56:06.200 --> 56:08.200\nWas she in a dorm?\n\n56:08.200 --> 56:10.200\nNo. Nobody's in a dorm.\n\n56:10.200 --> 56:15.200\nI saw that movie with Seth Rogen.\n\n56:15.200 --> 56:18.200\nThe crazy dorm movie.\n\n56:18.200 --> 56:20.200\nAnyone? Am I the only one?\n\n56:20.200 --> 56:22.200\nAm I the only human being in the world?\n\n56:22.200 --> 56:24.200\nIt's ever seen.\n\n56:24.200 --> 56:26.200\nI'm sorry.\n\n56:26.200 --> 56:29.200\nSome things that fascinated me about linguistics in no necessary order.\n\n56:29.200 --> 56:31.200\nI'm just going to shotgun them all.\n\n56:31.200 --> 56:34.200\nBreathe deeply and you'll come out of this in no time.\n\n56:34.200 --> 56:36.200\nHelp me. Help.\n\n56:36.200 --> 56:40.200\nNumber one is that when people have kids, they always tell you at two years old,\n\n56:40.200 --> 56:43.200\nthe kid just starts fucking talking.\n\n56:43.200 --> 56:48.200\nAnd we all have this instinctive baby talk thing that we do,\n\n56:48.200 --> 56:52.200\nwhich is another thing that's fascinating because people write different books and go,\n\n56:52.200 --> 56:54.200\ndon't baby talk, do baby talk.\n\n56:54.200 --> 56:56.200\nIt's fucking instinctive.\n\n56:56.200 --> 56:58.200\nYou do it to dogs.\n\n56:58.200 --> 57:00.200\nWhen you look at something cute, you kind of like,\n\n57:00.200 --> 57:02.200\noh, you, who is that?\n\n57:02.200 --> 57:06.200\nAnd what you're doing is I think you're making, you're showing it, you're trying.\n\n57:06.200 --> 57:08.200\nExcept I never did that with her.\n\n57:08.200 --> 57:09.200\nI never did that with her.\n\n57:09.200 --> 57:11.200\nWell, now she's in London.\n\n57:11.200 --> 57:13.200\nI mean, now I definitely wouldn't do it with her,\n\n57:13.200 --> 57:15.200\nbut I didn't do it with her when she was...\n\n57:15.200 --> 57:19.200\nGet her on the phone and let's have him do it to her tonight on the show.\n\n57:19.200 --> 57:20.200\nFor the first time ever.\n\n57:20.200 --> 57:23.200\nYou raised your daughter so coldly she had to move to England just to fit in.\n\n57:23.200 --> 57:25.200\nThat's right. Exactly.\n\n57:25.200 --> 57:27.200\nThat's exactly right.\n\n57:27.200 --> 57:29.200\nYou have to baby talk him.\n\n57:29.200 --> 57:31.200\nI didn't. I made that mistake.\n\n57:31.200 --> 57:33.200\nBut it actually turned out okay.\n\n57:33.200 --> 57:36.200\nBecause then suddenly she didn't talk for a long time.\n\n57:36.200 --> 57:38.200\nAnd then suddenly she just started talking like...\n\n57:38.200 --> 57:40.200\nThey just one day they just...\n\n57:40.200 --> 57:43.200\nEvery parent I've ever talked to says like, look, you do what you do.\n\n57:43.200 --> 57:45.200\nYou hope your kid will talk.\n\n57:45.200 --> 57:47.200\nThat's exactly right.\n\n57:47.200 --> 57:51.200\nAnd then one day you come home and you just hear a voice from the corner of the room\n\n57:51.200 --> 57:53.200\ngo like, you want fries with that?\n\n57:53.200 --> 57:54.200\nYeah, exactly.\n\n57:54.200 --> 57:55.200\nWhat the fuck?\n\n57:55.200 --> 57:57.200\nShit in the hell?\n\n57:57.200 --> 57:58.200\nThat's exactly right.\n\n57:58.200 --> 57:59.200\nMy niece lives...\n\n57:59.200 --> 58:01.200\nMy brother and his wife live nearby.\n\n58:01.200 --> 58:02.200\nThey live in Eagle Rock.\n\n58:02.200 --> 58:04.200\nOr the time was Glendale.\n\n58:04.200 --> 58:06.200\nAnd my niece didn't talk.\n\n58:06.200 --> 58:07.200\nAnd then one day...\n\n58:07.200 --> 58:09.200\nI didn't go to their house for a couple months.\n\n58:09.200 --> 58:12.200\nI went to the house and my niece is like...\n\n58:12.200 --> 58:13.200\nShe's got out of the bath.\n\n58:13.200 --> 58:14.200\nAnd she was going...\n\n58:14.200 --> 58:15.200\nShake, shake, shake.\n\n58:15.200 --> 58:16.200\nShake, shake, shake.\n\n58:16.200 --> 58:17.200\nShake your booty.\n\n58:17.200 --> 58:18.200\nWhat the fuck?\n\n58:18.200 --> 58:21.200\nLike last time I saw you, you didn't say things.\n\n58:21.200 --> 58:22.200\nBut now you're singing.\n\n58:22.200 --> 58:24.200\nThe way that they inflect when they're doing their...\n\n58:24.200 --> 58:30.200\nAt the young age when they start doing their impressions of how they see adult communication.\n\n58:30.200 --> 58:31.200\nYou punch them in the face.\n\n58:31.200 --> 58:34.200\nThis six-year-old girl who like leans up in the doorway and goes,\n\n58:34.200 --> 58:36.200\nwhy don't you come up and see me sometime.\n\n58:36.200 --> 58:39.200\nThey do weird shit.\n\n58:39.200 --> 58:41.200\nAnd you have these like anecdotes of like,\n\n58:41.200 --> 58:44.200\noh god, when you were a kid, you did this thing at the party.\n\n58:44.200 --> 58:45.200\nIt was so funny.\n\n58:45.200 --> 58:46.200\nAnd it was...\n\n58:46.200 --> 58:52.200\nBut it's because they're more capable of doing like clearer impressions of adult communication\n\n58:52.200 --> 58:56.200\nthan we are as adults because we actually learn the meaning of life.\n\n58:56.200 --> 59:00.200\nAnd they're actually just full bore like trying...\n\n59:00.200 --> 59:03.200\nThey're doing the equivalent of a parrot or...\n\n59:03.200 --> 59:05.200\nBut beyond a parrot because they're not just making noise.\n\n59:05.200 --> 59:06.200\nThey're...\n\n59:06.200 --> 59:07.200\nThey're smarter than parrots.\n\n59:07.200 --> 59:11.200\nThey're intuiting and also like they're actually communicating more effectively.\n\n59:11.200 --> 59:14.200\nAnd you just get these chills down your spine.\n\n59:14.200 --> 59:19.200\nThese kids like they roll their eyes at you and they make it very clear they're over you.\n\n59:19.200 --> 59:24.200\nAnd like they intone things just perfectly to...\n\n59:24.200 --> 59:26.200\nAnd you're like, wait, what the fuck are you...\n\n59:26.200 --> 59:27.200\nWhy are you...\n\n59:27.200 --> 59:31.200\nYou need to be 32 before you have those feelings about crayons.\n\n59:31.200 --> 59:36.200\nWhat do you mean you've had it up to here with these crayons?\n\n59:36.200 --> 59:40.200\nYou said it like Willy Loman.\n\n59:40.200 --> 59:43.200\nThat is so true.\n\n59:43.200 --> 59:44.200\nBut that's the...\n\n59:44.200 --> 59:45.200\nLet me tell you a guess.\n\n59:45.200 --> 59:50.200\nThe amazing thing to me is that verbal communication for us is biological.\n\n59:50.200 --> 59:53.200\nVerbal communication we've all seen now with Jody Foster.\n\n59:53.200 --> 59:56.200\nVerbal communication would happen in a vacuum.\n\n59:56.200 --> 59:57.200\nThat would...\n\n59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.200\nIf you were raised by wolves as a human being you would teach language to the wolves.\n\n01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.200\nYou would start to adopt the wolf language. People speak.\n\n01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.200\nThat's what we do.\n\n01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.200\nWe speak verbally.\n\n01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.200\nBut what we don't do naturally is written language.\n\n01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.200\nWhich is what our entire society is based on.\n\n01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:24.200\nIs the secondary unnatural mimetic evolution of language as transcribable thing.\n\n01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:29.200\nWe think because when we're kids we're learning to speak and write at the same time.\n\n01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.200\nAnd we're learning to read.\n\n01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.200\nWhich means interacting with written language and making it come out of our mouths.\n\n01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:43.200\nWe grow up feeling like verbal language is somehow secondary.\n\n01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.200\nThat written language is like this really important thing.\n\n01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.200\nIt's sort of like this dumb thing that would go away in one nuclear blast.\n\n01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:56.200\nBut verbal language is like here to stay so much so that if you walk 30 yards that way.\n\n01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.200\nPeople are going goop-a-goop-a-goop-a-goop-a-goop.\n\n01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.200\nAnd you can't understand what the hell they're saying.\n\n01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:08.200\nBecause humans actually just naturally hold our breath and use our forebrain and flex it.\n\n01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.200\nAnd go like express shit.\n\n01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.200\nAnd we use it to geolocate and we use it to socially interact.\n\n01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.200\nIt lost me man.\n\n01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.200\nI was hanging on for a while.\n\n01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.200\nI'm going to go to London and I'm going to enroll in your daughter's class.\n\n01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:31.200\nI'm telling you that you're the first person I've met who actually sounds like my daughter.\n\n01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.200\nThat's like talking to my daughter.\n\n01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.200\nAnd I don't understand her any more than I do you.\n\n01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.200\nCan you introduce him to your daughter?\n\n01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.200\nI would love to sit in the room and just watch them.\n\n01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.200\nI would love that.\n\n01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.200\nBut you should bring her by.\n\n01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:49.200\nI'll tell you, you're very lucky because I've been here what four times is my fourth time.\n\n01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.200\nI've never mentioned my daughter.\n\n01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.200\nBecause if I do, I'll go on.\n\n01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.200\nWell, it's because I'm a bad person.\n\n01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.200\nI don't think I've even asked you if you were married for the first three times.\n\n01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.200\nUntil now actually.\n\n01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:07.200\nBut also, I grew up in the 80s when it's like, well, what if you were married to a goat?\n\n01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.200\nWhat if that was your own business?\n\n01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200\nThat'd be really great.\n\n01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.200\nIf he was married to a goat.\n\n01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.200\nI would love that.\n\n01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.200\nI mean, I would respect it and understand it.\n\n01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.200\nWhat would be so good about it?\n\n01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.200\nI mean, it would be awesome.\n\n01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.200\nI'd be like, wow, tell me about that.\n\n01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.200\nAnd also, I'm totally cool with it.\n\n01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.200\nBecause I'm a libertarian.\n\n01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.200\nAnd everybody is...\n\n01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.200\nThe libertarians love...\n\n01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.200\nThey love people that fuck goats.\n\n01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.200\nThey love to let it all hang out.\n\n01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.200\nIf you're happy, fuck a goat.\n\n01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.200\nCan I charge you to fuck a goat?\n\n01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.200\nAnd I wouldn't have judged you for it.\n\n01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.200\nI would have been like, that's cool.\n\n01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.200\nTell me about it.\n\n01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.200\nThat's interesting.\n\n01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.200\nWhy weren't you as interested when he was just married to a human woman?\n\n01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.200\nBecause who isn't?\n\n01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.200\nYou go to fucking Subway.\n\n01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.200\nYou go to fucking Starbucks.\n\n01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.200\nThere's a bunch of married people.\n\n01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.200\nAnd all the public places in between.\n\n01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.200\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.200\nRouse, Vons.\n\n01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.200\nFrom Starbucks to Subway.\n\n01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.200\nI'm Justin Reiland, taking you on a tour of America.\n\n01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.200\nBBC Two.\n\n01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.200\nFrom paper cups with one logo on them\n\n01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.200\nto paper cups with another logo.\n\n01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.200\nThese are the four Micah tables\n\n01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.200\nfrom restaurant to restaurant\n\n01:03:22.200 -->

front like okay so magic people weren't\n\n01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.480\ngetting stopped at the front right so actually people with magic abilities\n\n01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:10.080\nshould go in the front take out these motherfuckers people who have hardware\n\n01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:13.960\nshould go in the back because every time someone with guns goes on the front\n\n01:39:13.960 -->
