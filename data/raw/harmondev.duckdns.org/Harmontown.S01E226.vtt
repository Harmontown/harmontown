02:35.000\nYou know what they call them?\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:36.000\nThey call them Sydney Siders.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:37.000\nDid you know that?\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:40.000\nThat's what they call people from Sydney.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:41.000\nSydney Siders?\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:42.000\nSydney Siders.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nOh, like on the side of Sydney.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:46.000\nCause I...\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:47.000\nWhat?\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:49.000\nNow, let's talk about your...\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nLet's talk about your new...\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:52.000\nyour new lip there, man.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:53.000\nI like it a lot.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nIs that a proper Acubra or whatever they call it?\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nIt was an authentic Acubra.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:02.000\nI got it in the store next to the hotel.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:08.000\nThere were rabbits drying on the rack and there were six of them that went into this one,\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:10.000\nso I know it's authentic.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nDid they have boomerangs there?\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nYeah, but they were mounted.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:15.000\nOh.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\nSo it's like...\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:17.000\nYou couldn't hurt people with them.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nYeah, they're like...\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:19.000\nYeah, it's easily...\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.000\nLike to put on your desk.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:21.000\nRight.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:24.000\nLike the buck stops here, but then it...\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:28.000\nThen it goes away and then it comes back again.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:33.000\nYeah, so we're here at the Sydney Opera House, the historic Sydney Opera House.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.000\nI, you know, I do not feel bad about this.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:41.000\nI'm very happy to be here, but I will say I was narcissistic and naive enough to believe\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nwhen they said come to a show at the Sydney Opera House.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nI thought...\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:49.000\nI didn't know they had other rooms.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nYeah.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:55.000\nIt makes perfect sense now, and I love you guys.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:56.000\nYou're amazing.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:03.000\nI'm not going to punish you, but I did fly out here with a different image in my head.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:04.000\nOne that makes no sense.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nNo sense.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nThe fact that not only could we fill the Sydney Opera House, but two nights.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:10.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:11.000\nThey're like, you saw that?\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nThey want to do a second show at the Sydney.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nReally?\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nOh, bring it on.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nI guess it's just cultural efficacy.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nThey must be bored down there.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nI don't know.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nYeah, I'm not being aloof.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nI'm just looking at my notes.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nAre those authentic crocodile teeth in the brim of that hat?\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nThey're teeth.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nI mean, I don't know, man.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nIt's a $65 hat.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:36.000\nThat's all I know.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\n$65 Australian dollars.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nAre they dollars or are they called boomos?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:41.000\nDollary.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nI think they're called dollary dudes.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nYeah.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:49.000\nYeah, so you were about to say a guy at the Melbourne show.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:55.000\nYeah, because we kicked off in Brisbane a couple nights ago, and shit went wild.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nThat crowd was raucous, to say the least.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nThey were just fighting with each other.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nThey were just booing each other.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nThey were having focus groups in the back?\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:04.000\nYeah.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nPeople were just saying, like, oh, that was a good joke.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nWhat did you think of that joke?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nIt was okay.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:11.000\nLet's listen to the next joke.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:13.000\nI'd rather discuss this joke.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nYou're from Ipswich?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nFuck you!\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nBut they were awesome.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nI was more entertained by them than I think they were of us.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:27.000\nBut then last night in Melbourne, it was a theater, like a proper nice old theater.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nSo it was less like a rock concert than the Brisbane show.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:34.000\nBut everybody had a thousand beers.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nAnd there were two hecklers.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nOne guy just kept going, bang orang from the back.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nWhich isn't even an Australian thing.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nIt's a Spielberg thing.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nBang orang.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nThat's not Australian.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nSo, and then there was a guy up front.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\nWe were talking to a blind woman in the back, and he was heckling her.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nShe wasn't blind, right?\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nShe was going blind in ten years.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nBut still, he took a pretty hard line on her.\n\n05:58.000 --> 05:59.000\nYeah.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:00.000\nHe turned out to be right.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nHe turned out to be right.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:05.000\nYeah, he's like, yeah, shut up to the blind lady.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nShe wasn't blind, but yeah.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:08.000\nBut then, so there was a guy.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nWe ran into somebody after the show at a bar.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nAnd he said, because the guy in the bang orang guy up in the balcony.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nWe were sitting behind him.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nAnd he had his shoe off at one point.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nHe was like waving his shoe.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nAnd then they had washed him, drank eleven beers.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nAnd then he just looked at his shoe.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nAnd then filled his shoe with vomit.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:31.000\nSo now he's sitting there with a vomit filled shoe.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nAnd then he realized that he has to go clean his shoes.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nSo he just pours the vomit out?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nNo, no, he went outside.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nHe poured it on the sidewalk outside.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nAnd then he proceeded to get in a fight.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nAnd then we left and got food.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nAnd then we came back and I saw the very vomit he poured out.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nI didn't realize at the time that this was shoe man's vomit.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nBut I pieced it together afterwards.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nOh, was it on the sidewalk?\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:56.000\nYeah.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:57.000\nI saw that too, yeah.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nAnd we were like, that's weirdly fresh vomit.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:00.000\nYeah.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:01.000\nThat's why.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nWith little pieces of koala meat in there.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nRight, yeah.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nLittle chlamydia koala meat.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nThat was a Sydney Siders vomit.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nNo, it was a Melbourneian.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nI think he was from Ipswich.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:21.000\nBut yeah, no, both great cities, both in their own different way.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nMelbourne was like the hipster city.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nAnd Brisbane was like Gremlins 2.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:37.000\nOh, we got, I think, I think Brisbane is Sydney's Ipswich.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nThis is starting to make sense.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nI'm from the Midwestern United States.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nEverybody always has to have a community.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nLike when you're from Milwaukee, you have to pick on Kutahoe.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:55.000\nIt's just like a town of 200 people where they, where they, where all the tanning factories are.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nSo it smells like poop when you drive past it.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:02.000\nPeople in Milwaukee love picking on Kutahoe because it's like shit rolls downhill.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:10.000\nSo, but, but Sydney is the multicultural capital of, you know, I mean, even the world, let alone Australia, this is the first place.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nThis is the first European settlement.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:15.000\nThis is where they first opened the prison colony for business.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nThey were like, this is the place.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nLet's send them.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:22.000\nAnd then in the 19th century, they said, okay, you're not prisoners anymore.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nNow you can try to build a society.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:29.000\nAnd the Aborigines were like, what about us for 30,000 years?\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nAnd then the beds are burning video.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nAnd then everything's fine.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nEverything's fine now.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:38.000\nOh, well, yeah, don't die.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:44.000\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:49.000\nYou're my knight in shining armor, you old poop.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:54.000\nI always thought that guy sounded a lot like Catherine Hepburn.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:58.000\nHow can we sleep when our golden pond is burning?\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nYou old poop.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nYou had him with Gremlins too.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nYou lost him with our golden pond.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nNo, but not all the Hepburn fans here.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nMaybe that's why you like this, that song so much.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nLike, like they were like, this sounds really original.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:19.000\nI'm like, that's, that's, that's, that's bringing up baby.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nYeah, no, but it's beautiful here.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nIt's beautiful Melbourne, beautiful here.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nWe're actually going to be here for a little while.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nWe're extending our vacation and then I'm off to Fiji.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:32.000\nBut when we first, when we landed in the airplane,\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:37.000\nwe got into the, we went from the airplane to the, to the, to the baggage claim.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nWe got into the shuttle and the first thing Spencer said,\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:46.000\nhaving taken in that much of Australia was, hot Canada.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:54.000\nIn a good way, just to be clear, in a good way.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nAnd I think there might have been a little pejorative.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nLike, I think it was just at that point, it was like, okay, it's hot.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:03.000\nAlso, yeah, I mean, we've flown over and landed in much drier areas,\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:06.000\nbut that area specifically was very green, very hilly,\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nvery much like Canada in the summer.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nIt was great.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nAlso the architecture to me is very reminiscent of Canada\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:16.000\nand that it's just very, like, interesting and, and I don't know,\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nyou know, all the buildings look the same.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nBut this is only the second country you've ever visited outside of the state.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nSo if you went to Thailand, you'd just go Asia, Canada.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:32.000\nIt's like, no, if I go to Thailand, I'm like, it's like hot Australia.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:37.000\nIt's just, then I'll go to China, I'll be like, it's like big Thailand.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:42.000\nIt's like cold, Russia is like cold China.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:47.000\nThat's all, it's just the last place I've been to.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:51.000\nThere are 250 languages spoken here, which I'm sure is the case for any city\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:54.000\nabove a certain, you know, level of population.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nThere's like 5 million people living here.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\n250 languages.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nCome on, some of those are fake.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nAre there even 200?\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nThat's like, there's some, there's some fucking, like, Star Wars.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nLike, India's got like 49 of them, don't they?\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nYeah.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nI guess that's true.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:14.000\nYeah, you get into these old, these much old, ancient countries\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nand they have like 25,000 languages.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nYeah, you're right, you're right.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nPeople are weird.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:24.000\nI just, I get into town, I open up the first paragraph of Wikipedia\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:28.000\nand I buy a hat and I'm just, I'm gold.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nYou guys are very supportive.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nYou should be booing by now for sure.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:37.000\nGod knows in Brisbane, a bowling ball would have been a shot at me.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nI used to, I told them in Melbourne, I'll tell you again,\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:46.000\nif you ever see me announce a game of audience sound effects,\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nI'm in Brisbane.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nLike, I was like, it was not, again, it's not their fault.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nLike, it was my fault, like the energy I put into the room\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nand they were just wonderful people.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nIt, but I was just, yeah.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nWell, you obsessed about their language for a long time.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nI did, I was doing the whole accent thing.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:07.000\nOh, la-di-da, Dan's gonna do the fucking accent humor.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:10.000\nTo me, it wasn't like punching down.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nI was like, I was trying to learn because your accent is very, very difficult\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nfrom a dialectic standpoint.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nIt's hard to imitate.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:21.000\nBut I came up with the phrase that I, I've been, I've,\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nLet's chart your progress and see if you're getting better.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nThe phrase that I've landed on and it's again,\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nI know this isn't how you talk.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nThis is, this is the sentence that I say.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:36.000\nMy note, my note going into this is Dan, it's a little too tense.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nYeah, because I'm thinking too hard about each word,\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:42.000\nbut if I don't think about each word, I'll just sound like a chimney sweep.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:45.000\nYou know, if an American tries to do Australian,\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:50.000\nit's just like, he's gonna go right into Dick Van Dyke and Mary Poppins.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nBut there's nuance to it.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nIt's a playful, wonderful dialect.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nIt's, and it's, so I've been trying to learn it\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nbecause I want to be able to do it.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nSo I arrived at this phrase.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:06.000\nOh, okay.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:14.000\nI like that hat, mate.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nDon't encourage me.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nI, I think they're just applauding the payoff.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nThey're not, they're not saying,\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nOh my God, Joe, I think he's going.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:28.000\nNo, no one in Australia is ever that upset about it, anything.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:32.000\nAt least of all the guy who likes that hat, mate.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nBut it's just me trying to, I'm like each word,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:39.000\nI'm like, oh, I like that hat, mate.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nSo angry.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nHe's not angry though.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nYou're passing a stone.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nWell, remember the guy in the Energizer commercials?\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nOi, Jackie, what was his name?\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nJacko.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:49.000\nI'm dating myself.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nJacko.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nAll right.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nAll right.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nMoving on.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.000\nMoving on.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\nWe're all human beings.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nIs that one of your notes?\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nYeah.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nNo.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nThis is a daily reminder.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nAll right.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nSo, well, I want to ask you a question.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nOkay.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nSo, those hotel safes, do those even work?\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nLike, like, like, I mean, they're fun for us.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nLike we like the idea that we're locking something in those safes.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:17.000\nBut if you're the kind of person that finds themselves in a hotel room\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nthat doesn't belong to you, which rules out most of us,\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nlike there's no cat burglars in this room.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nOr like, like, or, or inside job hotel,\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nlike two larsonists, you know, like,\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:30.000\nthose people know how to crack one of those fucking safes.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nYeah, because if you forget your code,\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nsomebody there knows how to get into that safe.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nYeah.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nAnd also there's a YouTube videos of the guy,\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nof a guy cracking those safes.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nAnd there's also a YouTube video of a,\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:46.000\nof a spider dragging a mouse up the side of a refrigerator.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nBut we're not going to talk about that.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nI'm going to pretend we're in a safe place,\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:54.000\neven though I'm covered, I'm riddled with bites already.\n\n14:54.000 --> 15:01.920\ngot me. It was a huntsman. I know a huntsman was on me. There's people that come up like\n\n15:01.920 --> 15:05.940\nbehind you at the supermarket and like when you type in your like if you're paying with\n\n15:05.940 --> 15:10.560\na credit card or a debit card or if you type in your code, there's people that have a heat\n\n15:10.560 --> 15:15.760\nsensing like app on their phone or a little add-on to their to their camera phone and\n\n15:15.760 --> 15:19.240\nit reads the numbers because you can still see the heat signature from the ones that\n\n15:19.240 --> 15:22.520\nyou push. Oh jeez. I thought you were gonna, I thought you were talking about spider detectors\n\n15:22.520 --> 15:25.520\nor something. I thought you were saying there's just people in Australia. This is how bad\n\n15:25.520 --> 15:30.400\nthe spider problem is. They have an app for that. Like you can see spider tracks across\n\n15:30.400 --> 15:38.200\nyour dashboard. Yeah. But we were, we were, I think we were in Brisbane and I was head\n\n15:38.200 --> 15:41.760\nlong into my spider anxieties and someone said there hasn't been a spider related death\n\n15:41.760 --> 15:46.280\nin Australia in 30 years and I was like, you know, a normal continent wouldn't have to\n\n15:46.280 --> 15:53.280\nsay that. No one says that in North America. No one says that. And we shoot each other\n\n15:53.280 --> 15:57.760\nevery day. I was reading the, there hasn't been a mass shooting in the United States\n\n15:57.760 --> 16:07.320\nin three weeks. I was reading the mass meeting more than eight. Look, I mean, yeah, exactly.\n\n16:07.320 --> 16:14.240\nThat's what I'm saying. You start, when the arithmetic comes in, you're hiding something.\n\n16:14.240 --> 16:18.440\nI'm saying like there's been gerrymandering or something going on as you guys redefine\n\n16:18.440 --> 16:23.240\nspider related death. That's all I'm saying. I'm not accusing you of anything. I just\n\n16:23.240 --> 16:27.240\nknow I see these videos. There's a lot of spiders down here and it's the ones you can't\n\n16:27.240 --> 16:34.920\nsee that kill you. You have ones the size of apes that, that can just put you to sleep\n\n16:34.920 --> 16:44.840\nfor an afternoon. And they'll go in your kitchen and make mango hummos, whatever they, they'll\n\n16:44.840 --> 16:50.040\nmake a flat white, the spider will go in and make a delicious flat white, which I love.\n\n16:50.040 --> 16:54.160\nBecause I cappuccino fucking, the only reason I never ordered cappuccinos because all that\n\n16:54.160 --> 16:59.080\ngoddamn foam, you guys are geniuses. Thank you. Flat white. I'm going to say, I'm going\n\n16:59.080 --> 17:02.480\nto, it's catching on back in the States, the flat white. I never heard of it until this\n\n17:02.480 --> 17:09.480\nyear. Me too. But then Cody said, by the way, also it's catching on back in the States.\n\n17:09.480 --> 17:14.680\nI can't wait to get back home and, and, and, and, and, and have a flat white and taste\n\n17:14.680 --> 17:19.080\nall of it because part of my brain won't be vigilant against spider attack.\n\n17:19.080 --> 17:24.920\nWhat do they do? It's just, it's just a coffee and they put milk on top of it.\n\n17:24.920 --> 17:29.040\nIt's just, it's like a cappuccino, but I don't know. They put foam reductor in it\n\n17:29.040 --> 17:33.440\nor something. They put, they put snake venom or something in it that makes the foam go\n\n17:33.440 --> 17:37.600\ndown. So it's not like a big pile of foam, like a cappuccino is so good, but then it's\n\n17:37.600 --> 17:41.400\nlike it's this big, it's like a baby taking a bath. You know, there's like a big, a big\n\n17:41.400 --> 17:44.920\ncone of foam on it. Like, who are you trying to impress? This isn't liquid. What am I supposed\n\n17:44.920 --> 17:49.480\nto do with it? It gets all over your face. It's like a novelty drink, a cappuccino.\n\n17:49.480 --> 17:55.760\nThey figured it out. They took the nonsense out. Oi.\n\n17:55.760 --> 18:04.320\nIt's a, it's a flit. It's a flit. Oi. A flit. Oi.\n\n18:04.320 --> 18:10.200\nAccording to my dialect chart, that's an I is an A is a, the O is an I.\n\n18:10.200 --> 18:17.400\nOkay. All right. So, all right. So not, you know, I don't think you're going to find probably\n\n18:17.400 --> 18:23.200\nanywhere you go. Every time we go outside the United States, be it to Canada or here.\n\n18:23.200 --> 18:33.320\nSometimes the food is wonderful, sometimes the food is bad, doesn't really matter, varies\n\n18:33.320 --> 18:39.960\ncity to city, but everywhere outside the United States by virtue of or by want of the kind\n\n18:39.960 --> 18:46.800\nof like particular I think capitalist fascistic frenzy that we have there where it's like\n\n18:46.800 --> 18:55.440\nyou are never more than a corned beef hash order served properly away from prison time\n\n18:55.440 --> 19:01.280\nlike you like America takes its capitalism very seriously so it's food service industry\n\n19:01.280 --> 19:06.200\nagain it's hit and miss in terms of the quality of the food but you better believe the people\n\n19:06.200 --> 19:09.800\nmaking the food and bringing it to your table they have a little hustle in their bustle\n\n19:09.800 --> 19:11.800\nthat you don't find when you leave the states.\n\n19:11.800 --> 19:16.640\nIn Canada you can go into restaurant and die of hunger because they're just not coming.\n\n19:16.640 --> 19:18.560\nThere's just no urgency at all.\n\n19:18.560 --> 19:24.320\nAnd there's a you know I've had some really really good food here but yeah by and large\n\n19:24.320 --> 19:28.840\nit's kind of like yeah thanks for coming into this place where we're making food sometimes\n\n19:28.840 --> 19:35.120\nand you kind of sometimes you're kind of waiting like I went to this place but well whatever\n\n19:35.120 --> 19:40.960\nI don't want to look like this is not me complaining it is me complaining.\n\n19:40.960 --> 19:45.400\nWell it's not the place it's just the restaurant right.\n\n19:45.400 --> 19:49.960\nWell the place that we ate just before we came here was fucking an Australia's fault.\n\n19:49.960 --> 19:55.440\nHas anybody been to the rock and pool rock pool rock pool bar and grill house.\n\n19:55.440 --> 20:02.880\nIt was it was like if the little rascals tried to build an eyes wide shut and all they had\n\n20:02.880 --> 20:10.600\nwas the materials they just had all the black on it the Formica and the crystal but none\n\n20:10.600 --> 20:20.200\nof the acumen like I it's this weird multi-tiered labyrinthine Lego village where it's really\n\n20:20.200 --> 20:27.200\nstrange and all of the wait staff they did they not they it's it's nobody who who expects\n\n20:27.200 --> 20:35.040\na wait person the whole experience to me was like being pulled over like by a cop my head\n\n20:35.040 --> 20:39.960\nspace was exactly that stressed and angry part of it felt like we were the cops like\n\n20:39.960 --> 20:46.120\nwe caught them having a restaurant and they were like right mixed like they are they were\n\n20:46.120 --> 20:51.840\nlike yeah they found us out they're coming for our drugs we got to make this look right\n\n20:51.840 --> 20:55.560\nyeah restaurant because we were trying to find out how to get into it because they have\n\n20:55.560 --> 21:00.840\na thing here Jeff we have you know handicap access you know you put a ramp or something\n\n21:00.840 --> 21:08.400\nyou know in America we like begrudgingly like put a ramp fine give me my subsidy here they're\n\n21:08.400 --> 21:14.320\nmuch more progressive but it's like it's a little confusing like we walk up to the restaurant\n\n21:14.320 --> 21:22.280\nit just it says disabled access only and we just paused in our tracks like and we're\n\n21:22.280 --> 21:28.000\nlooking at a restaurant the people are cleaning glasses they're just looking at us and it's\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:35.760\njust only and we're like we just fro and we're like own only yeah like so we you can't so\n\n21:35.760 --> 21:39.520\nyou can't take that would be like using a handicap stall to go in the door that's right\n\n21:39.520 --> 21:44.400\nin front of us yeah I don't think and the person just watching us playing in the glass\n\n21:44.400 --> 21:47.360\nand then we finally just like start walking away where they're looking at and we're waiting\n\n21:47.360 --> 21:52.840\nfor him to go like no no no that's just a that's a that's a kind of a formality like\n\n21:52.840 --> 21:56.760\nthe only part but I think it's serious but it was like that was the only way to get into\n\n21:56.760 --> 22:01.600\nthis place then we went on the right down that entrance had a had a sign for the place but\n\n22:01.600 --> 22:06.360\nthe proper entrance had not didn't really have the signage so like we saw what was the\n\n22:06.360 --> 22:11.120\nactual entrance and we figured out as the entrance because it was 20 stairs that was\n\n22:11.120 --> 22:17.400\nthe only clue that this was the same building we were trying to enter I mean I'm gonna just\n\n22:17.400 --> 22:28.280\nshow the video I took of the like that I'm not sure what to do with this up see you did\n\n22:28.280 --> 22:32.920\nsome photojournalism here so you gotta set this up videography they on the on the drinks\n\n22:32.920 --> 22:38.400\nmenu they had a set of rules that I posted on Instagram and we were going back and forth\n\n22:38.400 --> 22:42.480\non whether or not the rules were like a joke or serious but either way it's fucked because\n\n22:42.480 --> 22:47.360\nif they were serious they're bullying me and if they're and if they're joking they're\n\n22:47.360 --> 22:53.000\nbullying me except then you have to divine that they're not actually bullying me they're\n\n22:53.000 --> 23:00.440\njust bullying me what what were some of the

up or something I don't know I don't\n\n29:40.240 --> 29:45.280\nthink I don't know what I'm not gonna throw shade on the hotel as the kids would say I\n\n29:45.280 --> 29:48.520\ndon't know what they

got\n\n30:31.520 --> 30:36.000\nthe guy came to our door gave us keys me and Cody we went up to a different room it was\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:42.200\na fucking penthouse it was it was crazy there was a

like no she has to get in costume you\n\n31:58.680 --> 32:03.160\nknow like well sometimes that's it but you guys you guys go shopping like you go in little\n\n32:03.160 --> 32:09.240\ncostume shopping we go to Amazon you know it's like we order stuff on Amazon yeah when\n\n32:09.240 --> 32:12.520\nI go to pitch meetings at Amazon because they make TV I'm just like I'm always like walking\n\n32:12.520 --> 32:16.800\nout of there going like well did they say no to that TV idea because it's a bad TV idea\n\n32:16.800 --> 32:24.240\nor because they know I'm a fucking weird sex being who who always orders way too much toilet\n\n32:24.240 --> 32:33.000\npaper and like like like like just pantyhose and bulk anyways the but we did we yeah so\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:36.440\nwe I was like let's do a little role play with the using the boardroom environment because\n\n32:36.440 --> 32:40.440\nwe're not gonna have this ever again but it got really confusing because I tried I thought\n\n32:40.440 --> 32:47.320\nI could improvise my way through this week where I was like I was a human resources guy\n\n32:47.320 --> 32:54.240\nbut I was I bet you were I was investigating her because someone had filed a complaint\n\n32:54.240 --> 33:00.640\nthat she was dressed too provocatively at work and then but and then she's like well\n\n33:00.640 --> 33:04.800\nthis is how I dress all the time what's wrong with this and I was like well a lot of times\n\n33:04.800 --> 33:10.560\nwhat happens is guys at the office or if they get aroused they'll like they'll like try to\n\n33:10.560 --> 33:18.920\ntry to get revenge like by filing a complaint and I'm sorry it's their word against yours\n\n33:18.920 --> 33:26.880\nunless and it was getting really cuz she's trying to like yes she's like where are you\n\n33:26.880 --> 33:35.400\ngoing with this like I say what did and she's like is this about that she just made this\n\n33:35.400 --> 33:41.120\nis about what did she say Jason Ortega Jason or take no this is nothing to do with Jason\n\n33:41.120 --> 33:46.920\nOrtega no he he well yeah I mean all I can tell you is that multiple people have filed\n\n33:46.920 --> 33:52.440\ncomplaints about your provocative clothing and that and I was just like so I didn't know\n\n33:52.440 --> 33:58.560\nhow she was yes and in you but you absolutely know her her yeah well I was like Jason Ortega\n\n33:58.560 --> 34:02.600\nmay or may not be a part of this okay I was trying to figure out I was like how did you\n\n34:02.600 --> 34:06.360\nthink that you could jump into this pool and find your way to any edge that had to do with\n\n34:06.360 --> 34:12.480\nhaving sex before we have to go to dinner and so the way I got through it was as like look\n\n34:12.480 --> 34:24.440\nthere's exceptions we can make if I can prove that my dick fits in your pussy if I can prove\n\n34:24.440 --> 34:36.080\nthat it's just you as an individual that is arousing and not your outfits I then I can take\n\n34:36.080 --> 34:44.480\nyour side I'm hard as a fucking diamond right like the whole time we're having sex I'm like\n\n34:44.480 --> 34:52.360\njustifying I'm like yeah see this isn't your fault you were you were born this way I mean\n\n34:52.360 --> 34:57.960\nyeah the outfit's great but it's your it's the way it's on you and and wow you're great\n\n34:57.960 --> 35:04.680\nat this and and so I think I think you I think I'm gonna file a favorable report with human\n\n35:04.680 --> 35:14.560\nresources all over you maybe the last encounter she ever has with me is a badly improvised\n\n35:14.560 --> 35:20.880\nsexual play don't you don't reveal anything you don't want to reveal obviously but I don't\n\n35:20.880 --> 35:27.640\nget specific but like I I know that you guys do these fairly elaborate like backstory like\n\n35:27.640 --> 35:33.960\nrole-playing things so you are doing like improv yeah you're doing a little scene yeah\n\n35:33.960 --> 35:39.480\nyeah and like how good are you guys staying in character like I really good yeah that's\n\n35:39.480 --> 35:43.400\nthe problem with like the Jason Ortega or something that will throw somebody you know\n\n35:43.400 --> 35:47.840\nwe don't want to we don't want to break like we don't we don't tend to you know you could\n\n35:47.840 --> 35:50.960\nhave done you should have said that yeah it was about Jason Ortega then you make up what\n\n35:50.960 --> 35:58.480\nhe said okay Jeff and you're reenacted you should be making love to my girlfriend it's\n\n35:58.480 --> 36:01.320\neasy what if right at that moment she goes this is about Jason Ortega and you're like\n\n36:01.320 --> 36:04.760\nno no it could it be it might not it could be anybody and then knock knock knock and\n\n36:04.760 --> 36:13.080\nI'm there and I have a Jason name tag on your dress is a mariachi okay all right well it's\n\n36:13.080 --> 36:21.960\na little over the top but Jason Ortega is here yeah Jason Ortega that's too specific\n\n36:21.960 --> 36:26.120\nthat has to be a high school something like that sounds like a famous person right yeah\n\n36:26.120 --> 36:31.400\nbut she actually said well she explained afterward because we like to go back over it when we're\n\n36:31.400 --> 36:38.600\ndone like like well I you know I grabbed the towel and then we kind of like well back in\n\n36:38.600 --> 36:44.320\nAlbuquerque I took a left because I thought no you did but it's she was she was the first\n\n36:44.320 --> 36:48.440\nname off the top of her head she was afraid was gonna like upset me because it was somebody\n\n36:48.440 --> 36:53.800\nwe were been talking about earlier and that she that so she had to like really like hang\n\n36:53.800 --> 37:01.800\na hard left

crux of splasher someone should someone should tame that thing are you from\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:03.760\nhere I'm originally from Lithgow in the Blue Mountains let's go popular people apparently\n\n41:03.760 --> 41:11.200\nknow Lithgow I'm living in Wollongong at the moment which is south a little bit Wollongong\n\n41:11.200 --> 41:15.520\nWollongong yeah that's I'm going to university there I love it but I spent a fair bit of\n\n41:15.520 --> 41:19.760\ntime in Sydney my brother lives here so yeah what do you do relevant up until recently\n\n41:19.760 --> 41:25.520\nI was a science interpreter so teaching science to kids working at a planetarium now I'm currently\n\n41:25.520 --> 41:31.120\nnot doing that I pulled out of that because I'm doing my masters in teaching oh good\n\n41:31.120 --> 41:38.200\nnews right what do you want to teach I have a degree in history and one in English lit\n\n41:38.200 --> 41:45.440\nso either either or yeah okay so as a history teacher I got the brains on Ryan yeah can\n\n41:45.440 --> 41:54.400\nyou verify for me that we are in the States we are fucked that we're like historically\n\n41:54.400 --> 42:02.080\nlike fucking 1932 fucks I don't want to be an alarmist but yeah I mean we have to at\n\n42:02.080 --> 42:07.280\nthis point like everybody that everybody the internet's always like oh you know compared\n\n42:07.280 --> 42:12.400\nto Hitler it's like I don't care man I don't care about a party foul if somebody's so much\n\n42:12.400 --> 42:19.280\nlike Hitler that that I really I would really love to be wrong I'm fine with that but I if\n\n42:19.280 --> 42:24.880\nI'm right I think it's important to be right earlier than later I think that maybe people\n\n42:24.880 --> 42:30.640\nshould have compared Hitler to Hitler sooner yeah I know exactly what you mean and I think\n\n42:30.640 --> 42:34.960\nmost Australians will agree with me when I say it was kind of hilarious for a little while\n\n42:34.960 --> 42:42.080\nwhile what's happening like Hitler yeah because he literally looked like Charlie Chaplin okay\n\n42:42.080 --> 42:46.560\npeople are like you're hilarious but come on you can't talk like that you're going to jail\n\n42:46.560 --> 42:51.040\nand he's like I'm gonna write a dumb book and I was like this dumb book is great said the morons\n\n42:51.040 --> 42:55.040\nand then it's like everything was like perfect parallel yeah and then it's the first thing he\n\n42:55.040 --> 43:05.680\ndid when he got elected not by a majority but by the German electoral college yeah when he\n\n43:05.680 --> 43:12.720\nswept Michigan yeah yeah there's this there's this patch of field next to right on the armpit of the\n\n43:12.720 --> 43:23.760\nof the of the of the Rhine where everyone has 300 votes anyways the Harmon save it for your therapist\n\n43:26.320 --> 43:32.080\nwhat what what so where are you guys at because there's so many strange like\n\n43:32.720 --> 43:40.960\nflippy floppies that happen I mean like in the human sense you can just tell a hip progressive\n\n43:40.960 --> 43:47.040\nliberal person from from a from a kind of more starchy conservative person no matter where you\n\n43:47.040 --> 43:51.840\ngo but everybody has different words for the stuff and also it's not just semantics because\n\n43:52.400 --> 43:57.920\nyou depending on where you're at you're the progressives could be secessionists or progressives\n\n43:57.920 --> 44:02.320\ncould be like gun nuts like like that's happening in the States right now is like I feel like I\n\n44:02.320 --> 44:07.840\nwant to buy a gun and dig a hole and like wait for Trump to try to pry my gun out of my cold\n\n44:07.840 --> 44:12.640\ndead fingers which doesn't mean I'm like a constitution nut now what did somebody's yelling\n\n44:12.640 --> 44:19.040\nsomething out what's was it worth it yeah our conservative yeah yeah it's called the liberal\n\n44:19.040 --> 44:22.880\nI know that's the first thing I found out is it's a careful because you check yeah our liberals are\n\n44:22.880 --> 44:28.560\nNazis they were like uh I was like what it's crazy but then you go like well what does republican\n\n44:28.560 --> 44:33.840\nmean like all these guys love republics so much it's never really made any sense it's just anybody\n\n44:33.840 --> 44:38.800\nknows what I wanted to ask you is like like can you like and if you don't want to take the slings\n\n44:38.800 --> 44:43.680\nand arrows but if it's like a hot button and you're like I don't I came up here to talk about my\n\n44:43.680 --> 44:47.680\nbeautiful hair like I don't know but you're a history teacher that sounds like you have the\n\n44:47.680 --> 44:57.040\nrespect of the crowd like where where are you where are you where is where is Australia at right\n\n44:57.040 --> 45:03.520\nnow as this world is shifting into what I would call a factors leading to chapter in the history\n\n45:03.520 --> 45:10.240\nbook uh nationalist revolution it's kind of hard to say to be honest we're caught between\n\n45:10.800 --> 45:19.280\nyeah we're fucked we're fucked you're fucked too yeah I think we're we're all kind of a little\n\n45:19.280 --> 45:23.520\nbit fucked um that that goes just the subtitles of what's going on over here\n\n45:26.160 --> 45:31.120\nthe our current prime ministers like the most smug rich guy you can possibly imagine\n\n45:31.120 --> 45:37.680\nhe's he's maybe better than the last guy maybe there's a turn turnball right yeah turnball is\n\n45:37.680 --> 45:49.840\nour current p.m. and then tony abbot tiny abbot tony is this like is it more like crocodile\n\n45:49.840 --> 45:57.040\ndundee than I thought like a prime minister is donk uh and then tiny abbots are uh or president\n\n45:57.040 --> 46:01.920\nno okay uh tony tony abbot he he was like a monumental piece of shit but\n\n46:05.120 --> 46:10.720\nhe he didn't really have the wherewithal to hide it so everyone knew he was a piece of\n\n46:10.720 --> 46:15.280\nshit whereas uh turnball kind of hides it a bit better so I feel like he's winning some people\n\n46:15.280 --> 46:21.120\nover just because he's a bit more swarmy and stuff so uh yeah he's probably a lot worse but he\n\n46:21.120 --> 46:27.280\ncomes across as slightly more palatable yeah which is worrying that's why I felt so fucked in the\n\n46:27.280 --> 46:31.680\nstates is because it's not it's not donald trump like we have that it's it's it's it's actually\n\n46:31.680 --> 46:36.960\nit's either centuries or millennia payback of fixation on the hero worship the principle the\n\n46:36.960 --> 46:42.320\nidea that there's people that can make a difference it's as opposed to each individual has to like\n\n46:42.320 --> 46:48.160\nreally create their own world and like like like work practically toward a world that functions for\n\n46:48.160 --> 46:52.720\nall of us we all have this tendency to we just it just takes a big load off our shoulders when\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:56.640\nwe pick this favorite person to speak for us or that that person's going to bring about stuff so\n\n46:56.640 --> 47:02.320\nwe can kind of do what we do best which is not much at all and that's just that's just us being good\n\n47:02.320 --> 47:08.160\norangutans you know like like that's just whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa sorry uh\n\n47:08.160 --> 47:10.160\nuh\n\n47:16.160 --> 47:20.560\ndid I hear that wrong or do or do Australians just yell out baking soda when they get excited\n\n47:23.280 --> 47:24.160\nbaking soda\n\n47:26.240 --> 47:31.120\nyeah your plastic submarine's going up and in baking soda\n\n47:31.120 --> 47:34.320\nyeah\n\n47:35.200 -->

word yeah you can say it's my word oh he can say okay right\n\n47:55.120 --> 48:00.960\nso yeah yeah it was funny i that happens to me a lot too it's like well it's not funny now\n\n48:02.560 --> 48:07.280\nit was funny when i yelled it out and i didn't mumble it so i don't deserve this\n\n48:08.640 --> 48:15.440\ni nailed it the first time they all laughed you got gum in your dumb yanky ears very good sir\n\n48:15.440 --> 48:23.280\ngood job on that joke dots connected culturally uh all right so anyway so it's all right so what\n\n48:23.280 --> 48:28.480\nwhat what are you going to tell kids to do as you're teaching them history and you're you're\n\n48:28.480 --> 48:35.280\nalso thinking in your head i have no future to teach you because like it's it's grow gills or\n\n48:35.280 --> 48:41.440\ndrown like do you just hide that from them i don't know i'm i'm a little bit optimistic honestly\n\n48:41.440 --> 48:46.320\nthe more i work with kids the more i have faith in the future oh so like like like like\n\n48:46.320 --> 48:54.080\nit's it's honestly true it's like when you meet a baby boomer that's when the red flags\n\n48:54.080 --> 48:58.400\nstart popping up in my head yeah or a millennial so maybe having a soul skips a generation yeah\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:07.760\nthat's when i keep thinking because i'm from a thing called generation x i don't know if they\n\n49:07.760 --> 49:11.840\nhave that's maybe just an american thing but it's like we're out number 10 to 1 on both sides\n\n49:11.840 --> 49:16.880\nour parents are these huge douchebags that like they had their own trivial pursuit edition and\n\n49:16.880 --> 49:23.040\nlike they invented the beetles and the moon and all this shit like well it's like everyone\n\n49:23.040 --> 49:28.320\nmakes movies for them and they're just like jack off to references to their lifetime like what\n\n49:28.320 --> 49:36.400\nthat's what chuck willery uh oh i just can't suck willery uh but but and then and then and then\n\n49:36.400 --> 49:43.440\nmy generation was like i hate my parents that's enough for me and then but then we had kids and\n\n49:43.440 --> 49:49.280\nthese the the people they're like they're like little baby boomers i always said that like they\n\n49:49.280 --> 49:55.280\nlove they love their parents and they love the president and teamwork and and i just like it\n\n49:55.280 --> 50:01.040\njust like it started with like we're we're shiny star people we could use an ipad better and and\n\n50:01.040 --> 50:07.040\nit was like you're adorable but there's something fucking orwellian about your like like and and\n\n50:07.040 --> 50:11.280\nand then they just like they just didn't hit their teenage years and it was like i know we're one\n\n50:11.280 -->

time\n\n52:22.400 --> 52:27.680\nmathematically and i don't know if it's the same guy but there's another of the two in an uncomfortable\n\n52:27.680 --> 52:34.800\ncringey way uh has gone on record as saying that stupidity is a disease and we should cure it with\n\n52:34.800 --> 52:40.320\neugenics you know like oh some people are just dumb they're just born dumb and like that's like any\n\n52:40.320 --> 52:45.040\nother disability and why don't we cull that from the population if we're interested in that it's\n\n52:45.040 --> 52:54.800\nlike oh okay uh boy in the australian and the yiddish uh like like neither of us want to go there\n\n52:55.600 --> 53:01.440\nbut but but like like but then you what then in my country where or my prison colony where\n\n53:01.440 --> 53:06.000\nwhere where this this this recent thing happened it was like i just started feeling even before\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:11.920\nthe election actually kind of went the way it did i i i started having this like weird like\n\n53:11.920 --> 53:17.280\ni was just like fuck stupid people i just don't i don't like it's not like i i graduated college\n\n53:17.280 --> 53:21.760\nso by stupid i must

makes\n\n53:26.960 --> 53:31.280\nus hate stupid people because their stupidity counts as much as ours or more because you\n\n53:31.280 --> 53:35.680\nknow we live in california and our vote counts less than someone who lives in wyoming and we're\n\n53:35.680 --> 53:41.120\nbetter than wyoming and wyoming's full of idiots you hear that wyoming yeah go fuck yourself\n\n53:42.720 --> 53:46.080\ni used to tell people wyoming didn't exist and no one challenged me\n\n53:48.800 --> 53:52.240\nthat's a true story my whole middle school was just lying to people\n\n53:53.840 --> 53:57.760\nbecause you know as you could tell i'm an authoritative source that sounds like i know what\n\n53:57.760 --> 54:04.640\ni'm talking about so it just it all tracks you know what all right as a teacher i'm glad that\n\n54:04.640 --> 54:10.240\nyou're a good person Spencer because you can be really terrifying no i know i'd probably be more\n\n54:10.240 --> 54:15.920\neffective if i just embraced the evil but you know that's what i think sometimes i think like let's\n\n54:15.920 --> 54:20.800\njust be super villains like let's create a bomb that kills all the dumb people right yeah or just\n\n54:20.800 --> 54:24.640\ntake everybody to the moon i guess like i've been harping about we could just do that or just you\n\n54:24.640 --> 54:34.000\nknow fix education system in america that would help that's that sounds hard it is hard i got it all\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:39.920\nfigured out um what do you think i should do as a now i'm talking to the history that to the to the\n\n54:39.920 --> 54:48.480\nleader of children the consumer of my hit podcast uh and just a general like nice seeming guy like\n\n54:48.480 --> 54:53.280\nwhat do you think i should do in the face of all this i'll give you the spectrum in my head is\n\n54:53.280 --> 55:01.200\nranges from i'm supposed to uh use my pulpit to make people uh think correctly or do accomplish\n\n55:01.200 --> 55:05.600\nsomething and then the on the other side i'm supposed to stop thinking about this and and\n\n55:05.600 --> 55:13.360\ngive people something to laugh about with my rubber ducky uh squeaking forget okay i i think you\n\n55:13.360 --> 55:19.600\nshould write kung fu panda four like what is the what am i what's the path like my therapist can't\n\n55:19.600 --> 55:23.600\nhelp me because she used to tell me oh i would come in all upset about trump i would go you know\n\n55:23.600 --> 55:27.760\nthere's a weight nationalist movement happening and she would go it's secondhand smoke it's the\n\n55:27.760 --> 55:34.560\ninternet you're exposing yourself and then trump wanted she was like oops uh but but anyways like\n\n55:34.560 --> 55:38.240\nyeah so i can't really i don't really know what i'm supposed to do like what who am i i don't know\n\n55:38.240 --> 55:55.440\nwho i am tell me you beautiful crimson viking honestly if you're if your therapist can't help you\n\n55:55.440 --> 56:01.360\ni probably can't help too much but but also a little risk high yield because i mean you'll never\n\n56:01.360 --> 56:05.440\nsee me again this is like a you're up yeah okay one night stand tomorrow because i will be here\n\n56:05.440 --> 56:12.080\nfor your other show okay so if uh if you don't improve by tomorrow you can give it to me then\n\n56:12.080 --> 56:20.800\nuh um that is exactly what i meant someone's gonna get a jason nortigan name tag\n\n56:28.800 --> 56:33.760\nall right what do you think now i'm turned on again uh i don't know shave your head move out\n\n56:33.760 --> 56:39.760\ninto the wilderness start yourself a little commune joe yeah that's joe rogan you're right\n\n56:39.760 --> 56:46.880\nyou just gotta i honestly i i read uh the blog post you put on tumblr just after the election yeah\n\n56:46.880 --> 56:53.200\njust me me that that's that's what the uh nazis call virtue signaling that's what that's what they\n\n56:53.200 --> 57:01.040\ntell me i'm doing white knighting mansplaining uh beta beta pussying like i'm just trying i just\n\n57:01.040 --> 57:05.280\nmy instinct was just to like i hope the women feel better and i hope they think i'm a good person\n\n57:05.280 --> 57:10.240\ni don't know i think i think that's the stuff i like is the way you write has a lot of conviction\n\n57:10.240 --> 57:14.960\nto it every now and then you'll write something that is a little bit more open and susceptible\n\n57:14.960 --> 57:21.040\nto change so with that when i was reading that it felt like you were more open to changing\n\n57:21.760 --> 57:27.360\nyour perspectives on things that's what i like to see and it's yeah easy it's yeah but then i\n\n57:27.360 --> 57:33.120\nshould commit to that like i'm an epiphany addict i just apologize i should i should just open like\n\n57:33.120 --> 57:38.240\nan apology warehouse and just like like gives people like handcrafted apologies like i don't\n\n57:38.240 --> 57:41.840\nthink you should force it i think you should just maybe embrace it when it happens because otherwise\n\n57:41.840 --> 57:47.040\nif you're just constantly forcing that kind of catharsis it's nothing i guess i think the simple\n\n57:47.040 --> 57:52.800\nanswer for me the obvious answer is write a movie like like like use like like write a community\n\n57:52.800 --> 57:59.280\nmovie which i think but like like Dan a long time ago uh when we were both broke we've talked about\n\n57:59.280 --> 58:02.640\nthis in the show before like we would like pay each other's rent back and forth depending on who\n\n58:02.640 --> 58:07.920\nwas up or down in the chips at the time and uh there's a script that dan wanted to write based\n\n58:07.920 --> 58:12.320\non a certain mythological like greek myth character and so like that i i always really wanted to do\n\n58:12.320 --> 58:19.280\nlike what wanted to see dan write that and and uh you've got 19 000 tv shows going now so you're\n\n58:19.280 --> 58:25.840\nnot and you got a book and all this stuff so but like i think use the the knife that's in your\n\n58:25.840 --> 58:35.760\nor you know in your knife holder i see i ain't no writer but like like use use use the tools\n\n58:35.760 --> 58:39.920\nthat you're good at like like write stuff like write things about like because you know the\n\n58:39.920 --> 58:44.960\njoke in the documentary is that you you're a writer that writes about heroes and heroes by nature\n\n58:44.960 --> 58:48.320\nhave to change that's the point of a heroic journey that you start one way and you end\n\n58:48.960 --> 58:54.880\nsomething bigger um and that you're an epiphany junkie and you don't change it like that's you\n\n58:54.880 --> 58:59.920\nknow you've talked about that before so maybe you don't have to change but you have to keep writing\n\n58:59.920 --> 59:03.760\nstories with heroes that do because that's the you know that's that's the point of art is that it\n\n59:03.760 --> 59:10.720\nmakes sense of suffering and makes you know like it gives us a language of change i'm done that's\n\n59:10.720 --> 59:22.720\nwhat i meant but first a quick game of audience sound effects i think we should play that's why\n\n59:22.720 --> 59:26.880\ni brought it up because i was like that'd be a funny callback he explained it and then all right\n\n59:26.880 --> 59:35.680\nwell uh i already forgot your name ryan ryan one more thing have you ever heard of the porn phrase\n\n59:35.680 --> 59:44.880\ncf nm yeah it's clothed female nude male yeah i just discovered it and it's very exciting to me\n\n59:44.880 --> 59:51.520\nit's great it's a naked dude but the woman's dress personally i don't care if the guy's naked or not\n\n59:51.520 --> 59:56.560\nbut i like the clothed female part it's like but you can't just type in cf and just oh well i guess\n\n59:56.560 --> 01:00:03.440\nthat's non-nude but but yeah it's it's exciting i'm very attracted to clothed women i understand\n\n01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.120\nthere's a lot of clothed women in the audience right now\n\n01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.480\nalmost don't remind me almost two thirds\n\n01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.200\nyeah okay yeah i was just wondering oh and also have you uh where is this going\n\n01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.160\ni'm just asking him some stuff he's on the audience is responding to him yeah he's popping\n\n01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.440\ni i i think i speak for the audience and i think we're all kind of falling on levels ryan\n\n01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:38.320\nyeah we love him we love him he's a good sydney cider did you have you downloaded mario uh run\n\n01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.640\nit's like 15 bucks or something isn't it well there's a paywall i feel like the first four\n\n01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.720\nlevels three levels and then you have to pay i think it's like 10 bucks what i knew there was\n\n01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:54.080\npaywalls but that's fucking crazy yeah god dang so that can't be funny anymore i should leave\n\n01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:02.000\ni'll go it'll be fine that's so fucking stupid god damn it it's i want to flip this table\n\n01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.960\ni would i would i'd have to put it back that's the problem i like the fact that you were quiet\n\n01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:20.640\nduring the trump and the hitler stuff but mario really i'm trying speaking of trump i this is\n\n01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.440\nprobably just false hope to cling to but i heard someone talking you know now that the fbi has\n\n01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:31.200\nagreed that russia is definitely hacked the election um the thing is like trump could be\n\n01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:38.160\ntried for treason because he knew and possibly aided and abetted in the help helping a hostile\n\n01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:44.720\nforeign power wage war on our country which is literally the definition of treason so i think\n\n01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.880\nthat there's actually a treason case that could be made against him yeah then then yeah then then\n\n01:01:50.880 --> 01:02:01.680\nit's just sit back and let common sense take its course it's not gonna happen i mean i mean i\n\n01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.880\nmean it has to happen it needs to happen but like like no it's not like the horse has left a stable\n\n01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.280\nwell i mean like like people keep predicting they'll go like oh well he's gonna he's the medicare\n\n01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.640\nlike like the people who are gonna the people that got him elected they're gonna lose their\n\n01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:20.320\nfucking obama care it's it's it's poor white old people with like ptsd from wars and stuff that\n\n01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.280\nwe're getting insurance under obama that didn't understand what that meant and we're like fuck\n\n01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:30.960\nobama care because it was like dog whistle for like black guy care like like they were like\n\n01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.880\nthere's a black guy in the white house but that means what smart white people would rather hang\n\n01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.960\nout with smart black people than me um they they've they've got fucking mad and they overthrew\n\n01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.880\nthe like anyways i'm saying those people are gonna get their fucking health benefits taken away\n\n01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:55.040\nbut they're not gonna then go wait a minute i think this guy was with inhuman hair who is like\n\n01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.080\nhe wears fucking ball caps you can't be president you wear a goddamn trucker hat who is you know\n\n01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.520\nthat was a big trick that was that was a political strategy because he knows how fucking insane his\n\n01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.120\nhair is and that took it completely out of the picture i can't be shot you can't have all these\n\n01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.920\npictures i think he wore it like when he got off of like a helicopter yeah exactly where there's\n\n01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.320\nwind yeah exactly and it took it out of the equation he's like this is my life now i think\n\n01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.480\ni think it was smarter than that even it was smarter that the fucking word can't be used i\n\n01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.280\ni i think it was more strategic than that because like that that guy like like he's been wearing\n\n01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:37.120\nthat hair for a long time and like like like it's been fine like banding it about but i that baseball\n\n01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.840\ncap was a real signifier to this whole rust belt like it was like like there's a baseball cap i'm\n\n01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.840\ngonna wear it indoors and it's gonna have like generic felt letters ironed on to it there's\n\n01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.040\nnothing fancy about it because every every every trump supporter i've talked to it's like it always\n\n01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.320\ncomes down to like this anti-intellectual kind of revolution like it comes down to this like you've\n\n01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.840\nsmart frasiers think that you're so smart but i guess you weren't smart enough to win and and\n\n01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:08.480\nlike i i grew up in milwaukee like i just like i like like i'm like hey man i'm i'm i'm down for\n\n01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:15.040\nan anti-intellectual revolution i want to be i want to be dirty and ludite and fucking isolationist\n\n01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:22.000\nmaybe kind of but why is our leader a east coast trust fund pussy like what anyways you guys don't\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.680\nneed to hear this you have your own problems what am i doing why would i come here and dump this on\n\n01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:31.440\nyou you you already probably have to read about it in the like the australian gazette you're like\n\n01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:38.080\nthere's why is the why are we reading about this guy he's a million miles away if he the day he\n\n01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.800\ndecided to come here it'd be 15 hours from from here you guys could like by the time he got here\n\n01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:48.160\nyou could just punch him i just love that for five days i have not heard i haven't watched any u.s\n\n01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:53.760\nnews sources i i

dog in and six\n\n01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.240\nthousand dollars for the for the dog they paid six thousand dollars to get that dog alive because\n\n01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.520\nhe's a baby-saving

so\n\n01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.480\nin your this is my theory now i'm not a doctor i was not familiar with that but i think that when\n\n01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.800\nyou're learning to do things like walk and run and throw a ball and recognize faces and things\n\n01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.840\ni think that your your brain is going like oh this part of the brain is really important this part is\n\n01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.600\nnot so much important i think recognizing names and faces and things just just my brain just never\n\n01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.560\ni just think i'm like i just have like a dead spot in my brain like i can't that's my excuse that's\n\n01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:26.480\non the line i just think if you ever think if you think i'm a bad person because he's like oh

i'm not on reddit so it's fine you are now yeah\n\n01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.000\nthat's true you're gonna be yeah i will regret it all right so what's your name's kenny we already\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.920\nknow that all right what what gives um how are you going okay so i don't know i guess the reason\n\n01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:36.560\ni wanted to come up how many worries do you have seven um you're supposed to have no worries oh well\n\n01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:42.000\ni have like crippling social anxiety so it's like really yeah yeah it's like you thought oh go on stage\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.160\nyeah that's exactly that's actually yeah that's why i went skydiving because heights are terrifying\n\n01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.240\nyeah yeah exactly well that's like where they are the heights i got married\n\n01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.120\nit's the good place to go you just blew my fucking mind\n\n01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.400\nall right so well but that's literally it do you want me to just dig in or i'll mean yeah if you\n\n01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.800\nwant but like i think one of the other reasons is i uh i went to la earlier this year and i saw one\n\n01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:12.880\nof your shows and um i was hoping to do that who came from the furthest and then i would be like\n\n01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:19.280\naustralia and then it didn't happen but that's fine i'm here now oh more to the point you're here now\n\n01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.160\nso yeah yeah and i came the farthest now yeah exactly that's that's why that's why we have you\n\n01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.240\nup on stage yeah but it would have been weird for everybody in the audience together who came the\n\n01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:34.240\nfarthest when i came out because i'd be like me me me me well i probably didn't come the farthest\n\n01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.440\ntonight so that's fine all right now you say you have crippling social anxiety sure how does that like\n\n01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.040\nlet's just let's just let's just presume you do\n\n01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:55.040\nlet's just make that the premise uh like what is that like how does that manifest in your daily\n\n01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:01.040\nlife or um well i mean i've gotten better with it since like working in retail um because you\n\n01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:07.600\nlearn to pretend that the people aren't actually people it's sort of like you know westworld\n\n01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.280\nthey're all just hosts and they're on their loop they're just like they want something and then\n\n01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.120\nyou have to have some exchange with them and stuff and it's yeah it's like i'm pretending\n\n01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.880\ni basically associate but if it's westworld aren't you the host actually that's pretty apt i'm in\n\n01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:28.160\nmy cycle yeah working retail yeah yeah would you like a drink um it's probably entertaining to see\n\n01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:32.800\nme heave every time i take a sip so sure yeah i don't do well with spirits but sure let's go ahead\n\n01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:38.080\nno that's not for you no no it's fine it's fine i'll i'll be ready we'll we'll get you a nice\n\n01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:45.120\nshoot of armor then i'll be great yeah i mean i got through here yeah it's fine you don't have to\n\n01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.160\ndrink that no no no don't don't give me i like drinking it's just that it's the only thing here\n\n01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:58.320\nso that's fine yeah no it's not uh okay not okay he's just saying what you're a beer guy yeah\n\n01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.840\nthere's no beer apparently yeah exactly that's fine dude you just you made jeff leave\n\n01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.480\nhe you offended him oh wait oh okay yeah i didn't see what happened it's beer country i wouldn't\n\n01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.280\ni wouldn't presume that anybody i've i've i've had to i've had to walk many many bartenders\n\n01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:23.040\nthrough making me a negroni uh on this trip i don't know what that is yeah exactly it's a drink it's\n\n01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:29.600\nit's a it's a equal parts sweet vermouth gin and compari so no it's a yummy daytime beverage it's\n\n01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:37.600\nthere you go all right you've got you've got a coke a beer and a you got the beer\n\n01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:45.600\nall right thank you jeff\n\n01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.960\nall right there we go you don't have to it's not it's not a competition\n\n01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.120\nno it's australian all right kenny uh it's not a competition it's australian\n\n01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:12.000\nokay so we'll okay we'll we'll tell us more uh what would you like to know social anxiety\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.080\nah you don't you don't have the handshake of a socially anxious person\n\n01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.840\nwhen dan was walking through the crowd looking for somebody you was like i said you want to come\n\n01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:25.520\non stage is there something that you feel like you could like gain from this experience or\n\n01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:32.160\nit's just being up here and and like letting this weird feeling happen be it's its own reward\n\n01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.040\ni think uh i realized earlier this year this is actually after i went to see a show and everything\n\n01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:42.640\ni was like listening to um grandma's virginity podcast and listening to like justin and ryan\n\n01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.840\ntalking about writing and then it suddenly dawned on me that i want to be a fucking writer so like\n\n01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:54.160\none uh like physics degree later and working in retail and everything i've finally realized what\n\n01:17:54.160 --> 01:18:06.000\ni want to do and uh it's it's sort of like uh and i realized like having i can't count how many\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.240\ntimes i've marathoned community and everything so i realized that um after all this time you're\n\n01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.120\nprobably the closest thing i have to like an idol sort of thing like not it no don't don't\n\n01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.480\nfucking do that no it's not this is not a hero worship thing this is just like a i i really\n\n01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:28.000\ndo you feel bad for you they're like oh like oh you really gotta i'm used to that expand your\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.240\nhorizon yeah look at his idol i hear um was it ockerman i should go for him yeah i go between\n\n01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:43.920\nme and ockerman uh i'd go i'd go ockerman these days i mean what sort of physics uh like was\n\n01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.840\nthere any specialty in that i mean it was only a bachelor's before i realized i didn't fucking\n\n01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:53.600\nwant to do it so um let's experiment with i mean you know when you when you get a physics degree\n\n01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:00.080\nyou end up doing like the whole gamut you doing like quantum astro all that shit so yeah it's fun\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.920\nsee now i i i'm into physics i just have i have i have a terrible brain from math like i'm really\n\n01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:13.280\nnot a numbers guy but i love same i love shows about physics and about quantum theory and all\n\n01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.480\nthat jazz but when they start talking about anything like like slightly complicated like it's just so\n\n01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:31.680\ntheoretical and abstract don't let for the listeners dan is writing a live screenplay about\n\n01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:38.240\nkeep keep talking to him keep talking to him you and i are going to talk right now um all the\n\n01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.800\nwatching the documentaries and stuff from first time experience kenny what's your what's your last\n\n01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:51.760\nname mcdonald mcdonald okay with an a or did mc mc yeah oh nice first go i mean there's only two\n\n01:19:51.760 --> 01:20:15.760\noptions so it's not that impressive but\n\n01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.880\ni mean\n\n01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:33.600\ndan do i read any of this for the podcast or no yeah i don't know i don't know\n\n01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:41.440\nthis is just gonna this is gonna make people have to subscribe yeah um we're not even shooting\n\n01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.840\nare we shooting maybe we can edit it out of the audio part i don't know okay well let's keep talking\n\n01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:50.960\nso like oh well what i was going to say before is like with the watching documentaries and stuff\n\n01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.200\nand liking physics documentaries don't let that trick you into getting a degree in physics\n\n01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:06.880\nbecause you won't enjoy it right first hand experience\n\n01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.560\ni got uh i got very very lucky i met uh you know professor brian cox you know the very charming\n\n01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.800\nenglish uh is this from uh sarin your long lost cousin or something yeah yeah wonders of the universe\n\n01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:32.320\nso i don't you look similar yeah he's like he invited me to come out and go look at the\n\n01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:48.240\nlarge hadron collider which would be fun but i don't know what it is i i i don't know how magnetism works\n\n01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.200\ndan for the listeners dan is writing a very culturally sensitive not hack script right\n\n01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:00.640\nright that's me candy mcdonald\n\n01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:13.600\nso i guess i kind of screwed this i'm like i guess you don't start that view like the person's\n\n01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:18.160\nborn then you can't is that implied that i wasn't a baby but i am now this is like benjamin\n\n01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:23.360\nno god no i would never i wouldn't do that what else what else could have possibly be implying\n\n01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:29.440\nno i that i'm a bad writer i did a bad i i already painted myself into a corner i structurally i\n\n01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.360\nthe this type of voiceover doesn't work if the person's being born no it works it works\n\n01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.960\nno no it's a it's what you're wondering how i got here yeah nine months earlier no one's\n\n01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:45.200\nwondering how you got there how you got there was the sperm yeah cut to cut to some old mcdonald's\n\n01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:51.680\ntesticle yeah i like i like to think that i was like like you know what's the word like jesus um\n\n01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:56.880\nyeah jesus immaculate immaculate immaculate conception my parents never had sex that's fine\n\n01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.280\nno but why can't why can't you say like like uh like that it's him being born and then you're\n\n01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:05.840\nlike it's 30 year old yeah i'm not sure what they say in this case but i wouldn't always be a baby\n\n01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:14.320\npeople know that though all right so kenny so you you you got your degree in physics yeah\n\n01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:20.880\nwhich sounds arduous it sounds difficult uh yeah and then you said i don't want to be in physics\n\n01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:28.080\nlike yeah would you in your dream if you want to be like a theoretical particle physicist no uh like\n\n01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:34.320\ni think um i don't know i think part of like my like getting a science degree is kind of to\n\n01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:38.800\nshut people up when when i'm doing something else that i want to do um some people can say what are\n\n01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:43.520\nyou doing with your life i'm like i have a degree but that seems like a waste of 40 grand so i don't\n\n01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:56.720\nknow um all of my friends that have made it uh we have one thing in common none of uh any of us\n\n01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:02.720\nand them because i'm including like way more successful friends of mine uh none of them\n\n01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:07.440\nhas a degree that's because they're smarter than me and that's why they're successful but like i\n\n01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:13.920\nwent to i went to the university of southern california and i\n\n01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:26.080\nno it will tend to oh yeah yeah unless acted upon by an outside force yeah okay thanks\n\n01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:33.840\nbut yeah okay are we gonna get some new toning and punch lines going on\n\n01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.680\noh professional now\n\n01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.560\nlike i went to school i started as a business major i suck at i suck at math\n\n01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.560\nand then i went to journalism because there was no math requirement but then by the end i\n\n01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.640\ndon't want the degree i just sneaked into classes that i wasn't allowed to be in and just like if\n\n01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:01.440\ni'm gonna go to school for free because i was poor and had like you know financial aid and you know\n\n01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.120\nthey charge you to take the tests not the and get the paper at the end i i would just sneak\n\n01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.200\ninto cool like history classes and things that were like they try to take advantage of like that\n\n01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:17.120\nthe degree would be pretty meaningless but so now like you want to you want to be a film writer tv\n\n01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:25.120\nwriter novelist um tv tv tv yeah because like yeah i realized that throughout my life the thing\n\n01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.520\nthat's probably been said to me the most is like get off the fucking tv or like stop watching tv\n\n01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.360\nor some shit like that so it's like what do i love i love do you think that when the movie that dan\n\n01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:39.920\nis writing is made that adam scott's gonna play you sorry sorry yeah a little bit like adam\n\n01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:55.840\nscott no no no maybe just the angle uh so just nope i don't know who that is\n\n01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:06.720\nshould we should we should we perform this later on\n\n01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:20.400\ni i yeah we can perform it i think we should we put this on as a little one act play later\n\n01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:26.400\nuh all right so now what's have you tried writing are you are you working on stuff yeah like i like\n\n01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:32.640\ni'm like on the plotting stage of many things and then i finished an actual like um it was\n\n01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.680\nattempted to be a like a pilot episode but it turned out more like a short film um comedy\n\n01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:44.880\nsomething but um yeah no i'm i'm writing when i have time and i don't know like i know a lot of\n\n01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.360\nactors that are from here and work in acting here but is there a big like tv writing thing like i'm\n\n01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:57.680\nlike all of our tv is kind of shit especially the comedy i don't know like i oh man i was listen\n\n01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:04.720\ni was watching australian i was watching australian food network okay i'll let you talk sorry sorry\n\n01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:10.560\nit's fine sorry what was i was watching australian food network holy shit everyone just wanted to\n\n01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.360\ntalk on in front of the camera there was like four cooks and they're like now i'm making marzipan well\n\n01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.400\ni'm cooking up grapes yeah it's just like everyone's talking over each other and i'm like i don't know\n\n01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:26.880\nhow much butter you're using i don't think they know why though but yeah no that stuff's great\n\n01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:33.440\nbut oh i love food network yeah yeah you know oh yeah it's the network for the food now now you go\n\n01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.080\nwhat were you gonna say before i so rudely cut you off i'm not paying attention to myself 90\n\n01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.720\npercent of the time so yeah yeah how was your social anxiety doing right now is the

kidding oh no no that i've had a lot that's fine that's his father\n\n01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:06.080\nyeah i've written myself into a corner here i got the professor just uh i haven't been reading\n\n01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.680\nthat where we at like the keep can you put me up to date the physics professor made a fireball\n\n01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.720\nby lighting his pipe or something cleaning his pipe yeah he just is cleaning his pipe when his pipe\n\n01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:24.160\nburst into flame and then Kenny's climbing to his feet and then he'll say uh professor take me away\n\n01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:37.520\nfrom here this is a magical reality kind of thing with pleasure uh oh enter jason ortega\n\n01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:44.480\noh i know how to get out of this i know how to do this i've seen this double another\n\n01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:58.800\nKenny starts to reach for the hand then recoils uh the oops shit sorry the professor's hand is a\n\n01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:09.120\nrobot hand cut to Kenny's bedroom real world Kenny bolts up\n\n01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:18.240\nscreaming uh the audience is crying\n\n01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:26.160\nuh cop out sits up next to him do a little undercut\n\n01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.600\nbaking soda\n\n01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:42.560\njesus christ\n\n01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:49.600\nthis is

comment yeah yeah it's enormous laughter yeah i almost think we'll just\n\n01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:36.640\nhave to edit out almost your whole yeah that's that's fine i don't know what to do otherwise\n\n01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:40.400\nthis was an experiment i thought like oh except jeff talked to somebody and then i'll write a script\n\n01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.080\nabout them but it's like yeah it's a visual thank you for probably we're having just a regular\n\n01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:48.160\nconversation and a giant laster happening because you're making you're making mark ruffalo\n\n01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:52.320\nfuck adam scott but we're behind our shoulders let's do this like well we're at this doesn't that's\n\n01:31:52.320 --> 01:32:01.200\nas good an ending as any fain fain out got it okay but\n\n01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.040\nis there is there anything you're an aspiring writer kenny like is there anything you can think of\n\n01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:15.760\nnot to put you on the spot is there anything i could like show you or help you know like something\n\n01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:22.480\nthat or like i don't know some piece not how do i get a job anything other than like like creatively\n\n01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.800\nwhat can i impart to you what do you always wonder about dan where do you get it how does it happen\n\n01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:35.920\nhow do you keep your hair so soft and manageable um i i don't know if you want a real answer i guess\n\n01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.120\nlike you know coming up with a concept for a comedy tv show to be running over like multiple\n\n01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:46.320\nseasons it always feels so like like coming up with a concept that doesn't feel so trite and\n\n01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:54.800\nhacky like you know like like like community is something so like open to the idea of like\n\n01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:58.400\npeople coming together and having like real human experiences masked by all this like\n\n01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:02.960\nfarcical shit going on in front well that's the only thing you get you yeah there's no such thing\n\n01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:08.800\nas a good idea or a bad idea it doesn't matter like like like the point of tv is not to be original\n\n01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:14.080\nthe point of tv is to is to placate is to is to give people comfort you know it's like tater tots\n\n01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:19.600\nyou don't want to like reinvent the tater tot do you guys have tater tots i we call them potato\n\n01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:25.280\ngems but that's fine okay i suddenly accidentally saying something horribly racist but i say yes\n\n01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:38.000\nwe have tater tots my mother's one they're called argentinians uh but but but you know it's like\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.240\ncommunity is like it's a it's a hack idea i remember people make fun of it because the all\n\n01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:46.400\npeople knew was the logline of the idea i remember all the press was like oh there's a new mbc show\n\n01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:50.800\nchal mckayle plays a guy that goes back to college because he lost his thing and everybody was like\n\n01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:55.200\nwhat did seinfeld write this in his show like it's like bad idea it's like yeah it's dumb like like\n\n01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:00.240\nit's silly but so is uh people in a spaceship going out to boldly go where no one's gone before\n\n01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.480\nthat's a terrible idea so what what what do you mean you're going to boldly go what are you talking\n\n01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:08.160\nabout just going what are you gonna what are you how do you know when you're finished but the idea\n\n01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:16.000\nthe the idea is to get people well for at least for i mean this isn't the only job tv has but the\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:33.920\nidea is to get people in yeah it's nine eleven good job bless you sir the town crier it's nine\n\n01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:45.600\neleven and oh well it's nine eleven and i like that hat mate i dislike them tell us coming damn white\n\n01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:55.600\nhe said dislike he dislikes it i just like oh no not just like no no no who would like the only\n\n01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:01.120\nthing he likes i just like this often in eleven life was like null and void for him it was all\n\n01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:08.720\ndownhill from that but uh you know like like it's yeah no you just you know how it's you know how\n\n01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:16.640\nwhen it's raining uh like people are in a weirder happens occasionally yeah yeah it's it's like\n\n01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.360\nlike if it starts to really come down like everybody who's anywhere they all have to get out of the\n\n01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.760\nrain so then it's like oh then every once in a while like it's raining and you're stuck with a bunch\n\n01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:32.960\nof people like that you don't know and you're like huh it's raining but it's like a person you'd never\n\n01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:36.480\ntalked to but it's like and they're like jesus christ yeah it fucking rains started coming out of\n\n01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:41.520\nnowhere it was crazy it was dry and then it was wet and it's like this would never have happened\n\n01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:48.960\nand it's like that person might look like a ranger they're from some different walk of life they\n\n01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:53.840\nmight be uh liberal with a big l and you're liberal with a small l meaning you're like both sides of\n\n01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:59.760\nthe political spectrum you're labor and they're they're capital l liberal or the end of like like\n\n01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.080\nlike or yeah and and you're different ages or you're different genders and there's at least 50 known\n\n01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:10.560\ngenders uh the the the the rain made something happen the rain is the idea that's just it the\n\n01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:16.480\nrain could be oh it's the future and so everybody's in a starship and they have to go do stuff that's\n\n01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:21.760\na contrivance rain is a contrivance got you know it's like oh the god happened like you can have\n\n01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.320\none coincidence in your story is your this is for tv writing you just go like oh what's something\n\n01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.640\nstupid that made a bunch of people have to be together kind of forever like like mostly forever\n\n01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.360\nfor a hundred episodes or so also this is really old-fashioned advice because tv now is like like\n\n01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:41.680\nlike i'm talking about like 80s style craftsmanship and like tv now is like oh just take a shitty\n\n01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.360\n90 minute directive video movie break it up into 10 chapters and release them one at a time\n\n01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:54.000\nthis this tv series is called cobra man episode one man\n\n01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.320\nepisode two man at a cobra store\n\n01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.080\nepisode three all at the cobra store ain't what it seems\n\n01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:10.320\nepisode four cobra escape episode five mixed blessings\n\n01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:17.920\nepisode six almost unusual power\n\n01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:23.360\nepisode seven cobra man episode eight shark jumped\n\n01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:34.800\nepisode nine bat cleanup episode 10 clip show uh but but uh yeah i mean it's serialized now\n\n01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.000\nand that's a whole different discipline i don't really understand that i figure if i\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.280\nreally tell a serialized story i'll write a movie no one wants me to write a movie i want\n\n01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.480\ni'm gonna write a movie okay yeah it'll be great yeah you know you had a right all right you had\n\n01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:55.440\na right fucking cobra man i'm gonna write cobra man but in my opinion tv is supposed to be like\n\n01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:01.920\ncrack it's like each rock is an individual rock like you should be able to grab any rock in any\n\n01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:08.960\norder and it would get you high and you'll want to smoke all the crack rocks and you'll even if\n\n01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.280\nif you're then told they come in a certain order you'll go like yeah i'm a crackhead i'll\n\n01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.720\ngo meet you like sure if there's a number one on one of the crack rocks if it rolls under the\n\n01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:25.680\ncouch and there's only two five and seven i'm still gonna smoke the crack like like i don't owe it\n\n01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:30.800\nto the fucking crack to consume it in a certain order and the crack ought to meet me halfway as\n\n01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.880\na crackhead it's the least the crack can do to not fuck with me and so i'm like what the hell why\n\n01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:41.840\nis jillian anderson where did she go what is this is her dream now but i love the fall have you\n\n01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:47.040\nseen the fall no so good see that's serial that was a great message for the kids uh that's that's\n\n01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:53.120\ni'm glad ryan was here to hear that so he passed that along to the children oh the the look of the\n\n01:38:53.120 --> 01:39:00.240\ncrack metaphor but like like a good a good sitcom a good tv show is a in my opinion is a necklace\n\n01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.520\nmade of crack rocks because it's like you you provide the order you provide maybe you do put a big\n\n01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.360\nhonking rock right in the middle and you say like smoke from left to right as you would\n\n01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:15.120\nbut there's a string connecting all of them you can wear it you can tell your friends about it at\n\n01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.800\na party they go hey what's what's that you got around your neck it's a crack necklace\n\n01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:26.400\ni love it i smoke i smoke this one i smoke that one oh i crack's not for me no that's that's other\n\n01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:32.640\npeople's crack let me tell you about this this is this is rick and morty crack this is great uh\n\n01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:39.600\nso uh anyway so there's no such thing as a bad idea the the worst kind of idea that you could have\n\n01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:45.680\nis is the thing where you start thinking like uh uh uh uh like oh this sounds like tv this will\n\n01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:50.080\nmake a good tv show that you're gonna do that by default because you love tv you want to write good\n\n01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.240\ntv you're gonna always second guess yourself and be like like like you're gonna always be filtering\n\n01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.520\nthings through like oh and then it'd be like a tv show if i did it like this the the the way that\n\n01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:07.040\nyou make good stuff is by restraining that you have to like force your tv loving structure\n\n01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.400\ncraving self-loathing nothing inside my head deserves to be on television brain you have to\n\n01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:19.200\nforce it actively force it into the non-televisable realm go like what is the memory that i have that\n\n01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:26.560\nis so fucked up it cannot be it doesn't go near it's too boring or it's too pornographic or it's\n\n01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:33.840\ntoo bloody or it's too sad it's like like where it's just too like like like like personal to me it\n\n01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:39.840\ndoesn't make that much sense and try as hard as you can to not let that get filtered through that\n\n01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:44.080\nthe other part of your brain which everyone has anyway that's the unremarkable part of your brain\n\n01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.920\nthat like turns it into gilligan's island like like which is a great show that but the person\n\n01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:55.280\nthat created gilligan's island wasn't like i'm gonna try to make a show like gilligan's island\n\n01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:59.200\nlike that was a like weird byproduct of them i don't know who knows what they were sure sure\n\n01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:04.800\nshorts right like his thing was like he made tv like i'm gonna make sure that people will really\n\n01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.840\nhave to watch like like he would do anything he didn't care about the rules at all there have\n\n01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:14.320\nbeen many many attempts since gilligan's island to make shows about a group of people staring at a\n\n01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:21.280\ndesert island and they have all sucked this is the part where dan dies and it's very sad\n\n01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.360\ni talked while i was drinking it went down the rug pipe as you get older there's another thing\n\n01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:34.240\ngilly i could tell you chenny as you get older especially if you drink a fifth of vodka i'd\n\n01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:42.320\nlike your esophagus flap will start to degrade like a toilet flap you know you have to replace the\n\n01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.800\ntoilet flap every once in a while you go to the hardware store maybe maybe your parents did you\n\n01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.440\ndo this but millennial so there's like a rubber flap of the toilet that keeps it that you have a\n\n01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:58.320\nflesh one in here but you can't replace it it just melts what you say you've you've you've eroded\n\n01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.360\nyour epiglottis or whatever as i after i turned 40 i was like one day i was in a movie theater and\n\n01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:10.880\nit was like eating popcorn while going those muppets are funny uh this it's this hypothetical\n\n01:42:10.880 -->

01:42:42.560\nmuppets are you at the heimlich what's going on over there i got droplets of vodka went down my\n\n01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:50.000\nbreathing tube which is like like absorb them you absorb

heimlich the heimlich maneuver is just a one big hug well it's a series of very strong hugs\n\n01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:11.440\nit's just anyways so then i inhaled popcorn and i you have to chew very carefully now there's\n\n01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:14.960\nan episode of the podcast where the rest of the show is gonna be dan dan sounding like drunk\n\n01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:25.840\nnick nolte all
