["Pretty Beautiful"]

00:07.000 --> 00:23.000
["Pretty Beautiful"]

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
Turn your station to misery!

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
From the ridiculously beautiful Sydney Opera House

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
in New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, Harmontown

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
is now in session.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
["Pretty Beautiful"]

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Please welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden.

00:50.000 --> 01:01.000
["Pretty Beautiful"]

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
It's working now and I'm happy. How's everybody doing?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
["Pretty Beautiful"]

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

01:13.000 --> 01:23.000
["Pretty Beautiful"]

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Thank you, Sydney.

01:24.000 --> 01:33.000
["Pretty Beautiful"]

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
So kind. You're so kind.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
You know, Sydney is the kindest city in Australia.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Did you know that?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Is that right?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
It's the capital of the kindest state.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
We're in South Wales.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
New South Wales?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
New South Wales.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
This ain't your grandma's South Wales.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
No. Fuck South Wales.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
That shit's in England somewhere.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It might be in Wales.

01:59.000 --> 02:12.000
["Pretty Beautiful"]

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
He looked at a map while I was in the hat store.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Is your mic loud enough?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I had them turn mine up.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I don't know.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Mine has been...

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
My volume's going...

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I don't know.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
What about mine?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I don't know.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
That's great.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
A little louder for Dan's, alright?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
It's got a little bit more Dan.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Check one.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Sydney.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Sydney.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Check two.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Sydney.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
You know what they call them?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
They call them Sydney Siders.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Did you know that?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
That's what they call people from Sydney.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Sydney Siders?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Sydney Siders.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Oh, like on the side of Sydney.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Cause I...

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
What?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Now, let's talk about your...

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Let's talk about your new...

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
your new lip there, man.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I like it a lot.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Is that a proper Acubra or whatever they call it?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
It was an authentic Acubra.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
I got it in the store next to the hotel.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
There were rabbits drying on the rack and there were six of them that went into this one,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
so I know it's authentic.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Did they have boomerangs there?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, but they were mounted.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Oh.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
So it's like...

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
You couldn't hurt people with them.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, they're like...

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah, it's easily...

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Like to put on your desk.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Right.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Like the buck stops here, but then it...

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Then it goes away and then it comes back again.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, so we're here at the Sydney Opera House, the historic Sydney Opera House.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I, you know, I do not feel bad about this.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm very happy to be here, but I will say I was narcissistic and naive enough to believe

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
when they said come to a show at the Sydney Opera House.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
I thought...

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
I didn't know they had other rooms.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
It makes perfect sense now, and I love you guys.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
You're amazing.

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
I'm not going to punish you, but I did fly out here with a different image in my head.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
One that makes no sense.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
No sense.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
The fact that not only could we fill the Sydney Opera House, but two nights.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah, I know.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
They're like, you saw that?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
They want to do a second show at the Sydney.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Really?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Oh, bring it on.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I guess it's just cultural efficacy.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
They must be bored down there.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I don't know.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah, I'm not being aloof.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm just looking at my notes.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Are those authentic crocodile teeth in the brim of that hat?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I don't know.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
They're teeth.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I mean, I don't know, man.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
It's a $65 hat.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
That's all I know.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
$65 Australian dollars.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Are they dollars or are they called boomos?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Dollary.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I think they're called dollary dudes.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah, so you were about to say a guy at the Melbourne show.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah, because we kicked off in Brisbane a couple nights ago, and shit went wild.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
That crowd was raucous, to say the least.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
They were just fighting with each other.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
They were just booing each other.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
They were having focus groups in the back?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
People were just saying, like, oh, that was a good joke.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
What did you think of that joke?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
It was okay.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I don't know.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Let's listen to the next joke.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I don't know.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I'd rather discuss this joke.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
You're from Ipswich?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Fuck you!

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
But they were awesome.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I was more entertained by them than I think they were of us.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
But then last night in Melbourne, it was a theater, like a proper nice old theater.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
So it was less like a rock concert than the Brisbane show.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
But everybody had a thousand beers.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And there were two hecklers.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
One guy just kept going, bang orang from the back.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Which isn't even an Australian thing.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
It's a Spielberg thing.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Bang orang.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
That's not Australian.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
So, and then there was a guy up front.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
We were talking to a blind woman in the back, and he was heckling her.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
She wasn't blind, right?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
She was going blind in ten years.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
But still, he took a pretty hard line on her.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
He turned out to be right.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
He turned out to be right.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Yeah, he's like, yeah, shut up to the blind lady.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
She wasn't blind, but yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
But then, so there was a guy.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
We ran into somebody after the show at a bar.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
And he said, because the guy in the bang orang guy up in the balcony.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
We were sitting behind him.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And he had his shoe off at one point.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
He was like waving his shoe.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
And then they had washed him, drank eleven beers.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And then he just looked at his shoe.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
And then filled his shoe with vomit.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
So now he's sitting there with a vomit filled shoe.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And then he realized that he has to go clean his shoes.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
So he just pours the vomit out?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
No, no, he went outside.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
He poured it on the sidewalk outside.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And then he proceeded to get in a fight.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And then we left and got food.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And then we came back and I saw the very vomit he poured out.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
I didn't realize at the time that this was shoe man's vomit.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
But I pieced it together afterwards.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Oh, was it on the sidewalk?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
I saw that too, yeah.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And we were like, that's weirdly fresh vomit.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
That's why.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
With little pieces of koala meat in there.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Right, yeah.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Little chlamydia koala meat.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
That was a Sydney Siders vomit.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
No, it was a Melbourneian.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I think he was from Ipswich.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
But yeah, no, both great cities, both in their own different way.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Melbourne was like the hipster city.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
And Brisbane was like Gremlins 2.

07:27.000 --> 07:37.000
Oh, we got, I think, I think Brisbane is Sydney's Ipswich.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
This is starting to make sense.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I'm from the Midwestern United States.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Everybody always has to have a community.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Like when you're from Milwaukee, you have to pick on Kutahoe.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
It's just like a town of 200 people where they, where they, where all the tanning factories are.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
So it smells like poop when you drive past it.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
People in Milwaukee love picking on Kutahoe because it's like shit rolls downhill.

08:02.000 --> 08:10.000
So, but, but Sydney is the multicultural capital of, you know, I mean, even the world, let alone Australia, this is the first place.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
This is the first European settlement.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
This is where they first opened the prison colony for business.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
They were like, this is the place.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Let's send them.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
And then in the 19th century, they said, okay, you're not prisoners anymore.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Now you can try to build a society.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
And the Aborigines were like, what about us for 30,000 years?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And then the beds are burning video.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And then everything's fine.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Everything's fine now.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Oh, well, yeah, don't die.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
You're my knight in shining armor, you old poop.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
I always thought that guy sounded a lot like Catherine Hepburn.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
How can we sleep when our golden pond is burning?

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
You old poop.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
You had him with Gremlins too.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
You lost him with our golden pond.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
No, but not all the Hepburn fans here.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Maybe that's why you like this, that song so much.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Like, like they were like, this sounds really original.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
I'm like, that's, that's, that's, that's bringing up baby.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah, no, but it's beautiful here.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
It's beautiful Melbourne, beautiful here.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
We're actually going to be here for a little while.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
We're extending our vacation and then I'm off to Fiji.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
But when we first, when we landed in the airplane,

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
we got into the, we went from the airplane to the, to the, to the baggage claim.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
We got into the shuttle and the first thing Spencer said,

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
having taken in that much of Australia was, hot Canada.

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
In a good way, just to be clear, in a good way.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And I think there might have been a little pejorative.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Like, I think it was just at that point, it was like, okay, it's hot.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Also, yeah, I mean, we've flown over and landed in much drier areas,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
but that area specifically was very green, very hilly,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
very much like Canada in the summer.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
It was great.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Also the architecture to me is very reminiscent of Canada

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
and that it's just very, like, interesting and, and I don't know,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
you know, all the buildings look the same.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
But this is only the second country you've ever visited outside of the state.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
So if you went to Thailand, you'd just go Asia, Canada.

10:24.000 --> 10:32.000
It's like, no, if I go to Thailand, I'm like, it's like hot Australia.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
It's just, then I'll go to China, I'll be like, it's like big Thailand.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
It's like cold, Russia is like cold China.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
That's all, it's just the last place I've been to.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
There are 250 languages spoken here, which I'm sure is the case for any city

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
above a certain, you know, level of population.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
There's like 5 million people living here.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
250 languages.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Come on, some of those are fake.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Are there even 200?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
That's like, there's some, there's some fucking, like, Star Wars.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Like, India's got like 49 of them, don't they?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I guess that's true.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah, you get into these old, these much old, ancient countries

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
and they have like 25,000 languages.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
People are weird.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
I just, I get into town, I open up the first paragraph of Wikipedia

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
and I buy a hat and I'm just, I'm gold.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
You guys are very supportive.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
You should be booing by now for sure.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
God knows in Brisbane, a bowling ball would have been a shot at me.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
I used to, I told them in Melbourne, I'll tell you again,

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
if you ever see me announce a game of audience sound effects,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm in Brisbane.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Like, I was like, it was not, again, it's not their fault.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Like, it was my fault, like the energy I put into the room

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
and they were just wonderful people.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
It, but I was just, yeah.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Well, you obsessed about their language for a long time.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I did, I was doing the whole accent thing.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Oh, la-di-da, Dan's gonna do the fucking accent humor.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
To me, it wasn't like punching down.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
I was like, I was trying to learn because your accent is very, very difficult

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
from a dialectic standpoint.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
It's hard to imitate.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
But I came up with the phrase that I, I've been, I've,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Let's chart your progress and see if you're getting better.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
The phrase that I've landed on and it's again,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I know this isn't how you talk.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
This is, this is the sentence that I say.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
My note, my note going into this is Dan, it's a little too tense.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, because I'm thinking too hard about each word,

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
but if I don't think about each word, I'll just sound like a chimney sweep.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
You know, if an American tries to do Australian,

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
it's just like, he's gonna go right into Dick Van Dyke and Mary Poppins.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
But there's nuance to it.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
It's a playful, wonderful dialect.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It's, and it's, so I've been trying to learn it

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
because I want to be able to do it.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
So I arrived at this phrase.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, okay.

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
I like that hat, mate.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Don't encourage me.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I, I think they're just applauding the payoff.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
They're not, they're not saying,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Oh my God, Joe, I think he's going.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
No, no one in Australia is ever that upset about it, anything.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
At least of all the guy who likes that hat, mate.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
But it's just me trying to, I'm like each word,

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
I'm like, oh, I like that hat, mate.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
So angry.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
He's not angry though.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
You're passing a stone.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, remember the guy in the Energizer commercials?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Oi, Jackie, what was his name?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Jacko.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I'm dating myself.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Jacko.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
All right.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
All right.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Moving on.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Moving on.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
We're all human beings.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Is that one of your notes?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
No.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
This is a daily reminder.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
All right.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
So, well, I want to ask you a question.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Okay.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
So, those hotel safes, do those even work?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Like, like, like, I mean, they're fun for us.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Like we like the idea that we're locking something in those safes.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
But if you're the kind of person that finds themselves in a hotel room

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
that doesn't belong to you, which rules out most of us,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
like there's no cat burglars in this room.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Or like, like, or, or inside job hotel,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
like two larsonists, you know, like,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
those people know how to crack one of those fucking safes.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah, because if you forget your code,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
somebody there knows how to get into that safe.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And also there's a YouTube videos of the guy,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
of a guy cracking those safes.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
And there's also a YouTube video of a,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
of a spider dragging a mouse up the side of a refrigerator.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
But we're not going to talk about that.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I'm going to pretend we're in a safe place,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
even though I'm covered, I'm riddled with bites already.

14:54.000 --> 15:01.920
got me. It was a huntsman. I know a huntsman was on me. There's people that come up like

15:01.920 --> 15:05.940
behind you at the supermarket and like when you type in your like if you're paying with

15:05.940 --> 15:10.560
a credit card or a debit card or if you type in your code, there's people that have a heat

15:10.560 --> 15:15.760
sensing like app on their phone or a little add-on to their to their camera phone and

15:15.760 --> 15:19.240
it reads the numbers because you can still see the heat signature from the ones that

15:19.240 --> 15:22.520
you push. Oh jeez. I thought you were gonna, I thought you were talking about spider detectors

15:22.520 --> 15:25.520
or something. I thought you were saying there's just people in Australia. This is how bad

15:25.520 --> 15:30.400
the spider problem is. They have an app for that. Like you can see spider tracks across

15:30.400 --> 15:38.200
your dashboard. Yeah. But we were, we were, I think we were in Brisbane and I was head

15:38.200 --> 15:41.760
long into my spider anxieties and someone said there hasn't been a spider related death

15:41.760 --> 15:46.280
in Australia in 30 years and I was like, you know, a normal continent wouldn't have to

15:46.280 --> 15:53.280
say that. No one says that in North America. No one says that. And we shoot each other

15:53.280 --> 15:57.760
every day. I was reading the, there hasn't been a mass shooting in the United States

15:57.760 --> 16:07.320
in three weeks. I was reading the mass meeting more than eight. Look, I mean, yeah, exactly.

16:07.320 --> 16:14.240
That's what I'm saying. You start, when the arithmetic comes in, you're hiding something.

16:14.240 --> 16:18.440
I'm saying like there's been gerrymandering or something going on as you guys redefine

16:18.440 --> 16:23.240
spider related death. That's all I'm saying. I'm not accusing you of anything. I just

16:23.240 --> 16:27.240
know I see these videos. There's a lot of spiders down here and it's the ones you can't

16:27.240 --> 16:34.920
see that kill you. You have ones the size of apes that, that can just put you to sleep

16:34.920 --> 16:44.840
for an afternoon. And they'll go in your kitchen and make mango hummos, whatever they, they'll

16:44.840 --> 16:50.040
make a flat white, the spider will go in and make a delicious flat white, which I love.

16:50.040 --> 16:54.160
Because I cappuccino fucking, the only reason I never ordered cappuccinos because all that

16:54.160 --> 16:59.080
goddamn foam, you guys are geniuses. Thank you. Flat white. I'm going to say, I'm going

16:59.080 --> 17:02.480
to, it's catching on back in the States, the flat white. I never heard of it until this

17:02.480 --> 17:09.480
year. Me too. But then Cody said, by the way, also it's catching on back in the States.

17:09.480 --> 17:14.680
I can't wait to get back home and, and, and, and, and, and have a flat white and taste

17:14.680 --> 17:19.080
all of it because part of my brain won't be vigilant against spider attack.

17:19.080 --> 17:24.920
What do they do? It's just, it's just a coffee and they put milk on top of it.

17:24.920 --> 17:29.040
It's just, it's like a cappuccino, but I don't know. They put foam reductor in it

17:29.040 --> 17:33.440
or something. They put, they put snake venom or something in it that makes the foam go

17:33.440 --> 17:37.600
down. So it's not like a big pile of foam, like a cappuccino is so good, but then it's

17:37.600 --> 17:41.400
like it's this big, it's like a baby taking a bath. You know, there's like a big, a big

17:41.400 --> 17:44.920
cone of foam on it. Like, who are you trying to impress? This isn't liquid. What am I supposed

17:44.920 --> 17:49.480
to do with it? It gets all over your face. It's like a novelty drink, a cappuccino.

17:49.480 --> 17:55.760
They figured it out. They took the nonsense out. Oi.

17:55.760 --> 18:04.320
It's a, it's a flit. It's a flit. Oi. A flit. Oi.

18:04.320 --> 18:10.200
According to my dialect chart, that's an I is an A is a, the O is an I.

18:10.200 --> 18:17.400
Okay. All right. So, all right. So not, you know, I don't think you're going to find probably

18:17.400 --> 18:23.200
anywhere you go. Every time we go outside the United States, be it to Canada or here.

18:23.200 --> 18:33.320
Sometimes the food is wonderful, sometimes the food is bad, doesn't really matter, varies

18:33.320 --> 18:39.960
city to city, but everywhere outside the United States by virtue of or by want of the kind

18:39.960 --> 18:46.800
of like particular I think capitalist fascistic frenzy that we have there where it's like

18:46.800 --> 18:55.440
you are never more than a corned beef hash order served properly away from prison time

18:55.440 --> 19:01.280
like you like America takes its capitalism very seriously so it's food service industry

19:01.280 --> 19:06.200
again it's hit and miss in terms of the quality of the food but you better believe the people

19:06.200 --> 19:09.800
making the food and bringing it to your table they have a little hustle in their bustle

19:09.800 --> 19:11.800
that you don't find when you leave the states.

19:11.800 --> 19:16.640
In Canada you can go into restaurant and die of hunger because they're just not coming.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.560
There's just no urgency at all.

19:18.560 --> 19:24.320
And there's a you know I've had some really really good food here but yeah by and large

19:24.320 --> 19:28.840
it's kind of like yeah thanks for coming into this place where we're making food sometimes

19:28.840 --> 19:35.120
and you kind of sometimes you're kind of waiting like I went to this place but well whatever

19:35.120 --> 19:40.960
I don't want to look like this is not me complaining it is me complaining.

19:40.960 --> 19:45.400
Well it's not the place it's just the restaurant right.

19:45.400 --> 19:49.960
Well the place that we ate just before we came here was fucking an Australia's fault.

19:49.960 --> 19:55.440
Has anybody been to the rock and pool rock pool rock pool bar and grill house.

19:55.440 --> 20:02.880
It was it was like if the little rascals tried to build an eyes wide shut and all they had

20:02.880 --> 20:10.600
was the materials they just had all the black on it the Formica and the crystal but none

20:10.600 --> 20:20.200
of the acumen like I it's this weird multi-tiered labyrinthine Lego village where it's really

20:20.200 --> 20:27.200
strange and all of the wait staff they did they not they it's it's nobody who who expects

20:27.200 --> 20:35.040
a wait person the whole experience to me was like being pulled over like by a cop my head

20:35.040 --> 20:39.960
space was exactly that stressed and angry part of it felt like we were the cops like

20:39.960 --> 20:46.120
we caught them having a restaurant and they were like right mixed like they are they were

20:46.120 --> 20:51.840
like yeah they found us out they're coming for our drugs we got to make this look right

20:51.840 --> 20:55.560
yeah restaurant because we were trying to find out how to get into it because they have

20:55.560 --> 21:00.840
a thing here Jeff we have you know handicap access you know you put a ramp or something

21:00.840 --> 21:08.400
you know in America we like begrudgingly like put a ramp fine give me my subsidy here they're

21:08.400 --> 21:14.320
much more progressive but it's like it's a little confusing like we walk up to the restaurant

21:14.320 --> 21:22.280
it just it says disabled access only and we just paused in our tracks like and we're

21:22.280 --> 21:28.000
looking at a restaurant the people are cleaning glasses they're just looking at us and it's

21:28.000 --> 21:35.760
just only and we're like we just fro and we're like own only yeah like so we you can't so

21:35.760 --> 21:39.520
you can't take that would be like using a handicap stall to go in the door that's right

21:39.520 --> 21:44.400
in front of us yeah I don't think and the person just watching us playing in the glass

21:44.400 --> 21:47.360
and then we finally just like start walking away where they're looking at and we're waiting

21:47.360 --> 21:52.840
for him to go like no no no that's just a that's a that's a kind of a formality like

21:52.840 --> 21:56.760
the only part but I think it's serious but it was like that was the only way to get into

21:56.760 --> 22:01.600
this place then we went on the right down that entrance had a had a sign for the place but

22:01.600 --> 22:06.360
the proper entrance had not didn't really have the signage so like we saw what was the

22:06.360 --> 22:11.120
actual entrance and we figured out as the entrance because it was 20 stairs that was

22:11.120 --> 22:17.400
the only clue that this was the same building we were trying to enter I mean I'm gonna just

22:17.400 --> 22:28.280
show the video I took of the like that I'm not sure what to do with this up see you did

22:28.280 --> 22:32.920
some photojournalism here so you gotta set this up videography they on the on the drinks

22:32.920 --> 22:38.400
menu they had a set of rules that I posted on Instagram and we were going back and forth

22:38.400 --> 22:42.480
on whether or not the rules were like a joke or serious but either way it's fucked because

22:42.480 --> 22:47.360
if they were serious they're bullying me and if they're and if they're joking they're

22:47.360 --> 22:53.000
bullying me except then you have to divine that they're not actually bullying me they're

22:53.000 --> 23:00.440
just bullying me what what were some of the rules don't look at anyone fiercely yeah don't

23:00.440 --> 23:05.120
look don't join a conversation that's that's your bread and butter though man no that's

23:05.120 --> 23:10.920

23:45.960 --> 23:51.280
lady the lady was it was giving me water they were giving me okay so like at this point

23:51.280 --> 23:55.800
I was really agitated like I was like I said it was like being pulled over like my heart

23:55.800 --> 24:02.760
was racing and my skin was vibrating and she kept refilling my water and she came around

24:02.760 --> 24:07.760
one more time to refill my water I was like no no I'm good and she didn't say anything

24:07.760 --> 24:13.200
and she just poured me the water and as she was walking away she was like just in case

24:13.200 --> 24:20.880
and I was like I'm I'm out and I walked out because she refilled my water just deal breaker

24:20.880 --> 24:26.600
yeah well again she I told her not to and she did she was bullying you have you you created

24:26.600 --> 24:30.520
you want to create a some sort of social contract with these people and they're going to violate

24:30.520 --> 24:34.280
the simple simple things yeah I was doing it right I wasn't looking at anyone fiercely

24:34.280 --> 24:40.520
I wasn't joining a single conversation okay so I went I went to go to the bathroom in

24:40.520 --> 24:46.280
this place and then I when I came back from the bathroom I then because I was like I can't

24:46.280 --> 24:51.520
believe what I just walked through so I came back and then I took my that's why I shot

24:51.520 --> 25:00.280
in portrait mode I'm not an amateur but I I so I recreated the bathroom walk but I don't

25:00.280 --> 25:03.200
know if this will translate or not but this is what you go through to get to the bathroom

25:03.200 --> 25:20.840
in this place so you walk around there's this whole big restaurant but you go you got to

25:20.840 --> 25:26.360
go around this corner and then there's this really narrow staircase it's already like

25:26.360 --> 25:33.240
weird like you're going to an attic and it's there's a landing and then you turn and then

25:33.240 --> 25:36.640
there's another narrow staircase and at this point you're thinking okay the bathroom's

25:36.640 --> 25:46.600
coming right no this is where the wedding area is there's a wedding going on so it's

25:46.600 --> 25:49.880
starting to look like like it's like the shining like you're just going to see a guy blowing

25:49.880 --> 25:57.960
a lion or that that might just be a bathroom purgatory people never found yeah yeah they

25:57.960 --> 26:03.000
just they just fell in love and got married so then I did yeah okay so then you go passes

26:03.000 --> 26:09.960
what is this this is a kitchen what am I in the there's a stove here but there's two guys

26:09.960 --> 26:16.600
doing their taxes on it these aren't chefs wait but they're like bodyguards or something

26:16.600 --> 26:21.280
like odd job and like like like Dwayne the Rock Johnson are doing their taxes on a on

26:21.280 --> 26:26.920
an oven in the middle of a carpeted vestibule next to a wedding up two flights of narrow

26:26.920 --> 26:32.720
stairs and still no bathroom but they're like in a hotel corridor here right it's carpeted

26:32.720 --> 26:38.200
uh yeah and so okay so then you keep going and I'm getting scared so MF like I think

26:38.200 --> 26:42.120
there's bathroom male female I don't know if that's an Australian thing I'm like okay

26:42.120 --> 26:50.680
so you keep following the MF but what is this area okay services but it's blocked with a

26:50.680 --> 26:57.760
it's blocked with a couch there's something trying to get out of there like like like

26:57.760 --> 27:02.280
what is that and is that oh I that's a doorknob now I'm overreacting I thought that was like

27:02.280 --> 27:09.440
a crucifix okay but then I just run it what are the other doors electrical cupboard and

27:09.440 --> 27:19.720
the old wip hose reel they're still working on that one yeah all right so then you go

27:19.720 --> 27:24.840
down this narrow hallway of these these door I don't know if you can tell how narrow these

27:24.840 --> 27:29.400
doors are like they like a radio this is your second time doing so you know where you're

27:29.400 --> 27:33.000
going well I knew I knew to point the camera at some stuff but I'm also terrified I'm gonna

27:33.000 --> 27:36.520
get caught like because there's like guys in dinner jackets keep walking by and looking

27:36.520 --> 27:40.800
at me but I don't know if you could see like these doors like they're really narrow and

27:40.800 --> 27:44.920
they have these really high doorknobs and they don't they don't they have like this weird

27:44.920 --> 27:52.880
purple glow coming out like it's like the minority report virtual sex dungeon like there's

27:52.880 --> 27:59.000
a guy behind each door like like engaged in a different fantasy is this guy just came

27:59.000 --> 28:03.560
out of like one weird bathroom and that I don't know that was the handicap one that Chris

28:03.560 --> 28:11.400
Hardwick yes and then it says toilet and then you get your M and your F and I finally you

28:11.400 --> 28:23.360
know finally yeah thank you sir not that I see the world through that lens but oh no

28:23.360 --> 28:41.080
please well will that translate to our audio podcast listeners no but these people paid

28:41.080 --> 28:45.880
good money for can you show can you can you upload a link to that on your Yelp review

28:45.880 --> 28:53.440
of this place yeah like you better kind of just kind of have to pee when you start that

28:53.440 --> 29:02.720
process yeah man yeah and but the food was great it was Cody said her prawn was good

29:02.720 --> 29:07.000
but then halfway through the meal she said she started she she could she was seeing a

29:07.000 --> 29:11.480
cloud that wouldn't go away I don't think that's this restaurant's fault I think it

29:11.480 --> 29:15.040
was before we were when we were ordering she started to see this thing I'm really concerned

29:15.040 --> 29:22.960
about her she's back at the hotel she what am I gonna do without my being yeah thanks

29:22.960 --> 29:30.040
guys I didn't cancel the show or anything I told Steve to check in on her halfway but

29:30.040 --> 29:35.440
I got her permission to tell this story we we got we got I mean like we got to the hotel

29:35.440 --> 29:40.240
and then I guess I guess there was some maybe screw up or something I don't know I don't

29:40.240 --> 29:45.280
think I don't know what I'm not gonna throw shade on the hotel as the kids would say I

29:45.280 --> 29:48.520
don't know what they did wrong or didn't do wrong I just sat in the lobby and played

29:48.520 --> 29:52.640
cookie collector until someone handed me the hotel key we went up to the room the room

29:52.640 --> 29:58.720
was was small but whatever it's a hotel but then I guess you know our very intrepid very

29:58.720 --> 30:05.520
like she's she's the she's the civilized crocodile Dundee to our what's her name from

30:05.520 --> 30:10.920
crocodile Dundee she's our Australian guide she's our she's our she's our point person

30:10.920 --> 30:14.440
Alice Alice has been taking very good care of us she's our she's our wrangler and every

30:14.440 --> 30:19.040
time there's a problem you get to say go ask Alice like for some reason when she was just

30:19.040 --> 30:26.120
small but she I guess she she did some some wrangling at that desk and maybe between that

30:26.120 --> 30:31.520
and the niceness of the Australian people in general they upgraded our rooms so we got

30:31.520 --> 30:36.000
the guy came to our door gave us keys me and Cody we went up to a different room it was

30:36.000 --> 30:42.200
a fucking penthouse it was it was crazy there was a board room in our room there's a there's

30:42.200 --> 30:45.680
a room and then there's like two bathrooms and there's a bedroom and then there's like

30:45.680 --> 30:52.920
a hallway it's there there's a door mark WIP hose reel there's a hose reel that's a portal

30:52.920 --> 30:59.000
straight to Rockpool restaurant let's not gloss over this conference room this board

30:59.000 --> 31:05.440
room it had a conference table with how many chairs more than eight I think it was 10 person

31:05.440 --> 31:11.160
like a literal conference room it was made for board board meetings yeah and the first

31:11.160 --> 31:16.120
thing we thought when we looked at it as we got it we got a fuck on this like we got it

31:16.120 --> 31:19.680
we got it we got to do some kind of sexual role play like we don't we don't because usually

31:19.680 --> 31:26.560
when we do that we I want that report on my giant desk we usually have to we have to when

31:26.560 --> 31:30.480
we when we do our little role-playing scenarios that's what Cody and I are into again I got

31:30.480 --> 31:34.360
her permission if she's dying tonight and she don't feel bad for her that she did give

31:34.360 --> 31:40.160
me permission to tell to talk about our sex life before real quick like when they travel

31:40.160 --> 31:44.080
like we'll be somewhere on the road and we'll be getting into the hotel like we'll be out

31:44.080 --> 31:49.760
having lunch or whatever go back to the hotel and they'll be beans on the bar you can go

31:49.760 --> 31:53.880
up there and you know I'll be up in five minutes like I like what are you taking a lobby shit

31:53.880 --> 31:58.680
like you know so she can have things like it's like no she has to get in costume you

31:58.680 --> 32:03.160
know like well sometimes that's it but you guys you guys go shopping like you go in little

32:03.160 --> 32:09.240
costume shopping we go to Amazon you know it's like we order stuff on Amazon yeah when

32:09.240 --> 32:12.520
I go to pitch meetings at Amazon because they make TV I'm just like I'm always like walking

32:12.520 --> 32:16.800
out of there going like well did they say no to that TV idea because it's a bad TV idea

32:16.800 --> 32:24.240
or because they know I'm a fucking weird sex being who who always orders way too much toilet

32:24.240 --> 32:33.000
paper and like like like like just pantyhose and bulk anyways the but we did we yeah so

32:33.000 --> 32:36.440
we I was like let's do a little role play with the using the boardroom environment because

32:36.440 --> 32:40.440
we're not gonna have this ever again but it got really confusing because I tried I thought

32:40.440 --> 32:47.320
I could improvise my way through this week where I was like I was a human resources guy

32:47.320 --> 32:54.240
but I was I bet you were I was investigating her because someone had filed a complaint

32:54.240 --> 33:00.640
that she was dressed too provocatively at work and then but and then she's like well

33:00.640 --> 33:04.800
this is how I dress all the time what's wrong with this and I was like well a lot of times

33:04.800 --> 33:10.560
what happens is guys at the office or if they get aroused they'll like they'll like try to

33:10.560 --> 33:18.920
try to get revenge like by filing a complaint and I'm sorry it's their word against yours

33:18.920 --> 33:26.880
unless and it was getting really cuz she's trying to like yes she's like where are you

33:26.880 --> 33:35.400
going with this like I say what did and she's like is this about that she just made this

33:35.400 --> 33:41.120
is about what did she say Jason Ortega Jason or take no this is nothing to do with Jason

33:41.120 --> 33:46.920
Ortega no he he well yeah I mean all I can tell you is that multiple people have filed

33:46.920 --> 33:52.440
complaints about your provocative clothing and that and I was just like so I didn't know

33:52.440 --> 33:58.560
how she was yes and in you but you absolutely know her her yeah well I was like Jason Ortega

33:58.560 --> 34:02.600
may or may not be a part of this okay I was trying to figure out I was like how did you

34:02.600 --> 34:06.360
think that you could jump into this pool and find your way to any edge that had to do with

34:06.360 --> 34:12.480
having sex before we have to go to dinner and so the way I got through it was as like look

34:12.480 --> 34:24.440
there's exceptions we can make if I can prove that my dick fits in your pussy if I can prove

34:24.440 --> 34:36.080
that it's just you as an individual that is arousing and not your outfits I then I can take

34:36.080 --> 34:44.480
your side I'm hard as a fucking diamond right like the whole time we're having sex I'm like

34:44.480 --> 34:52.360
justifying I'm like yeah see this isn't your fault you were you were born this way I mean

34:52.360 --> 34:57.960
yeah the outfit's great but it's your it's the way it's on you and and wow you're great

34:57.960 --> 35:04.680
at this and and so I think I think you I think I'm gonna file a favorable report with human

35:04.680 --> 35:14.560
resources all over you maybe the last encounter she ever has with me is a badly improvised

35:14.560 --> 35:20.880
sexual play don't you don't reveal anything you don't want to reveal obviously but I don't

35:20.880 --> 35:27.640
get specific but like I I know that you guys do these fairly elaborate like backstory like

35:27.640 --> 35:33.960
role-playing things so you are doing like improv yeah you're doing a little scene yeah

35:33.960 --> 35:39.480
yeah and like how good are you guys staying in character like I really good yeah that's

35:39.480 --> 35:43.400
the problem with like the Jason Ortega or something that will throw somebody you know

35:43.400 --> 35:47.840
we don't want to we don't want to break like we don't we don't tend to you know you could

35:47.840 --> 35:50.960
have done you should have said that yeah it was about Jason Ortega then you make up what

35:50.960 --> 35:58.480
he said okay Jeff and you're reenacted you should be making love to my girlfriend it's

35:58.480 --> 36:01.320
easy what if right at that moment she goes this is about Jason Ortega and you're like

36:01.320 --> 36:04.760
no no it could it be it might not it could be anybody and then knock knock knock and

36:04.760 --> 36:13.080
I'm there and I have a Jason name tag on your dress is a mariachi okay all right well it's

36:13.080 --> 36:21.960
a little over the top but Jason Ortega is here yeah Jason Ortega that's too specific

36:21.960 --> 36:26.120
that has to be a high school something like that sounds like a famous person right yeah

36:26.120 --> 36:31.400
but she actually said well she explained afterward because we like to go back over it when we're

36:31.400 --> 36:38.600
done like like well I you know I grabbed the towel and then we kind of like well back in

36:38.600 --> 36:44.320
Albuquerque I took a left because I thought no you did but it's she was she was the first

36:44.320 --> 36:48.440
name off the top of her head she was afraid was gonna like upset me because it was somebody

36:48.440 --> 36:53.800
we were been talking about earlier and that she that so she had to like really like hang

36:53.800 --> 37:01.800
a hard left off of a more naturally improvised name because it was you no I'm kidding but

37:01.800 --> 37:07.120
anyways all right so like like like look no no Harmontown show abroad would be complete

37:07.120 --> 37:16.400

a legal procedure here I write I like I write little phrases for the Australian guests to

40:06.640 --> 40:11.120
read to verify their Australian miss because if I said this I wouldn't sound Australian

40:11.120 --> 40:18.320
are you read that it's at the top in boldface right there's more spider's here than people

40:18.320 --> 40:22.320

40:35.520 --> 40:49.760
truth that crux of splasher the crux of splasher that's what you guys say if you take a shit

40:49.760 --> 40:57.000
truth that crux of splasher someone should someone should tame that thing are you from

40:57.000 --> 41:03.760
here I'm originally from Lithgow in the Blue Mountains let's go popular people apparently

41:03.760 --> 41:11.200
know Lithgow I'm living in Wollongong at the moment which is south a little bit Wollongong

41:11.200 --> 41:15.520
Wollongong yeah that's I'm going to university there I love it but I spent a fair bit of

41:15.520 --> 41:19.760
time in Sydney my brother lives here so yeah what do you do relevant up until recently

41:19.760 --> 41:25.520
I was a science interpreter so teaching science to kids working at a planetarium now I'm currently

41:25.520 --> 41:31.120
not doing that I pulled out of that because I'm doing my masters in teaching oh good

41:31.120 --> 41:38.200
news right what do you want to teach I have a degree in history and one in English lit

41:38.200 --> 41:45.440
so either either or yeah okay so as a history teacher I got the brains on Ryan yeah can

41:45.440 --> 41:54.400
you verify for me that we are in the States we are fucked that we're like historically

41:54.400 --> 42:02.080
like fucking 1932 fucks I don't want to be an alarmist but yeah I mean we have to at

42:02.080 --> 42:07.280
this point like everybody that everybody the internet's always like oh you know compared

42:07.280 --> 42:12.400
to Hitler it's like I don't care man I don't care about a party foul if somebody's so much

42:12.400 --> 42:19.280
like Hitler that that I really I would really love to be wrong I'm fine with that but I if

42:19.280 --> 42:24.880
I'm right I think it's important to be right earlier than later I think that maybe people

42:24.880 --> 42:30.640
should have compared Hitler to Hitler sooner yeah I know exactly what you mean and I think

42:30.640 --> 42:34.960
most Australians will agree with me when I say it was kind of hilarious for a little while

42:34.960 --> 42:42.080
while what's happening like Hitler yeah because he literally looked like Charlie Chaplin okay

42:42.080 --> 42:46.560
people are like you're hilarious but come on you can't talk like that you're going to jail

42:46.560 --> 42:51.040
and he's like I'm gonna write a dumb book and I was like this dumb book is great said the morons

42:51.040 --> 42:55.040
and then it's like everything was like perfect parallel yeah and then it's the first thing he

42:55.040 --> 43:05.680
did when he got elected not by a majority but by the German electoral college yeah when he

43:05.680 --> 43:12.720
swept Michigan yeah yeah there's this there's this patch of field next to right on the armpit of the

43:12.720 --> 43:23.760
of the of the of the Rhine where everyone has 300 votes anyways the Harmon save it for your therapist

43:26.320 --> 43:32.080
what what what so where are you guys at because there's so many strange like

43:32.720 --> 43:40.960
flippy floppies that happen I mean like in the human sense you can just tell a hip progressive

43:40.960 --> 43:47.040
liberal person from from a from a kind of more starchy conservative person no matter where you

43:47.040 --> 43:51.840
go but everybody has different words for the stuff and also it's not just semantics because

43:52.400 --> 43:57.920
you depending on where you're at you're the progressives could be secessionists or progressives

43:57.920 --> 44:02.320
could be like gun nuts like like that's happening in the States right now is like I feel like I

44:02.320 --> 44:07.840
want to buy a gun and dig a hole and like wait for Trump to try to pry my gun out of my cold

44:07.840 --> 44:12.640
dead fingers which doesn't mean I'm like a constitution nut now what did somebody's yelling

44:12.640 --> 44:19.040
something out what's was it worth it yeah our conservative yeah yeah it's called the liberal

44:19.040 --> 44:22.880
I know that's the first thing I found out is it's a careful because you check yeah our liberals are

44:22.880 --> 44:28.560
Nazis they were like uh I was like what it's crazy but then you go like well what does republican

44:28.560 --> 44:33.840
mean like all these guys love republics so much it's never really made any sense it's just anybody

44:33.840 --> 44:38.800
knows what I wanted to ask you is like like can you like and if you don't want to take the slings

44:38.800 --> 44:43.680
and arrows but if it's like a hot button and you're like I don't I came up here to talk about my

44:43.680 --> 44:47.680
beautiful hair like I don't know but you're a history teacher that sounds like you have the

44:47.680 --> 44:57.040
respect of the crowd like where where are you where are you where is where is Australia at right

44:57.040 --> 45:03.520
now as this world is shifting into what I would call a factors leading to chapter in the history

45:03.520 --> 45:10.240
book uh nationalist revolution it's kind of hard to say to be honest we're caught between

45:10.800 --> 45:19.280
yeah we're fucked we're fucked you're fucked too yeah I think we're we're all kind of a little

45:19.280 --> 45:23.520
bit fucked um that that goes just the subtitles of what's going on over here

45:26.160 --> 45:31.120
the our current prime ministers like the most smug rich guy you can possibly imagine

45:31.120 --> 45:37.680
he's he's maybe better than the last guy maybe there's a turn turnball right yeah turnball is

45:37.680 --> 45:49.840
our current p.m. and then tony abbot tiny abbot tony is this like is it more like crocodile

45:49.840 --> 45:57.040
dundee than I thought like a prime minister is donk uh and then tiny abbots are uh or president

45:57.040 --> 46:01.920
no okay uh tony tony abbot he he was like a monumental piece of shit but

46:05.120 --> 46:10.720
he he didn't really have the wherewithal to hide it so everyone knew he was a piece of

46:10.720 --> 46:15.280
shit whereas uh turnball kind of hides it a bit better so I feel like he's winning some people

46:15.280 --> 46:21.120
over just because he's a bit more swarmy and stuff so uh yeah he's probably a lot worse but he

46:21.120 --> 46:27.280
comes across as slightly more palatable yeah which is worrying that's why I felt so fucked in the

46:27.280 --> 46:31.680
states is because it's not it's not donald trump like we have that it's it's it's it's actually

46:31.680 --> 46:36.960
it's either centuries or millennia payback of fixation on the hero worship the principle the

46:36.960 --> 46:42.320
idea that there's people that can make a difference it's as opposed to each individual has to like

46:42.320 --> 46:48.160
really create their own world and like like like work practically toward a world that functions for

46:48.160 --> 46:52.720
all of us we all have this tendency to we just it just takes a big load off our shoulders when

46:52.720 --> 46:56.640
we pick this favorite person to speak for us or that that person's going to bring about stuff so

46:56.640 --> 47:02.320
we can kind of do what we do best which is not much at all and that's just that's just us being good

47:02.320 --> 47:08.160
orangutans you know like like that's just whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa sorry uh

47:08.160 --> 47:10.160
uh

47:16.160 --> 47:20.560
did I hear that wrong or do or do Australians just yell out baking soda when they get excited

47:23.280 --> 47:24.160
baking soda

47:26.240 --> 47:31.120
yeah your plastic submarine's going up and in baking soda

47:31.120 --> 47:34.320
yeah

47:35.200 --> 47:38.880
baking soda remove the odor from your fridgey

47:43.440 --> 47:47.360
baking soda no what did he say i have no idea what did you say

47:49.680 --> 47:55.120
yeah i can say it's my word yeah you can say it's my word oh he can say okay right

47:55.120 --> 48:00.960
so yeah yeah it was funny i that happens to me a lot too it's like well it's not funny now

48:02.560 --> 48:07.280
it was funny when i yelled it out and i didn't mumble it so i don't deserve this

48:08.640 --> 48:15.440
i nailed it the first time they all laughed you got gum in your dumb yanky ears very good sir

48:15.440 --> 48:23.280
good job on that joke dots connected culturally uh all right so anyway so it's all right so what

48:23.280 --> 48:28.480
what what are you going to tell kids to do as you're teaching them history and you're you're

48:28.480 --> 48:35.280
also thinking in your head i have no future to teach you because like it's it's grow gills or

48:35.280 --> 48:41.440
drown like do you just hide that from them i don't know i'm i'm a little bit optimistic honestly

48:41.440 --> 48:46.320
the more i work with kids the more i have faith in the future oh so like like like like

48:46.320 --> 48:54.080
it's it's honestly true it's like when you meet a baby boomer that's when the red flags

48:54.080 --> 48:58.400
start popping up in my head yeah or a millennial so maybe having a soul skips a generation yeah

49:04.400 --> 49:07.760
that's when i keep thinking because i'm from a thing called generation x i don't know if they

49:07.760 --> 49:11.840
have that's maybe just an american thing but it's like we're out number 10 to 1 on both sides

49:11.840 --> 49:16.880
our parents are these huge douchebags that like they had their own trivial pursuit edition and

49:16.880 --> 49:23.040
like they invented the beetles and the moon and all this shit like well it's like everyone

49:23.040 --> 49:28.320
makes movies for them and they're just like jack off to references to their lifetime like what

49:28.320 --> 49:36.400
that's what chuck willery uh oh i just can't suck willery uh but but and then and then and then

49:36.400 --> 49:43.440
my generation was like i hate my parents that's enough for me and then but then we had kids and

49:43.440 --> 49:49.280
these the the people they're like they're like little baby boomers i always said that like they

49:49.280 --> 49:55.280
love they love their parents and they love the president and teamwork and and i just like it

49:55.280 --> 50:01.040
just like it started with like we're we're shiny star people we could use an ipad better and and

50:01.040 --> 50:07.040
it was like you're adorable but there's something fucking orwellian about your like like and and

50:07.040 --> 50:11.280
and then they just like they just didn't hit their teenage years and it was like i know we're one

50:11.280 --> 50:16.400
orwellian dictator from these kids in a jumpsuit like they're gonna flip like a fucking othello piece

50:16.400 --> 50:23.120
like and and and and but but anyway why am i why did i bring you up here to just talk at you i've

50:23.120 --> 50:26.960
already said all this stuff what do you tell us the solution tell us how to fix the world

50:26.960 --> 50:32.400
so i'm gonna get a drink you want to drink i would love a drink all right well when i come back

50:32.400 --> 50:42.800
you better have a please solution to everything is murder getting a drink probably yeah yeah maybe

50:42.800 --> 50:49.600
maybe it's murder nah yeah no it's i know it's murder you just you can't you can't do it that's

50:49.600 --> 50:54.960
the problem i'm i'm touching your eyes i hope that's okay yeah but that's my friend of a friend

50:54.960 --> 51:00.480
of mine is dating some guy uh down in like like like like in central america and like they they're

51:00.480 --> 51:06.080
super hippy ecologist types they live in like mud huts and whatnot and and it's all about saving

51:06.080 --> 51:10.400
the planet which sounds amazing but then the more you find out about this guy is that he's a complete

51:10.400 --> 51:17.040
psychopath and he's like he's kind of like a low-level wannabe cult guy where like women have

51:17.040 --> 51:21.520
like that have to hang out with him like you can't talk to your parents and you can't talk to anybody

51:21.520 --> 51:26.880
that lives in a city because that's all evil and you have to just live with me and connect to

51:26.880 --> 51:32.320
nature and he starts like running these people's lives and one of his solutions like that he really

51:32.320 --> 51:36.080
thinks that the way to save the planet is just to start killing people yeah man

51:39.040 --> 51:43.520
yeah that's what i'm saying start with that guy though fuck him

51:43.520 --> 51:53.520
right it's the world's shortest oh henry novel

51:55.120 --> 52:00.080
lead by example motherfucker it's a two-minute twilight zone episode

52:01.520 --> 52:04.240
time enough for genocide at last wait me

52:06.560 --> 52:11.920
uh i i i do have that like wasn't it one of the one of the two guys was it watson or crick

52:11.920 --> 52:17.760
who uh they did the guys that discovered the shape of dna one of them one of them's like a cosmic

52:17.760 --> 52:22.400
dna guy that said that said like oh dna couldn't have evolved on earth there's not enough time

52:22.400 --> 52:27.680
mathematically and i don't know if it's the same guy but there's another of the two in an uncomfortable

52:27.680 --> 52:34.800
cringey way uh has gone on record as saying that stupidity is a disease and we should cure it with

52:34.800 --> 52:40.320
eugenics you know like oh some people are just dumb they're just born dumb and like that's like any

52:40.320 --> 52:45.040
other disability and why don't we cull that from the population if we're interested in that it's

52:45.040 --> 52:54.800
like oh okay uh boy in the australian and the yiddish uh like like neither of us want to go there

52:55.600 --> 53:01.440
but but but like like but then you what then in my country where or my prison colony where

53:01.440 --> 53:06.000
where where this this this recent thing happened it was like i just started feeling even before

53:06.000 --> 53:11.920
the election actually kind of went the way it did i i i started having this like weird like

53:11.920 --> 53:17.280
i was just like fuck stupid people i just don't i don't like it's not like i i graduated college

53:17.280 --> 53:21.760
so by stupid i must mean something else and i know definitely fuck stupid people but but

53:21.760 --> 53:26.960
should we just should we just go to war no but i mean i don't know the thing is democracy makes

53:26.960 --> 53:31.280
us hate stupid people because their stupidity counts as much as ours or more because you

53:31.280 --> 53:35.680
know we live in california and our vote counts less than someone who lives in wyoming and we're

53:35.680 --> 53:41.120
better than wyoming and wyoming's full of idiots you hear that wyoming yeah go fuck yourself

53:42.720 --> 53:46.080
i used to tell people wyoming didn't exist and no one challenged me

53:48.800 --> 53:52.240
that's a true story my whole middle school was just lying to people

53:53.840 --> 53:57.760
because you know as you could tell i'm an authoritative source that sounds like i know what

53:57.760 --> 54:04.640
i'm talking about so it just it all tracks you know what all right as a teacher i'm glad that

54:04.640 --> 54:10.240
you're a good person Spencer because you can be really terrifying no i know i'd probably be more

54:10.240 --> 54:15.920
effective if i just embraced the evil but you know that's what i think sometimes i think like let's

54:15.920 --> 54:20.800
just be super villains like let's create a bomb that kills all the dumb people right yeah or just

54:20.800 --> 54:24.640
take everybody to the moon i guess like i've been harping about we could just do that or just you

54:24.640 --> 54:34.000
know fix education system in america that would help that's that sounds hard it is hard i got it all

54:34.000 --> 54:39.920
figured out um what do you think i should do as a now i'm talking to the history that to the to the

54:39.920 --> 54:48.480
leader of children the consumer of my hit podcast uh and just a general like nice seeming guy like

54:48.480 --> 54:53.280
what do you think i should do in the face of all this i'll give you the spectrum in my head is

54:53.280 --> 55:01.200
ranges from i'm supposed to uh use my pulpit to make people uh think correctly or do accomplish

55:01.200 --> 55:05.600
something and then the on the other side i'm supposed to stop thinking about this and and

55:05.600 --> 55:13.360
give people something to laugh about with my rubber ducky uh squeaking forget okay i i think you

55:13.360 --> 55:19.600
should write kung fu panda four like what is the what am i what's the path like my therapist can't

55:19.600 --> 55:23.600
help me because she used to tell me oh i would come in all upset about trump i would go you know

55:23.600 --> 55:27.760
there's a weight nationalist movement happening and she would go it's secondhand smoke it's the

55:27.760 --> 55:34.560
internet you're exposing yourself and then trump wanted she was like oops uh but but anyways like

55:34.560 --> 55:38.240
yeah so i can't really i don't really know what i'm supposed to do like what who am i i don't know

55:38.240 --> 55:55.440
who i am tell me you beautiful crimson viking honestly if you're if your therapist can't help you

55:55.440 --> 56:01.360
i probably can't help too much but but also a little risk high yield because i mean you'll never

56:01.360 --> 56:05.440
see me again this is like a you're up yeah okay one night stand tomorrow because i will be here

56:05.440 --> 56:12.080
for your other show okay so if uh if you don't improve by tomorrow you can give it to me then

56:12.080 --> 56:20.800
uh um that is exactly what i meant someone's gonna get a jason nortigan name tag

56:28.800 --> 56:33.760
all right what do you think now i'm turned on again uh i don't know shave your head move out

56:33.760 --> 56:39.760
into the wilderness start yourself a little commune joe yeah that's joe rogan you're right

56:39.760 --> 56:46.880
you just gotta i honestly i i read uh the blog post you put on tumblr just after the election yeah

56:46.880 --> 56:53.200
just me me that that's that's what the uh nazis call virtue signaling that's what that's what they

56:53.200 --> 57:01.040
tell me i'm doing white knighting mansplaining uh beta beta pussying like i'm just trying i just

57:01.040 --> 57:05.280
my instinct was just to like i hope the women feel better and i hope they think i'm a good person

57:05.280 --> 57:10.240
i don't know i think i think that's the stuff i like is the way you write has a lot of conviction

57:10.240 --> 57:14.960
to it every now and then you'll write something that is a little bit more open and susceptible

57:14.960 --> 57:21.040
to change so with that when i was reading that it felt like you were more open to changing

57:21.760 --> 57:27.360
your perspectives on things that's what i like to see and it's yeah easy it's yeah but then i

57:27.360 --> 57:33.120
should commit to that like i'm an epiphany addict i just apologize i should i should just open like

57:33.120 --> 57:38.240
an apology warehouse and just like like gives people like handcrafted apologies like i don't

57:38.240 --> 57:41.840
think you should force it i think you should just maybe embrace it when it happens because otherwise

57:41.840 --> 57:47.040
if you're just constantly forcing that kind of catharsis it's nothing i guess i think the simple

57:47.040 --> 57:52.800
answer for me the obvious answer is write a movie like like like use like like write a community

57:52.800 --> 57:59.280
movie which i think but like like Dan a long time ago uh when we were both broke we've talked about

57:59.280 --> 58:02.640
this in the show before like we would like pay each other's rent back and forth depending on who

58:02.640 --> 58:07.920
was up or down in the chips at the time and uh there's a script that dan wanted to write based

58:07.920 --> 58:12.320
on a certain mythological like greek myth character and so like that i i always really wanted to do

58:12.320 --> 58:19.280
like what wanted to see dan write that and and uh you've got 19 000 tv shows going now so you're

58:19.280 --> 58:25.840
not and you got a book and all this stuff so but like i think use the the knife that's in your

58:25.840 --> 58:35.760
or you know in your knife holder i see i ain't no writer but like like use use use the tools

58:35.760 --> 58:39.920
that you're good at like like write stuff like write things about like because you know the

58:39.920 --> 58:44.960
joke in the documentary is that you you're a writer that writes about heroes and heroes by nature

58:44.960 --> 58:48.320
have to change that's the point of a heroic journey that you start one way and you end

58:48.960 --> 58:54.880
something bigger um and that you're an epiphany junkie and you don't change it like that's you

58:54.880 --> 58:59.920
know you've talked about that before so maybe you don't have to change but you have to keep writing

58:59.920 --> 59:03.760
stories with heroes that do because that's the you know that's that's the point of art is that it

59:03.760 --> 59:10.720
makes sense of suffering and makes you know like it gives us a language of change i'm done that's

59:10.720 --> 59:22.720
what i meant but first a quick game of audience sound effects i think we should play that's why

59:22.720 --> 59:26.880
i brought it up because i was like that'd be a funny callback he explained it and then all right

59:26.880 --> 59:35.680
well uh i already forgot your name ryan ryan one more thing have you ever heard of the porn phrase

59:35.680 --> 59:44.880
cf nm yeah it's clothed female nude male yeah i just discovered it and it's very exciting to me

59:44.880 --> 59:51.520
it's great it's a naked dude but the woman's dress personally i don't care if the guy's naked or not

59:51.520 --> 59:56.560
but i like the clothed female part it's like but you can't just type in cf and just oh well i guess

59:56.560 --> 01:00:03.440
that's non-nude but but yeah it's it's exciting i'm very attracted to clothed women i understand

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.120
there's a lot of clothed women in the audience right now

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.480
almost don't remind me almost two thirds

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.200
yeah okay yeah i was just wondering oh and also have you uh where is this going

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.160
i'm just asking him some stuff he's on the audience is responding to him yeah he's popping

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.440
i i i think i speak for the audience and i think we're all kind of falling on levels ryan

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:38.320
yeah we love him we love him he's a good sydney cider did you have you downloaded mario uh run

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.640
it's like 15 bucks or something isn't it well there's a paywall i feel like the first four

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.720
levels three levels and then you have to pay i think it's like 10 bucks what i knew there was

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:54.080
paywalls but that's fucking crazy yeah god dang so that can't be funny anymore i should leave

01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:02.000
i'll go it'll be fine that's so fucking stupid god damn it it's i want to flip this table

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.960
i would i would i'd have to put it back that's the problem i like the fact that you were quiet

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:20.640
during the trump and the hitler stuff but mario really i'm trying speaking of trump i this is

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.440
probably just false hope to cling to but i heard someone talking you know now that the fbi has

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:31.200
agreed that russia is definitely hacked the election um the thing is like trump could be

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:38.160
tried for treason because he knew and possibly aided and abetted in the help helping a hostile

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:44.720
foreign power wage war on our country which is literally the definition of treason so i think

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.880
that there's actually a treason case that could be made against him yeah then then yeah then then

01:01:50.880 --> 01:02:01.680
it's just sit back and let common sense take its course it's not gonna happen i mean i mean i

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.880
mean it has to happen it needs to happen but like like no it's not like the horse has left a stable

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.280
well i mean like like people keep predicting they'll go like oh well he's gonna he's the medicare

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.640
like like the people who are gonna the people that got him elected they're gonna lose their

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:20.320
fucking obama care it's it's it's poor white old people with like ptsd from wars and stuff that

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.280
we're getting insurance under obama that didn't understand what that meant and we're like fuck

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:30.960
obama care because it was like dog whistle for like black guy care like like they were like

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.880
there's a black guy in the white house but that means what smart white people would rather hang

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.960
out with smart black people than me um they they've they've got fucking mad and they overthrew

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.880
the like anyways i'm saying those people are gonna get their fucking health benefits taken away

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:55.040
but they're not gonna then go wait a minute i think this guy was with inhuman hair who is like

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.080
he wears fucking ball caps you can't be president you wear a goddamn trucker hat who is you know

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.520
that was a big trick that was that was a political strategy because he knows how fucking insane his

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.120
hair is and that took it completely out of the picture i can't be shot you can't have all these

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.920
pictures i think he wore it like when he got off of like a helicopter yeah exactly where there's

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.320
wind yeah exactly and it took it out of the equation he's like this is my life now i think

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.480
i think it was smarter than that even it was smarter that the fucking word can't be used i

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.280
i i think it was more strategic than that because like that that guy like like he's been wearing

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:37.120
that hair for a long time and like like like it's been fine like banding it about but i that baseball

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.840
cap was a real signifier to this whole rust belt like it was like like there's a baseball cap i'm

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.840
gonna wear it indoors and it's gonna have like generic felt letters ironed on to it there's

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.040
nothing fancy about it because every every every trump supporter i've talked to it's like it always

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.320
comes down to like this anti-intellectual kind of revolution like it comes down to this like you've

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.840
smart frasiers think that you're so smart but i guess you weren't smart enough to win and and

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:08.480
like i i grew up in milwaukee like i just like i like like i'm like hey man i'm i'm i'm down for

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:15.040
an anti-intellectual revolution i want to be i want to be dirty and ludite and fucking isolationist

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:22.000
maybe kind of but why is our leader a east coast trust fund pussy like what anyways you guys don't

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.680
need to hear this you have your own problems what am i doing why would i come here and dump this on

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:31.440
you you you already probably have to read about it in the like the australian gazette you're like

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:38.080
there's why is the why are we reading about this guy he's a million miles away if he the day he

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.800
decided to come here it'd be 15 hours from from here you guys could like by the time he got here

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:48.160
you could just punch him i just love that for five days i have not heard i haven't watched any u.s

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:53.760
news sources i i read a couple ozzie papers read a very uplifting story about a dog who saved a

01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:01.680
baby from a snake i saw a story the fucking snake bit the dog and then they took the dog in and six

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.240
thousand dollars for the for the dog they paid six thousand dollars to get that dog alive because

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.520
he's a baby-saving dog yeah well the yeah that's that's us that's that's the whole point of the

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.240
of uh you know breeding like uh you want to definitely want that dog to have more dogs

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.360
like that's that's what that's what got us to them bringing us newspapers is like that it's like

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.240
that thing saved a baby so this one didn't save a baby but you're talking about you're talking about

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:35.280
dog you're talking about dog eugenics now yeah we don't want to practice that on each other we

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:42.480
don't yeah because you can't you steven hawking never brought anybody a newspaper like like well

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.160
he brought us a new way of thinking about black holes he did it just took a lot longer

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.960
as the comic verna Chapman said steven hawking sure he can talk to talk oh boy

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:08.480

that will save the united states like when we are being we've been taken over by the soviets yeah

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:08.080
yeah the the mad max won't be a tough guy in a car it'll be a teacher yeah yeah dropping in on some

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:15.680
homemade weather balloon that he made out of rabbit pelts and pickle skin pickle skin pickle

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.160
skin yeah just i don't know i just i tried to improvise something savage sounding

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:27.120
because it's the most wild thing i've encountered in 30 years is pickle skin

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:34.800
and the wikipedia entry for sydney there's a lot of spiders here all right hot canada

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.560

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.800
cities is there i don't know what livable means i don't know what that means this is not funny this

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.560
is just true i had one of the best dinners of my life i'm vegetarian went to bowdie that place

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:56.480
was fucking good okay oh man me too i uh i left rock pool because i was disgusted with the place

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:03.440
and then i went home and i went back to the hotel and i put on good burger and i ate a whole box of

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:12.560
cheez-its yeah do you guys have cheez-its here oh they're great you get you get you some all right

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.560
let's meet another let's meet another australian that that that it's i want to tell you in advance

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:22.960
whoever you are it's okay for you to disappoint us you can't follow that just just commit to being

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:29.600
yourself people they that's the sound of people already forgiving you in advance for being a huge

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:37.440
letdown uh should we base it on something i would usually just go go out there i guess but

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:45.680
but that's how that's how i got uh what's his name ryan he's he's the worst person he really is bad

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:52.720
i just don't have okay so the thing is do you know how like a baby's brain it runs on glucose so

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.480
in your this is my theory now i'm not a doctor i was not familiar with that but i think that when

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.800
you're learning to do things like walk and run and throw a ball and recognize faces and things

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.840
i think that your your brain is going like oh this part of the brain is really important this part is

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.600
not so much important i think recognizing names and faces and things just just my brain just never

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.560
i just think i'm like i just have like a dead spot in my brain like i can't that's my excuse that's

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:26.480
on the line i just think if you ever think if you think i'm a bad person because he's like oh why

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.400
doesn't he remember me why doesn't he remember my name or my face it's right before you think what

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:37.440
that guy's an asshole then i that's when i swoop in with it i was bullied i think what you're saying

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.560
is that when god was handing out baby glucose you were at the back of the line yeah i was like like

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.320
what did what did it profit me oh oh oh the guy on the left that's giving me a swirly in the toilet

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:55.680
that's naphin oh great i'll be sure to ask him about soccer next time did you ever actually get a

01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:01.280
swirly uh i think i think my brother probably like read about swirly's and like tried to give me one

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:07.360
maybe you guys know what a swirly is right yeah it's when you put someone's head in the toilet

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:13.680
and then flush it right it's also called drowning somebody you call it waterboarding these days

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:18.720
yeah yeah i mean news flash like physically forcing anyone into any position physically

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.920
it's like are you leaving what's going on yeah i'm going i'm coming up into the stands turning

they're a pragmatic people here it's a port town dan walked up all the way to the back and there was

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.640
a guy right down the front well that's hard to ignore all right going up all right

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:23.200
if you're keeping track there's no women in city what's your name sir what's your name

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.280

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.960
what's up kenny there's spencer grab one of these microphones here

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.360
kenny you're looking very biz cash i like that thank you is this on yeah i could all right

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.760
kenny you're up against a lot you know like like like it was bad enough you're following ryan but

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:55.040
you did it voluntarily like you're like i'm the guy but like you can hear they're like there's like

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:59.840
a kind of a break in the energy and they're all discussing you they're going like i look to that

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:05.280
time i think he might be a nip switchy i'm looking forward to the reddit threads yeah yeah i've seen

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:12.080
the ones about brisbane don't go don't go to reddit i know go to reddit to read about anything

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:17.280
other than yourself is my advice yeah well normally i'm not on reddit so it's fine you are now yeah

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.000
that's true you're gonna be yeah i will regret it all right so what's your name's kenny we already

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.920
know that all right what what gives um how are you going okay so i don't know i guess the reason

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:36.560
i wanted to come up how many worries do you have seven um you're supposed to have no worries oh well

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:42.000
i have like crippling social anxiety so it's like really yeah yeah it's like you thought oh go on stage

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.160
yeah that's exactly that's actually yeah that's why i went skydiving because heights are terrifying

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.240
yeah yeah exactly well that's like where they are the heights i got married

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.120
it's the good place to go you just blew my fucking mind

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.400
all right so well but that's literally it do you want me to just dig in or i'll mean yeah if you

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.800
want but like i think one of the other reasons is i uh i went to la earlier this year and i saw one

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:12.880
of your shows and um i was hoping to do that who came from the furthest and then i would be like

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:19.280
australia and then it didn't happen but that's fine i'm here now oh more to the point you're here now

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.160
so yeah yeah and i came the farthest now yeah exactly that's that's why that's why we have you

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.240
up on stage yeah but it would have been weird for everybody in the audience together who came the

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:34.240
farthest when i came out because i'd be like me me me me well i probably didn't come the farthest

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.440
tonight so that's fine all right now you say you have crippling social anxiety sure how does that like

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.040
let's just let's just let's just presume you do

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:55.040
let's just make that the premise uh like what is that like how does that manifest in your daily

01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:01.040
life or um well i mean i've gotten better with it since like working in retail um because you

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:07.600
learn to pretend that the people aren't actually people it's sort of like you know westworld

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.280
they're all just hosts and they're on their loop they're just like they want something and then

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.120
you have to have some exchange with them and stuff and it's yeah it's like i'm pretending

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.880
i basically associate but if it's westworld aren't you the host actually that's pretty apt i'm in

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:28.160
my cycle yeah working retail yeah yeah would you like a drink um it's probably entertaining to see

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:32.800
me heave every time i take a sip so sure yeah i don't do well with spirits but sure let's go ahead

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:38.080
no that's not for you no no it's fine it's fine i'll i'll be ready we'll we'll get you a nice

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:45.120
shoot of armor then i'll be great yeah i mean i got through here yeah it's fine you don't have to

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.160
drink that no no no don't don't give me i like drinking it's just that it's the only thing here

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:58.320
so that's fine yeah no it's not uh okay not okay he's just saying what you're a beer guy yeah

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.840
there's no beer apparently yeah exactly that's fine dude you just you made jeff leave

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.480
he you offended him oh wait oh okay yeah i didn't see what happened it's beer country i wouldn't

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.280
i wouldn't presume that anybody i've i've i've had to i've had to walk many many bartenders

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:23.040
through making me a negroni uh on this trip i don't know what that is yeah exactly it's a drink it's

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:29.600
it's a it's a equal parts sweet vermouth gin and compari so no it's a yummy daytime beverage it's

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:37.600
there you go all right you've got you've got a coke a beer and a you got the beer

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:45.600
all right thank you jeff

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.960
all right there we go you don't have to it's not it's not a competition

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.120
no it's australian all right kenny uh it's not a competition it's australian

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:12.000
okay so we'll okay we'll we'll tell us more uh what would you like to know social anxiety

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.080
ah you don't you don't have the handshake of a socially anxious person

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.840
when dan was walking through the crowd looking for somebody you was like i said you want to come

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:25.520
on stage is there something that you feel like you could like gain from this experience or

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:32.160
it's just being up here and and like letting this weird feeling happen be it's its own reward

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.040
i think uh i realized earlier this year this is actually after i went to see a show and everything

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:42.640
i was like listening to um grandma's virginity podcast and listening to like justin and ryan

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.840
talking about writing and then it suddenly dawned on me that i want to be a fucking writer so like

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:54.160
one uh like physics degree later and working in retail and everything i've finally realized what

01:17:54.160 --> 01:18:06.000
i want to do and uh it's it's sort of like uh and i realized like having i can't count how many

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.240
times i've marathoned community and everything so i realized that um after all this time you're

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.120
probably the closest thing i have to like an idol sort of thing like not it no don't don't

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.480
fucking do that no it's not this is not a hero worship thing this is just like a i i really

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:28.000
do you feel bad for you they're like oh like oh you really gotta i'm used to that expand your

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.240
horizon yeah look at his idol i hear um was it ockerman i should go for him yeah i go between

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:43.920
me and ockerman uh i'd go i'd go ockerman these days i mean what sort of physics uh like was

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.840
there any specialty in that i mean it was only a bachelor's before i realized i didn't fucking

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:53.600
want to do it so um let's experiment with i mean you know when you when you get a physics degree

01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:00.080
you end up doing like the whole gamut you doing like quantum astro all that shit so yeah it's fun

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.920
see now i i i'm into physics i just have i have i have a terrible brain from math like i'm really

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:13.280
not a numbers guy but i love same i love shows about physics and about quantum theory and all

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.480
that jazz but when they start talking about anything like like slightly complicated like it's just so

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:31.680
theoretical and abstract don't let for the listeners dan is writing a live screenplay about

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:38.240
keep keep talking to him keep talking to him you and i are going to talk right now um all the

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.800
watching the documentaries and stuff from first time experience kenny what's your what's your last

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:51.760
name mcdonald mcdonald okay with an a or did mc mc yeah oh nice first go i mean there's only two

01:19:51.760 --> 01:20:15.760
options so it's not that impressive but

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.880
i mean

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:33.600
dan do i read any of this for the podcast or no yeah i don't know i don't know

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:41.440
this is just gonna this is gonna make people have to subscribe yeah um we're not even shooting

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.840
are we shooting maybe we can edit it out of the audio part i don't know okay well let's keep talking

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:50.960
so like oh well what i was going to say before is like with the watching documentaries and stuff

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.200
and liking physics documentaries don't let that trick you into getting a degree in physics

01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:06.880
because you won't enjoy it right first hand experience

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.560
i got uh i got very very lucky i met uh you know professor brian cox you know the very charming

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.800
english uh is this from uh sarin your long lost cousin or something yeah yeah wonders of the universe

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:32.320
so i don't you look similar yeah he's like he invited me to come out and go look at the

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:48.240
large hadron collider which would be fun but i don't know what it is i i i don't know how magnetism works

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.200
dan for the listeners dan is writing a very culturally sensitive not hack script right

01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:00.640
right that's me candy mcdonald

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:13.600
so i guess i kind of screwed this i'm like i guess you don't start that view like the person's

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:18.160
born then you can't is that implied that i wasn't a baby but i am now this is like benjamin

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:23.360
no god no i would never i wouldn't do that what else what else could have possibly be implying

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:29.440
no i that i'm a bad writer i did a bad i i already painted myself into a corner i structurally i

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.360
the this type of voiceover doesn't work if the person's being born no it works it works

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.960
no no it's a it's what you're wondering how i got here yeah nine months earlier no one's

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:45.200
wondering how you got there how you got there was the sperm yeah cut to cut to some old mcdonald's

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:51.680
testicle yeah i like i like to think that i was like like you know what's the word like jesus um

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:56.880
yeah jesus immaculate immaculate immaculate conception my parents never had sex that's fine

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.280
no but why can't why can't you say like like uh like that it's him being born and then you're

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:05.840
like it's 30 year old yeah i'm not sure what they say in this case but i wouldn't always be a baby

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:14.320
people know that though all right so kenny so you you you got your degree in physics yeah

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:20.880
which sounds arduous it sounds difficult uh yeah and then you said i don't want to be in physics

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:28.080
like yeah would you in your dream if you want to be like a theoretical particle physicist no uh like

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:34.320
i think um i don't know i think part of like my like getting a science degree is kind of to

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:38.800
shut people up when when i'm doing something else that i want to do um some people can say what are

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:43.520
you doing with your life i'm like i have a degree but that seems like a waste of 40 grand so i don't

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:56.720
know um all of my friends that have made it uh we have one thing in common none of uh any of us

01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:02.720
and them because i'm including like way more successful friends of mine uh none of them

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:07.440
has a degree that's because they're smarter than me and that's why they're successful but like i

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:13.920
went to i went to the university of southern california and i

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:26.080
no it will tend to oh yeah yeah unless acted upon by an outside force yeah okay thanks

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:33.840
but yeah okay are we gonna get some new toning and punch lines going on

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.680
oh professional now

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.560
like i went to school i started as a business major i suck at i suck at math

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.560
and then i went to journalism because there was no math requirement but then by the end i

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.640
don't want the degree i just sneaked into classes that i wasn't allowed to be in and just like if

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:01.440
i'm gonna go to school for free because i was poor and had like you know financial aid and you know

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.120
they charge you to take the tests not the and get the paper at the end i i would just sneak

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.200
into cool like history classes and things that were like they try to take advantage of like that

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:17.120
the degree would be pretty meaningless but so now like you want to you want to be a film writer tv

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:25.120
writer novelist um tv tv tv yeah because like yeah i realized that throughout my life the thing

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.520
that's probably been said to me the most is like get off the fucking tv or like stop watching tv

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.360
or some shit like that so it's like what do i love i love do you think that when the movie that dan

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:39.920
is writing is made that adam scott's gonna play you sorry sorry yeah a little bit like adam

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:55.840
scott no no no maybe just the angle uh so just nope i don't know who that is

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:06.720
should we should we should we perform this later on

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:20.400
i i yeah we can perform it i think we should we put this on as a little one act play later

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:26.400
uh all right so now what's have you tried writing are you are you working on stuff yeah like i like

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:32.640
i'm like on the plotting stage of many things and then i finished an actual like um it was

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.680
attempted to be a like a pilot episode but it turned out more like a short film um comedy

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:44.880
something but um yeah no i'm i'm writing when i have time and i don't know like i know a lot of

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.360
actors that are from here and work in acting here but is there a big like tv writing thing like i'm

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:57.680
like all of our tv is kind of shit especially the comedy i don't know like i oh man i was listen

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:04.720
i was watching australian i was watching australian food network okay i'll let you talk sorry sorry

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:10.560
it's fine sorry what was i was watching australian food network holy shit everyone just wanted to

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.360
talk on in front of the camera there was like four cooks and they're like now i'm making marzipan well

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.400
i'm cooking up grapes yeah it's just like everyone's talking over each other and i'm like i don't know

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:26.880
how much butter you're using i don't think they know why though but yeah no that stuff's great

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:33.440
but oh i love food network yeah yeah you know oh yeah it's the network for the food now now you go

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.080
what were you gonna say before i so rudely cut you off i'm not paying attention to myself 90

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.720
percent of the time so yeah yeah how was your social anxiety doing right now is the heart

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:47.120
beating fast are you are you are you settling in i i dealt pretty well with the boo so i think i'm

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:56.160
doing all right so fuck you kidding oh no no that i've had a lot that's fine that's his father

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:06.080
yeah i've written myself into a corner here i got the professor just uh i haven't been reading

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.680
that where we at like the keep can you put me up to date the physics professor made a fireball

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.720
by lighting his pipe or something cleaning his pipe yeah he just is cleaning his pipe when his pipe

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:24.160
burst into flame and then Kenny's climbing to his feet and then he'll say uh professor take me away

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:37.520
from here this is a magical reality kind of thing with pleasure uh oh enter jason ortega

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:44.480
oh i know how to get out of this i know how to do this i've seen this double another

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:58.800
Kenny starts to reach for the hand then recoils uh the oops shit sorry the professor's hand is a

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:09.120
robot hand cut to Kenny's bedroom real world Kenny bolts up

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:18.240
screaming uh the audience is crying

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:26.160
uh cop out sits up next to him do a little undercut

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.600
baking soda

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:42.560
jesus christ

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:49.600
this is getting kind of slashy

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:59.120
Dan right now who who are you casting as a what actor is the professor in your mind right now

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.720
uh mark rooflow

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.400
yeah he's at professor age now isn't he's got gray hair and everything

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:12.640
i need to put him pouting in one of the action lines

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:18.000
i should put what in the actualized way you need to put him pouting i put what

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.120
with little pout a little a little pout the pout you love the pout oh the rooflow pout yeah

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:28.320
sure okay yeah we call him ruffalo yeah it's uh it's a big difference culturally but it's fine

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:40.960
did you guys see mark do you follow him on instagram he had a he was so excited about

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.000
something that happened with the thing that i should know about because i'm a good person

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.200
with the the gas line thing or whatever he was like yes thank you thank you so much thank you

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:53.040
thank you the army corps of engineers thank you everybody thank you so much thank you

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:57.520
i just wanted to kiss him the whole time it was he was so happy i was just like what do

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:01.200
what do you have to do to make mark rooflow happy like like like because i want to do it all the

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:05.280
time just sort of just want to just want to bring him breakfast and see him get happy and

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:10.480
all right so you're a comedy guy you can write comedies or dramas what do you got i'll try yeah

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:22.320
uh comedy yeah yeah yeah yeah this is going to be audio is really going to be jarring when people

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:27.760
listen to this yeah dull comment yeah yeah it's enormous laughter yeah i almost think we'll just

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:36.640
have to edit out almost your whole yeah that's that's fine i don't know what to do otherwise

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:40.400
this was an experiment i thought like oh except jeff talked to somebody and then i'll write a script

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.080
about them but it's like yeah it's a visual thank you for probably we're having just a regular

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:48.160
conversation and a giant laster happening because you're making you're making mark ruffalo

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:52.320
fuck adam scott but we're behind our shoulders let's do this like well we're at this doesn't that's

01:31:52.320 --> 01:32:01.200
as good an ending as any fain fain out got it okay but

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.040
is there is there anything you're an aspiring writer kenny like is there anything you can think of

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:15.760
not to put you on the spot is there anything i could like show you or help you know like something

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:22.480
that or like i don't know some piece not how do i get a job anything other than like like creatively

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.800
what can i impart to you what do you always wonder about dan where do you get it how does it happen

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:35.920
how do you keep your hair so soft and manageable um i i don't know if you want a real answer i guess

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.120
like you know coming up with a concept for a comedy tv show to be running over like multiple

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:46.320
seasons it always feels so like like coming up with a concept that doesn't feel so trite and

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:54.800
hacky like you know like like like community is something so like open to the idea of like

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:58.400
people coming together and having like real human experiences masked by all this like

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:02.960
farcical shit going on in front well that's the only thing you get you yeah there's no such thing

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:08.800
as a good idea or a bad idea it doesn't matter like like like the point of tv is not to be original

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:14.080
the point of tv is to is to placate is to is to give people comfort you know it's like tater tots

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:19.600
you don't want to like reinvent the tater tot do you guys have tater tots i we call them potato

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:25.280
gems but that's fine okay i suddenly accidentally saying something horribly racist but i say yes

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:38.000
we have tater tots my mother's one they're called argentinians uh but but but you know it's like

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.240
community is like it's a it's a hack idea i remember people make fun of it because the all

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:46.400
people knew was the logline of the idea i remember all the press was like oh there's a new mbc show

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:50.800
chal mckayle plays a guy that goes back to college because he lost his thing and everybody was like

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:55.200
what did seinfeld write this in his show like it's like bad idea it's like yeah it's dumb like like

01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:00.240
it's silly but so is uh people in a spaceship going out to boldly go where no one's gone before

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.480
that's a terrible idea so what what what do you mean you're going to boldly go what are you talking

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:08.160
about just going what are you gonna what are you how do you know when you're finished but the idea

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:16.000
the the idea is to get people well for at least for i mean this isn't the only job tv has but the

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:33.920
idea is to get people in yeah it's nine eleven good job bless you sir the town crier it's nine

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:45.600
eleven and oh well it's nine eleven and i like that hat mate i dislike them tell us coming damn white

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:55.600
he said dislike he dislikes it i just like oh no not just like no no no who would like the only

01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:01.120
thing he likes i just like this often in eleven life was like null and void for him it was all

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:08.720
downhill from that but uh you know like like it's yeah no you just you know how it's you know how

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:16.640
when it's raining uh like people are in a weirder happens occasionally yeah yeah it's it's like

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.360
like if it starts to really come down like everybody who's anywhere they all have to get out of the

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.760
rain so then it's like oh then every once in a while like it's raining and you're stuck with a bunch

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:32.960
of people like that you don't know and you're like huh it's raining but it's like a person you'd never

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:36.480
talked to but it's like and they're like jesus christ yeah it fucking rains started coming out of

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:41.520
nowhere it was crazy it was dry and then it was wet and it's like this would never have happened

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:48.960
and it's like that person might look like a ranger they're from some different walk of life they

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:53.840
might be uh liberal with a big l and you're liberal with a small l meaning you're like both sides of

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:59.760
the political spectrum you're labor and they're they're capital l liberal or the end of like like

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.080
like or yeah and and you're different ages or you're different genders and there's at least 50 known

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:10.560
genders uh the the the the rain made something happen the rain is the idea that's just it the

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:16.480
rain could be oh it's the future and so everybody's in a starship and they have to go do stuff that's

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:21.760
a contrivance rain is a contrivance got you know it's like oh the god happened like you can have

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.320
one coincidence in your story is your this is for tv writing you just go like oh what's something

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.640
stupid that made a bunch of people have to be together kind of forever like like mostly forever

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.360
for a hundred episodes or so also this is really old-fashioned advice because tv now is like like

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:41.680
like i'm talking about like 80s style craftsmanship and like tv now is like oh just take a shitty

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.360
90 minute directive video movie break it up into 10 chapters and release them one at a time

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:54.000
this this tv series is called cobra man episode one man

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.320
episode two man at a cobra store

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.080
episode three all at the cobra store ain't what it seems

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:10.320
episode four cobra escape episode five mixed blessings

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:17.920
episode six almost unusual power

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:23.360
episode seven cobra man episode eight shark jumped

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:34.800
episode nine bat cleanup episode 10 clip show uh but but uh yeah i mean it's serialized now

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.000
and that's a whole different discipline i don't really understand that i figure if i

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.280
really tell a serialized story i'll write a movie no one wants me to write a movie i want

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.480
i'm gonna write a movie okay yeah it'll be great yeah you know you had a right all right you had

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:55.440
a right fucking cobra man i'm gonna write cobra man but in my opinion tv is supposed to be like

01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:01.920
crack it's like each rock is an individual rock like you should be able to grab any rock in any

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:08.960
order and it would get you high and you'll want to smoke all the crack rocks and you'll even if

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.280
if you're then told they come in a certain order you'll go like yeah i'm a crackhead i'll

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.720
go meet you like sure if there's a number one on one of the crack rocks if it rolls under the

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:25.680
couch and there's only two five and seven i'm still gonna smoke the crack like like i don't owe it

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:30.800
to the fucking crack to consume it in a certain order and the crack ought to meet me halfway as

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.880
a crackhead it's the least the crack can do to not fuck with me and so i'm like what the hell why

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:41.840
is jillian anderson where did she go what is this is her dream now but i love the fall have you

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:47.040
seen the fall no so good see that's serial that was a great message for the kids uh that's that's

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:53.120
i'm glad ryan was here to hear that so he passed that along to the children oh the the look of the

01:38:53.120 --> 01:39:00.240
crack metaphor but like like a good a good sitcom a good tv show is a in my opinion is a necklace

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.520
made of crack rocks because it's like you you provide the order you provide maybe you do put a big

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.360
honking rock right in the middle and you say like smoke from left to right as you would

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:15.120
but there's a string connecting all of them you can wear it you can tell your friends about it at

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.800
a party they go hey what's what's that you got around your neck it's a crack necklace

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:26.400
i love it i smoke i smoke this one i smoke that one oh i crack's not for me no that's that's other

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:32.640
people's crack let me tell you about this this is this is rick and morty crack this is great uh

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:39.600
so uh anyway so there's no such thing as a bad idea the the worst kind of idea that you could have

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:45.680
is is the thing where you start thinking like uh uh uh uh like oh this sounds like tv this will

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:50.080
make a good tv show that you're gonna do that by default because you love tv you want to write good

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.240
tv you're gonna always second guess yourself and be like like like you're gonna always be filtering

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.520
things through like oh and then it'd be like a tv show if i did it like this the the the way that

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:07.040
you make good stuff is by restraining that you have to like force your tv loving structure

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.400
craving self-loathing nothing inside my head deserves to be on television brain you have to

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:19.200
force it actively force it into the non-televisable realm go like what is the memory that i have that

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:26.560
is so fucked up it cannot be it doesn't go near it's too boring or it's too pornographic or it's

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:33.840
too bloody or it's too sad it's like like where it's just too like like like like personal to me it

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:39.840
doesn't make that much sense and try as hard as you can to not let that get filtered through that

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:44.080
the other part of your brain which everyone has anyway that's the unremarkable part of your brain

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.920
that like turns it into gilligan's island like like which is a great show that but the person

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:55.280
that created gilligan's island wasn't like i'm gonna try to make a show like gilligan's island

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:59.200
like that was a like weird byproduct of them i don't know who knows what they were sure sure

01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:04.800
shorts right like his thing was like he made tv like i'm gonna make sure that people will really

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.840
have to watch like like he would do anything he didn't care about the rules at all there have

01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:14.320
been many many attempts since gilligan's island to make shows about a group of people staring at a

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:21.280
desert island and they have all sucked this is the part where dan dies and it's very sad

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.360
i talked while i was drinking it went down the rug pipe as you get older there's another thing

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:34.240
gilly i could tell you chenny as you get older especially if you drink a fifth of vodka i'd

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:42.320
like your esophagus flap will start to degrade like a toilet flap you know you have to replace the

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.800
toilet flap every once in a while you go to the hardware store maybe maybe your parents did you

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.440
do this but millennial so there's like a rubber flap of the toilet that keeps it that you have a

01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:58.320
flesh one in here but you can't replace it it just melts what you say you've you've you've eroded

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.360
your epiglottis or whatever as i after i turned 40 i was like one day i was in a movie theater and

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:10.880
it was like eating popcorn while going those muppets are funny uh this it's this hypothetical

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:17.600
scenario believe me dan hates the muppets but i inhaled uh the muppets hate the muppets man

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:28.000
jim henson loved the muppets and he's dead the muppets killed jim henson no i'm saying you can't

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.400
keep doing if you can't make phones after steve jobsties and make them right you can't make no

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:42.560
muppets are you at the heimlich what's going on over there i got droplets of vodka went down my

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:50.000
breathing tube which is like like absorb them you absorb them he he just drank more vodka

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.840
he's gonna wash it down this guy doesn't fucking learn well what's gonna work water hugs hugs

01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:03.120
the heimlich the heimlich maneuver is just a one big hug well it's a series of very strong hugs

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:11.440
it's just anyways so then i inhaled popcorn and i you have to chew very carefully now there's

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:14.960
an episode of the podcast where the rest of the show is gonna be dan dan sounding like drunk

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:25.840
nick nolte all right all right what else what other advice can i give you um uh uh you know i mean

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.960
you're talking about yeah you you actually is it a physical thing is that you're just being

01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:44.320
hypochondria hypochondriacal um steve levy can we give it up for steve levy everybody steve levy he's

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:50.560
dan's uh like you know he's what's uh he's what's batman's butler's guy the fucking alfred he's

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:56.080
alfred but this guy goes to the gym like every like every 45 minutes this guy's got like he's

01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:01.760
got abs on his face this is steve levy's laptop we should reward him by going through his photos

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:10.480
oh my god please what are the olsen twins doing on here please find something awful no

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.560
would there be anything we would find in your photo roll that would be embarrassing well

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:19.440
you just scrolled past uh what do you call it a story circle so it's definitely there could

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.560
definitely be trade see oh they could definitely be like a like a like a like a like a doctor strange

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:31.760
treatment or something yeah he could be cobra man we find out that you're stealing that from him

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:37.120
we were doing a show in the states uh and uh yeah i had the laptop out and then i clicked on a thing

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:42.400
and there was like a file name that a huge doctor strange fan recognized as a character

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:47.680
from that universe went to the that's how it leaked that i did no work on doctor strange at all

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.800
otherwise i would have been credited i didn't do i didn't help them at all i went in there and was

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:58.960
like doctor strange is neat all right all right all right uh uh uh uh kenny give him you give him

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:05.680
your three your three rules your three never is or your three always is for a writer all right

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:12.800
you prove that you suck right done because you because you're worried about that so if you if

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:17.520
you sit and you try to prove that you're good what will you write you'll write nothing if you try to

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:21.280
prove that you'll suck what will you write you'll write everything you'll write the first thing up

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:27.280
to your head pooby-doo i wrote something i wrote a thousand percent more than the guy whose goal

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:34.000
was to write something good just that it's it's a dramatic rendition of scooby-doo it's kind of

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.480
it's sent in uh and then post-war Czechoslovakia it's about a dog who uh right from start to finish

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:50.000
that's going kenny yes right right from right from start to finish right in in passes so you go

01:45:50.720 --> 01:46:02.560
fade in interior poopy-doo's house poopy-doo is making tea a wizard steals it poopy-doo

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:16.720
chases him don't now start at the top and go poopy-doo is making chamomile a wizard carefully

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:26.400
steals it poopy-doo chases him on a razor scooter these changes are not gonna help you just made

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:33.920
it better that's what you think but guess what happens then you cut to you got a hit exterior

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:47.520
streets of san francisco there's uh an elaborate chase the poopy-doo hits the wizard with a car

01:46:47.520 --> 01:47:04.160
he picks up his stolen tea and looks at the camera poopy-doo that's a wrap tea style

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:14.400
and then and you fade out so i finished my draft now now i can go back and change the tea and all

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:20.560
this stuff if i do that after i finish the first scene then i go to the second scene and it's like

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:27.760
i realize oh streets of san francisco wait i should i like this sucks i should fade in on san francisco

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.720
this whole scene's gonna get cut or changed so dramatically all of my thought about what kind

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:38.400
of tea it should be i know how the wizard steals it is gonna all of that time is just gonna be wasted

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:43.760
basically so it's like you you even though it's totally counterintuitive because you're a perfectionist

01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:47.840
you want to always when you sit down to your document your work in progress you want to stand

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:53.200
i always do it do as i say not as i do i've never followed this fucking advice in my goddamn life

01:47:54.560 --> 01:48:00.080
start at the don't start at the top of the document erase the interior poopy-doo's house

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:05.840
and to the cut to so they just fade in and then the first thing we see is x exterior

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:14.080
streets of san francisco well this is my this is now we're on to how to receive notes so you're

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:17.200
gonna be you're gonna be collaborating you're gonna be developing can it be can it be at lana

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:21.360
we get so many tax breaks that we shoot in lana what wait what are you what are you what are you

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:26.720
saying like if you start there fade in street to san francisco this is an elaborate chase oh yeah

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:36.080
poopy-doo it's wizard yeah exactly that's that's a fucking good that's a cold open par excellence

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:43.680
yes and you might and and hey you might be one of these people you go like uh you know it's uh

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:53.680
cut to you know title three weeks earlier and then you fucking even get to use this scene

01:48:53.680 --> 01:49:04.800
you just move it down to here see if I can there you go yeah fade in on a cut to fade in

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:10.240
straight to yeah title three weeks earlier oh shit man this fucking thing this just became uh

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:18.320
john wick this shit is hot now this is like on the blacklist

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:28.320
uh so yeah okay so prove that you suck write a shitty draft write it all the way through before

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.720
you start second guessing it because you'll make discoveries along the way and I guess the third

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:38.880
thing is like uh oh shit what the fuck oh I thought there was a don't do that I thought there was

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:49.280
like a huntsman behind me uh don't move don't move don't look up now come on I don't want to don't

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:57.760
it's not funny is it um the the what is the third thing uh you know that that's what you know kind

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:03.920
of works like it's like it's like yeah like don't like you don't separate yourself from what is

01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.520
going on if you're working in advertising and somebody's saying I want you to write me the

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:12.160
best Pepsi commercial in the world like and you have to be going through a divorce or a custody

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:17.360
battle with children like and that's all you can think about is like how much it hurts to like lose

01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.720
talking about something as if it's a commodity even though it's your child and you feel you hate

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:27.280
yourself or you're vigilant against injustice you gotta put that into your Pepsi commercial or

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.840
your bad Pepsi commercial writer and no one's gonna buy Pepsi from your commercial like you

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.400
or you should you gotta go you gotta tell Pepsi I can't write this commercial right now it's all

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:41.440
an autobiography it's all meta it's all personal write what you know that's what that means it

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.520
doesn't mean oh you know what people are really interested in is your life as an oceanographer

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:50.640
they don't give a fuck but they they they want to feel sincere writing they want you to like they

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:55.920
don't want they could they could if they wanted to read something by somebody who was trying to make

01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:01.040
a tv show they could write their own shit and do it they'd be like fade in on some fucking asshole

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:08.000
trying to write a script like like they they're counting on you to to lower that compartment

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:14.480
between Kenny the physicist and Kenny the writer not for you to stop being a physicist and start

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:20.560
being a writer this shit is dumb like illiterates can buy final draft and write use the software

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:25.520
you need to be like write a shitty draft to just be like fade in and fucking what physics

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:32.480
fucking bug bumming me out I don't know maybe your voice will be different but but uh surprisingly

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:36.960
no there's something there's something when you get really honest with yourself there's something

01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:41.520
about your life that you've where you've come from like like that that it's just your map of the

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:47.840
cosmos don't you're not trying to like tell other people what to think or or prove that you're

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:52.960
interesting or cool or that or that you or that you like them or that they should like you like

01:51:52.960 --> 01:52:00.000
pretend your goal is some alien came down and put a laser gun to your head and said you have to

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:08.080
show me in the next day with a document like how you saw the world period like like or i'm gonna

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.000
blow your brains out with this alien gun it's gonna hurt extra bad it's not gonna be a painless

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:20.160
death surprisingly common theme in my dreams yeah uh the the yeah just you just your goal is to like

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.040
is to just is to just say i was here this is what this is what happened to me the more brutally

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:28.640
honest you are the more you'll get close to being like Woody Allen Lena Dunham or something like they

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:34.320
don't they don't moralize they they they're narcissistic and they they look at their shit this is

01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:37.680
what i had for breakfast and then this is who i slept with and this is what i thought as i was

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:41.760
sleeping with them and and and and these people are geniuses when they do it right that's that's

01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:46.320
really like one of the things i really loved about great minds like i like you're going through what

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:50.560
you were at the moment at the time that that was being done uh you could see all of that pouring

01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:54.640
out and maybe like random people on youtube just stumbling across it might not but people who are

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:58.800
religious like harm and town listeners will know like some of the little like ticks you have and

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:02.640
all the little things you mentioned like that's all callbacks to things about yourself that you're

01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:06.000
like being honest about and i think that's what people really love about your writing like yeah

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.240
you just come through it's yeah it's my it's my little bag of tricks yeah i mean it's and it can

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:13.680
be yours too because it'll be different when you do it like like just reaching into your own

01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:20.480
as a friend of ours sam christin sam christin said uh is an awesome mentor uh from he said remember

01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:30.880

black white Judas

that's that's high-roading from the low road i know

01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:59.440
as he puts his face into the ice bucket

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:06.800
there's like uh we all pay a huge price tag for where we are like like life comes with a price and

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:13.120
then as as artists we get to cash in on that like our job is to show the world like how

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.880
like what what we went through to make us us you know like that's that that's the beauty of our

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:24.000
i've i've tried i've tried i tried as hard as i could to not be distracting

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.880
and it was funny because it was like it's there's no have you ever tried to put ice in a glass

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:36.000
