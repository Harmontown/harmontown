00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Hello, game, from beautiful uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
I say, why bury the good stuff?

00:24.000 --> 00:39.000
Let's bring out the great stuff, Spencer Crittenden, the Game Master, and the Mayor of Harmontown, and the landlord of your heart, Dan Harmon.

00:54.000 --> 01:10.000
For the home listener, Dan Haslam can only be described as a new look.

01:10.000 --> 01:27.000
I place it's equidistant between Walter Cronkite and Captain Kangaroo, with just a little suggestion of Stacey Keach.

01:27.000 --> 01:47.000
It's for a movie, so you're judging a movie star. See where that'll get you. Throw your mud from aside the red carpet. It won't musse it.

01:47.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah, it's for a movie. And here's the thing. You know what I need to do? I leave the set of the movie, and as I was walking, I'm going to go a couple blocks from this bar.

02:03.000 --> 02:16.000
I'll go there and I'll have a drink, and then I'll call an Uber or a Lyft, if you want to believe that I am helping, and just haven't given up and don't want to be talked to.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
But then, halfway there, I'm like, oh, shit, fuck, god damn it, I look like this.

02:23.000 --> 02:32.000
And then it's just like, I've been grappling for two days, I go like, well, what is it? Because you looked so good before?

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
And then I was like, oh, okay, no, I never thought I looked good, but what I looked like before was someone who didn't care what he looked like.

02:41.000 --> 02:50.000
This looks like someone was like, what can I do? How am I driving? And that's the deal breaker for me.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
And why is that the deal breaker for me? Because, oh, I'm so honest, I'm such an honest person.

02:56.000 --> 03:13.000
And then I'm like, you should have a mustache. The person I am inside looks like this. It's perfect, because this is how much I care. I do want to be cool this much, and I do fail this much.

03:13.000 --> 03:26.000
And I should, this is who I should be, this is how I should get used to it, because this is a big, you know, my zizzic beard, and it's like, oh, so that if somebody can go like, hey, you piece of shit, and I go, what?

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
I said you're a piece of shit. I don't care. That's not true. That's not true.

03:32.000 --> 03:43.000
I don't think this look says that you care how you look. It says that you care about the fact that at 1pm, President Kennedy is pronounced dead. Dallas, Texas.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
You have to put some...

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Vice President Johnson is on the plane.

03:48.000 --> 03:57.000
I mean, I just, this is part, I'm just saying, this is a journey I have to go on, because I'll tell you kids, like, a lot of you have tattoos, piercings, and things like that.

03:57.000 --> 04:09.000
I'll confess to you, I don't feel this way anymore. 15 years ago, if somebody had like a pierced lip, or like a tattoo, or something, I would like secretly in my head, I'd be like, I don't trust that person.

04:09.000 --> 04:20.000
Because they'd be like, well, they're so scared that no one's going to notice, or that no one's going to know who they are, or that they don't know who they are, or that they had to take these measures and stuff.

04:20.000 --> 04:29.000
And it's like, I would look down on that, I wouldn't look down on them, but I would be like, that person's not going to get along with me, because the real thing you're supposed to do is do that in front of a typewriter.

04:29.000 --> 04:44.000
And I'd be like, fuck it, there's so many things to hurt about yourself before you put a hole in your lip. You could fucking just dissolve your esophagus with acid that you drink like a quart of a week for 40 years.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
That's fucking honest.

04:46.000 --> 05:00.000
So I'm just sorry about that 15 years ago that I was ever like, oh, she has a thing in her nose. I don't trust her. I trust you now.

05:00.000 --> 05:10.000
But do we trust you with this new look, Dan? That's the question. Your sideburns are triumphant, by the way. You look like a little bit like Nigel Bruce, like Holmes.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
I mean, that's our Watson from the old, you know, Sherlock Holmes.

05:16.000 --> 05:27.000
I keep making the joke, but it's not a joke. You know when I got out of the makeup chair, I was like, oh, Nick Offerman said no.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
They should credit me as that. The movie should say starring Nick Offerman said no.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Well, the same thing. Every time I've ever gotten a job is because Jerry O'Connell passed.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
You know, Jack Black used to say that about Philip Seymour Hoffman. But when they were younger, like they would be in the same waiting rooms all the time.

05:46.000 --> 05:55.000
We've talked about that. The Wolfman had nards. Indeed.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
But yeah, this is the fate I deserve. So I don't know. Maybe when I finish this movie, maybe I'll...

06:01.000 --> 06:12.000
I was also noticing, like, oh, sideburns. Oh, I was like, what was the deal with sideburns? And I was thinking, oh, the men in control in the 70s, they were more likely to be older and overweight.

06:12.000 --> 06:21.000
And so, and sideburns kind of squeeze your face like bookends. Even though my double chin is exposed, you're like...

06:21.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't say you're... Just don't... Hey, guys, also... Don't correct me on this. It's like a slimming thing for a fat face. You would not...

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Fuck you. Just come on. I'm just saying.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Dan, just tell them. You gained weight for the role.

06:38.000 --> 06:47.000
But then the 80s came and then everyone was like, everybody's doing aerobics. And then it became more possible to be...

06:47.000 --> 06:59.000
I've been thinking about this all, like, okay, so, you know how like surfing, all of a sudden in the 60s, everybody was like, whoa, there's beaches everywhere where the water is.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
We should get down there and we should have all kinds of fun. It was like, oh, why didn't they...

07:05.000 --> 07:13.000
Those beaches were there in the 40s and it was like, oh, that's where battles were happening.

07:13.000 --> 07:22.000
Nobody wanted to... The previous generation was like, dad, let's go to the beach and he'd be like, yeah, that would be fun.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
Maybe we'll find my arm.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
You remember how many lives are lost at the Great Battle of Zuma?

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
But, you know, that's not really it. But then I was thinking, oh, you know what it probably is?

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
It's like, okay, so, you know, you see like black and white photos of people at the beach and they have like the crazy like Charlie Chaplin swimsuits where it's like, you know,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
you have to cover more of your body culturally.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah, the onesie.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
And then it was like, everybody's always had a beach ball and they had like a onesie.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
And then like the standards for public like undress slackened.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So then I was thinking, oh, that's kind of interesting.

07:56.000 --> 08:06.000
Like, do you think that the outfits got comfortable enough for people to realize how fun it could be at the beach and or the beaches got more popular

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
because that's where you could see ever increasing states of undress provocative things are happening down there.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
These ladies got their boobies in less material.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Let's get down to the beach.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Hey, it's nice down here.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
Feminism has always had a strange creepy handshake with the grody dudes like enjoying it.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
The bra burning thing.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Hear him out.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Oh, no, I'm not saying please appreciate it for what it's enough.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm just pointing it out.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm not like, you need to, you need to approve.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
We're the wind beneath your wings, ladies.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
You're going to miss us when we're gone.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Try getting equal without a dude in a raincoat jerking off to it.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Just try.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You'll find it's quite impossible.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
No, that's not what I'm saying.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm just saying that culture advances as, like,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
but can we check in about the bra burning thing?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Because I was just like, it's safe enough now.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Like, we've gone through enough stuff.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
We're all brothers and sisters and you weren't like,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
that was kind of a swing and a miss, wasn't it?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Like, wasn't it?

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
The burning, you found, not you, you're 25, but like,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
wasn't that sort of a check to see?

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
I was like, I think this is, I think these were invented by men

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
to make our boobs look better.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
So I'm going to burn them.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
They're like shackles around my femininity.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
And then everybody was just like, okay, they're burning them.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And then aren't they back?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
And then it was just like, we never talked about it again.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
It was just like, oh, can I get three bras?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And Jesus Christ, my tits are killing me.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I don't know what a bra is.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Coming out of the 50s, those bras are those crazy weird,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
like Miss Osilo bras that were really like.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
You should have burnt the tips of the bras.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Get your activism straight in the 50s.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I don't know.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I just wanted to check in.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I thought all women would go like, you were right.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
You were right.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
We're sorry.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
We never, we didn't want to talk about, we were embarrassed.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
We love bras.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
They were our idea.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm so glad that in the first five minutes of the show,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
you fixed feminism.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Retroactively.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
It's really good.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I love when I do my self deprecating thing.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
And then you're like, well, that's crazy.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I come up like, hey, ladies, look at me.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm so thin.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
And then you're like, thin as an elephant.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Well, that's not very nice or helping at all.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
All I've said is that you look fantastic.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
You look like a.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
No, I was making, I was using a metaphor for what you just did.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
I was breaking it down.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I understand.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
You're a little insecure right now because you look terrific.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I was driving towards Elysium Park this morning.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
And I saw a lady that was pulled over in a driving lane

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
that had just finished up urinating in the street

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
and getting back into her cars and getting her shoes back on

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
and all that stuff.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It was, I didn't see it actually happening,

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
but I saw it put together very quickly that that was just had happened.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
You, you didn't see her urinating, but you sussed that out?

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
No, I saw this, this large puddle on the floor that was trickling downhill.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
She was putting her shoes back on and kind of straining at her one,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
one piece kind of dress situation.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
It was all very complicated.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
She got back into her car?

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
I was like, man, she almost made it, but I saw.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
So she was dying for a pee, got out and just took it in the street.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
I guess.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
She was right by a lawn, but she didn't go into the lawn.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
She might have thought like, like this is the first time I've peed as an adult in the city.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Maybe it's disrespectful to do it on the lawn.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
That was what she had on the sign she was holding.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Like I'm not sure what I'd do if I was like traffic and I just had to get Schrab told the story,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
but he just peed his pants and he was like, it was kind of a triumph for him.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
That's like a heroic tale.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Because it's like, what are we doing?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Why are we trying to not pee our pants?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Does our parents told us?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
It's silly.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
It's dumb.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
They just didn't want to change us.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
You can pee your pants anytime you want now.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
It's not a crime.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
It's not like a van driving around like looking for people with pee in their pants.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
It's for you dry pants.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
It's a favor you do yourself.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
You can, if you have to pee that bad, you can opt to have wet pants.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
It's a natural, it's an arguably more natural state of pants than dry pants.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
Like we go through our day making trips to a strange room to keep our pants dry,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
but it's like that because that's an artificial construct.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Dry pants.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
It's an illusion.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
Like the idea that none of us are peeing right now is a lie.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
There's urine inside our body.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Our bodies are 29% urine.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You can look it up.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
You should burn your pants and protest.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Does that mean that not jizzing is also a lie?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Everything's a lie.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Talking is a lie.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
My brain, the only form of truth would be if you could know what I'm thinking and feeling.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
If you were me, the only thing that's true is silence.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And then I violated.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
I put on a performance by wobbling the air with my mouth,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
and then you get vibrations in your earhole,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
and then you associate those vibrations with a trunk in your head.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
You open it up.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
It's like if I send you a heart emoji with my mouth,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
then you have to load the heart emoji on your side.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I'm explaining communication to you, but...

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
You could theoretically, neuroplasticity dictates that you could decide

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
that when I hear the word cucumber,

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
I'm going to respond as if I heard the word dolphin.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
If I hear love, I'm going to think hate.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
You could just re-root your brain.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
You could go to any point, as long as you start being aware of what you're doing,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
then you go to these points in your brain,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
and then you don't have to do anything,

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
because what happens is a new, random, natural thing.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
The reason there's a road to Rome from a gas station outside Rome

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
is because there was a spot where Romans were standing,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
and then they were like, I'm going to go to Rome,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
and they started walking because they were like,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
we've got to be over there. Why are we at this gas station?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
And also, we should have taken the car. We got all the gas.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
They didn't have cars yet.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
But they had gas stations. That was better.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
That's why Rome fell.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
The chariots were just coated in gasoline.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
There was no tank, and they would burst into flames.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And all the lead in that gasoline got into the pipes,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and that's how they fucking did it.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
You walk where you want to go, and then you leave this little footpath,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
and the person follows you, and you know,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
a road's start is like footpaths and trails and things.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
It's a path of least resistance.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
It's like a drop just takes a kind of semi-shortest route to a destination.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
So if you go back to a point in your neurology,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
by being aware, you don't have to try anything.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
You don't have to be like, oh, I'm going to be different.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
You can just go, okay, I'm going to be aware of every thought that I have.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
And then there's certain thoughts that have this straight fucking paved freeway

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
to Rome, which you think is the only choice you have

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
to the point where you don't even realize this is a place you can stop.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
So you practice stopping.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
See, I did it.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Right now I was about to finish my thought,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
but I do that all the time.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
No, I don't.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
But you can just wait and see what happens.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Someone goes like, hey, peanut butter, and you go, I love peanut butter.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
And then, boom, you don't smoke anymore.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
You'll figure it out.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
It's called neuroplasticity.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I just explained it.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
That was the first time I've ever truly understood what neuroplasticity was.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
You can remap your whole brain.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Just being aware of the things that happen to you throughout the day,

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
when you get up in the morning, you can just sit there and go,

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
okay, so I'm going to move my arm, and then it's like baby steps,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
and what about Bob, maybe?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
No.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Who cares?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Like, usually when I'm in this position where I'm like,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I feel like nobody understands me, then I freak out,

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
so I'm going to stop, and then I'm going to take another option.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Mmm.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Mmm.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Oh, God, I should do this all the time.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Mmm.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh, that's good.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
God, it's making everyone smarter.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Mmm.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
There, I fixed myself.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
All right.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Our guest tonight, uh...

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
You're just on the keypad.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Oh, no.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
What?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Oh, you...that's...

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Huh?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
That's a joke.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
No, no, it's the truth.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
You clearly...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Whatever.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Did I ruin your joke?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
No, no.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
You're just trying to cover for it now.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Oh, what?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
All right, all right.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Hey, wait, so, okay, whose idea was it

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
to make full-blown a medical term?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Like, how is that...

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Isn't that...this is so childish.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Like, someone is like,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
oh, we have this serious thing called AIDS.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
It's killing people.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
It couldn't be more sensitive and terrible.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
But we actually need to distinguish a few things

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
linguistically because we're trying to cure it

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
and we need to document all these things.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
So there should be a difference between this and that.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
I was like, well, let's call that one full-blown AIDS?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Like, why didn't that guy get fired?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Why was it like...

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Well, you're good job, Jenkins.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
It's like if he said, like, a humdinger or, like...

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Like, that one's a lulu.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
A doozy.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
A doozy.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Tote's AIDS.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
It just seems...

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It makes you feel bad when you're talking about it.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Like, it's like, you know, we all got a kick out of it.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I finally looked it up, but sure enough, it's a clinical term.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Like, that was a terrible idea.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Did we talk about, on the show before,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
about J. Johnson's pitch for a breakfast restaurant?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Give you some full-blown eggs.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
See, that's the right use of full-blown.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Honey, I want breakfast.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
God, me too.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Let's call it a full-blown eggs.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I have one more linguistic problem.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
And I said, look, hey,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I don't want to start a beef with the band Imagine Dragons.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I have no problem with them.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I have a problem with the phrase Imagine Dragons,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
because how could...

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It's the...

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
That is the one...

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Imagine Drag.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
If I'm imagining, why would I imagine...

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
That's like doing an impression of Homer Simpson

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
in your stand-up act.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
That's like someone else's imagination.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Dragons.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Imagine... Oh, you got me.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Dragons. What the fuck?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Someone else imagined them.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Imagine... Oh, I don't know.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I'll try to keep up. Just play the music.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I mean, go ahead and try to blow my mind, but...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Maybe they're dragons that imagine.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
They're like the Imagine Dragons.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
These are dragons that have imagination.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Maybe we're going to find out with Pearl Jam

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
that it means something disgusting.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Imagine Dragons is like

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
when you stick your dick in a woman's nose

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
or something.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
That's Dragon Sleeve.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Dragon Sleeve?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Come on, give her a Dragon Sleeve.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Do you ever watch the really, really rough porn?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
We should bring Schrabba.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
All right.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
That was a hairpin turn.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Our guest tonight

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
is a civil rights activist and...

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
He's doing a lot of work with Antifa.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Hello. Hello, Dan.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
Hello, everyone.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Hey, I just texted you a clip.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Oh.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Can I sit there, then, if you want me to play stuff for them?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
The AV's over here.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Let me see.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Okay.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Where am I going to put my phone?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You could put it on that other thing.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Do you want to play the clip?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
No, no, no.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Don't let him do it.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
So we're shot, boys.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Sorry.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Oh, shit.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It's been a while.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
It's been a while since I've been here, everyone.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Sorry.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
All right. This is Christ.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
What the hell?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Ugh, these chairs suck.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
They suck so bad.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
No, they're good.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
We've got a couch right there.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
There's a couch.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
There's a couch right there.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Go sit there.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
There's a couch right there.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
There's a couch right there.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I can feel the padding.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I'm sitting in a bird cage.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Sitting in a couch.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
All right.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
No more negative talk.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Jeff is grabbing a pillow cushion.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Thank you.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Very good.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
He's giving it to Rob.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Rob has the cushions.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I love it.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
He's not sitting on it.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
So this clip you sent me.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I don't ever understand why.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
This is not going to work.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
This is going to kill him.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Don't die.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Don't die.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Yay.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
He's sitting on the cushion.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
On the chair.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
In a precarious tangle.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Should I just press play on this?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
He will die.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Please don't follow the backwards.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You got it.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Can you read?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah, it's it.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
You get it.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Read first of all.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Read them the name of the clip.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Read them the name of the clip.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Don't read them it.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
The name of the clip

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
is man shitting on the street

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
in Lahore, Pakistan?

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Right.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
There's man shitting on the street everywhere.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Just listen to the

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
guys talking off camera.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
That's the whole thing.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Let's listen.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Start from the beginning.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Stop.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
No, no, no.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
What he's shitting

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I'm putting on his knee.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Why?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
What?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
He's rubbing it on his leg.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
He's going

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
No, no, no, no.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Why?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Why?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
No, no, shitting.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Why?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
The best is him going

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Why?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
No, no.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Why?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Why shitting?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Can you bring up my

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
screen on my iPhone?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Did it break?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
No, no, no. I wanted to show him

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
the text message exchange from

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Schrab.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Oh, I have to mirror it.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Wow, I really just brought the show

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
to a halt.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's not worth it. It doesn't matter.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
You could describe it, right?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah, but that's how you know

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
something's not really worth it.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
How you doing, Jeff?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I'm doing okay.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
How's it going, Dan?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I feel like the show's been

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
split a little bit.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I think it's probably fine.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Oh, brother.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
You ever think about that treasure

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
map we found?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Every day.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Every day of my life.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
What's going on in your life?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I'm working on this show, Ghosted,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
starring Adam Scott.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I think if we go and find the treasure,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
we'd be able to start some kind of

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
treasure team.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Rob, do you want to steal Dan and Spencer's treasure?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Yeah.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I hear

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
they need some new people over at

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Ghosted.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Why don't we

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
pretend to be interested

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
in working on that show?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And we might be able to

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
find treasure digging equipment.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Right.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Let's do that.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Hi, guys.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
What are you guys talking about over there?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
We were trying to do things concurrently,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
but you guys stopped.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I got kind of invested.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
You guys had a richer

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
tapestry over there.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
You're saying we won.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
That's what I'm hearing.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
We won the conversation.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Captain Kangaroo always won.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Hey, okay.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Bob Keesha.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
You guys ever get...

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
You guys ever get into...

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I heard you were a real badass in Vietnam.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I read that on Facebook.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Like you and Mr. Rogers,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
despite being

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
such great children

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
entertainers, you were

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
a motherfucker in Vietnam.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You certainly sent Charlie

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
back into the bush.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
You were a badass in Vietnam, Captain.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Is it true, Dan,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
that right now you are an aging detective

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
who's getting a little too old for this shit?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Yeah.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Just a couple weeks away from retirement?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Or a principal.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Give me like a British...

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Yeah, there's...

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Give me a blustery old, like, Colonel

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
old, so...

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
No, not Japanese.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Do English, not Japanese.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
It's hardly the way to behave

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
in that situation.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Whoever committed this murder

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
must have one shoe

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
wider than his thigh.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I say, Mr. Harmon, nothing.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I find your methods highly unethical.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Oh-ho-bo-ho-key.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Ooh, the cheek on this one.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
So, listen.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Did you guys know that...

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Did you guys know that

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
the guy who came up...

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
the phrase Murphy's Law,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
whatever can go wrong,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
will go wrong, basically,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
we looked it up in the car

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
on the way over because we were looking up

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
at some of the eponymous stuff.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
If that's what they call it.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Cody was...

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
because she was learning about the Bechdel test

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
and she's like, how many other

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
eponymous things are named after women?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
One, the Streisand effect, and then everything else.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
So, it's kind of...

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
eponymous laws don't really...

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
they kind of violate some tests there.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
But one of the tests is Murphy's Law.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And I was like, yeah, but that's not a guy.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
That's just probably some ironic Irish thing

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
or something, like luck of the Irish inverted

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
but there was a guy

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
whose, I guess his nickname

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
was Murphy, but his full name was like

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
kind of Robocop.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
It was a...

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I don't know, it's a longer name

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
but they called him Murphy, but he was a guy

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
who made measuring instruments

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
or something. He was a fuck-up.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I think his shit didn't work.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
So, the reason Murphy's Law

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
is a thing isn't because...

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
we've all adopted it as a phrase that makes us think,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
like, whoa, you know, look,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
give yourself a break, like, shit goes wrong.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
You know, you've got to anticipate shit going wrong

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
but it was like, it wasn't even invented

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
by the guy named Murphy.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
It was like something applied, it was like

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Murphy's Law is that this shit won't work.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Like, a guy probably...

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
he probably only didn't kill himself

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
because his noose broke.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
He's probably like, well, this isn't going to last.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I mean, a couple of weeks and they'll get sick

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
of saying Murphy's Law.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And then someone was like, you know that thing

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
you thought would happen? It didn't.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
It went wrong.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Everyone's going to say you're a fuck-up

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
for the rest of your life. Well...

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
They're saying it in Ohio.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Then I'll blow my brains out. Click.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
They're saying it in Florida.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
They're saying it in Canada.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
They're saying it in Alaska.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
They're saying it in

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Ontario.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
They're saying it in China.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
They're saying it in Australia.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
They're saying it

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
in Chicago.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
They're saying it

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
in Atlantis.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
They're saying it

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
in South America.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
They're saying it

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
in South Dakota.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
They're saying it in

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
South Korea.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
They're saying it in

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
South Milwaukee.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
All right.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Book market.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I want to use more of that.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Put that one on the Holiday Reel.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Put that on our anniversary show.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I want you back.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
He's like Chef Lightning lived without the speeder.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Rob, I hear that

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
the new trend

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
is ramen noodles.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I hear they're talking about them

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
all over the place.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
What?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I hear they're talking about ramen noodles.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
There's a big trend right now.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm trying to set you up for your big

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
ramen noodles.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
You can't make

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Schrab do anything.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
He doesn't sit in the right chair.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
He doesn't do anything.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
If he's not

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
in the show, then he comes up in the audience.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
If everyone laughs, then you book him next week.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Then he comes and he's in a bad mood.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
You know what

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Schrab hates?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
What?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Playing Pictionary.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Rob Schrab, famous artist.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I don't like people making me play Pictionary.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
It's just dumb.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
No, I'm sorry. That's rude.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
It's a little bit, but...

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
You invited me up here.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I know.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I'm sorry.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Rob, what's your wife doing?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
She's playing magic cards.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Who does she play with?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Her friend Zach.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I think...

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
We'll be right back.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Mandy's is this office

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
underwear you'll ever put.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Real big.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I want to play magic with your wife.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
It's true. It's not a joke.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Can I watch?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Can I watch?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Hey, Spencer, can I watch?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Hey, Spencer, you mind if I watch you

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
play magic with my wife?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Hey, Spencer.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
What are you doing tonight?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Hey, Spencer, why don't you come over

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
and play magic with my wife while I watch

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
from the closet?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
What do you guys do when you get into a car?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
What?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
What?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
What did you say?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It's not a game show.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
You have to wait until the questions

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
fully ask.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
He's holding his glasses up to his ear

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
so he can see

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
the sound waves better.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I'm a car hearing.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
What do you guys do

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
when you get into

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
a car

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
that you've called with...

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Sorry.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
What do you guys do

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
when you get into a rideshare

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
vehicle that you've ordered

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
via the intertubes

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
and you get into the car

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and the driver says,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
what kind of music are you interested

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
in listening to?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
What are you supposed to say to that?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I always say the same thing.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Whatever you like.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Does anyone go

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
something salty?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Give me a swingy number.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Hip hop or nothing?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Who's going to stick their

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
neck out?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Who do you think right now is the saltiest

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
music artist out there?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
It's T-Swift, right?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Her new single.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Oh, shit.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Have you heard T-Swift's

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
new single?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Does anyone call her T-Swift?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Oh, yeah.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
T-Swift.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
You know, it's a...

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I got to dance.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I haven't heard it either.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I just saw everyone's talking about it.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I don't know what. I've never heard it.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
It sounds pretty salty.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
But sometimes some of those songs

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
that everyone's talking about are great.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I remember it was like, hey, that Lord song,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
everyone listen to that Lord song

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and I plushed it and then I was like,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I enjoy that. I also

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
would like to be royal,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
but don't need to be.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I also will never be royal.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I also don't.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I like to have a good time for less

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
overhead.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Lord.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I also...

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I'm fine with people calling me Queen B.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Hmm.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Hmm.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
You know who you are.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
You thought I was too funny.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Shame on you.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Schrab's wife plays magic.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Murphy's Law.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Okay, so Dino has this lizard

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
in his house.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
What? Or he used to.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
He's gone now. He gave it to somebody

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
that can take better care of it.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
His daughter wanted a bearded dragon

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
so he had this

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
lizard in a

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
tank.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
He'd take it out and let it run around

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
and whenever it runs around,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I'd be like, oh bearded dragons,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
they're so curious.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
They're trying to escape.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
They're curious.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
They go up through the window and go

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
just keep trying

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
to walk like a fuck

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
and like, can I get...

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And then I was like, I used to laugh at it

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
but he doesn't know.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
There's nothing out there for him.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
If you opened the front door,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
he'd go through it and he'd be like,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
come on, that's one homeless lizard.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
He's not going to become

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
vice president of anything.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
He's not going to find a condo.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
He's not even going to find a fly.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
He's a lizard from a tank.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
He's going to go out there and he's going to

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
get his ass kicked by the rat race.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
But

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I was in Tulum, Mexico

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
and then there's this movement

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
over in the underbrush.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
It's a giant iguana.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Clearly, and then we're like,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
oh god, is it going to kill us?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Have we intruded on its territory?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Mexico.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
No, of course we haven't.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Sorry, what?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
That's...

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
That's...

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I heard Texaco

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
so I don't know what you're...

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Mexico, okay.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
So we're like,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
is it going to attack us?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
It's like coming up to us.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And then we're like, I don't know,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
we threw a nacho

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
in a different direction

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
and it ran and started eating a nacho.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
And then Cody was like,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
oh god, what if the nachos are sharp?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
It's not supposed to eat nachos.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
And I looked up iguana on the internet

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
and I was like, it says they can eat anything.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
But don't eat nachos largely.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
This is the biggest iguana I'd ever seen.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And then we started realizing this thing lives here.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
It lives here and it eats nachos.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
And by any definitions,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
it is a successful iguana

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
for having done it.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
That was the biggest one you've ever seen.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
What was the smallest?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
The smallest iguana

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
that you've ever seen?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Another iguana that I saw there in Mexico.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Whoa.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Same day?

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Maybe? I can't quite remember that.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Okay.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Are you checking out my

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
sources or what?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I'm doing some research.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
He wants to know how many iguanas

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
have you seen.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I saw a million iguanas in Tulum.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
They're everywhere.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
They're like Chihuahua in

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Chihuahua.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
So I was just thinking,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
it's funny because that iguana

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
escaped from anything.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Then I was thinking, oh,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Dino's lizard when it's pressed up against the window.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
It doesn't have

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
the word power to explain this to us.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
It doesn't even know in its own lizard brain

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
what it's looking for.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I can't push the air.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
It's still basically

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
it wants to be

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
on a beach with us eating nachos.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Lizards.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
It's not like,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I want to get out of here

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
and be Lewis and Clark.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I want to find a place

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
where I can have food

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
and shelter and sex

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
and watch the sunset with you.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
You weird primate.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Why are you keeping me in this

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
in Los Feliz in a hot guest house?

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
And we're like,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
because you're fun.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Like, here's a stick.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
And it's like, what do you think this

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
because this looks like nature that I'm going to hang

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
on a stick on top of your TV

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
and chill

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and be as happy as I would be

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
if you

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
like, it wants what we want.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
The lizard wants what we want.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I don't think any animal,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
if they had the cognitive ability,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
wants to be in a little tank

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
in your living room with a stick.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
No.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah, pet ownership is really immoral.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
That's what we're saying, right?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
We should probably start fixing this country

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
starting with the top problem it has.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
It's National Dog Day, Dan.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Oh.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Couple of dogs in the audience.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Did you wish your dogs

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
a happy National Dog Day, Dan

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
and Rob?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I did.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Oh.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Well, I'm off on Twitter, so I don't know anything.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
It was on Instagram.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
But I feel like,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
and I'm not diminishing,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I support your animal enthusiasm.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Thank you, Daniel.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
It seems like there's a lot of animal

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
days happening with you.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
With me?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Well, there's a lot of animal days

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
that I'm conscious of because of your hashtags.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
There's not just one animal day a year.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
There's National Dog Day, there's an international

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
You Love Your Pet Day,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
there's Dog Defense Day,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
there's stuff like Mercy for Animals.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
That's not a day, that's just a thing you'd like to see.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Yeah.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
So, you're glutting the market.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Okay.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
You gotta cut down. Anything else?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Anything else I'm doing wrong?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Like, do you want to comment

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
on what I'm wearing?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Or, you know, my home?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Anything else? Anything, any other notes?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
For my life?

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
You're flooding the market.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
You gotta stop doing that.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
No, it's okay. Go ahead.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
What was it like

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
when you were writing scripts together

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
when you guys were alone in the room?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Just like this.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Without an audience.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Yeah, not a lot of scripts coming out of that machine.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Why is the Monster House just

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
bitching at itself about

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
how it's a bad friend?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Well, that's right what you know.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
We're done.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Alright, well, get in here, Pamela Petler.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Remember

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
when that guy wanted to,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I think maybe murder me and Pamela

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Petler because we were sending him

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
secret messages to Roster House.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I showed you the stuff and you're like,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
what am I, chopped liver?

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Remember that guy?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
No.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Maybe it was me.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
That was a story for only you.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Well, I've told that story before

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
about the guy that thought that

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Monster House was sending secret messages to him.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
The bear's retelling.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
He sent a lot of letters

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
to Sony and they give

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
me a big box of them to wash their hands

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
legally of it after the case was closed.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
They're like, this guy might kill you one day. Bye.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And he was like

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
a schizophrenic guy, right?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Who thought there was like secret messages.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Yeah, I mean, I would just...

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Dear Robert Semeckis.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I am

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
writing to

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
alert you to the fact

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
that your movie is

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
putting words in my

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
head.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I just wanted to let you know

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
that...

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
It's more like usually

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
they already assume

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
that Robert Semeckis knows it.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
They assume Sony knows it.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
They're writing to say,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
don't think I don't know what you're doing to me.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I know. Stop doing it.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Or I want money because they're convinced

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
of this thing. And then they're like,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Dan Harmon and Pamela Petler

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
are bragging about killing my daughter

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
in Monster House.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
And...

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
There's no...

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
There's no reason to give it.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
It's just Schrab is just excised from this guy's

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
murder fantasies.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
This guy can't get a break.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
The credits are Dan Harmon

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
and Ampersand Rob Schrab

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
and Pamela Petler.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
He just needlessly removed Schrab

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
from his mental...

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Might be a...

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
fan.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I can't stay mad at Schrab.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Did you ever think that it might have been Schrab?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Schrab, did you write that letter?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Yes.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Did you guys know that the phrase

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
cakewalk is racist like everything else?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Damn.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I don't know.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
What is the origin of cakewalk?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Maybe it's not racist.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
It has uncomfortable origins to like...

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
It is named after

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Elijah's cake.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Do you remember when...

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Say what?

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
It's a kind of party.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Well, cakewalk, yes, Annie is calling out.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
It's a kind of party. A cakewalk is when you see...

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
I believe they were doing this on Soul Train.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
You see clips of Soul Train or at weddings

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
when kind of a spontaneous line forms

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
and people dance down the line

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
like the Will Smith summertime video.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
That's what a cakewalk is.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
It's like people going down a line

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
and just getting points for style kind of thing.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Are they in line for cake?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
That's the thing, so it goes...

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
The etymology goes back to

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
slave times

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
when there would be a cake awarded

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
to the best

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
style going down the line or something.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
So then you're like, is there anything

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
that doesn't...

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
If you pull a cord

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
three inches and you're like, I don't want a guy.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Everything is ugly.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I just don't want a thing.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I just want to withdraw from everything.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I'm going to buy a land in the desert

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
and I'm going to dig straight down like Minecraft

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
and just see what happens.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
That sounds badass.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
It's probably hard though because it's all sand.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I have a new friend that's going to help me

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
because he bought land in the desert.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
What the fuck?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I exchanged numbers with him.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Jesus.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
And then you know how you exchange numbers

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
with people and

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
then you just text your name to them

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
because now they have your number.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I won't say his first name because I don't know

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
what his privacy is.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
But his last name is Pizza.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
It was like, for instance,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
John Pizza.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
And I was like, cool.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
The text conversation is just me.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
He's like, so here's that information

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I told you to give you.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Your last name is Pizza?

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Yes, it is.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
And you want to register here

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
and there's a type of thing.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Yeah, so...

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
stage name?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
No, real name Pizza.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
He sent a photo of his driver's license.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
You can tell he's had this conversation

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
a thousand times.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
That's the first Pizza I've ever met.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
And then I was like,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I had to ask.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I said, do you like Pizza?

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
And he's like, and he said,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
I knew what he was going to say.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
And I said, I know that, but everyone's not named Pizza.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
So I had to check

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
because what if you were the one guy

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
that didn't like it?

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
New whole new conversation.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I know everyone likes Pizza.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Do you know how

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Mexican people slice their Pizza?

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Cuatro Cinco.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
What?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
With Little Caesars.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I didn't say it.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
Racist in the audience said it.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I was asking because I don't know.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
But we found out that some of our audience

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
is very racist.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Well, I remember the quicksand joke

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
that's what I was doing, Cuatro Cinco.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Cuatro Cinco, yeah.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
What's the quicksand joke?

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
It's...

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
I don't really want to say it.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I'm a lift out.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Just look it up.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I don't know if I ever told this story on that.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Were you there, back in Milwaukee,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
because we were in comedy sports,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
there was a joke-telling contest at a shopping mall?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
No, but you did tell me.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
I wasn't there, but you told me.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
And I was like, oh, we need local celebrities to judge.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Comedy professionals.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
So we worked at comedy sports,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
so we went to judge this kind of like

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
joke-telling contest at a shopping mall.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
And it was like, there's like eight people

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
that are in constant rotation just wondering

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
by going, why is there a stage here?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
What's going on?

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
And then they go, so we're going to start the joke contest.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
So just remember, keep it above the belt.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Keep it clean.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
No, nothing overtly racial or

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
profane. They have this whole disclaimer.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
It's like, let's keep it friendly.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
And it's a fun joke.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
And then everyone's just so delightful

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
and bright-eyed. No one's trolling

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
or anything, but everyone's just hearing

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
that disclaimer and then coming up and going,

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
what do you call four Mexicans in quicksand?

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
And they just don't know.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
And then they're like, okay, okay, great.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Let's hear it for Emily. Again,

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
we really just want to,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
it's a joke contest at a shopping mall

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
and we just want to, and then it was

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
everything, it didn't matter

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
what color the person was, what gender.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
It was like they all shared one thing,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
which was a total love of some

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
disgusting, horrible, immediately offensive

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
joke that they had. No, I was like,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
a little 10-year-old girl came up

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
and she was like so excited and she goes like,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
and she goes like,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
it was the Fakawi joke.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
It was the Fakawi tribe joke.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
She was so excited to tell it.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
I don't know how to tell it. I don't know how to tell jokes.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
We know that. Have you

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
heard of the Fakawi tribe,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
the Native American tribe?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
They were

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
famous for their

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
sense of direction

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
and they mapped

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
the entire

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
pre-colonial

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
American

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
prairie because they had this amazing technique

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
because they didn't

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
use the sun and they didn't use

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
mountains, they didn't use the ocean,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
they would just, whenever they would

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
end up somewhere they weren't familiar with,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
they'd stop and say,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
we're the Fakawi.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
You did it.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
A 10-year-old girl

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
said that in a shot.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
That whole joke?

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
That's me trying to,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
that's my frog DNA.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I don't know how to tell jokes.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
I don't know.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:51.540

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:55.540
You got to go to commercial. You don't have to do that. You don't have to be here, Dan.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:06:10.540
Why are your shoes like society?

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:21.540
They protect you.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:28.540
They protect you while imprisoning you.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.540

He told us he wasn't going to help.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.540
And they shouldn't have gone into Vietnam.

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.540
Oh no.

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.540
They don't want me to say it.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.540
This war is a lie.

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:48.540
Please stand by. We're experiencing technical difficulties.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.540
Let's be doing cocaine.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:54.540
Please stand by.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:07:00.540
We now return to real people already in progress.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:07.540
Hey, you know, I'm trying to figure out how to make these cheese models work.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.540
What kind of glue are you using?

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.540
Just wood glue.

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:18.540
Oh, okay. Well, here. Let me help you out there.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:23.540
We are up to this broadcast to bring you an emergency service.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.540
The dead are rising from the grave and walking the earth.

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:31.540
If you see a loved one, a friend, someone you recognize,

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:35.540
and they are behaving erratically, homicidally, do not trust them.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:38.540
Do yourselves indoors. Burn the corpses.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:41.540
Do not trust the dead.

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.540
Report to the following safe haven.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.540
That was a close one.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.540
Virginia.

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.540
That wasn't close.

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.540
Thank God.

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.540
Thank God for zombies.

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:51.540
Man.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.540
Tomorrow morning, no one's going to be talking about that shoe ramps.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:54.540
I know.

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.540
They're all going to be talking about their loved ones trying to eat them.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.540
Oh, gosh.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.540
Boy, did we dodge a bullet on that one.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:04.540
Man, I invested like everything I own into that last hour television.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.540
Wait a second. I just got a telegram.

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.540
Is Dan still in the building?

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.540
Is Dan still in the building?

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:11.540
Yeah.

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.540
Let me check.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.540
Yeah, he's still here.

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.540
Dan, get your ass in here.

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.540
Dan, could you please get your ass in here?

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:23.540
I don't know what you think you were doing with that shoe ramp about Vietnam.

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.540
What was that shoe ramp about Vietnam?

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:31.540
One of our sponsors is the Viet Cong.

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:36.540
Oh, for Christ's sake, Susan, follow the money.

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.540
Look, I got good news and I got bad news.

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.540
Hey, hey, you want to hear some news?

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:41.540
There's two types.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.540
Go for it.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:44.540
The good news is...

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:50.540
The good news is Dan.

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.540
The good news.

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.540
I'm going to give you the good news first.

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:57.540
You get it first and then bad.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:02.540
The good news is that I haven't already come over there and killed you myself for ruining our show.

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.540
That's the good news.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.540
That's the good news. That's the good news.

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.540
Well, it sounds bad.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:12.540
Well, tell him the bad news.

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.540
Is the bad news?

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:18.540
I saved the bad news for last because I want your humiliation to be complete.

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:19.540
Yeah.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.540
Well, I thought I'd get good news and bad news.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:22.540
Well, you got the good news.

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:23.540
You got the good news.

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.540
I got two kinds of bad news.

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.540
Just admit it.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:30.540
You're using an ironic framing device.

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.540
No, we're not.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.540
You got two pieces of news. They're both bad.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.540
You put them in order of ascending badness.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.540
Yes.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.540
You don't fuck with people like that.

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:40.540
Oh, I don't fuck.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.540
You fucked with our hit TV show.

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:43.540
You fucked the TV show.

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:46.540
We had a big turn and hit.

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:49.540
I fucked that TV show to the top.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.540
No.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.540
Look at these numbers.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:54.540
You want the bad news or not?

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:55.540
Yeah.

01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.540
Give it to me.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.540
The bad news is...

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.540
I hope I choke on it.

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.540
I hope you do too.

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:01.540
Yeah.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.540
The bad news, my friend.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.540

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.540
Yeah.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.540
Here it comes.

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.540
This news is going to make those last newses seem good.

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.540
I wouldn't...

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:17.540
Go.

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:20.540
If I were you, I would buckle your bad news belt.

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.540

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:27.540
The bad...

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.540
What?

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:29.540
What does the bad news belt do?

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.540
It protects you from bad news.

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.540
Yeah.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.540
But this bad news is so bad that the belt is almost worthless.

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:35.540
So you know what?

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:36.540
Don't even put it on.

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.540
Are you trying to give me bad news?

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:39.540
Why give me the belt?

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:40.540
I'm giving...

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.540
I'm saying...

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.540
Put a hundred...

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.540
Put good news belts on.

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:47.540
Nothing's going to save you from how bad the news is that I'm about to...

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.540
So you don't want the news to be good.

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.540
I know.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.540
Just call it news then.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.540
Why do you have...

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.540
You don't even like it when it's good.

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.540
Why are you being so antagonistic?

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.540
Here's a pitch.

01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:58.540
Here's a pitch.

01:10:58.540 --> 01:10:59.540
How about this?

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:00.540
I'm going to give you another piece of news.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.540
After I give you this piece of news, you can look back later on when you go to bed.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.540
You can say which was the good news and which was the bad news.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.540
Which was the better news.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.540
That's a good way of explaining it.

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:10.540
That's a great way of explaining it.

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:11.540
Are you ready for the news?

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:12.540
Yeah.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.540
He did a pretty good job of setting it up.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:21.540
So just respect him enough to listen to the other half of the news.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:29.540
The two news items that we are troubling with you and wasting so much of your precious time with.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.540
Go ahead.

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:32.540
We're halfway through.

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.540
Here's the news.

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:36.540
He's fucking...

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.540
The head of the network.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.540
The guy that pays all of our bills.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.540
A man that could crush any one of us.

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:45.540
All your crazy, shoe Vietnam rents.

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.540
Your shitty attitude.

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.540
Loved it so much, he wants five more live right now.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.540
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. and Mrs.

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.540
I was kidding you fucking stupid asshole.

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.540
Did nobody watch it?

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:12.540
You ruined our show.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:20.540
We're so shitty you made the dead come back to the life and everybody's dead and we're sitting here all alone.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.540
The only reason we haven't left the studio is because our loved ones are out to kill us, right?

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.540
Yes.

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.540
Because of that last shoot.

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:30.540
You made America lose faith in its armed forces.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.540
Yes.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.540
And it's a very fabric of our society.

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.540
The fabric of society.

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:40.540
You faked a television broadcast during a zombie apocalypse just to shame me.

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:43.540
Which we should be storing water.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:50.540
Dan, what if I told you that this whole thing has been the new episode of your new show where you do rant about politics

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.540
and you get to speak your mind?

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.540
I'd be ecstatic.

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.540
Well then why don't you say hi to the audience because you see these cameras?

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.540
Gentlemen, pull the tape off from the red lights.

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.540
You see, this has been rolling live the entire time.

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.540
Dan, the people love you.

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:05.540
You spoke your mind.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.540
You gave them the truth.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.540
We want more.

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:13.540
We want more.

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:17.540
We want more shoe based truth.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.540
It's a weird network note.

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:23.540
They want all of your truth to be shoe kind of put into a shoe metaphor.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:24.540
Yeah.

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.540
Can you just put it in a shoe metaphor?

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.540
Just your truth.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:33.540
Why did you guys fool me into thinking that you hated me and that I was...

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.540
Because we wanted to see the real you.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.540
We wanted to see if you could stand up for yourself or shrink.

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.540
And you know what, sweetheart?

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:46.540
You nailed it.

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:47.540
I'm ready.

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:48.540
You ready?

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.540
I'm not afraid anymore.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.540
Dan, Dan, Daniel, Dan, got a little bit of shit on your face.

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.540
Can we get last looks?

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.540
Can we get last looks?

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.540
A little bit of shit on your face.

01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.540
Jeremy, can you come out here and give him a little powder?

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:00.540
He's a little shiny right now.

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.540
It's like a piece of...

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.540
He's a little shiny.

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.540
A little pretzel there.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.540
A little bit shiny.

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.540
Okay.

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:06.540
I think we're...

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.540
Here we go.

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:08.540
Dan, just be yourself.

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.540
Okay.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:10.540
Yeah.

01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.540
You got it.

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.540
One more.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.540
One more.

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.540
Just...

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.540
What?

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.540
Okay.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:24.540
What do new balanced shoes have in common with the city commissioner's office of St. Louis?

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.540
Focus on arch support.

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:35.540
We'll be right back.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:39.540
I can't believe you thought we were really doing a show.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:40.540
There was...

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.540
Dan, there's no cameras out there.

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:43.540
Yeah.

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:44.540
Yeah.

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.540
What the fuck are we...

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:46.540
You...

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.540
You believe that?

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:48.540
Yeah.

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:50.540
We wanted you to do a shoe-based hate show?

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:51.540
Yeah.

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.540
We...

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:54.540
You gotta be a special kind of dumb.

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.540
You ruined...

01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.540
You ruined our network.

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.540
Yeah.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:02.540
You trashed the world with your bile coming out of your...

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.540
I'm gonna go outside and have a smoke.

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.540
Yeah.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:06.540
I'll be right back.

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.540
Me too.

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.540
I'm gonna go out and watch him smoke.

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.540
Quick.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.540
This fucking guy is fucking...

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:13.540
I know.

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:14.540
I know.

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:15.540
I know.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.540
Smoking quick.

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.540
Okay.

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:18.540
Smoking quick.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:19.540
Wait, do you hear something?

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:20.540
They're getting closer.

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.540
Do you hear something?

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.540
Keep smoking.

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.540
I'm smoking as fast as I can.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.540
You're gonna tell me how to smoke now?

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.540
Ah!

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:27.540
Oh!

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.540
Oh!

01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.540
Ah!

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.540
Oh!

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.540
Zombie!

01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.540
Hit!

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.540
Sorry, Jeff.

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:37.540
Susan.

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.540
Susan!

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.540
Susan's fucking...

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.540
Jesus.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.540
All right.

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:42.540
It's past 9-11.

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.540
We should get...

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.540
Move on to the next segment of our show.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:50.540
No one wants to.

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.540
Well, guess what?

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.540
Levy's out of town, so fucking Dickhead has to take his place.

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.540
Anyway, so...

01:15:56.540 --> 01:16:01.540
Are we not doing G&G because Levy's out of town?

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.540
What?

01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:03.540
We are...

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:04.540
Oh, sorry.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:05.540
I put you on the spot.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:10.540
Let's, instead, fight.

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:11.540
Fascism?

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:12.540
No.

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:13.540
Each other.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.540
Oh.

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:15.540
Woo!

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.540
Let the fascists win.

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.540
But...

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.540
We're the audience.

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.540
Right?

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.540
We could fight the audience.

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.540
That would be fun, right?

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:24.540
You know, okay.

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:25.540
All right, so no D&D.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.540
Okay, fine.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.540
No, we could play D&D.

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:31.540
Hey, before we do, can I...

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.540
Can I do a plug real quick?

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.540
Yeah.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:38.540
I'm gonna be doing an art show September 9th.

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.540
It's called Slashback Video.

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:44.540
It's called The Missing N, the September 9th story.

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:47.540
Fucking bush mouth.

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.540
It's a Slashback video.

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:55.540
It's gonna be an art show that they take like a gallery and turn it into a video store.

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:59.540
And I'm gonna be putting up some of my VHS boxes.

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.540
What's it called again?

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.540
Slashback Video.

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.540
And it's gonna be September 9th.

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:05.540
So check out...

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.540
September 9th.

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.540
Instagram and Twitter for that.

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:10.540
Woo!

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:11.540
It's gonna be cool.

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.540
It's gonna be really cool.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.540
Where can they find us online if they want to find them?

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:18.540
On my Instagram account and Twitter account.

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:22.540
You can just go to HotmailBallWorship.com.

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:23.540
Stop it.

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.540
Stop it.

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.540
Stop it.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.540
Nobody likes that.

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:28.540
Nobody's ever liked that.

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:31.540
Did you say that you were gonna go...

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:34.540
He can Schrab it out, but he can't...

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.540
He can't Schrab it.

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:38.540
He can't Schrab it.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:41.540
Where'd you go on your phone to show something up on your screen earlier on?

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:45.540
I was just gonna show our text message conversation, but it's not worth it.

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:48.540
It's like, no, no, no, no.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:49.540
It's not worth it.

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:53.540
It's just this relationship is just dumb.

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.540
I said, will you do the...

01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:58.540
What did you think it was gonna be?

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.540
No, a wine and roses?

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:01.540
Don't do that.

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:02.540
I never promised you a rose.

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:05.540
I didn't ask for roses.

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:10.540
I said...

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:12.540
Can I see a little bit more of your iguana impression?

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.540
I quite enjoyed the iguana.

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.540
Can I see?

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:36.540
Now do an iguana shitting on the streets of India.

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:42.540
Why?

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:44.540
Why?

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.540
Oh, why?

01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.540
You were so in character.

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.540
You're like, why are you judging me?

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.540
Why?

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:54.540
No, no, no, no, no.

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:55.540
Shitting.

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.540
Do you guys think astrologers...

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:01.540
Aren't astrologers the ultimate pro-choicers?

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.540
Because you can't...

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:04.540
It'll fuck up your math.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.540
It's when you're born...

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:11.540
You can't be a pro-life astrologer

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:14.540
because it would fuck up all the math.

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.540
It's like the minute you draw...

01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:18.540
According to an astrologist's thing,

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:20.540
it's like when you draw your first breath

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.540
or when the cord is cut, I don't know.

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:25.540
Life cannot begin during conception.

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.540
It's when you're born.

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.540
The time of your actual emergence.

01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:32.540
What's the January astrology sign?

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.540
Capricorn.

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:36.540
Capricorn or Aquarius?

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:37.540
So you'd go nine months back.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.540
I'm sure somebody's done this bit on the internet,

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.540
the life horoscope.

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:43.540
It's just nine months earlier.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.540
So I should also look out for a new opportunity.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.540
Anyways, should we play G&D?

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:56.540
I think we should.

01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:58.540
I think we should roll the dice.

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.540
Roll those bones.

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.540
Let's just note that that last joke lost Annie.

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.540
She left.

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:11.540
No, you know, this is the time for Annie to take her show shit.

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:16.540
She goes back, she takes a big fucking steaming shit.

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.540
That's the thing that they all call it.

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.540
Why are you gonna...

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:24.540
What? What did I do now?

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.540
What?

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:29.540
The relationship is dumb.

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.540
No, I was trying to...

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.540
I'll try to do this, then I say,

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.540
we're the best and then we're a morning show.

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.540
I don't know.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.540
Why are you gonna do that?

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:40.540
I'm afraid of intimacy.

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.540
Google it.

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:44.540
What am I supposed to say,

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.540
I love you all the time?

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.540
We're dying.

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.540
Wow, that just turned so quickly.

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:52.540
We're your best friend.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.540
Thank you for being a friend.

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.540
I said, okay, wow.

01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.540
What?

01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:00.540
I don't know what to see.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.540
It's a dumb relationship.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:04.540
That's when I said it.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.540
Okay.

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:12.540
Twist my arm.

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.540
Rob, you're kind of a hugger.

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.540
You hug occasionally, right?

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:26.540
Yeah, I've been known to do that.

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.540
Dan, not as much of a hugger.

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:30.540
But you and I have hugged a couple or three times in our...

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.540
Maybe 20 or 30 times.

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.540
Dan's a back pattern.

01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.540
He's like...

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.540
That's what you'll get.

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:40.540
A back pattern.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:42.540
That's a sign you're a bad person.

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.540
You don't rub your hand.

01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.540
They're fucking bra strap.

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.540
You don't want to feel your bra strap.

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.540
You fucking pat.

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.540
When you hug a woman, it's the same rules as when you...

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.540
When you have a stain, you dab.

01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:56.540
Let's just do the fucking game.

01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.540
Let's just do the game, Dan.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.540
Dan, let's just do it.

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.540
I'm going to do it standing.

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.540
I had to find out.

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.540
I was at the Creative Arts Emmys with Alice and Brie.

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.540
And there's a photo of me with my armor around her.

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.540
And I'm like...

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.540
And then that's how I found out about hover hand

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.540
and men who are afraid to touch women.

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:16.540
Because everyone was like, Dan, really?

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.540
Come on. And they close up with my hand.

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:20.540
It's like claw hand over Alice and Brie's shoulder.

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:22.540
Because I'm afraid to touch.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:24.540
I'm like, I don't know. You just hate yourself.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.540
And you're just like, well, I don't want to...

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.540
They're making you pose for a photo. I don't want to...

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.540
And then that guy was like, well, he just thought it was okay

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:32.540
to rub his hand all over Taylor Swift to ask

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.540
because he's taking a photo with her.

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.540
It's like, you want to be the opposite.

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.540
And then you end up looking like a weird claw man.

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.540
And then I saw the blog and I was like, yeah,

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.540
it's like, yeah, I'm embarrassed.

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.540
I don't like touching people.

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.540
I've never had a professional massage.

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.540
Because I'm just like, for the same reason

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:52.540
that I would never have sex work done.

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.540
Or go to a sex worker.

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.540
It's sex work done.

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.540
I don't know the jargon.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.540
I don't frequent that industry.

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.540
Could you change my...

01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:04.540
Change my balls, oil filter.

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:06.540
I'm afraid, like society says,

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.540
oh, make that person...

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.540
Or I would never get a pedicure.

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:12.540
This person's seen a million toenails.

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:14.540
They know exactly how gross mine are.

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:16.540
But then all women say, no,

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:18.540
you just go and shove your gross toenails in their face.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.540
It's like, great. You're paying for it.

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:22.540
They've seen the worst.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.540
If you get a facial done, they do the extraction,

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:26.540
which is a fancy word for poppin' your zits

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.540
and your blackheads and things like that.

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.540
They all love it.

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:32.540
Well, I had a girlfriend who liked poppin' zits.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.540
And I told the story up here,

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.540
but a fucking random Trump voter dude

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.540
who like pumped, popped one of my zits

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.540
at a bar,

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.540
non-consensually,

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:44.540
just like reached out and fucking grabbed it

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.540
and went, pshh.

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:48.540
And my immediate response was like,

01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.540
emotionally it was the same as like a kitten

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.540
getting picked up by a scruff. I was like, thanks.

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.540
I wasn't... I didn't thank him,

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.540
but I was like, wow, what a man.

01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:58.540
Like, popped my zits.

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.540
Well, he's telling me to vote for Trump.

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.540
Like, we're going to lose the Civil War, for sure.

01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.540
That's the opposition.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.540
They will fuck it.

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:10.540
We ain't got no dothraki on our side.

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.540
Church and I, every night before bed,

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.540
we groom each other like chimps

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:16.540
and eat the bugs out of each other's hair.

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.540
I think that really is so romantic,

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.540
but I guess that's because we're primates.

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:22.540
Did you just buy that?

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.540
The idea that you could like,

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.540
grooming and grooming and like,

01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.540
and then eating the bugs out of the prayer.

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.540
I really do like that.

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:32.540
It's the nicest thing you can do for somebody

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.540
is get the bugs out of it.

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.540
But you're also getting something out of it.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.540
You're like, see, I got a bug.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.540
Yeah, this is trying to eat you, now I'm trying to eat it.

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:42.540
That fuck is not gross.

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:44.540
We peaked at chimp level,

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:46.540
and then we couldn't stand it.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:48.540
We were like, we fucking nailed it.

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:50.540
Oh, we cheat the system.

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:52.540
And then the same mechanism

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.540
that got us that far.

01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.540
Now we got these alarm doohickeys.

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.540
I've talked about it.

01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:02.540
Chimps don't got ice cream, man.

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.540
Chimps ain't got no ice cream.

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:08.540
But you know what they do, they have frog mouths.

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.540
Oh yeah, well humans do too.

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:12.540
I guess we could all fuck a frog in the mouth

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.540
if we wanted to.

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:16.540
But chimps do it and sleep like a baby.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:18.540
We'd all feel real bad about it.

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:20.540
Look at that frog walks away

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.540
going, what in the world

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:24.540
what frog god did I

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:26.540
offend?

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.540
The fact that that was caught on camera

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.540
couldn't just be the only time a chimp fucked a frog.

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.540
No, we've talked about this a lot.

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:34.540
We have like 600 episodes of the podcast.

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.540
They're all frogs.

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.540
If a chimpanzee

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:40.540
comes within five feet of a frog

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.540
it fucking...

01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:44.540
What are you talking about?

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:46.540
I can't believe you guys don't...

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:48.540
Come on.

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.540
What are you talking about?

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:52.540
Type chimpanzee and frog into YouTube

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.540
and send your kids to bed.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.540
Because

01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.540
why?

01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:00.540
And atone with your god because any time

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:02.540
a chimp finds a frog

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:04.540
it spends five seconds

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.540
it picks it up.

01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:08.540
It runs its finger over the frog's

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.540
lips.

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.540
It gets a look on its face.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.540
It pries the frog's mouth open

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.540
and then the rest

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.540
is kismet.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:20.540
A male chimp I should specify.

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:24.540
And then the

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.540
frog's fate depends on

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.540
what that chimp had

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.540
for breakfast.

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.540
Do the frogs ever hop away

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.540
from this interaction?

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:38.540
The camera usually stays on the chimp

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.540
as it enters its

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.540
refractory period.

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.540
The frog's

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:46.540
story remains untold.

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:50.540
Is it like a Flintstones cartoon?

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.540
And it just like goes...

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.540
It's a living.

01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:58.540
Those are our ancestors.

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.540
The Flintstones.

01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.540
The Flintstones.

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.540
We all celebrate the gazelle

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.540
femur and I go I could use this

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.540
as a hammer but it's like also

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:10.540
we're a sexual

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.540
we're a creepy species.

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.540
We're descended from the bonobo in particular

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:20.540
it's a very sexual version of the chimp.

01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:22.540
Have you seen that one clip I just saw

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:24.540
a couple days ago where the two monkeys are fucking

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:26.540
and the little monkey walks up and goes

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.540
sticks its finger up the nail.

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:32.540
They settle their grievances

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.540
through orgies and they

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:36.540
have constant incestuous like crazy sex

01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:38.540
and then you know

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:40.540
I just thought I just thought

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:42.540
we've talked about this a million times that's all

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.540
it's just like that's I know

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:46.540
we've talked about this.

01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:48.540
I know we said a lot of differences here at Harmon Channel

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:50.540
we fantasy role play with a little D&D

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.540
Okay so Schrab you're playing

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:56.540
just I mean all right

01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:58.540
Spencer do you want to give him a quick run down

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:00.540
on what is... Just do it.

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.540
Just go.

01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.540
Just be yourself.

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.540
All right here we do it. He's playing standing up.

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:10.540
He's like Hugh Jackman in that hacker movie

01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:12.540
where he's hacking standing up.

01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:14.540
Swordfish.

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.540
All right here we go.

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.540
Last time

01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.540
on Harmontown

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:24.540
you guys went into the secret

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:26.540
room of the priory

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:28.540
and you found evil shit

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.540
going down a hooded

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.540
figure was mutating people

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.540
and the people attacked

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:36.540
you fought the people

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.540
and they were really kicking your ass

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.540
you got most of them killed

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.540
and the vampire threw a barrel of piss

01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.540
at Steve Levy

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:46.540
it escaped in the form of a mist

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.540
and you guys chased after it

01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:50.540
only to narrowly escape

01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:52.540
a giant explosion

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:54.540
that sent

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:56.540
the priory starting to crumble

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.540
and you escaped

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:00.540
from the sanctuary

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.540
and you crashed to the ground

01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:04.540
you checked out those crazy

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.540
horses hoping to find some escape

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.540
but the horses were slaughtered

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:10.540
oh boy

01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.540
that's all

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:16.540
that's about all that happened right?

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.540
yeah yeah

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:20.540
I smell like piss

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:24.540
we got bigger problems than that Diarrhea Junior

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.540
did the mist get away?

01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:28.540
yeah you don't see it anywhere

01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:30.540
and it is a mist so it could be anywhere

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:32.540
is it nighttime outside?

01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:34.540
yeah we're in the courtyard now right?

01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:36.540
yeah you can see it's like the buildings

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.540
all around you

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:40.540
you could see only the sanctuary

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:42.540
that area that you were in only that part

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:44.540
caved in and collapsed the rest of the buildings

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:46.540
don't seem to be collapsed or destroyed

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:48.540
god damn it

01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:50.540
this whole fucking church

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:52.540
it's corrupt where's that guy that was sleeping?

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:54.540
Patchens

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:56.540
which guy? the guy you

01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:58.540
the guy that was sleeping not outside

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.540
but the guy that was sleeping in bed

01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.540
the first steps that Diarrhea found

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.540
oh that person was still in the bed last you left them

01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.540
I want to head in that direction

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.540
alright

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.540
you go up the stairs into the sleeping quarters

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:12.540
that you were last in

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.540
there's six doors like last time

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.540
you remember which door

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:18.540
was the one you went through last time

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:20.540
I go in

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.540
okay so

01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:24.540
I want to go check the other doors too then

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:26.540
I want to know how many people are left in this

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:28.540
prior area

01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:30.540
yeah

01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.540
alright me too

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.540
you check all the doors and you see that

01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:36.540
they're all empty there's no one inside

01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:38.540
not even in the one that you thought there would be a person in

01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.540
god damn it

01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:42.540
everybody boned out this whole church was

01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:44.540
just a fucking brood

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.540
of baddies

01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:50.540
you hear too late

01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:52.540
a screaming as a

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:54.540
shrill cry

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:56.540
ushers forth from ahead

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.540
and you can see like in the ceiling

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.540
beams and stuff

01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.540
there's like two little girls and they jump on Diarrhea

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.540
Jr. and they're each holding a big head

01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:06.540
sized rock and each

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:08.540
you're on the head with a giant rock

01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:10.540
and you go down so sexy

01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.540
fucking love it you go unconscious

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.540
with the rock

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:20.540
I reach over and grab

01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:22.540
one of the girls off of

01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:24.540
DJ

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.540
alright you grab one

01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:28.540
the other one is wielding a knife

01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:30.540
and it's swinging it around

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:32.540
it's trying to cut you as you go into

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.540
grab, grab, grab her

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:36.540
you know other but she misses

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:38.540
thank god

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.540
alright

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.540
you're unconscious at the moment

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:44.540
I'm unconscious so I do nothing

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:46.540
I'm just gonna lay here

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:48.540
just for a little bit

01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.540
you think I'm gonna hit in the head

01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:52.540
with a brick?

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.540
two of them

01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:56.540
two bricks

01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:58.540
so is it my turn?

01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.540
I mean

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:02.540
I wish it was the first time I've said it

01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:04.540
I attack the little girl

01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:08.540
what do you attack her with?

01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.540
again in a cycle

01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.540
I seem to be caught in

01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:18.540
I attack the little girl with my morning star

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:20.540
I just grabbed mine

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.540
I think I've subdued her

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:24.540
well there's two

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:26.540
you decided just to kill that one

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:28.540
I can't grab a little girl

01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:30.540
I smash her in the face

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:32.540
with a morning star

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.540
I'm not like a wrestler

01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:36.540
I don't know how to

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.540
she goes flying across the room

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:40.540
like a rag doll

01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:42.540
how does the girl that I'm holding

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.540
react to seeing that

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:46.540
appropriately

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.540
okay I thought they were

01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:52.540
sorry

01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:54.540
this escalated

01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:56.540
but they're like evil little girls

01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:58.540
they dropped down from a ceiling with rocks

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:00.540
they did drop down from the ceiling with rocks

01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:02.540
I thought they were like

01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.540
they're actual little girls

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.540
this is a great time for me as the DM

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.540
to point out that asking questions

01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:10.540
is a great way to improve your standing

01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.540
in the game of Dungeons and Dragons

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:16.540
but

01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.540
yeah

01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.540
they're just regular little girls

01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:22.540
who are you asking?

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:24.540
my eyeballs

01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:26.540
they don't look mutanty or evil

01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:28.540
they look terrified

01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.540
one of them has a smashed face

01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:32.540
because I hit it with them

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:34.540
well one of them is probably unconscious

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.540
if you took a metal baseball bat

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.540

01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:16.540

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:30.540
I put her down step aside

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:32.540
and I point to morning star guy over here

01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:34.540
this guy doesn't fucking

01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:36.540

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.540

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:48.540
a locked door

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.540
it's really scary and mysterious

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.540
and it seems to remind you of stuff

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.540
can we role play in his dream

01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:56.540

01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:58.540
it seems to remind you of something

01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:00.540
hear me out little girl

01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:02.540
oh my gosh

01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:04.540
somebody else

01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:06.540
maybe I should open this door

01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.540
but I'm afraid to

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:10.540
I'm just gonna reach out

01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:12.540
I'm gonna reach out

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.540
and grab this doorknob

01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.540
the doorknob's a hand

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:18.540
I don't know I thought it was a dream I could

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.540
yeah the doorknob's a hand

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:24.540
it's a hand like blue man group

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:26.540
it grabs your hand and then you become doorish

01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:28.540
instead of it becoming like

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:30.540
open

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:32.540
oh shit it's scary

01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:34.540
but you don't wake up because that would be

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.540
convenient

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.540
alright back to the bedroom

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:40.540

01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:44.540
as members of the church of the silver flame

01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.540
that we did not cause the explosion

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.540
and all the violence here

01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.540
at the sanctuary because that violence

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:52.540
yes and I can

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.540
un-cause it and I go to the girl

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.540
his face I smashed and I

01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:58.540
I would like to change

01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:00.540
my virtue

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.540
spell for a spontaneous healing spell

01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:04.540

but I do have a healing skill

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.540
which I guess is like having a

01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.540
cup holder instead of a

01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:30.540

01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:14.540
there was a loud explosion

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:16.540
and we woke up in our beds

01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:18.540
we realized no one else was in the sleeping quarters

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:20.540
so we thought someone had attacked the church

01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:22.540
where are your beds

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.540

01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:26.540
in and around

01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:28.540
why were you in the ceiling

01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:30.540
because we were hiding from intruders

01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:32.540

01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.540
bad thinking on our part

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.540

01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:16.540
she was a lady that came to the church

01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:18.540
she was just a church

01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:20.540

should we

01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:52.540
should we separate them and

01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:56.540
ask him questions

any answer would have been funny I mean

01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:02.540
I think

01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:04.540
separate of them might be more traumatic

01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.540
they're all they have right now

01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:08.540

to kind of hurriedly follow him

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:22.540
because he's not being slow

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.540

01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:10.540
she was a blonde

01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:12.540
they would have told us if they had other kids

01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:14.540
oh darn

01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:16.540

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.540
I was

01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:20.540

01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:26.540
Tom get over here

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.540
Tom's in the house

01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:30.540
that's on fire

01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:32.540
Tom stay in the house

01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:34.540

01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:36.540
no this is my holy mission

01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:38.540
what are you trying to accomplish here

01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:40.540
I'm gonna slay the child

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:42.540
and bring our town to peace

01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:44.540
we already got the demon out of the child

01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:46.540
I'm gonna feed him bad soup

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:48.540
that's gonna take forever

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:50.540
we already

01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:52.540
released the demon out of that

01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:54.540
and it took us to a place

01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:56.540
he's been buried and killed

01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:58.540
he's got buried and killed

01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:00.540
whoa

01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:02.540
the priors not listening to reason

01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:04.540
I'll say he's

01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:06.540
holding a sword in his

01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:08.540
weapon of choice is soup

01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:10.540
he's an idiot

01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.540
we were gonna feed bad soup at one point

01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:14.540
remember that

01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:16.540
he smashes through the door

01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:18.540
and he goes in the house

01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.540
we follow him I guess

01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:22.540
gotta follow the priors

01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.540
we're gonna leave you outside

01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:26.540

01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:20.540
it's called dying

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.540
we're injuring a house of people that hate us

01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:24.540
we don't know what the priors are so he's freaking out

01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:26.540
but he's the prior

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:28.540
of the church that has the demon lady

01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:30.540
I'm so bad with names and faces

01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:32.540
I thought that he

01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:34.540
when we talked to him the first time

01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:36.540
he was like all fucked up and evil seeming

01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:38.540
but I guess maybe he was overwrought

01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:40.540
or maybe he seemed paranoid

01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:42.540
because and I pull out my book

01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:44.540
that I grabbed called what to do when your

01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:46.540
church is under attack

01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:48.540
I look at Patchens

01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:50.540
what the hell is going on

01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:52.540
do you know what's going on why is the prior acting like this

01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:54.540
he's fucking crazy who would just burst into

01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:56.540
someone's house or light it on fire

01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:58.540
just to get at their possessed child

01:51:58.540 --> 01:52:00.540
he's gonna kill the kid he's right

01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:02.540
he thinks the kid is

01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:04.540
prior

01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:06.540
I run

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:08.540
you're in the flaming house

01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:10.540
and there's nobody

01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.540

01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:14.540

01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.540

01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:36.540

This guy's crazy. Who's talking Tom? Sorry, your son was possessed by a demon. Yeah, I know

01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:06.620
Well, it made your home the enemy of the church

01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:09.740
Hmm at least you're alive. Yeah

01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:12.340
Not too not too bad

01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:18.540
I'll tell you one thing that church that you hate so much it you're right to hate it because we went down into the sanctuary

01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:23.140
And there was a vampire doing crazy blood magic. That's why your cows are being killed

01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:29.580
That's that's that's where all this blood has been going. Oh, I thought it was just because I had been stealing from the church for the past three months

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:35.020
Here's some relics I stole I feel guilty about it. Oh wow

01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:41.820
I examine the relics. They're just relics. They seem like art objects that might sell for money. Okay

01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.620
Well, we should return these yeah

01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:52.420
Is there anything else you want to tell us but there's an evidence locker later on? No, you don't want to tell us anything else

01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:54.760
Well, we should kill this guy right this guy's crazy

01:55:56.500 --> 01:56:00.220
The prior look no, I mean, there's many sides many sides

01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:12.300
I like this is what I'm hearing. I liked it. I liked it. I liked it

01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:16.980
No, I liked it. Well because someone died. That's why it's not funny. I

01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:19.900
Didn't think it was funny. I just liked it

01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:24.900
But most people are gonna be listening to this a year from now, they're gonna go what many say, okay, I

01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:27.900
Can't hear this through a gas mask

01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:36.380
Why is my child half cockroach is the prior conscious or unconscious he's knocked out

01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:40.900
We leave a note on his chest that says we came

01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:46.580
For the problem the problem is gone. No, I don't know. I don't think it'd be funny

01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:51.580
I take some rope and tie his hands and feet just in case he wakes up and goes crazy again

01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:53.980
All right, I pull his pants down

01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:56.900
