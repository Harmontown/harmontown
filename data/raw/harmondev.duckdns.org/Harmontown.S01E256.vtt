{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.000\nHello, game, from beautiful uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:24.000\nI say, why bury the good stuff?\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:39.000\nLet's bring out the great stuff, Spencer Crittenden, the Game Master, and the Mayor of Harmontown, and the landlord of your heart, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:10.000\nFor the home listener, Dan Haslam can only be described as a new look.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:27.000\nI place it's equidistant between Walter Cronkite and Captain Kangaroo, with just a little suggestion of Stacey Keach.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:47.000\nIt's for a movie, so you're judging a movie star. See where that'll get you. Throw your mud from aside the red carpet. It won't musse it.\n\n01:47.000 --> 02:03.000\nYeah, it's for a movie. And here's the thing. You know what I need to do? I leave the set of the movie, and as I was walking, I'm going to go a couple blocks from this bar.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:16.000\nI'll go there and I'll have a drink, and then I'll call an Uber or a Lyft, if you want to believe that I am helping, and just haven't given up and don't want to be talked to.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:23.000\nBut then, halfway there, I'm like, oh, shit, fuck, god damn it, I look like this.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:32.000\nAnd then it's just like, I've been grappling for two days, I go like, well, what is it? Because you looked so good before?\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:41.000\nAnd then I was like, oh, okay, no, I never thought I looked good, but what I looked like before was someone who didn't care what he looked like.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:50.000\nThis looks like someone was like, what can I do? How am I driving? And that's the deal breaker for me.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:56.000\nAnd why is that the deal breaker for me? Because, oh, I'm so honest, I'm such an honest person.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:13.000\nAnd then I'm like, you should have a mustache. The person I am inside looks like this. It's perfect, because this is how much I care. I do want to be cool this much, and I do fail this much.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:26.000\nAnd I should, this is who I should be, this is how I should get used to it, because this is a big, you know, my zizzic beard, and it's like, oh, so that if somebody can go like, hey, you piece of shit, and I go, what?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:32.000\nI said you're a piece of shit. I don't care. That's not true. That's not true.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:43.000\nI don't think this look says that you care how you look. It says that you care about the fact that at 1pm, President Kennedy is pronounced dead. Dallas, Texas.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:44.000\nYou have to put some...\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:48.000\nVice President Johnson is on the plane.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:57.000\nI mean, I just, this is part, I'm just saying, this is a journey I have to go on, because I'll tell you kids, like, a lot of you have tattoos, piercings, and things like that.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:09.000\nI'll confess to you, I don't feel this way anymore. 15 years ago, if somebody had like a pierced lip, or like a tattoo, or something, I would like secretly in my head, I'd be like, I don't trust that person.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:20.000\nBecause they'd be like, well, they're so scared that no one's going to notice, or that no one's going to know who they are, or that they don't know who they are, or that they had to take these measures and stuff.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:29.000\nAnd it's like, I would look down on that, I wouldn't look down on them, but I would be like, that person's not going to get along with me, because the real thing you're supposed to do is do that in front of a typewriter.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:44.000\nAnd I'd be like, fuck it, there's so many things to hurt about yourself before you put a hole in your lip. You could fucking just dissolve your esophagus with acid that you drink like a quart of a week for 40 years.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nThat's fucking honest.\n\n04:46.000 --> 05:00.000\nSo I'm just sorry about that 15 years ago that I was ever like, oh, she has a thing in her nose. I don't trust her. I trust you now.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:10.000\nBut do we trust you with this new look, Dan? That's the question. Your sideburns are triumphant, by the way. You look like a little bit like Nigel Bruce, like Holmes.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:16.000\nI mean, that's our Watson from the old, you know, Sherlock Holmes.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:27.000\nI keep making the joke, but it's not a joke. You know when I got out of the makeup chair, I was like, oh, Nick Offerman said no.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:33.000\nThey should credit me as that. The movie should say starring Nick Offerman said no.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:38.000\nWell, the same thing. Every time I've ever gotten a job is because Jerry O'Connell passed.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:46.000\nYou know, Jack Black used to say that about Philip Seymour Hoffman. But when they were younger, like they would be in the same waiting rooms all the time.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:55.000\nWe've talked about that. The Wolfman had nards. Indeed.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:01.000\nBut yeah, this is the fate I deserve. So I don't know. Maybe when I finish this movie, maybe I'll...\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:12.000\nI was also noticing, like, oh, sideburns. Oh, I was like, what was the deal with sideburns? And I was thinking, oh, the men in control in the 70s, they were more likely to be older and overweight.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:21.000\nAnd so, and sideburns kind of squeeze your face like bookends. Even though my double chin is exposed, you're like...\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:31.000\nI don't say you're... Just don't... Hey, guys, also... Don't correct me on this. It's like a slimming thing for a fat face. You would not...\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nFuck you. Just come on. I'm just saying.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:38.000\nDan, just tell them. You gained weight for the role.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:47.000\nBut then the 80s came and then everyone was like, everybody's doing aerobics. And then it became more possible to be...\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:59.000\nI've been thinking about this all, like, okay, so, you know how like surfing, all of a sudden in the 60s, everybody was like, whoa, there's beaches everywhere where the water is.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:05.000\nWe should get down there and we should have all kinds of fun. It was like, oh, why didn't they...\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:13.000\nThose beaches were there in the 40s and it was like, oh, that's where battles were happening.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:22.000\nNobody wanted to... The previous generation was like, dad, let's go to the beach and he'd be like, yeah, that would be fun.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nMaybe we'll find my arm.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nYou remember how many lives are lost at the Great Battle of Zuma?\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:34.000\nBut, you know, that's not really it. But then I was thinking, oh, you know what it probably is?\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:41.000\nIt's like, okay, so, you know, you see like black and white photos of people at the beach and they have like the crazy like Charlie Chaplin swimsuits where it's like, you know,\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nyou have to cover more of your body culturally.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nYeah, the onesie.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nAnd then it was like, everybody's always had a beach ball and they had like a onesie.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:54.000\nAnd then like the standards for public like undress slackened.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nSo then I was thinking, oh, that's kind of interesting.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:06.000\nLike, do you think that the outfits got comfortable enough for people to realize how fun it could be at the beach and or the beaches got more popular\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:14.000\nbecause that's where you could see ever increasing states of undress provocative things are happening down there.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nThese ladies got their boobies in less material.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nLet's get down to the beach.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nHey, it's nice down here.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:29.000\nFeminism has always had a strange creepy handshake with the grody dudes like enjoying it.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:33.000\nThe bra burning thing.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nHear him out.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nOh, no, I'm not saying please appreciate it for what it's enough.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nI'm just pointing it out.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nI'm not like, you need to, you need to approve.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nWe're the wind beneath your wings, ladies.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nYou're going to miss us when we're gone.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:55.000\nTry getting equal without a dude in a raincoat jerking off to it.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nJust try.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nYou'll find it's quite impossible.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nNo, that's not what I'm saying.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:05.000\nI'm just saying that culture advances as, like,\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nbut can we check in about the bra burning thing?\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nBecause I was just like, it's safe enough now.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nLike, we've gone through enough stuff.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nWe're all brothers and sisters and you weren't like,\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nthat was kind of a swing and a miss, wasn't it?\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nLike, wasn't it?\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:24.000\nThe burning, you found, not you, you're 25, but like,\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nwasn't that sort of a check to see?\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:31.000\nI was like, I think this is, I think these were invented by men\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nto make our boobs look better.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nSo I'm going to burn them.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nThey're like shackles around my femininity.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nAnd then everybody was just like, okay, they're burning them.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nAnd then aren't they back?\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nAnd then it was just like, we never talked about it again.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nIt was just like, oh, can I get three bras?\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nAnd Jesus Christ, my tits are killing me.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nI don't know what a bra is.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nComing out of the 50s, those bras are those crazy weird,\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nlike Miss Osilo bras that were really like.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nYou should have burnt the tips of the bras.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:03.000\nGet your activism straight in the 50s.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nI don't know.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nI just wanted to check in.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nI thought all women would go like, you were right.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nYou were right.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:12.000\nWe're sorry.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nWe never, we didn't want to talk about, we were embarrassed.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nWe love bras.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nThey were our idea.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nI'm so glad that in the first five minutes of the show,\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nyou fixed feminism.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nRetroactively.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nIt's really good.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nI love when I do my self deprecating thing.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nAnd then you're like, well, that's crazy.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nI come up like, hey, ladies, look at me.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nI'm so thin.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nAnd then you're like, thin as an elephant.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\nWell, that's not very nice or helping at all.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nAll I've said is that you look fantastic.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nYou look like a.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nNo, I was making, I was using a metaphor for what you just did.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nI was breaking it down.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nI understand.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:53.000\nYou're a little insecure right now because you look terrific.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nI was driving towards Elysium Park this morning.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:00.000\nAnd I saw a lady that was pulled over in a driving lane\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nthat had just finished up urinating in the street\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:07.000\nand getting back into her cars and getting her shoes back on\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:08.000\nand all that stuff.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nIt was, I didn't see it actually happening,\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:14.000\nbut I saw it put together very quickly that that was just had happened.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\nYou, you didn't see her urinating, but you sussed that out?\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:22.000\nNo, I saw this, this large puddle on the floor that was trickling downhill.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:26.000\nShe was putting her shoes back on and kind of straining at her one,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.000\none piece kind of dress situation.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:30.000\nIt was all very complicated.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nShe got back into her car?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:42.000\nI was like, man, she almost made it, but I saw.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:46.000\nSo she was dying for a pee, got out and just took it in the street.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nI guess.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nYeah.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nShe was right by a lawn, but she didn't go into the lawn.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:57.000\nShe might have thought like, like this is the first time I've peed as an adult in the city.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nMaybe it's disrespectful to do it on the lawn.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nThat was what she had on the sign she was holding.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nYeah.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:09.000\nLike I'm not sure what I'd do if I was like traffic and I just had to get Schrab told the story,\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nbut he just peed his pants and he was like, it was kind of a triumph for him.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nThat's like a heroic tale.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nBecause it's like, what are we doing?\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nWhy are we trying to not pee our pants?\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nDoes our parents told us?\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nIt's silly.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nIt's dumb.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nThey just didn't want to change us.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nYou can pee your pants anytime you want now.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nIt's not a crime.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:30.000\nIt's not like a van driving around like looking for people with pee in their pants.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nIt's for you dry pants.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nIt's a favor you do yourself.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:39.000\nYou can, if you have to pee that bad, you can opt to have wet pants.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:44.000\nIt's a natural, it's an arguably more natural state of pants than dry pants.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:50.000\nLike we go through our day making trips to a strange room to keep our pants dry,\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:53.000\nbut it's like that because that's an artificial construct.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nDry pants.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:56.000\nIt's an illusion.\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:01.000\nLike the idea that none of us are peeing right now is a lie.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nThere's urine inside our body.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nOur bodies are 29% urine.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nYou can look it up.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nYou should burn your pants and protest.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:15.000\nDoes that mean that not jizzing is also a lie?\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nYeah.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nEverything's a lie.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nTalking is a lie.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:26.000\nMy brain, the only form of truth would be if you could know what I'm thinking and feeling.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:30.000\nIf you were me, the only thing that's true is silence.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nAnd then I violated.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:35.000\nI put on a performance by wobbling the air with my mouth,\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nand then you get vibrations in your earhole,\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\nand then you associate those vibrations with a trunk in your head.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nYou open it up.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nIt's like if I send you a heart emoji with my mouth,\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nthen you have to load the heart emoji on your side.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nI'm explaining communication to you, but...\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:56.000\nYou could theoretically, neuroplasticity dictates that you could decide\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nthat when I hear the word cucumber,\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:03.000\nI'm going to respond as if I heard the word dolphin.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:06.000\nIf I hear love, I'm going to think hate.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:10.000\nYou could just re-root your brain.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:14.000\nYou could go to any point, as long as you start being aware of what you're doing,\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:17.000\nthen you go to these points in your brain,\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nand then you don't have to do anything,\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nbecause what happens is a new, random, natural thing.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:31.000\nThe reason there's a road to Rome from a gas station outside Rome\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nis because there was a spot where Romans were standing,\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nand then they were like, I'm going to go to Rome,\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nand they started walking because they were like,\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nwe've got to be over there. Why are we at this gas station?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nAnd also, we should have taken the car. We got all the gas.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nThey didn't have cars yet.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nBut they had gas stations. That was better.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nThat's why Rome fell.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:54.000\nThe chariots were just coated in gasoline.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nThere was no tank, and they would burst into flames.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nAnd all the lead in that gasoline got into the pipes,\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nand that's how they fucking did it.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:04.000\nYou walk where you want to go, and then you leave this little footpath,\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nand the person follows you, and you know,\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\na road's start is like footpaths and trails and things.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nIt's a path of least resistance.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:14.000\nIt's like a drop just takes a kind of semi-shortest route to a destination.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:17.000\nSo if you go back to a point in your neurology,\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nby being aware, you don't have to try anything.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nYou don't have to be like, oh, I'm going to be different.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:25.000\nYou can just go, okay, I'm going to be aware of every thought that I have.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:30.000\nAnd then there's certain thoughts that have this straight fucking paved freeway\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:34.000\nto Rome, which you think is the only choice you have\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:38.000\nto the point where you don't even realize this is a place you can stop.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:42.000\nSo you practice stopping.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nSee, I did it.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:47.000\nRight now I was about to finish my thought,\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nbut I do that all the time.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nBut you can just wait and see what happens.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nSomeone goes like, hey, peanut butter, and you go, I love peanut butter.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nAnd then, boom, you don't smoke anymore.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nYou'll figure it out.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nIt's called neuroplasticity.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nI just explained it.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:11.000\nThat was the first time I've ever truly understood what neuroplasticity was.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:14.000\nYou can remap your whole brain.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:17.000\nJust being aware of the things that happen to you throughout the day,\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:20.000\nwhen you get up in the morning, you can just sit there and go,\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nokay, so I'm going to move my arm, and then it's like baby steps,\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nand what about Bob, maybe?\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nNo.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nWho cares?\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nLike, usually when I'm in this position where I'm like,\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nI feel like nobody understands me, then I freak out,\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nso I'm going to stop, and then I'm going to take another option.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nMmm.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nMmm.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nOh, God, I should do this all the time.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nMmm.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nOh, that's good.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:51.000\nGod, it's making everyone smarter.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nMmm.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nThere, I fixed myself.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nAll right.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:00.000\nOur guest tonight, uh...\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nYou're just on the keypad.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nOh, no.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nWhat?\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nOh, you...that's...\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nHuh?\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nThat's a joke.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nNo, no, it's the truth.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nYou clearly...\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nWhatever.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nDid I ruin your joke?\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nNo, no.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nYou're just trying to cover for it now.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nOh, what?\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nAll right, all right.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nHey, wait, so, okay, whose idea was it\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nto make full-blown a medical term?\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nLike, how is that...\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nIsn't that...this is so childish.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nLike, someone is like,\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\noh, we have this serious thing called AIDS.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nIt's killing people.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:48.000\nIt couldn't be more sensitive and terrible.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nBut we actually need to distinguish a few things\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nlinguistically because we're trying to cure it\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nand we need to document all these things.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nSo there should be a difference between this and that.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nI was like, well, let's call that one full-blown AIDS?\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nLike, why didn't that guy get fired?\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nWhy was it like...\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nWell, you're good job, Jenkins.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nIt's like if he said, like, a humdinger or, like...\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nLike, that one's a lulu.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nA doozy.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nA doozy.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nTote's AIDS.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nIt just seems...\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nIt makes you feel bad when you're talking about it.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nLike, it's like, you know, we all got a kick out of it.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nI finally looked it up, but sure enough, it's a clinical term.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nLike, that was a terrible idea.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nDid we talk about, on the show before,\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nabout J. Johnson's pitch for a breakfast restaurant?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nGive you some full-blown eggs.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:42.000\nSee, that's the right use of full-blown.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nHoney, I want breakfast.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nGod, me too.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nLet's call it a full-blown eggs.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nI have one more linguistic problem.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nAnd I said, look, hey,\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nI don't want to start a beef with the band Imagine Dragons.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nI have no problem with them.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nI have a problem with the phrase Imagine Dragons,\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nbecause how could...\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nIt's the...\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nThat is the one...\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nImagine Drag.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nIf I'm imagining, why would I imagine...\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nThat's like doing an impression of Homer Simpson\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nin your stand-up act.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nThat's like someone else's imagination.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nDragons.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nImagine... Oh, you got me.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nDragons. What the fuck?\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nSomeone else imagined them.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nImagine... Oh, I don't know.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nI'll try to keep up.

26:24.000\nYeah.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nOr a principal.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nGive me like a British...\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nYeah, there's...\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nGive me a blustery old, like, Colonel\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nold, so...\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nNo, not Japanese.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nDo English, not Japanese.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nIt's hardly the way to behave\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nin that situation.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nWhoever committed this murder\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nmust have one shoe\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nwider than his thigh.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nI say, Mr. Harmon, nothing.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nI find your methods highly unethical.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nOh-ho-bo-ho-key.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nOoh, the cheek on this one.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nSo, listen.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nDid you guys know that...\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nDid you guys know that\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nthe guy who came up...\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nthe phrase Murphy's Law,\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nwhatever can go wrong,\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nwill go wrong, basically,\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nwe looked it up in the car\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\non the way over because we were looking up\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.000\nat some of the eponymous stuff.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nIf that's what they call it.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nCody was...\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nbecause she was learning about the Bechdel test\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nand she's like, how many other\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\neponymous things are named after women?\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nOne, the Streisand effect, and then everything else.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nSo, it's kind of...\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\neponymous laws don't really...\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nthey kind of violate some tests there.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nBut one of the tests is Murphy's Law.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, but that's not a guy.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nThat's just probably some ironic Irish thing\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nor something, like luck of the Irish inverted\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nbut there was a guy\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nwhose, I guess his nickname\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nwas Murphy, but his full name was like\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nkind of Robocop.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nIt was a...\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nI don't know, it's a longer name\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nbut they called him Murphy, but he was a guy\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nwho made measuring instruments\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nor something. He was a fuck-up.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nI think his shit didn't work.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nSo, the reason Murphy's Law\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nis a thing isn't because...\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nwe've all adopted it as a phrase that makes us think,\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nlike, whoa, you know, look,\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\ngive yourself a break, like, shit goes wrong.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nYou know, you've got to anticipate shit going wrong\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nbut it was like, it wasn't even invented\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nby the guy named Murphy.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nIt was like something applied, it was like\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nMurphy's Law is that this shit won't work.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nLike, a guy probably...\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nhe probably only didn't kill himself\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nbecause his noose broke.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nHe's probably like, well, this isn't going to last.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nI mean, a couple of weeks and they'll get sick\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nof saying Murphy's Law.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nAnd then someone was like, you know that thing\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nyou thought would happen? It didn't.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nIt went wrong.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nEveryone's going to say you're a fuck-up\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nfor the rest of your life. Well...\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nThey're saying it in Ohio.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nThen I'll blow my brains out.

44:36.000\nJesus.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nAnd then you know how you exchange numbers\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nwith people and\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nthen you just text your name to

is.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nBut his last name is Pizza.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nIt was like, for instance,\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nJohn Pizza.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nAnd I was like, cool.\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nThe text conversation is just me.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nHe's like, so here's that information\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nI told you to give you.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nYour last name is Pizza?\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nYes, it is.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nAnd you want to register here\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nand there's a type of thing.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nYeah, so...\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nstage name?\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nNo, real name Pizza.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nHe sent a photo of his driver's

met.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nAnd then I was like,\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nI had to ask.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nI said, do you like Pizza?\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nAnd he's like, and he said,\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\nI knew what he was going to say.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nAnd I said, I know that, but everyone's not named Pizza.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nSo I had to check\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nbecause what if you were the one guy\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nthat didn't like it?\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nNew whole new conversation.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nI know everyone likes Pizza.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nDo you know how\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nMexican people slice their Pizza?\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nCuatro Cinco.\n\n45:56.000

46:08.000\nI was asking because I don't know.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nBut we found out that some of our audience\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nis very racist.\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nWell, I remember the quicksand joke\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nthat's what I was doing, Cuatro Cinco.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nCuatro Cinco, yeah.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nWhat's the quicksand joke?\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nIt's...\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nI don't really want to say it.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nI'm a lift out.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nJust look it up.\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nI don't know if I ever told this story on that.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nWere you there, back in Milwaukee,\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nbecause we were in comedy
