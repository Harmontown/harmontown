{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:09.000\nHow do you feel?\n\n00:09.000 --> 00:13.000\nIf you're at home right now, pull your pants down.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:22.000\nPlease welcome to the stage, Dungeon Master, Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:32.000\nHere we are together, just us.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:40.000\nAnd it wouldn't be just us unless we welcomed out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:44.000\nYes!\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:49.000\nI am Brandon Johnson. I'll be sitting in for Jeff Davis. We love you, Jeff Davis.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:55.000\nThank you. Thank you, Guest Comptroller, Brandon Johnson. Thank you.\n\n00:55.000 --> 01:00.000\nHe just said it. He said it.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:04.000\nI think I'm just going to get right into it. I don't really have a...\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:07.000\nI don't think I have... I've been purposely avoiding current events.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:12.000\nI don't think that's why anyone listens to this show.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:19.000\nYou tune in to hear about me.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:24.000\nI forget about this Russia investigation. How is Dan taking it?\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:26.000\nRight.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:30.000\nAnd so the only news on that front is that Dan is trying to...\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:35.000\nDan is experimenting with ignoring it.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:40.000\nAnd Dan understands that that is a full-on coward move.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:44.000\nThere's nothing that you can say to me.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.000\nI don't think that would make me go,\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:52.000\nNow wait a minute about what I am right now.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:58.000\nI am a fragile white closet libertarian.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nI don't know whatever I was.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:08.000\nI'm a coastal elite that just wants his Obama back.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:15.000\nOr any mannequin dressed like Obama that wants to just carry on the fucking status quo.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:20.000\nDrone strikes on Benghazi, whatever the fuck was the problem before.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:26.000\nI don't care. Just get it back up and running.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nI do not want Nazis in Atwater.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:34.000\nI don't want one of the five places that I used to go drink\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:38.000\nwhen the other four places were shitty.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:42.000\nI always had a weird vibe about that place.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:46.000\nI always thought I could smell a little Nazi on that place.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:51.000\nDid you see the... In case LA people were talking about a local bar,\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\ndid you know what I'm talking about?\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nFuck you!\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:59.000\nThis is not politics. By the way, none of this is fucking politics.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:05.000\nIt's a fascist coup of whatever, but an asteroid coming at the earth\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:09.000\nisn't politics just because Republicans want to say it's not coming at the earth.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nThat doesn't make it politics.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nI don't give a fuck about Republicans and Democrats.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:17.000\nI'm scared of asteroids.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nThere's an asteroid called fascism.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:22.000\nA lot of my friends that I talk to, they go like,\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nI think it'll swing and it always swings.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:28.000\nI know it always swings. We're always addicted to the swing.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nWe love the swing. We love the four years of this and the eight years of that\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nand the eight years and the four years and the four years.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.000\nThe swing that we're on right now is a 30-year swing.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:43.000\nIt's a big old swing and the front porch is called the end of a country.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\nIt takes 30 years to swing back.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:52.000\nAnd it's going to swing back to some horrible form of militant socialism\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nwhen it does swing back. We're fucked no matter what.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\nOkay, so that's the end of my politics corner.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:03.000\nAnd what the fuck was I...\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:07.000\nOh, just in the culture realm,\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.000\nI just found it interesting. Did you see the apology for the owner of that place?\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:12.000\nI did.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.000\nThis is not politics. This is just...\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nAs you guys know, I teach a masterclass in apologies.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:22.000\nApologies are...\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nI missed it.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nThe guy's apology was essentially,\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nhey, I'm Jewish. My bouncers are gay and black.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nAnd they love these guys.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nAnd I didn't know they were Nazis because I didn't see no uniforms.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nRight.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nIt was just sort of a...\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:41.000\nIt was really defensive.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nI would summarize his apology as this.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nHe was saying, look, I'm a businessman.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:52.000\nI don't know for sure that I can close the financial gap between\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\na fascist or welcome here bar and a fascist-only bar.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:00.000\nI'm going to need a couple more months.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nSo please keep having your liberal rat parties here.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nBecause I need to tell, like, I think 2019.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:10.000\nI think by then, then I can just say fascist-only and then, like, it'll be fine.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nThey did need a little convincing to start throwing those people out.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nThat is the truth.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nThey said that the only color we see is green.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nYeah.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nWhich is my favorite answer to any sort of racist question.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nLike, oh, they're beating black people in the streets.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nHey, man.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nKermit the Frog. Motherfucker Kermit the Frog.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nPlant life, bro. Plant life.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nGreen. That's all we see.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nAll right.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:37.000\nSo it's crazy that it's, like, literally now right behind your house.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:38.000\nRight.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:39.000\nWell, you made fun of me.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nLast time, what, two years ago, when Kumail had his story that happened in Silverlake.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nAnd I was like, this happened in Silverlake.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nAnd you're like, Silverlake.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nWow.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nWay to rub my oppression in my face, Dan.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nIt may as well be happening in our basements.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.000\nI mean, I don't even, it's not even like, oh, shit, it's at-at water.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\nBut it does, it does sort of signify a little bit of a shift that it's now in places where\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nyou thought there were going to be hip white people sort of helping you out.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:05.000\nYeah.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:10.000\nOr gay black bouncers, be fair.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nWell, you know, the bouncer is black and the other one is gay.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:16.000\nHe merged the two to have a super bouncer.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:20.000\nSo yeah, it does mean a little something when you hear it like, oh, shit, it's going down\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nand like, well, it's fearless.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:31.000\nBecause you getting chased out of little dorms of shit is when it's going to get, like, pretty critical.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:36.000\nI got to say, I do like the forced kind of survival behavior of some of these groups where\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:40.000\nthese groups are almost in a mocking or like Psyops way.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:47.000\nThey're like, hey, look, if we were, if we were racist, we wouldn't have this guy or this guy.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:52.000\nBecause it actually does for, I do think, I see a million flaws in the mirror when we were like, like,\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nhating some of these guys is making it, you know, hopefully the positive side.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nIt's like, oh, what, what do you hate and why?\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:00.000\nAnd the answer is nationalism.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:05.000\nThe answer is all these, you know, ideology, let's not be fooled by, like, you know,\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nlet's not be too so fashionable that we're blinded by this shit.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nThat's kind of, that's what, that's what trolling helps.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:16.000\nIt's like this bleach you scatter across things and like kind of like it's corrosive,\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nbut it kind of like also gets some shit off the counter.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nYou know, it's like, let's talk about good versus bad.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:26.000\nLet's not talk about fucking like, yeah, like, you can tell how liberal you are\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nby how many black people are in your club.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:33.000\nBut you can't edit, you can know it is a good indicator.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nAnd I'm doing pretty good.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:39.000\nAs long as Jeff, as long as Jeff keeps getting sick, man.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:42.000\nThis is the most liberal podcast in town.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:48.000\nWe want to invite you, but you ate too many lemon bars.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:51.000\nAll right, so I have a special story.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nThat's enough of that.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:57.000\nI know 30% of my fans are Nazis and that's why there's probably, there's empty seats here now.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nThe show is failing.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nIt's 30%, 30% of the seats are empty.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nI mean, not 30, right guys?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nOh, Jesus.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\nWell, you can't believe them.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nThose are full seats. They're biased.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nThey're like, whoa.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nHey, empty seats.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nAre you not here?\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nWhat?\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nWeird.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:25.000\nSo here's a, here's a, here's a story I have to sit down for.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nOh shit.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nA sit down story there.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nOh shit and a heart sit down.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nOkay, get your mic.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nOkay.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nAll right.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:37.000\nAll right.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nOkay.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nAll right.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\nPapa Bear is going to tell you a story.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nOkay.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nHere we go.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nWhere is this?\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:50.000\nOkay.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:58.000\nSo, the story starts on Thursday when I get a text message from dad on my phone.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:03.000\nAnd it's very, it's very nice.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:12.000\nThursday, 12, 28 PM, as your father, I wanted to text you to tell you how proud of you I\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:27.000\nam for your Emmy nomination for that pickle show you work so hard on.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:32.000\nAnd as a good son, six hours later, I text dad, thanks.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nBut here's something of even higher value.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\nI got a Tesla because my dad, I'm like, I want to bond with my dad.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nHe's a car guy.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:43.000\nBecause stuff, you know, it's like, oh my God, I'm bonding with my dad.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nI'm texting you right now while it drives itself.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nIt was true.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nDon't judge me.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nAlso the last thing that we ever read.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nAnd then so, so this is where my dad starts to really blow my mind.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nI was like, that was nice.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nCongratulations.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:04.000\nBut he says, but what about the smudges on the touch screen?\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nCouldn't you afford the Edison?\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:12.000\nAnd I went, holy shit, my dad is making references to my television show, great minds with Dan\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nHarmon, which is a really deep cut.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nYeah.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nYeah.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nOn top of an Edison joke, which you never hear.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:24.000\nAnd then my dad goes, nothing like self-congratulatory callbacks.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:32.000\nI'm like, well, my dad is like so hip.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nSo at this point, it's important.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:39.000\nThe story happens in layers and it gets a little thick and there's shit to unpack.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:44.000\nBut the first thing I need to do now is bring up the director of great minds with Dan Harmon,\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:45.000\nHeath Cullins.\n\n10:45.000 --> 11:00.000\nSo before we start to unpack this, he's like, I guess the first question is, do you remember\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:08.000\nwhen and why I put your number in my phone as dad?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:09.000\nHe asks everybody.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:10.000\nI forgot.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nFor sure.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nDon't feel bad because he asks everybody this question.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nHow many people?\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:22.000\nI do, in fact, remember.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nI wish it were more tawdry than it actually is.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:32.000\nSo we, as Dan mentioned, worked on great minds together and it was not the highest of budgeted\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:37.000\nshows, so we didn't have like VFX for things necessarily other than the really awesome\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nstuff in the lab that I'm sure you all saw.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.000\nBut we couldn't burn in the image of dad calling on his cell phone.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:50.000\nSo we had to have, to shoot it, we had to have an actual phone, probably not this one\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nbecause you have a Tesla now, so you've got a newer phone probably as well.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nThe Ron Funches episode, he plays Edie Amin.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nAnd dad had to call.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:01.000\nAnd the resolution to the conflict with Edie Amin, who like, it turns into a hostage situation,\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:08.000\nbut then like my dad calls on the phone and Edie Amin enjoys talking to him about politics\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nand they kind of call, I don't know, they call each other down until Edie turns into dust.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:20.000\nBut so we had to put someone's, we put your phone number in my phone as dad so that when\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:25.000\nyou called me, it would say dad and then I forgot.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:31.000\nBut it's notable, the important thing about the story, the absolute tragedy of this story\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:38.000\nis that it's not just me thinking that I have a new wonderful relationship with my dad.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:43.000\nAnd Heath is not trying to deceive me.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:50.000\nIf you scroll back through this window, there are a half a dozen times over the years where\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nthe following conversations happen.\n\n12:52.000 --> 13:01.000\nLike, it'll say like, let's see, let's see.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:07.000\nThursday, May 10th, 1242 p.m., he texts, congrats on that ginormous renewal.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:16.000\nAs recently as the 70 episode thing, I remembered and I say, thanks dad.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nYou're still in my phone as dad.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nSo I remember and I know.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nSo Heath thinks I remember and I know.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:31.000\nSo the really sad part of this, the whole thing that happens that starts on Thursday,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:38.000\nis that I'm thinking I have a new late life friendship with my dad and Heath thinks that\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:46.000\nDan Harmon's being really nice to him.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:53.000\nSo now knowing that it's Heath and that Heath doesn't know I don't know it's my dad and\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nthat I don't know it's not my dad.\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:01.000\nLet's start just over again and you can read your part and I'll read my part.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:07.000\nBecause then it continues until last night at which point I realized when Cody, I think\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nCody pointed out, no, you did.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nOh, God.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:15.000\nAnd then at a certain point I was like, you have to come on the show and we have to share\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nthis.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:20.000\nThis is the worst thing that's ever happened to end to two people.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:21.000\nOkay.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:25.000\nSo yeah, you want to just start with As Your Father.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nAs Your Father?\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nYeah.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nThursday, 1228 p.m.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:34.000\nAs Your Father, I wanted to text you to tell you how proud of you I am for your Emmy,\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nspelled E-M-M-I-E.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nBecause I thought that would be more dadlike.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:44.000\nFor your Emmy nomination, for that pickle show you worked so hard on.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd now I get it, you're acting, you're talking like a dad, but you weren't trying to fool\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.000\nme.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:51.000\nNo.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nYou were doing the same bit that we kept doing.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nVerisimilitude.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nI just forgot.\n\n14:55.000 --> 15:00.000\nI just drank that part of the roll of decks away.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nAnd so I go, dad, thanks, but here's something of even higher value.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nI got a Tesla.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nI'm texting you right now while it drives itself.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:09.000\nBut what about the smudges on the touch screen?\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nCouldn't you afford the Edison?\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:15.000\nNothing like self-congratulatory callback.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:21.000\nSelf-congratulatory, because he knows that it's the director of the show that he's referencing.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:25.000\nSo he's not trying to fool me.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:29.000\nBut I'm like, oh my God, I'm texting Cody in the meantime.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:32.000\nI'm like, my dad, look at those, they're sending her screen grabs.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:37.000\nI'm looking, he's making Greek minds references.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:45.000\nSo this is on some Make-A-Wish shit.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:50.000\nSo I sent a video of the inside of my Tesla.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:55.000\nIt was a video of just going from the dashboard to the steering wheel, because I wanted to\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:59.000\nshow that it was driving itself, but it doesn't look like any.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nIt looks the same as a normal car, because you're just shooting from here.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nYou can't tell that it's driving itself.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:09.000\nAnd so I just sent an unremarkable video showing that, and I said,\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:13.000\nI always want to show people a video of me not driving, but the LA cops are too aggressive\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nabout pulling over for texting and driving.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nThey're not too aggressive.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:23.000\nI support the law about distracted driving.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:28.000\nBut I just meant they're too aggressive for me to get that video in full.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:33.000\nI'd have to do so much that I would be distracted driving.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:39.000\nSo then my dad says, I sent a video of me\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:47.000\nfakingly self-driving my Hyundai Elantra on the highway, and it says NBD.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:51.000\nI'm like, oh my God, my dad says NBD.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:55.000\nMy Hyundai can do that too with the video.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:59.000\nAnd then he shows a video, and it's like the Hyundai dashboard,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:03.000\nbut then like a crazy camera shake.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:10.000\nAnd the sound of what I thought was my dad doing a crazy character going, oh, God damn it.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:16.000\nAnd he was like affecting this fun voice and doing this comedy bit.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:21.000\nAnd Heath just pointed out backstage that had I watched the entire video,\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:28.000\nwhich I always stopped, even though I kept showing it to Cody and going, my dad's doing bits.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:32.000\nIt cuts to black because the phone falls down.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:37.000\nAfter six seconds of which, Heath picks up the phone, looks into the lens,\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:43.000\nand goes, whatever, does some self-effacing bit, which I've never seen.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:49.000\nAnd so that, if only I had watched the video all the way.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:56.000\nInstead, I just text absolutely sincerely, ha ha.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nSo then days go by.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.000\nSo I walk into Little Dom's the other day.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nLast night's, well, Saturday night.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.000\nNo, Saturday? Yeah, it says Saturday.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:10.000\nOkay, yes, Saturday night. Two days later.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:13.000\nI walk into Little Dom's with Cody.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:16.000\nJohn Hamm is sitting there.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nI'm just going to go ahead.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nOh wait, who cares?\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nWait, whatever.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nHe's sitting there with Edgar Wright and...\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:24.000\nPaint the picture. All of them.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:29.000\nI'm not going to name everybody.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:34.000\nBut like Joaquin Phoenix and like Cicely Tyson.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nIt was a table of stars.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:41.000\nA Batman.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nA table of stars.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nPerched in the booth there, not the head, it was just a little booth.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:51.000\nAnd it's very clearly Warren Beatty.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nAnd it's like, ugh.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nLike that's famous even for LA.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nCrazy famous.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nLike legendary icon.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nYou don't expect to see Warren.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\nYou expect to see Quentin Tarantino in a drive-thru\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nor something like the back of his head.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nThat's Quentin Tarantino.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nMaybe even Harrison Ford.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nLike, oh, look, he's jogging.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nYou just never expect to see Warren Beatty.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:21.000\nAnd I saw him and then...\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nI did what you're supposed to do.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nI ignored him and pretended he was a ghost\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nand like talked to John Hamm about, how's business?\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nWhere do you live now?\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nOh, that's a good neighborhood.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nAnd then we go over to the booth\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:38.000\nand we're like Cody and I are like, wow, that's pretty neat.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nThat's the real deal.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nThat's a big deal, like seeing Warren Beatty.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nHe didn't really meet him as such.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:46.000\nI was introduced to him, but this is Warren.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nSo I met Warren Beatty.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nTechnically.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:54.000\nAnd also, what more do you need?\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nFrom that exchange, I met Warren Beatty.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.000\nThat's peak Warren Beatty relationship, right?\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nI met him.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nI'm not saying there's not more fulfilling things\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nin store for you if you are his neighbor.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nI'm just being me.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nWhat am I going to do with a Warren Beatty friendship?\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nI'm like, this is it.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nI got to share it with somebody.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:14.000\nBut who do you share it with?\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:19.000\nI don't want to come off like a star fucker to my LA friends.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:23.000\nAnd the truth is, even Cody's a little young to understand\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:26.000\nwhat a big deal it is to see Warren Beatty in person.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:31.000\nDo I have an older friend who's from out of town?\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nNope.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nWait a minute.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nI think I said it out loud and Cody was like,\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\nwell, your dad's been pretty cool lately.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:45.000\nSo now I text my dad.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nBut it's not my dad.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nI'm texting Heath Cullen, the director of Great Minds,\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:54.000\nwho thinks he's my friend.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:59.000\nHe has good reason to think that I would just text him\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nthe following.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:04.000\nI just met Warren Beatty at a restaurant.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:07.000\nExclamation point.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nWhat?\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nWho are you?\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:14.000\n1930s Hollywood royalty?\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nIf I wasn't playing a dad,\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nI promise I would have come up with something better than that.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:21.000\nBut I was trying to stay in the voice.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:25.000\nParentheses, in my mind, he's 120 years old.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nThen I said, was it at Chick-fil-A?\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:31.000\nI heard he loves waffle fries.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nAnd then meanwhile, I'm trying to take a picture.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nLike I'm trying to do a selfie thing,\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nbecause he's in a booth behind us.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nI didn't want to be like, I just thought maybe,\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nyou never know if the camera's on top.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nMaybe if I do one of these,\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:46.000\nmaybe you'll see like the top of Warren Beatty's head\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nover me and Cody.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:51.000\nBut it ends up just being a nice selfie of me and Cody.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nAnd that's fine too.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nAnd I send it to my dad and I say,\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:58.000\nthis would have been my attempt at a periscope shot, Adam,\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nbut there's no way.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:02.000\nSo it's just us having met Warren Beatty.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nI'll tell you what, man,\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:07.000\nhe looks way older than you.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nBecause it's important to compliment your dad.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nAnd this is, I feel bad,\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nbut I'm trying to flatter my dad.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nI'm like, he looks like a mummy that went to a barber\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:23.000\nand said, make my hair look like Warren Beatty.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:31.000\nMaybe that's why you don't get to meet people.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:37.000\nI'm really excited that Dan is texting me these\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:40.000\non Saturday night, like, unsolicited, unannounced.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nSo I keep playing along.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:44.000\nSo he looks better than I expected.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nBut you see, you're not playing my dad at this point, right?\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nYou're just being Heath.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nYeah.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nYou think I know you're Heath.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nYes.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nYeah, okay, all right.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nI don't want to fuck up the bit.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nI thought you were still enjoying that.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nOkay, so you...\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nBut you knew it was me.\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nOkay, yeah, okay.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nI'm not going to not, yes, I do.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nSo you think I know that it's you.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nYes.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nAnd you think that even though I know it's you,\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nI'm still treating you like my dad.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nI thought you...\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nYeah.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nOkay.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nWe're entertained by it.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nAnd so you say...\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nAnd Cody being there also made me feel that way.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:15.000\nRight.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:19.000\nPlease don't fight, guys.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nSo then you say, no, it's your...\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nSo I say, so he looks better than I expected is what I ask.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nRight.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nAnd I say, here's the important takeaway.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:31.000\nYou are like three times sexier than Warren Beatty.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nThis is how...\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nDon't look at me.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:42.000\nThis is how cool a son I would be, by the way.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:48.000\nIf you just, like, look how low my bar is for a dad.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:51.000\nBefore I open the fucking floodgates.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nAnd I'm like your pal.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:57.000\nLike I'm giving you like inside Hollywood shit.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nI'm calling you sexier than Warren Beatty.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:04.000\nLike all you got to do is like congratulate me on an Emmy nomination.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:11.000\nAnd I will be your son every eight hours via text message.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:16.000\nAnd yeah, so I say you're three times sexier than Warren Beatty.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:21.000\nI say, boy, you two look like you have that post Beatty glow though.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nAre you both pregnant now?\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nHe's old but virile.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nThis is where it gets really sad to me.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:29.000\nThis is real.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nIt takes a turn.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:34.000\nBecause Cody and I are talking the whole time.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:37.000\nAnd the conversation isn't about Warren Beatty.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nIt's about my dad.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nI'm like, okay.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:45.000\nSo then I text, Cody says you and mom should come out to California\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:48.000\nand we could go to Death Valley with Cody's dad.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:52.000\nYou'd probably like it in the desert.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:58.000\nI want to let you all know that you are falling for the same shit.\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:00.000\nWhat are they falling for?\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nThey're, they're going like, oh, this is.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:08.000\nNo, there was a, there was a, oh, like, oh, he, daddy, oh.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nWe all got, we all got wrapped up in this shit.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:14.000\nIt's beautiful, but it's sad.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nBut it is beautiful.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nIt's, it's sad.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nAnd it's sad.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:25.000\nI mean, the beauty, the only, the beauty is only just go in.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nIt's a sad balloon.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nMaybe it's inflated by beauty.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:33.000\nLike we blow it up with beauty, but it's a, it's a balloon made of sadness.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:38.000\nYeah, we like to call it the old pistain clown.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nAll right.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:43.000\nSo I invite you and mom out to California and you say,\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:46.000\nI'm not sure we can handle the heat.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:49.000\nIt is a dry heat though.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:53.000\nSo now at this point, I'm thinking, am I correct in assuming that maybe you're\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nstarting to go, oh shit.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:58.000\nDoes he think I'm like, I want to put on it.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:04.000\nThe dad foad dadness of it enough that you're like, ha, ha, fuck you, whatever.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.000\nDry heat.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nOh, he's really going over the top with this dad character.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:11.000\nBut also at this point, and Emma, my wife can attest to this.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:15.000\nI'm like, oh, he's really like playing, we're like riffing.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:24.000\nAnd I didn't want to ruin it, but I was also just like, what do I say now?\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:31.000\nBut and here's the sad part from not this is much sadder, but the sad part from my\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:35.000\nside is like, I don't want Dan to think now I'm not funny.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:38.000\nLike that I can't keep it going.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nLike a dad would think.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:41.000\nYeah.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:42.000\nYou'd want to be cool to your kid.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:45.000\nOr also like a son would think to for his, it was.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nThat's right.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:47.000\nThis is the whole.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:48.000\nI'm telling you, it was dynamic.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nIt's dynamic.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nWhat an emptiness here.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nI'm just swooning.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:57.000\nI just, I go, it's so dry.\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:00.000\nI'm a bigger pussy about heat than you and I was fine.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nIt's incredibly quiet and free and you can do whatever you want.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nJust a thought.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nCody's dad loves the desert.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:08.000\nAnd so Cody kind of grew up going out there with him.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:09.000\nIt was like her Dells.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:21.000\nThat's a reference to the Wisconsin Dells where my family would go when I was a kid.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:26.000\nThe next bit require a little context with the brothel thing because.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nYeah.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nI mean, it does.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nBecause like, like Cody's dad.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:37.000\nSo I, so I know Cody, Cody, who you all, I'm assuming know since you watch the show\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:38.000\nand know who she is.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:41.000\nShe's a great writer, wrote a show that I worked on as well.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:44.000\nThat's how I met Dan through directing the show that she wrote.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:48.000\nOne of the things she told me, her dad is very cool, artistic.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:51.000\nAnd when she was a youth, they would go to the desert.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nYou've learned, heard about that so far.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:57.000\nBut there was a brothel that he went to with her and he was like friends with some of,\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:02.000\nI don't know what happened there, but they were friends and it would seem sweet.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:03.000\nAnd I was like, that's crazy.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nCody.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:05.000\nAnd then we would always joke about it.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:09.000\nAnd then Cody and her father recently went on a trip out there and the brothel has since\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\nclosed and he like collected a sign from the exterior of it.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:16.000\nAnd it was like sweet, but funny and, and just a cool little side story.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:23.000\nSo I text after he suggests we go out there, it's tempting.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nAnd you know how I feel about brothels.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nDoes Cody's dad still know a good spot?\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:33.000\nI know his favorite spot is closed, but maybe you, he and I could find a new one together.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nSo then I turned to Cody and go,\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:43.000\nDid you tell my dad about the brothels?\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:47.000\nAnd Cody goes, I don't know, I tell everybody.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:51.000\nSo, so on we go.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:55.000\nAnd so I go, I go, we could start one.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nI'm going to pitch it to Warren.\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:01.000\nOh, I bet he has some great thoughts on that.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nHe'll class up on that.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:06.000\nI'm going to pitch it to Warren.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:09.000\nOh, I bet he has some great thoughts on that.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:12.000\nHe'll class up the joint for sure.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:18.000\nAnd then, hey Dan, I'm really enjoying our father's son, Rep Arte.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:22.000\nI just want to make sure you remember this is actually he.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:36.000\nThe time stamp on this was 1052 p.m.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:40.000\nOn Saturday night, this started at like 830 p.m.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.000\nThat night.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:44.000\nAnd so, and so in my next text, I said 1110.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nSo that's 18 minutes later.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:49.000\nAnd I didn't get anything else done.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:54.000\nLike, I just read that and took 18 minutes to respond.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:57.000\nOh my God.\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:07.000\nSomebody just got dad fished.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:18.000\nI wish there was a way to cheer with a rotten tomato.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:22.000\nYou don't like my Steve Harvey line of jokes?\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:26.000\nThey come with a briefcase and a peacock.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:33.000\nYou deserve cheer booze for that.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nAnyways, oh my God.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:38.000\nAnd then, oh my God.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:42.000\nAnd then, I just finished explaining this to Cody.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nSo that's what the 18 minutes is.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:48.000\nThis is, wow.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:53.000\nThis is really so sad.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:56.000\nI kept showing messages to Cody and being like, this is so cool.\n\n30:56.000 --> 31:00.000\nI don't know when my dad got so cool.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nAnd Cody was like, I love your dad.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:05.000\nI told you he was cool.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, but he just seems different.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:10.000\nLike, he's funnier now.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nOh my God.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:21.000\nThe darkness of this makes it worth it.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:25.000\nI had 12 hours of the nicest, closest, most human relationship\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:29.000\nI've ever had with my dad.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nSo Cody says you have to come on Harmontowns\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nand we can explain this whole story and read these texts\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nand walk through it.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nYou do understand that I really thought you were my dad\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nthe entire time from all the way back to you\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\ncongratulating me on the Emmy nom.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:48.000\nI thought my dad was revealing he watched great minds.\n\n31:48.000 --> 32:01.000\nThat's about it.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nSo many people in the back crying right now.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nIt's okay.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:10.000\nWhat did you learn about this moment of love?\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:15.000\nThat it was fake?\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nI mean, is there a takeaway from that?\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nThere is.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nThere is.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:21.000\nThere is.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:22.000\nOkay.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:23.000\nThere is because it's clear.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nIt's like, oh my God, are we all?\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:26.000\nWell, forget we.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nI use my I statements.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:39.000\nI am literally one sentence texted away from like reaching out\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:42.000\nemotionally to my loved ones.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:50.000\nLike lowering my guard of being, you know, like it makes you\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:57.000\nwonder how many sentences are we away from just like the flood\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:00.000\ngates opening with people that don't have, we don't necessarily\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:03.000\nhave a 45 year back story with, but maybe the, you know,\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:07.000\nwhat if the postman said, or what if the postman said,\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nI'm a post lady?\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nWhat if the, what if the, what if the, what if the,\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:16.000\nwhat if your male person, you know, what sentence lies between\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:24.000\nyou and a friendship with your post deliverer, your aunts,\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:28.000\nyour uncles, your neighbors, your intimate others,\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:31.000\nlike how many of us are in relationships where maybe you're\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:35.000\nin a funk for six months and like what could one of you say\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nthat would like break the spell?\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:41.000\nIt's like, and it's, it doesn't even have to be, it's a text.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nYeah.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:45.000\nWhat's great is there were, excuse me for this,\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nbut you were super brave.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:50.000\nOnce somebody leaned out to you, reached out to you,\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nyou became a whole different motherfucker.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:53.000\nYou got super brave.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nYou started sharing, you did all these things.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:56.000\nBrave.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:59.000\nIs it, is it, is it, is it brave to fawn and be like,\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:02.000\nit's brave to reach out to somebody who might smack your\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nhands and remind you of why you don't.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nI don't think my dad to be clear.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:09.000\nI don't think my dad would, in case this is.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nYou're going to take this bravery.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:14.000\nBut I don't think, I mean, I think.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nPeople just why you don't meet nobody.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:19.000\nWith my family to be clear, and I think this is an important\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:27.000\npoint to make, like, you know, the, do you need a glad?\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:31.000\nCan somebody get a heath a glass?\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nSteve will probably get a cup.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:40.000\nThere's a coffee mug that says, world's greatest director.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:43.000\nYou were saying to be clear with your family, there is.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nIt's, it's, it's, it's, it's.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nSteve Levy, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:53.000\nAnd I think, I don't think there's a lot of, like, harm\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:56.000\nthat could come of a tentacle reaching out, you know, like,\n\n34:56.000 --> 35:00.000\nlike, it's, it's, it's not like.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:06.000\nThere's a, there's a wall between, that exists between\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nthat happening in real life between me and my dad that's\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nlike, doesn't make really any sense.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:15.000\nThat's why, as you can see, as soon as it was perforated,\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:18.000\nI never, and in spite of all of the signs that should have,\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:21.000\nif I, if I thought I was, like, such an expert on why I\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:24.000\ndon't, like, regularly text my dad, I love you, or something\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:29.000\nlike that, like, if, like, why don't I recognize, why can't\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nI tell him from a friend?\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:34.000\nThe answer is because, because I, because I like him.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:35.000\nRight.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:36.000\nLove him, whatever you call it.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:40.000\nBut, but, but, like, my family doesn't, you know, it's,\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:43.000\nlike, there's, there's a lot of, like, it's just, it's just,\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:46.000\nyou know, like, a lot of people can relate to this is,\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:49.000\nlike, there's families that are, like, they're, like, they're\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:53.000\nproactive about, like, you know, this is how I feel about you\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nand I love you and I'm proud of you or whatever.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:58.000\nAnd then there's families that are, like, you know, they throw\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:01.000\nshoes at each other and all this stuff and, like, and then\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:04.000\nthere's, you know, there's probably a good 70% of us,\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:07.000\nlike, somewhere in the middle where we're kind of, like,\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:12.000\nstrained and, like, you don't, I don't know.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:15.000\nYeah, but in this situation, when it was presented to you,\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:19.000\nyou made the choice to be fucking a bigger, better person\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nthan you might normally walk around as.\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:24.000\nThat's the only thing that I want to, I get in this argument\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nwith my therapist all the time, so maybe I'm doing this thing\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:29.000\nthat she yells at me about, which is, like, but I don't really\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:32.000\nthink I deserve any accolades for my behavior because I wasn't\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nreally risking anything.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:37.000\nIn my opinion, maybe you're seeing that differently.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:38.000\nThat's interesting.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:39.000\nI didn't think about it that way.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:42.000\nI was just, I think of myself as being the selfish one, too.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nLike, it's a two-way street.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:46.000\nMy not, you know, I don't, like, I could text my dad anytime\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nI wanted to go.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:50.000\nI do it once a year, maybe, like, Father's Day.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nSo should I give you the old challenge to say that you should\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:55.000\ntext your dad about the Emmy just to see what this conversation\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nwould really look like?\n\n36:57.000 --> 37:00.000\nText him, text my dad that I got.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:07.000\nI think he'd be more impressed with the Tesla, you know.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:08.000\nOkay.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:09.000\nEither one.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:10.000\nEither one.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:13.000\nAnd we also witnessed somebody fucking being super generous.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:14.000\nOh, you want me to do it now?\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.000\nYou do it right now!\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:24.000\nEverybody, get out your phones and call someone you love right now.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:29.000\nI'm also going to need a dollar on each one of those phone calls.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:30.000\nHi.\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nMy neighborhood's overrun by racism.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:35.000\nI just, I also want to say that we got to see somebody be so generous\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:39.000\nand just keep up a super loving act.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:44.000\nWhich is like, I don't know why this dude asked me to rub his back,\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nbut I'll rub his back.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:49.000\nIt's kind of the coolest fucking thing in the world.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:54.000\nI was waiting for Heath to look at his phone and notice that.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:55.000\nOh, Jesus.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:59.000\nI wanted to do the bit and he was like, no, you just did it again.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nOh, that's me.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nAll right, all right.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nOh, it didn't go through.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:06.000\nThere's no service here.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:09.000\nHeath, was anybody on your end watching as well?\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nMy wife.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:11.000\nOkay.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:12.000\nDid she give you tips at all?\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.000\nWhat was that?\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:14.000\nDid she give you tips at all?\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:15.000\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:16.000\nShe's funnier than I am.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nI run them by.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nI run a lot of them by.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:22.000\nNo, she was the one that finally was like,\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:30.000\nare you sure that he doesn't think that you're his dad right now?\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:33.000\nAnd I really didn't want to believe that was true.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:36.000\nBut then, I just wanted to think that he and Cody were shooting the shit\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:39.000\nand getting drunk and were like, we should text Heath a joke.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:40.000\nThat'd be fun.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:43.000\nIt's like, I'm only doing this to, yes, and the suggestion.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nI think it's kind of a douchey thing to text your dad\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nthat you got nominated for an Emmy.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.000\nI find that to be not like.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:51.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nLast week you said, I'm happy.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:54.000\nRight.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:55.000\nRight.\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:56.000\nSo like there's steps to being happy.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:57.000\nRight.\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nAnd one of the fucking steps is to celebrate the good shit.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nBy bragging to your dad.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nYour dad, it's not bragging when it's to your parents.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:06.000\nThey're proud of you for fucking wiping your own ass one day.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:07.000\nThey're like, I did that.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nI won that Emmy.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:14.000\nI'm like, I made that.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:15.000\nYeah.\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:19.000\nI mean, I want to say that's not how my family works.\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:20.000\nI believe it.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nBut then you'd say, oh, this is the problem.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:23.000\nIs you thinking that?\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nI'm not going to judge you.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nYou can do whatever you want to do.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:29.000\nI mean, don't you think it would be better to say like, how's your boat?\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:30.000\nGo get that shit.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:31.000\nLike to ask him something.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nGo get that thing you wanted.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nI don't want nothing.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:36.000\nI don't want nothing.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:37.000\nYeah, you do.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:38.000\nGo get that thing you wanted.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:42.000\nOkay, I got busted kind of wanting something during this story, didn't I?\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nSo that's the key.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:50.000\nIf you're 45 years old and your weekend can be eclipsed and derailed by an accidental\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:57.000\nradar ping that makes you think your dad loves you for a second, then you don't have a right\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:01.000\nto be like, I don't need nothing from nobody.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:05.000\nYou should reach out to your dad.\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:10.000\nAnd since you're clearly still in childhood with that relationship, you may as well say,\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:13.000\nI made a poopoo in the Emmy potty.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:14.000\nOkay.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:15.000\nAll right.\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:18.000\nNow I see the logic of it.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:19.000\nOkay.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:23.000\nMy show got nominated for an Emmy exclamation point.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:32.000\nI mean, it's by the way, it's midnight in Florida, so he'll love that.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:37.000\nBecause he's been asleep for six hours, so he's probably getting ready to get up.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:38.000\nLeave a voicemail.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:40.000\nLeave a voicemail.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nIt's also not going to, what's that?\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:43.000\nLeave a voicemail.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:44.000\nNo, come on.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:45.000\nStop it.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:46.000\nNo.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nThat's a deal breaker.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:54.000\nNo, I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure 40% of my divorce with McGathey was like my inability\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:55.000\nto FaceTime.\n\n40:55.000 --> 41:00.000\nLike, come on.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:04.000\nI'm allowed to be part of society because of the invention of text messaging.\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:07.000\nLike, I don't do the phone.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:08.000\nOkay.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:12.000\nSo, yeah, I sent it and there you go.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:13.000\nIt went through.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:14.000\nYeah.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:21.000\nBut I'm telling you, I'm telling you, like, it's, come on.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:25.000\nIt's, I'm already the obnoxious Hollywood son.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:30.000\nLike, I really don't think, I think he's going to be like, he'll make a joke.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:33.000\nHe'll say like, ah, don't get AIDS from it or something.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nI don't know.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nNow I can capture his voice.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nNow I'm ready.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nNext round when you forget again.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nI really got his voice now.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:46.000\nIt's AIDS jokes, that's all right.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:50.000\nThat's the rock I needed to overturn.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:54.000\nWhen you make jokes around your family, do they still laugh or do they roll their eyes\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:55.000\nand laugh?\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:03.000\nI don't think, I don't know if I get, my family, my family, my mom and dad, like, if they're\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:07.000\nlaughing, like, we'll laugh together at something.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nLike, if, you know, something funny happens.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:12.000\nLike, I'm not, like, making anybody laugh.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\nDo you point it out, though, first or is that in the jeep?\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:15.000\nPoint out what?\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:16.000\nLike, whatever happened.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:19.000\nIf somebody fell in front of you guys, who's going to fire first?\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nIt's kind of like my dad.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:24.000\nI think my dad's kind of in charge of when everyone starts laughing.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:28.000\nBecause, like, he's not, you know, like, he's not on board.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nEverything's going to just, like, sink anyway, you know?\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:35.000\nLike, you could do all the jokes you wanted, but then, you know, like, it's funny.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:39.000\nIt's more fun if my dad's, like, in the picture.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:44.000\nYou feel like that dude sort of has to bring you on stage a little bit because it's his\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:45.000\nhouse?\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:46.000\nMy dad was super funny, too.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:47.000\nThat's why I asked.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:51.000\nI was like, you know, you have the first clown you see as your dad, really.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:54.000\nHe takes these big risks in front of you and you're like, all right, let's see.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:55.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:59.000\nAnd there's this thing about puberty where you're like, I hope I'm as witty as that individual.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.000\nI want to smack him.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:03.000\nWith my father, it was fake cursing from Johnny dangerously.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nSo I'd be at the table and I'd be like, you Fargan Eisberg?\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:10.000\nOr I'd give him this finger and he'd be like, okay.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:15.000\nOkay, Brandon, very funny.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:19.000\nI felt like when I hit puberty, like, when you said those glands start overacting, like,\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nyeah, I look back with kind of shame on that.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:25.000\nI was like bouncing off the walls and, like, trying to be funny.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.000\nAnd I don't think my dad was probably very incredibly entertained by it.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nI think he was sort of confused.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nYou know, it was like, like, bemused.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nLike, he'd be like, what the f...\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:35.000\nAll right.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:39.000\nBut then you killed him because we all know when you're a professional, there is a moment\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:42.000\nwhere you've made your family laugh in a way that you didn't before.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:43.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:47.000\nLike, you use all the shit you've learned sort of to come home and be like, this is fucking funny.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:48.000\nYou can't debate that.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:53.000\nSo do you remember the moment when you said something funny to your father and you were\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:57.000\nlike, I got you, old motherfucker?\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:58.000\nNo.\n\n43:58.000 --> 43:59.000\nNo.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:00.000\nNo.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:01.000\nI used to...\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nWhen I was a real little kid, I would do like little shows.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nRight.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:05.000\nAnd I would like...\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nBecause I just like the...\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nYou know, like everyone...\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:12.000\nYou'd force people to gather around and you would do...\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:17.000\nI would do like magic tricks and like Carson bits that I didn't understand.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:22.000\nAnd it was like, yeah, I wanted the attention and I wanted to be funny, but...\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:27.000\nAnd yeah, I didn't understand what humor was.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nYou know, my dad was the funny one.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nMy dad was the one that made everybody laugh.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nLike he would...\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:38.000\nMy dad would read towards the night before Christmas.\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:41.000\nAnd then he'd do like commentary on it.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:44.000\nLike he'd be like...\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:50.000\nAnd then I'd put his finger on his nose and it would shot up the chimney.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nI don't know how he got up the goddamn chimney.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nHe's so fat, you know?\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:55.000\nSuddenly he'd just make comments.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:58.000\nI'm making him sound a little lammer than he is.\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nBut it would be like little comments.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:04.000\nAnd then I remember being like at a certain age, like that puberty age.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nLike I remember like, now I want to do it.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\nI want to do it.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:11.000\nLike after my dad just killed and it was like we could have moved on to have hot cocoa\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:12.000\nand fucking put in a happy family.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nBut I was like, now me, now me.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:18.000\nAnd like 11, you know, like a fucking adult basically.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:21.000\nI'm like as big as a golden retriever.\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:25.000\nLike hard to hit with a whip, you know?\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:28.000\nAnd then I'm like, everybody.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nAnd then I kind of made everybody like, now me.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nAnd I like went through it and made my own comments.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:35.000\nLike, oh boy, how do you get his fat butt up the chimney?\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:38.000\nAnd I remember just thinking of my dad being like, what?\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nHe's just my bits.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:44.000\nLike I remember him like, I remember him calling it out and being like,\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:45.000\nyou're just doing that.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.000\nI already did that bit.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:50.000\nHe didn't call it a bit, but he was like, man, I just did that.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\nYeah.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:55.000\nI was kind of associated comedy with like a thing that I wished I could do.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nI never really saw myself as a...\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nOther people would be laughing.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:02.000\nLike when I went to school, like then after a certain point,\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nthen people are like, you're so funny.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nAnd I'd be like, oh shit, fuck.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nClassroom or cafeteria?\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:09.000\nPlayground?\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:10.000\nWhat was your stage?\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:14.000\nWell, starting with just like, like two nerds in the back of the room\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nbecause I was a nerd.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nSo I wasn't going to make anybody laugh.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:22.000\nLike I was like, just right in the back corner and the English class\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:26.000\nlike mutter under my breath and be like, man, this is stupid.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:30.000\nAnd then like the kid next to me who was also a nerd and crammed back there\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nand be like, that was funny.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:39.000\nAnd then that kid started a comedy sports team at my high school.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:44.000\nAnd then I got into like drama and improv and forensics and all that stuff\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:49.000\nand got a little more training in like, yeah, just honestly,\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:53.000\njust hit the back wall with your voice and just keep talking\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\neven if you don't have anything to say.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:56.000\nAnd just kind of exercise it.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:59.000\nAnd then we would do stuff and then the school would come\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:04.000\nand then strangers like in the school were like, oh, you're funny.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nYou should be on Saturday Night Live.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nAnd I'd be like, you didn't know what you're talking about.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:09.000\nYou're dumb.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:12.000\nBut this feels like power to me.\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:13.000\nSo I'll take it.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nYeah.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:20.000\nAnd yeah, that's the story of becoming funny.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:23.000\nBut never, never, my dad never was like, this guy's hilarious.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:24.000\nYeah.\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:25.000\nYeah.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.000\nAnd I think that might be important, right?\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:27.000\nLike the same with your dad.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:31.000\nYou're kind of like, he was like a heckler almost like or like an unbeatable like.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:35.000\nYou know, it is, I think so your dad's side of the family is funny.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:36.000\nI take it.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:49.000\nFunny year than my mom's side at the risk of offending a bunch of very unfunny people.\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:53.000\nI've talked about my great-grandma Boucher who's now who's now passed.\n\n47:53.000 --> 48:02.000\nI mean, she was funny in the sense that she was a probably a murderer and and also like\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:05.000\nseveral people attempted to murder her and she survived.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nThat's funny because she was really old.\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:10.000\nLike when she got her throat slashed and she walked to the hospital with a towel wrapped\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\naround her neck.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nI mean, funny, like weird.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:14.000\nYeah.\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:17.000\nBut no, not a lot of humorists on that side.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:18.000\nYeah.\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:21.000\nSo when you met with, when you would hang out with like, do you ever hang out with your\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:22.000\nuncles on your dad's side?\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:27.000\nWhen those guys got around, there is a potential joke circle because he's got the funny gene,\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:28.000\nright?\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:29.000\nAm I right about that?\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:32.000\nWere his brothers just like little, we're not funny.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:33.000\nHe's funny.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:39.000\nMy dad's sister, half sister, you know, she's very jocular, very funny, like, like very\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:40.000\noutgoing.\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:41.000\nWhat's your bit?\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:42.000\nYou got a bit?\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:43.000\nWhat's that?\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:44.000\nDo you know a bit?\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:45.000\nShe does?\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:50.000\nNo, I just mean, you know, gregarious, like, like just, just having fun, you know, like,\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:55.000\nlike, like at the party, like, like, like if something, if there's something fun to happen,\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:59.400\nlike, you know, yes, ending it and being fun and going with the flow about the funny stuff\n\n48:59.400 --> 49:04.000\nand not being like a passive aggressive kind of like threshold guardian about crazy craziness\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:07.400\njust like moving with it and being like, that's funny.\n\n49:07.400 --> 49:09.400\nLike she's not going to turn the room down.\n\n49:09.400 --> 49:10.400\nShe's going to keep it going.\n\n49:10.400 --> 49:11.400\nRight.\n\n49:11.400 --> 49:15.800\nI just wonder, because when you, you know, to answer your question about your dad is\n\n49:15.800 --> 49:20.400\nif he comes from funny people too, it's even more daunting when you're in a family situation\n\n49:20.400 --> 49:22.160\nto chip at the throne.\n\n49:22.160 --> 49:26.200\nSo like, thanksgivings and Christmases, you're trying to get in there and sort of do your\n\n49:26.200 --> 49:27.200\nmaterial.\n\n49:27.200 --> 49:31.200\nBut you also have this dude who is now surrounded by his team.\n\n49:31.200 --> 49:35.760\nWas that anything, you know, now, I think, I think, I think with my dad at the risk of\n\n49:35.760 --> 49:40.120\ntalking out of school or whatever, like, because I don't really know that much about the family\n\n49:40.120 --> 49:41.720\ntree as it goes back beyond that.\n\n49:41.720 --> 49:47.360\nBut I get the impression that my dad and his siblings, like, they all have one thing in\n\n49:47.360 --> 49:48.360\ncommon.\n\n49:48.360 --> 49:49.760\nLike some of them are crazier than others.\n\n49:49.760 --> 49:54.000\nSome of them are like more fun than others or whatever, but all of them are kind of like,\n\n49:54.000 --> 50:00.960\nI think there was a lot of trauma and anxiety, and I think they all dealt with it by like\n\n50:00.960 --> 50:09.160\nreally chesting up and like being like either incredibly cynical or incredibly like gregarious\n\n50:09.160 --> 50:14.320\nand in any case, like, not going gentle into that good night and just being like more kind\n\n50:14.320 --> 50:21.000\nof like, like, is that all you got, God, like, fuck it, like, I think that's funny then kind\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:22.000\nof thing.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:26.000\nLike, I don't think there was anybody hilarious over them.\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:33.080\nI think quite the opposite, I get the impression that there was like bad people going up that\n\n50:33.080 --> 50:37.480\nchain and that that's why they're like kind of like, you know, I can take a punch kind\n\n50:37.480 --> 50:38.480\nof funny.\n\n50:38.480 --> 50:39.480\nYeah.\n\n50:39.480 --> 50:40.480\nLiterally.\n\n50:40.480 --> 50:44.800\nWhat about you, Heath?\n\n50:44.800 --> 50:45.800\nWhat about me, Dan?\n\n50:45.800 --> 50:49.120\nHeath, who are you and your family, where do you fall in terms of funny?\n\n50:49.120 --> 50:51.000\nWhen did you become filled with toffee?\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:56.560\nWell, Dan, never, never heard that before.\n\n50:56.560 --> 50:57.560\nNever.\n\n50:57.560 --> 50:58.560\nYou never.\n\n50:58.560 --> 50:59.560\nCandy bar.\n\n50:59.560 --> 51:00.560\nI don't have an answer about that.\n\n51:00.560 --> 51:01.560\nI mean, candy bar comments.\n\n51:01.560 --> 51:03.360\nIt's the first time ever to hear that.\n\n51:03.360 --> 51:04.880\nAre you siblings?\n\n51:04.880 --> 51:11.320\nUh, two older, I'm nine years older than my brother, 11 years, I mean, nine years younger\n\n51:11.320 --> 51:13.960\nthan my brother, 11 years younger than my sister.\n\n51:13.960 --> 51:19.360\nUh, definitely the funniest one in the family, but that was not saying much.\n\n51:19.360 --> 51:20.520\nCan you fuck them up at will?\n\n51:20.520 --> 51:21.520\nYeah.\n\n51:21.520 --> 51:22.520\nYeah.\n\n51:22.520 --> 51:23.520\nYeah.\n\n51:23.520 --> 51:24.520\nYeah.\n\n51:24.520 --> 51:25.520\nYou're certainly the funniest one in my family.\n\n51:25.520 --> 51:26.520\nYeah.\n\n51:26.520 --> 51:27.520\nI am.\n\n51:27.520 --> 51:28.520\nI am.\n\n51:28.520 --> 51:39.040\nUm, so my dad's funny, but it's like, nah, it's sarcasm, like mean, like, um, my brother\n\n51:39.040 --> 51:43.000\nand sister were two years apart, so they would fight a lot, like, you know, four-year-old\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:47.240\nand six-year-old or three-year-old and five-year-old fight, like that kind of bullshit.\n\n51:47.240 --> 51:52.720\nAnd um, there was a Siberian husky dog, I was yet to be born, and my sister was calling\n\n51:52.720 --> 51:55.760\nmy brother a butthole, and my dad was like, that is not a thing.\n\n51:55.760 --> 51:56.760\nYou don't use that word.\n\n51:56.760 --> 51:57.760\nDon't use that word.\n\n51:57.760 --> 52:01.680\nAnd he finally picked up the dog ass end and like lifted its tail up and was like, that's\n\n52:01.680 --> 52:02.680\nwhat you're calling your brother.\n\n52:02.680 --> 52:03.680\nIs that a nice thing?\n\n52:03.680 --> 52:05.760\nThat's a real pretty thing, isn't it?\n\n52:05.760 --> 52:08.960\nUm, and that, that, that put an end to all of it.\n\n52:08.960 --> 52:10.360\nThat put all into the buttholes.\n\n52:10.360 --> 52:13.800\nAll you needed to do is see a real, pretty asshole.\n\n52:13.800 --> 52:18.080\nYeah, uh, that's real pretty, isn't it?\n\n52:18.080 --> 52:19.680\nThat's real pretty, isn't it?\n\n52:19.680 --> 52:25.840\nIt would be like that kind of, um, I do have one, I do have a second.\n\n52:25.840 --> 52:29.680\nWhat was the thing about the hose, I remember something about the hose and mud or something\n\n52:29.680 --> 52:30.680\nlike that.\n\n52:30.680 --> 52:33.920\nNo, no, no, it was dog shit and, and, and throwing it, oh, so this was the story I was\n\n52:33.920 --> 52:42.400\ngoing to, yeah, so, so now we, I'm now born, seven, nine, I don't know, uh, and we have\n\n52:42.400 --> 52:47.280\na dog and, uh, I had to clean up his shit was the job that I had to like scoop it, put\n\n52:47.280 --> 52:51.600\nit in a bucket and then throw it in the trash and we had a fence in the backyard and I figured\n\n52:51.600 --> 52:55.920\nout like a lot faster to just throw it right over the fence and to just a field, it was\n\n52:55.920 --> 52:58.200\njust a field, it wasn't someone else's yard.\n\n52:58.200 --> 53:04.160\nSo my dad's over in one part of the yard, gardening, and, uh, I'm scooping the shit\n\n53:04.160 --> 53:08.600\nand I'm like, I'm just chucking it, chucking it, like hard white, hard, hard, like, oh,\n\n53:08.600 --> 53:10.280\nthat's white and chalky, gonna fly.\n\n53:10.280 --> 53:16.840\nSo dark, like fine, and then I get to one that's fresh and not solid and doesn't have\n\n53:16.840 --> 53:18.440\nthe density to clear the fence.\n\n53:18.440 --> 53:28.440\nAnd so it just like, across the fence and I froze and my dad's like on the, on his knees\n\n53:28.440 --> 53:45.800\nlike with a trowel and I see him freeze, oh, that's great.\n\n53:45.800 --> 53:46.800\nThat's great.\n\n53:46.800 --> 53:47.800\nThat's a work of art.\n\n53:47.800 --> 53:53.080\nI don't know why I'm so glad you didn't do it the way I told you to do it.\n\n53:53.080 --> 53:54.080\nThat is it.\n\n53:54.080 --> 54:00.800\nThat is it God, honey, honey, get a marker, we got a Picasso and just like fucking paraded\n\n54:00.800 --> 54:08.400\nmy eight year old self with this just blistering, like it would have hurt less if it were an\n\n54:08.400 --> 54:11.440\nactual pull a switch kind of thing.\n\n54:11.440 --> 54:14.200\nIt was an emotional switch.\n\n54:14.200 --> 54:20.920\nYou guys have any real early memories of straight up eating cat shit out of a cat litter box?\n\n54:20.920 --> 54:25.680\nI swear to God, I remember, I have this like the biggest memory of being like under the\n\n54:25.680 --> 54:33.040\nstairs playing and what I thought was like another sandbox with like a brown car and\n\n54:33.040 --> 54:41.800\nlike and the reason I remember it was like someone, either my brother or somebody coming\n\n54:41.800 --> 54:50.720\nup like, what the fuck are you doing and like I'm playing in the sandbar probably smoking\n\n54:50.720 --> 54:58.920\nit like a cigar and like everyone like the family meeting, like I don't remember like\n\n54:58.920 --> 55:03.320\nanybody grabbing me and going, come on, it was just more like everyone get over here\n\n55:03.320 --> 55:04.320\nand watch Danny shit.\n\n55:04.320 --> 55:07.840\nBecause it was probably time to argue about whose fault it was that this happened, you\n\n55:07.840 --> 55:15.560\nknow, like who's supposed to be watching Daniel, he is in the fucking cat shit eating it.\n\n55:15.560 --> 55:21.480\nThat's not where shit eating came in, Pickle Rick, is it?\n\n55:21.480 --> 55:27.080\nIs that like, was that like a memory that found its way?\n\n55:27.080 --> 55:31.280\nBecause isn't that what the psychiatrist, it's family therapy and shit eating?\n\n55:31.280 --> 55:37.800\nOh, okay, I mean, I don't know, I mean, I ate shit once when I was a kid.\n\n55:37.800 --> 55:47.800\nDid you, did you, did you have a cat?\n\n55:47.800 --> 55:48.800\nThree.\n\n55:48.800 --> 55:54.600\nSpencer, did you ever eat cat turds?\n\n55:54.600 --> 56:01.120\nI feel like, I don't know, I feel like that like someone of the kids, like my parents\n\n56:01.120 --> 56:06.320\ntold stories about that and I don't know, I remember being in a bathtub and my brother\n\n56:06.320 --> 56:11.440\npissing into my mouth.\n\n56:11.440 --> 56:15.240\nNot really consensually, but, yeah.\n\n56:15.240 --> 56:21.320\nPlease join us on this very special family episode of Hotter Town Jesus, Jesus.\n\n56:21.320 --> 56:30.160\nWas it, was it, was it like, was it, were you going, stop, don't, or was he like, were\n\n56:30.160 --> 56:31.360\nyou so young that he was like, open your mouth.\n\n56:31.360 --> 56:36.280\nI was going, stop, don't because I was taking a bath and I did not want the bathtub to be\n\n56:36.280 --> 56:38.640\nurinated in.\n\n56:38.640 --> 56:42.480\nI wasn't even thinking that it might go into my mouth.\n\n56:42.480 --> 56:50.400\nI just already saw that trouble was a Bruin, but, yeah, no, he pissed in my mouth and I\n\n56:50.400 --> 56:55.800\njust, I remember and I can't not remember, but my parents told me because it's the funniest\n\n56:55.800 --> 57:02.440\nthing to them and yeah, it's probably funny, but like, I was like, it's, it's warm and\n\n57:02.440 --> 57:10.040\nit's sour and it's real bitter, just like, just live commentating the experience.\n\n57:10.040 --> 57:13.280\nLike I stopped screaming to, to commentate.\n\n57:13.280 --> 57:17.120\nI, I demand a boycott.\n\n57:17.120 --> 57:19.640\nThat happened.\n\n57:19.640 --> 57:25.280\nHashtag peeing in my mouth is over party.\n\n57:25.280 --> 57:26.920\nWas there any sort of payback?\n\n57:26.920 --> 57:30.320\nNo, I was a good person.\n\n57:30.320 --> 57:35.440\nI didn't pee in things that, you know, would cause problems for people.\n\n57:35.440 --> 57:37.680\nIt was great.\n\n57:37.680 --> 57:45.520\nI cut the tail off of one of my, like a rubber whale toy that my brother turned out to have\n\n57:45.520 --> 57:50.400\na lot of affection for, I remember that, but I think it's because, and I think I was just\n\n57:50.400 --> 57:55.520\na kid, I was so young that I was just like playing with scissors and was, I didn't understand\n\n57:55.520 --> 57:56.520\npermanence or anything.\n\n57:56.520 --> 57:57.520\nRight.\n\n57:57.520 --> 58:03.320\nLike this rubber thing and then my, but I remember my brother like revealing how valuable\n\n58:03.320 --> 58:10.320\nthat rubber whale was and I, and I remember thinking like, fuck you, a rubber whale.\n\n58:10.320 --> 58:11.840\nThat's like your thing.\n\n58:11.840 --> 58:12.840\nLike this is your thing.\n\n58:12.840 --> 58:14.840\nSpider-Man's your thing, motherfucker.\n\n58:14.840 --> 58:20.200\nI know because I cut his head off.\n\n58:20.200 --> 58:24.280\nBut I had to, yeah, it had to be hard to have a little brother like, you know, I'm sure\n\n58:24.280 --> 58:25.280\nit can't be.\n\n58:25.280 --> 58:26.280\nIt's not easy.\n\n58:26.280 --> 58:28.320\nYou know, like siblings don't have to fight and stuff.\n\n58:28.320 --> 58:35.440\nLike Cody's sister, she's got two kids and like, I've been listening to these books about\n\n58:35.440 --> 58:40.840\noptimism and happiness and how, like, because, you know, my therapist told me, okay, so you're\n\n58:40.840 --> 58:43.120\nhappy now, maybe.\n\n58:43.120 --> 58:46.080\nSo maybe are you going to drink yourself to death or are you going to be actually, you\n\n58:46.080 --> 58:47.080\nare going to have a good life?\n\n58:47.080 --> 58:52.560\nAnd part of it is like, I don't, there's a, and I think this is endemic to our society,\n\n58:52.560 --> 58:57.680\nwhich is kind of a nice thing about us, but we think happiness is like, well, there's\n\n58:57.680 --> 59:01.920\ngot to be, you know, we're cynical about it, which, you know, is not to say that, oh, everyone\n\n59:01.920 --> 59:06.840\nshould be happy, but it's like we have an attitude about happiness where we're like,\n\n59:06.840 --> 59:14.800\nif it's, if something seems happy, then you got to, it's more real to get to the unhappiness\n\n59:14.800 --> 59:21.960\nunderneath it, like the, we just sort of, it's sort of built into us to think that tragedy\n\n59:21.960 --> 59:28.120\nis reality because, makes sense, life ends in death and then comedy is fake, happiness\n\n59:28.120 --> 59:29.840\nis fake.\n\n59:29.840 --> 59:33.480\nThis is a popular opinion now among our little Nazi friends.\n\n59:33.480 --> 59:38.560\nThey have this virtue signaling like phrase that they use if you're trying to help somebody\n\n59:38.560 --> 59:43.600\nout or just say a nice thing or a supportive thing or an anti-fascist thing.\n\n59:43.600 --> 59:49.720\nIt's like, oh, you're virtue signaling because the idea is if you're positive about something,\n\n59:49.720 --> 59:55.000\nif you're hopeful or optimistic or called to action, then you're, there's a fake reason\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:56.000\nfor it.\n\n59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.760\nWe even like mythologize our cultures like artists and pioneers.\n\n01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:09.200\nWe say things like, oh, so and so invented this and that, and then their biography will\n\n01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:15.280\ncome out and it'll say, which means he must've really wanted his father's approval.\n\n01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:21.640\nWe love getting to the bottom of the stuff and making it more gritty and dirty and real.\n\n01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.120\nOtherwise, we don't believe it's real.\n\n01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:30.600\nAnd so, you sign a deal to do 70 episodes of your favorite show, if you've been waiting\n\n01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.640\nfor a really long time to have job security, there's like a little bit of an obstacle\n\n01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.800\nyou hit there where you're like, okay, so I have everything I've ever wanted, okay,\n\n01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.520\nso now I'm hitting like a vapor lock here, I'm like, well, then what's wrong?\n\n01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.640\nWell, Nazis are taking over America, that helps.\n\n01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:55.000\nThis is fitting, this makes sense to me, like God would do this to me, or I can always just\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.400\nfind a lump in my, you know, wherever, like that'll happen or, you know, we can't control\n\n01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400\nthat.\n\n01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.360\nYou start dwelling on that stuff, you're like, I swear every time my agents or lawyers\n\n01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.760\nare on the phone now, I used to get excited and now I'm like, oh God, wow.\n\n01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:13.600\nOkay, here it is, here it is, here I'm going to find out that I hit a baby with my car\n\n01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.560\nor something, like I don't know about it, they found it in the bumper.\n\n01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:23.440\nI wish I had reps that cared that much.\n\n01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.400\nOr they're just going to be like, oh, we're going over this contract that we're still\n\n01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.400\nworking on for Rick and Morty.\n\n01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:34.480\nDid you know that the guy that you were talking to on the phone the whole time escaped from\n\n01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.480\nan asylum?\n\n01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.000\nLike, just some shoo will drop.\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nIt was just me.\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nIt was just me.\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nIt was just me.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.120\nDid you have Heath in your phone as Mike Lasso, Cartoon Network?\n\n01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.680\nIt's going to be a sweet contract, don't worry.\n\n01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.640\nBut there's an, I'm reading this book, like, I'll be with this guy, I don't know if I,\n\n01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.640\nyou know.\n\n01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.960\nIt's true that if I remove the threat, not I, if you remove the threat, people will\n\n01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.600\nfind another threat because it's part of our wiring.\n\n01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.720\nI should give some credit where it's due in case anybody wanted to, you know, it's like\n\n01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720\na short book.\n\n01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:11.960\nAnd there's this thing called Authentic Happiness, who's it by, this guy, Seligman, Martin Seligman.\n\n01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.760\nHe's like a guy that was like, it's like, like, like, there was a, there was a turning\n\n01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:20.040\npoint in the psychology industry where I think it was this guy, Seligman, I think, or, or\n\n01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.160\nmaybe there's some other guy, but who cares.\n\n01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:29.360\nThere was some guy that was like sort of like famous for standing up at a big seminar for\n\n01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.200\nall the shrinks in the world.\n\n01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:37.240\nLike they would always have their big organizations and this guy got up one year and said, look,\n\n01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.640\nwe've gotten really good at diagnosing mental illness.\n\n01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.680\nWe've gotten really good at, we're doing great business, like, the world is crazier than\n\n01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680\never.\n\n01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680\nYeah.\n\n01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:54.240\nIt doesn't mean we're fucking up, like, like our, if we all bought into the myth that, that,\n\n01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.400\nthat happiness is impossible, like, are we also fucking miserable?\n\n01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.520\nAnd I was like, are we not supposed to be making people happy?\n\n01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.520\nWe have cured nothing.\n\n01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.520\nYeah.\n\n01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.520\nAnd we've, we're not doing anything.\n\n01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.400\nLike if we were real, if we, if, if, if, if being sad was a broken arm, we would be\n\n01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.200\nthe worst medical industry in the history of culture.\n\n01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.200\nAnd people are like, boo, you suck.\n\n01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.320\nAnd he's like, see, that just missed my point.\n\n01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320\nNo.\n\n01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.920\nI don't think anything that interesting ever happens in a psychology seminar, but, but,\n\n01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.400\nbut he kind of, he made waves, you know, and I'm sure by waves, I mean, like a bunch\n\n01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:31.160\nof people tenting their fingers and percing their lips and like writing, scribbling marks\n\n01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.440\ndown hoping that he'll get insecure.\n\n01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.600\nBut he was, he was, he was, he, he then that sparked this kind of wave of psychotherapy\n\n01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.160\nthat was like, what if our, what if our goal was happiness?\n\n01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.720\nWhat if we just experimented with that?\n\n01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.800\nAnd I think that's where cognitive behavioral therapy comes in and stuff like, is this working\n\n01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.800\nfor you?\n\n01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.120\nIf not, you know, changing all that crap.\n\n01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.120\nIt's interesting.\n\n01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:58.280\nAnd I already like took some weight off my shoulders where they get, there's like, like,\n\n01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:05.960\nlike the idea of like, like, you know, like, like happiness is a, yeah, it's a privilege.\n\n01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.120\nIt's like a good thing that you have it.\n\n01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:15.120\nBut like, if you have more of it than your immediate surroundings, you, it's not necessarily\n\n01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.840\nbecause something unfair is happening.\n\n01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:23.280\nIt's you're lucky, but you're not necessarily, it's not necessarily because you're rich,\n\n01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.320\nfor instance, because it's just all this science that goes into it, like, like, like, like,\n\n01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.200\noh, who's happier rich people or poor people?\n\n01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.440\nIt's like, yeah, they're, they, they even have who, then there's like these weird kind\n\n01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.960\nof differences, like as much as I'm sure scientists didn't want this data to come in\n\n01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.960\nthis way.\n\n01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.360\nThe truth is people that have a religion, they, they're, they're a little happier.\n\n01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.720\nThey live a little longer, I think, and they, they're a little happier data.\n\n01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.720\nYou collect it.\n\n01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:57.760\nThere's not enough of a difference that we should all run out and join a cult.\n\n01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.560\nThere's like, there's like strange, what you'd think is almost arbitrary, like, things.\n\n01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:06.320\nAnd then there's all these other factors that you would assume are like, oh, well, that\n\n01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320\nwould affect your happiness.\n\n01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.600\nAnd it's like, no, that's, that's nothing.\n\n01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600\nThat's negligible.\n\n01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:16.040\nAnd then there's, but I just like hearing it broken down to numbers because it demystifies\n\n01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.040\nit.\n\n01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040\nLike, I have this religious fear of being happy.\n\n01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:24.760\nI really think that if I'm over 50% happy, and I took this, I took this online thing,\n\n01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.760\nI got my happiness index is 3.12.\n\n01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.240\nDonald McDonald's survey.\n\n01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.880\nWho was the, what was, who did this survey?\n\n01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.880\nDo you know?\n\n01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.680\nIt's like something on the site that goes with this book.\n\n01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.840\nIt's like, they kind of, you can go there and you can like, you just fill in a couple\n\n01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840\nof questions in there.\n\n01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:47.560\nThey're kind of taking your data because they want like more data from, but it's like between\n\n01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.840\nzero and five, I'm like 3.12.\n\n01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.920\nIt's like all the bar, it's like, oh, uh, how much happier are you than people that are\n\n01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920\nyour age?\n\n01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:59.320\nIt's a 50% people in your income, 50% people, your gender, 50.\n\n01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.960\nI'm like right in the middle.\n\n01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960\nNow, okay.\n\n01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.960\nIt's the three I was going to ask you is the three on the good leading side or the bad\n\n01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960\nleading side?\n\n01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960\nI assume the good.\n\n01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960\nYeah.\n\n01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.960\nOkay.\n\n01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.960\nYeah.\n\n01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960\nYeah.\n\n01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960\nI don't think it's star meter.\n\n01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960\nI don't think it's like, it's all.\n\n01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.800\nYeah, but it's like, it is fascinating because we're trying to figure out how much of it\n\n01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.560\nwe should actually have in order to keep going.\n\n01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.320\nSo I think people study their happiness and depression because they really want to relate.\n\n01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.560\nHow much can I accomplish?\n\n01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.960\nOh, and here's a, here's a really interesting about happiness.\n\n01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.760\nLike everybody that you ask, like, do you want to be happy?\n\n01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.960\nObviously the answer is yes.\n\n01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:39.520\nOnly one idiot would say no, but, but everybody that you ask, uh, if I were to give you a\n\n01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:44.400\nmagic wand that you could point at your head and make yourself happy, would you, everyone\n\n01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.400\nstarts arguing.\n\n01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.320\nLike everyone's like, well, no, no, not like that.\n\n01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.800\nIt's really interesting.\n\n01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.640\nPeople don't just want to be happy.\n\n01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.960\nPeople want, people want gratification.\n\n01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.480\nThey want to earn their happiness.\n\n01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:03.240\nThey want to feel accomplishment, which is where the, uh, uh, it makes all these scientific\n\n01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:08.120\ncases for like anthropologically, like why happiness, which has long since been dismissed\n\n01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:13.480\nas like just a byproduct of emotional thinking that we need to feel anger and we need to\n\n01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.160\nfeel fear in order to survive.\n\n01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.680\nYou need to be like, oh, shit, there's a leopard of, you know, like I'm mad at you for taking\n\n01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.180\nmy banana.\n\n01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:25.160\nAnd, and, and then happiness is just like, oh, no one's taking my banana right now and\n\n01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.880\nthere's no lion, but it's like, he's made, he makes the case that no, happiness is like\n\n01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880\nthe thing.\n\n01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.960\nIt's like, because it makes you, I can't even, I wouldn't do a good job of selling it,\n\n01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.800\nbut it's like, you hear it and you go, shit, this could be scientific.\n\n01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:43.520\nYou could be like Asperger's about being happy, like being, being like, like, like into it.\n\n01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.920\nYou could, you could, you could, you could turn being happy into Minecraft.\n\n01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.640\nYou could like try to knock it out, you know, like organize it and like do it right.\n\n01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.840\nAnd you wouldn't be cheating.\n\n01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.280\nYou wouldn't be like, you know, destined to, to have an anvil fall on your head.\n\n01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.480\nAnd, and, and, and that, and that, like a mountain climber, like, like she talks about\n\n01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.080\nthe difference between pleasure and, and, and gratitude and gratification.\n\n01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:10.280\nSo we're like, like a mountain climber is like, is, is, is happy because they're like,\n\n01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.480\nthey're climbing a mountain, but it's fucking hard.\n\n01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.520\nAnd then like, there's a point where they're like, going to fall off the mountain.\n\n01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.800\nAnd they, they're, they're not dumb.\n\n01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.560\nThey wouldn't be like, I hope I fall off this mountain.\n\n01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.160\nThey're like, I hope I don't.\n\n01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:28.200\nAnd I wish I, I wish I, I wish this rope was working better or whatever, you know, like\n\n01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.480\nthey can have regrets about their situation and wish that it would, and hope that it like\n\n01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.740\ngoes better.\n\n01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.280\nBut that's different from being like, I wish I'd never climbed this mountain.\n\n01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.480\nI mean, they knew climbing a mountain is a bunch of fucking hard work.\n\n01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:44.960\nAnd they chose to like, but they, they were pursuing this like happiness high that they\n\n01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.640\nknew would only come if they like, if they did all this shit that was hard.\n\n01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.200\nAnd there's a big difference between like, well, for instance, playing Minecraft, which\n\n01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.200\nisn't hard.\n\n01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.080\nIt's like a comfort thing for me or like eating a Twinkie or, you know, like just, there's\n\n01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.960\nnothing wrong with like pleasuring yourself, but you, but pleasure is just like, we feel,\n\n01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.600\nwe feel like it's fake.\n\n01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.400\nWe don't feel gratified by it.\n\n01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.920\nYour mountain analogy is the same sort of money where people work really, really hard\n\n01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.760\nto get a ton of money and then get a ton of things, big houses and a lot of grounds.\n\n01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:19.000\nAnd they're still not happy because it's the difference right between gratification and\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nactually being satisfied.\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nYeah.\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nThere's all this.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nIt's an interesting read.\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.160\nI mean, I got the book on tape and I only listened to it.\n\n01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.160\nIt was like a couple hours.\n\n01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.720\nAnd at the end I was like, that's it.\n\n01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720\nFuck this book.\n\n01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:36.440\nBut, but, but the first half I thought was really interesting and throw a lot of science\n\n01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440\nat you.\n\n01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.440\nIt might, if it helps demystify, I think we get, I think smart people get in a funk\n\n01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.480\nabout, about, about happiness and then we, we, we are suspicious of it.\n\n01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.920\nThere is this thing that we take it for granted the way we take for granted that rich kids\n\n01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.240\ndon't have a hard time growing up with money.\n\n01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.840\nSo we just sort of assume that if your parents had money and you have money, you know how\n\n01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.840\nto keep it, you know how to make it, you know how to earn it, you know how to value\n\n01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840\nof it.\n\n01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.840\nThat's true.\n\n01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.840\nThere should be sort of a course.\n\n01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.320\nAnd there's no question that, you know, people who, if you want to be unhappy and you want\n\n01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:10.400\nto hit all the points that make people scientifically less happy, one of the top things is live in\n\n01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.680\nan autocratic third world like country that where, where like you have no freedom and\n\n01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.880\nlike there's, there's less nutrition and there's less, less like wealth and there's\n\n01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.240\nless like, there's more, like those people are made unhappy by that environment.\n\n01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:31.240\nSo it's not, it's like poverty does make you unhappy because you're being deprived of fucking\n\n01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.880\nshit that an ape would have in the wild.\n\n01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:41.480\nI mean, you're being deprived of like really like minimum levels of like comfort and emotional\n\n01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.480\ncomfort.\n\n01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.720\nLike, like, do I belong in this family of apes like to like, are these people cool with me?\n\n01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.720\nIf you're sleeping on a sidewalk, you're like more bummed out.\n\n01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.120\nSo, so, you know, I thought there was that documentary is like, yeah, it tops out like\n\n01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.360\nthe way the guy says it is like, if you, if you could afford this book, you've, you've,\n\n01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.240\nyou've, you're past the threshold where money affects your happiness.\n\n01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:06.400\nLike you're, you're, you're, you're, it's, it only works to a, to like 70 grand a year\n\n01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400\nor something.\n\n01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.400\nUh, anyways, go fuck yourself, everybody.\n\n01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.480\nUh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.560\nAnd then he talks about how to, how to be happy in relationships and have kids and stuff\n\n01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560\nor whatever.\n\n01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.760\nLike, I guess your kid, I guess your kids, you're supposed to like, let them do shit\n\n01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.320\nand like not yell at them and stuff like, uh, but, and, and I would normally not believe\n\n01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.320\nit.\n\n01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.640\nLike the way he talks about kids, but I said, like Cody's sister, like, like, I, everything\n\n01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.520\nI hear the guy saying, I'm like, oh, that's how your sister, that's how she's raising\n\n01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.520\nher kids.\n\n01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.880\nThat's why they're like, and then the sibling rivalry thing, which we take for granted,\n\n01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.760\nwe think that siblings are supposed to like resent each other.\n\n01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.520\nAnd, but it's not really a, it's not a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's\n\n01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.400\na pervasive thing, but it's not, it's not a natural thing.\n\n01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.880\nIt's not necessary.\n\n01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.880\nWhat?\n\n01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.880\nWhat is it?\n\n01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880\nWhat?\n\n01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880\nOh man.\n\n01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.280\nYou don't have to like be mad at your brothers and sisters just because they're older or\n\n01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280\nyounger than you.\n\n01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.520\nLike that's, it's not, it's not, it's not a thing that just happens like because you're\n\n01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520\nbabies.\n\n01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520\nWhat?\n\n01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520\nWhy does it happen?\n\n01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:17.320\nIt happens because there's like, I hate to throw 90% of American families under the\n\n01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.480\nbus, but it happens because it happens because of a trickle down of like a culture of like,\n\n01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.000\nthe parents expect it to happen.\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.640\nLike a, like a, be nice to your sister.\n\n01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.440\nLike it's just that everything is like, it's not based on, on, on.\n\n01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.480\nThey're setting norms that it's normal for them to fight like that.\n\n01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.480\nAnd so they're taking it.\n\n01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.480\nThey create a share.\n\n01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480\nAnd I don't know.\n\n01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.680\nIt just, it just has everything to do with like the nuances of like, are you, are you\n\n01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.000\nprojecting onto your kids?\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.320\nLike they're going to pick up from you.\n\n01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.320\nRight.\n\n01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.720\nLike, oh, I'm like a hockey team and my sister's like a different hockey team.\n\n01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:50.000\nLike they just, you just, you, you put it onto them on accident because you learned it\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nthat way.\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nLike it's cause we're close.\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nWe're all in the same car.\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nWe're all in the same house.\n\n01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nWe're going to fight.\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nIt's just how it gets out.\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nYeah.\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nI would have thought so too.\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.280\nI mean, and, and, and you know, it's not like unhappiness is a myth.\n\n01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.440\nIt's not like it doesn't fall out of trees and stuff, but like I, it is comforting to\n\n01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.600\nfeel like, oh yeah, but happiness is like kind of, it's easier for some people than others.\n\n01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.640\nAnd then like some people have to work for it a little bit more, but it's like a thing\n\n01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:19.280\nthat you could just decide to be kind of like, that sounds, that sounds very naive and privileged.\n\n01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:22.840\nThat's, that's, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's not, it's not because there's\n\n01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.000\nthis thing that says like, you know, you can decide when you want to be happy and people\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.960\nscoff at that because they're like, well, what if you're in a jail cell or what if you're\n\n01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:33.200\nwhatever, what if you're an auto person, but the truth of the matter is so much great art\n\n01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.360\nand life and joy comes out of slumps, to be honest.\n\n01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.600\nSo there's, it's obvious that happiness doesn't know geography.\n\n01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.960\nIt doesn't know any sort of social class because if we can't get access to museums, somebody's\n\n01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.960\ngoing to spray paint something.\n\n01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.800\nIf we can't get access to instruments, somebody's going to figure out a way to put two turntables\n\n01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:49.800\ntogether.\n\n01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.400\nLike people always figure out a way to bring joy regardless of, you know, where, or how\n\n01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.280\nbad it truly is.\n\n01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.680\nEspecially the streets.\n\n01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.680\nHit it.\n\n01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680\nMinor always.\n\n01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680\nYou know.\n\n01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:20.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.680\nFlying high, flying low.\n\n01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680\nI fucked your mama like a Bologgelo.\n\n01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.680\nFuck your inner.\n\n01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.680\nFace.\n\n01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.680\nJust.\n\n01:14:35.680

01:14:44.680\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.680\nOkay.\n\n01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.680\nYo.\n\n01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.680\nYo.\n\n01:14:48.680 -->

back and forth on the A and B rhymes.\n\n01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:00.680\nYou know what I'm saying.\n\n01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.680\nOh, I'm just curious though.\n\n01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.680\nWhat is it about my rapping that had no limitations on it that made you think what I needed was\n\n01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:07.680\nlimitations.\n\n01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.680\nOh, maybe you should, maybe you should draw boundaries around your.\n\n01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.680\nJust make sure that you have gotten enough sleep before you rhyme.\n\n01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.680\nYo.\n\n01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.680\nYo.\n\n01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.680\nYo.\n\n01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.680\nYo.\n\n01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.680\nYo.\n\n01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.680\nYo.\n\n01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.680\nCombs.\n\n01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.680\nHair.\n\n01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.680\nSky.\n\n01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.680\nAir.\n\n01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.680\nEyeballs.\n\n01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.680\nNose.\n\n01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.680\nI fucked your mama and then I smelled a rose.\n\n01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.680\nI put my shoes on tight.\n\n01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.680\nI fucked your mama all day and all night.\n\n01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:43.680\nI put my suspenders on and I rolled around and made an angel on the lawn out of clippings.\n\n01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680\nThen I just mowed.\n\n01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.680\nI fucked your mama when it was 10 below.\n\n01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680\nIt's cold.\n\n01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.680\nI warmed her up.\n\n01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.680\nI fucked your mama and then it drank out of a cup.\n\n01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.680\nIt was my own cum.\n\n01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.680\nStraight rod, steward.\n\n01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.680\nStraight.\n\n01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.680\nI drank my own cum.\n\n01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.680\nI love to drink my own cum.\n\n01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.680\nI know you asked why.\n\n01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.680\nI thought you might have some limitations.\n\n01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:15.680\nYeah.\n\n01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:23.680\nWell, that's enough I think for now.\n\n01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.680\nBring your board.\n\n01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:32.680\nOh, Affinity Designer came out for the iPad.\n\n01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.680\nYeah, just very excited about that.\n\n01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.680\nWhat's that like?\n\n01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.680\nThe ongoing drama.\n\n01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.680\nThe Schrab drama.\n\n01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.680\nSchrab drama?\n\n01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.680\nYeah, there's a Schrab iPad drama.\n\n01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680\nOh, I don't know.\n\n01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.680\nSchrab got some old ass iPad from Kevin Day and he tried to high road me with it.\n\n01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.680\nI could see it was like a legacy iPad.\n\n01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680\nShots fired.\n\n01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.680\nYeah, I mean, like, fucking Schrab.\n\n01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.680\nAnd where has Schrab been?\n\n01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:03.680\nLike, he came and he campaigned and he got a first class ticket to Long Island and then\n\n01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.680\nhe just boned out.\n\n01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.680\nHe's probably trying to unload Skud t-shirts in Boston or something.\n\n01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.680\nYou know, there was some scam to it.\n\n01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.680\nLike, where is he?\n\n01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:17.680\nLike, that friendship's not real.\n\n01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.680\nHe's always accusing me of being unfeeling.\n\n01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.680\nBut look how emotional I am.\n\n01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.680\nLike, it's always me.\n\n01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.680\nHe's always putting it on me.\n\n01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.680\nHe's like, oh, the big joke, oh, Dan's so mean and he's so unfeeling.\n\n01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.680\nBut this is all heart.\n\n01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.680\nBut if that were true, you wouldn't be the one reaching out.\n\n01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:36.680\nYeah.\n\n01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.680\nYeah.\n\n01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.680\nYou want me to text Rob that I want to know me?\n\n01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:40.680\nYeah.\n\n01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.680\nGot nominated?\n\n01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.680\nLet him know, let him know.\n\n01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.680\nLeave a voicemail.\n\n01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.680\nYeah.\n\n01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.680\nUh, oh, let's bring Steve Levy up.\n\n01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.680\nSteve Levy.\n\n01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.680\nSteve Levy, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:03.680\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.680\nHey, Steve, what's up with the 20 empty seats?\n\n01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.680\nShould we stop doing the show?\n\n01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.680\nUh, no, we should keep doing the show.\n\n01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.680\nAs the audience dwindles?\n\n01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.680\nI think, yeah.\n\n01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:19.680\nFor this show, yeah, it seems like our numbers, our numbers.\n\n01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.680\nWell, should we target like a year though?\n\n01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.680\nIf we're going to stop doing the show, we have to decide a year in advance.\n\n01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:28.680\nYeah.\n\n01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.680\nThat's on you, I think, right?\n\n01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.680\nYeah.\n\n01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:36.680\nI don't like to be dramatic about stuff, but I also can't afford to.\n\n01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:40.680\nI don't have the option of just being following my bliss with the show.\n\n01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.680\nSo we have to decide, like, now-wish if we want to, like, oh, let's spend this year\n\n01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.680\nwrapping things up, because then the subscriptions, like, six months from now we can go,\n\n01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.680\nokay, no more six month subscriptions.\n\n01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.680\nAll right, well, I'll get one more week, and then I'll make an official,\n\n01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.680\nlike, Jeff should be here for the decision.\n\n01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.680\nYeah, I think so.\n\n01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.680\nNot that I'm going to let any, I'm not going to take a vote.\n\n01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.680\nI'm the one that has to be here every fucking week.\n\n01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:14.680\nLike, everybody else is like, oh.\n\n01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:25.680\nI did it.\n\n01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.680\nThis place is cutthroat.\n\n01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:30.680\nI actually need that.\n\n01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.680\nNo joke.\n\n01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.680\nThat's not funny.\n\n01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.680\nDad.\n\n01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.680\nWhat do you think, Spencer, in terms of the D&D business?\n\n01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.680\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.680\nWhatever you guys want, man.\n\n01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.680\nDon't always say that.\n\n01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.680\nLet's do it.\n\n01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.680\nWhat about you?\n\n01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680\nWhat do you want?\n\n01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.680\nI want to play D&D.\n\n01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.680\nAw.\n\n01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.680\nAw.\n\n01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.680\nLet's do it for the people at home.\n\n01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:00.680\nThe people at home.\n\n01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.680\nDoes it make you happy, Spencer?\n\n01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.680\nUh, I don't know.\n\n01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.680\nIt makes me happy.\n\n01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:15.680\nIt certainly makes me feel wanted.\n\n01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:20.680\nThat's a big part of the biological necessity of happiness or whatever, the drive for it,\n\n01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:25.680\nbecause it has to do with, like, if you're, it's, happiness is like this, like, velcro\n\n01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.680\nthat holds a tribe together, because, like, and they, and they immediately, the first\n\n01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:35.680\nthing they did is they were like, oh, are, is it just, is it just cute people?\n\n01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.680\nAre cute, are people that are attractive just happy because everyone likes them and\n\n01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.680\nhas nothing to do with happiness?\n\n01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.680\nLike, is there just another factor and they, they had to eliminate all that stuff and some\n\n01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.680\nvery uncomfortable experiments, I'm sure.\n\n01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:47.680\nExcuse me, sir.\n\n01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.680\nWould you like to answer some questions about your life?\n\n01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.680\nWhy?\n\n01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.680\nWell, you seem very happy.\n\n01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:55.680\nOkay.\n\n01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.680\nWhy am I in a room full of, uh, half-handsome people?\n\n01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.680\nWhich one?\n\n01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.680\nUh, because you're, maybe you're handsome.\n\n01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:04.680\nI don't know.\n\n01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:12.680\nWhy am I sitting on the other side of the room with a lot of ugly people who are also\n\n01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.680\nhappy?\n\n01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:18.680\nAnd why are the beautiful people frowning at us?\n\n01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.680\nAh, happiness.\n\n01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:23.680\nYou know about those carrier pigeons?\n\n01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.680\nI, I've been listening to this, uh, podcast.\n\n01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.680\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.680\nGo on.\n\n01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680\nNot so easy, is it?\n\n01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.680\nI've been listening to this podcast, Business Wars.\n\n01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.680\nDo you guys know about the Business Wars?\n\n01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.680\nAll the time, baby.\n\n01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.680\nThere are some good wars between those businesses.\n\n01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:45.680\nThere's, uh, Netflix and Blockbuster and Adidas and Nike and Marvel and DC, some really,\n\n01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:52.680\nsome really fun companies and, and right now, um, they're doing Hearst, uh, versus Pulitzer\n\n01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.680\nand the news business back in the day.\n\n01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.680\nYou're talking about all-time corporate rivalries, like 30 for 30, but corporate.\n\n01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:00.680\nRight?\n\n01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.680\nYeah.\n\n01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.680\nIt's a really fun podcast.\n\n01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.680\nAnyway, today, they're talking about, um, carrier pigeons.\n\n01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.680\nWhich is the, which is the Rothschild.\n\n01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.680\nSo there was versus the gun.\n\n01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.680\nVersus, no, like, versus the cell phone.\n\n01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:21.680\nSo Hearst, like, invested heavily in pigeons that would carry, like, actually carry messages\n\n01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.680\nthroughout New York City.\n\n01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.680\nThey would go 90 miles per hour and know exactly where to go.\n\n01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.680\nAnd there was this big trial that they were trying to get the scoop on before the, before\n\n01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.680\nPulitzer.\n\n01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.680\nWhere did you come from before this, man?\n\n01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.680\nWhat?\n\n01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.680\nI just found it fascinating.\n\n01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.680\nWhat were you doing backstage?\n\n01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.680\nYou know, catching up some work, listening to some podcasts.\n\n01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.680\nUm, I don't know.\n\n01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680\nIt's crazy.\n\n01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:50.680\nYou know, the Rothschilds, the Rothschilds also used carrier pigeons.\n\n01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.680\nYou don't give a shit about what I'm, okay.\n\n01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.680\nRothschild, I'm trying to help you.\n\n01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:02.680\nI'm trying to talk about 1930s New York railroad barons.\n\n01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.680\nYou think I wanted to do this?\n\n01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.680\nJust try to put a smile on your face.\n\n01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:07.680\nYes.\n\n01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.680\nSo I do cosine what you are saying.\n\n01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.680\nThe Rothschilds also used carrier pigeons.\n\n01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.680\nYou were.\n\n01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.680\nBut they're extinct.\n\n01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.680\nWow.\n\n01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.680\nThey went out of business.\n\n01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.680\nThey went out of business.\n\n01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.680\n1910s.\n\n01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.680\nI don't know.\n\n01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.680\nYou know what else about optimism and happiness?\n\n01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:27.680\nMartin Luther King, uh, uh, his branding optimism.\n\n01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.680\nUse your eye statements.\n\n01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.680\nLike I heard that Ted talk or the person that talks about the effectiveness of\n\n01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.680\nleaders and stuff.\n\n01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:34.680\nMartin Luther King.\n\n01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.680\nWhy, why was his branding so effective?\n\n01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.680\nHe wasn't the first guy to notice things were bad and all that stuff.\n\n01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:45.680\nHe used his eye statements and he said, I believe I have a dream.\n\n01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.680\nHis speech wasn't called, I have a plan.\n\n01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.680\nOr, you know, I have, I have, I have, I have, I have 10 rules about how everyone\n\n01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.680\nshould operate.\n\n01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.680\nIt was like, I, I, I have a dream.\n\n01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.680\nAnd his dream was like two kids holding hands.\n\n01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:02.680\nAnd if you couldn't get behind that, then you're, you know, you're like, all right,\n\n01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.680\nyou're in the minority.\n\n01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.680\nAnd like, like most people are like, yeah, well, when you put it that way, I can\n\n01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:08.680\naccess that.\n\n01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.680\nIt's like a vision.\n\n01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.680\nIt's like, that's what leadership is.\n\n01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.680\nYou go, I believe like first, like the most important thing.\n\n01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:19.680\nIt, optimism is the opposite of pessimism.\n\n01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.680\nPessimism is the thing that like infects you and it fucks everything up.\n\n01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.680\nEverybody that's mad right now, they're like, they're pessimistic.\n\n01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.680\nAnd so some people are moving to try to get behind the thing that they're scared is\n\n01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.680\ngoing to happen.\n\n01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.680\nSo that, because no one wants to be a fool.\n\n01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.680\nSo they're like, okay, the world's falling apart.\n\n01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.680\nThat's kind of what I've been doing, like hiding.\n\n01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.680\nLike I don't want to be a loser in that battle.\n\n01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.680\nLike, okay, let me scoot away and are over here and stuff.\n\n01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.680\nAnd then like, but optimism is the only thing that's going to actually counter that\n\n01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.680\nsickness, but it seems stupid to us.\n\n01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:59.680\nLike, optimism seems stupid to us because they're, they believe more crazy shit.\n\n01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.680\nAnd they're actually less accurate.\n\n01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.680\nThey do these studies.\n\n01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.680\nOh, there's this study that was hilarious on the book.\n\n01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.680\nSo they take people and they put them in a room with a light switch that straight up\n\n01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.680\njust works randomly.\n\n01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:15.680\nSo, and they go like, hey, turn on the light 20 times or something like that.\n\n01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.680\nAnd then the light switch is like programmed to just be random.\n\n01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:23.680\nSo like, it just, when you turn it on, sometimes it comes on, sometimes not.\n\n01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.680\nWhen you turn it off, if it's on, sometimes it goes off, sometimes it doesn't.\n\n01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:32.680\nThe depressed people that they pre-screen for are like, are you depressed?\n\n01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.680\nCome do this experiment.\n\n01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.680\nThey're like a control group.\n\n01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.680\nThey, they, they asked them like, hey, what was going on with the light switch?\n\n01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:41.680\nHuh?\n\n01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.680\nAnd the depressed people nailed it.\n\n01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.680\nThey're like, well, it's fucking random is what it was because I turned it on the first\n\n01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.680\ntime and I was like, what the fuck's going on?\n\n01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:50.680\nAnd so I tested it.\n\n01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.680\nAnd they're like, clued in, like they get reality.\n\n01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.680\nIf you're depressed, like you understand what's sad about the world and what's not\n\n01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.680\nworking, you're like, finely tuned to it.\n\n01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.680\nThe, the, the happy people, they were like, what's up with that light switch?\n\n01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:07.680\nAnd I know 30% of the time it was just out of control.\n\n01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.680\nYeah.\n\n01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.680\nThey don't believe a conspiracy.\n\n01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.680\nYeah.\n\n01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.680\nThey're like, they're just like, they, they, they, they're delusional.\n\n01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.680\nRight.\n\n01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:21.680\nAnd, and, and so, but there's, there's a difference between that delusion and being delusional\n\n01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:22.680\nabout the things that matter.\n\n01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:27.680\nCause the thing is in terms of society, that delusion makes shit happen.\n\n01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.680\nRight.\n\n01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.680\nAnd happy people go, that shit happens.\n\n01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.680\nAnd depressed people go, that shit's happening to me.\n\n01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:32.680\nRight.\n\n01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.680\nAnd yeah.\n\n01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.680\nAnd like, if everyone is depressed and everyone is like noticing how the light switch doesn't\n\n01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.680\nwork, the light, when the light switch is a real light switch, that's incredibly helpful.\n\n01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:43.680\nThank you.\n\n01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.680\nYou're Vin Diesel in pitch black.\n\n01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.680\nLike, thank you.\n\n01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.680\nYou can see, you can see things that I can't see.\n\n01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.680\nThank you for saving me from the monsters.\n\n01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.680\nBut this isn't a real light switch when you're talking about like fucking democracy or you're\n\n01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:59.680\ntalking about like mankind deserving a chance against giraffes or asteroids.\n\n01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.680\nYou actually need, you need that fucking Bill Pullman to get out there and be like, hey\n\n01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.680\neverybody, let's fight together the aliens.\n\n01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.680\nLike there's no reason to do that.\n\n01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.680\nIf there's anybody that's sad out there, they're like, this is bullshit.\n\n01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.680\nI'm flying away from the aliens because we're all going to die.\n\n01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.680\nThat person's correct, but not going to win.\n\n01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:19.680\nAll right.\n\n01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:20.680\nWhatever.\n\n01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:21.680\nBut you're exactly right.\n\n01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.680\nIt's kind of why they start with the first images of just straight bullshit.\n\n01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.680\nSo you kind of knew that this administration was going to go after women and children first\n\n01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.680\nbecause that's the most shocking and jarring.\n\n01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.680\nIt's sort of designed to make you freak the fuck out.\n\n01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.680\nSo they, they show you the hardest of hard.\n\n01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.680\nIt's a, it's a little bit of a like precursor to what's about to happen to wear you down.\n\n01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.680\nBut don't be, we're not going to be worn down.\n\n01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:48.680\nWell, I'm pretty worn down, but finally I'm someone.\n\n01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.680\nI was at home on my couch when I got this phone call.\n\n01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:01.680\nHey guys, I just wanted to step in and say everybody be aware of guns.\n\n01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.680\nYeah.\n\n01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.680\nMC gun control.\n\n01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.680\nJust to, that's it.\n\n01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.680\nI've got, I've got, I'm proud of our audience.\n\n01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.680\nThey're tired of that bit.\n\n01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.680\nThat was a test you guys passed.\n\n01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:25.680\nSpencer, do you bring us up to speed?\n\n01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.680\nTell us where we're at.\n\n01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680\nWhat's been going on?\n\n01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.680\nYeah.\n\n01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:41.680\nOh, last time on Harmon time, our heroes had just put out the fire.\n\n01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:45.680\nAnd I think then they started another fire.\n\n01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.680\nI'm not sure about that.\n\n01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.680\nThat might not have happened, but they were certainly putting their foot back in it.\n\n01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:57.680\nAnd ended up escaping from the town, but farmers were in hot pursuit.\n\n01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:06.680\nAfter making it out of the perimeter of the town, they weighed up their options and decided they were outnumbering the farmers and decided to attack.\n\n01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:14.680\nUntrained, the farmers took several blows and were instantly overwhelmed, but they fought valiantly.\n\n01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:21.680\nAnd then Diarrhea Jr. threw a bunch of vampire dust in the air and everyone started choking.\n\n01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.680\nThat's what's happening now.\n\n01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.680\nAll right.\n\n01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.680\nAnyone got any questions?\n\n01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.680\nI hope so.\n\n01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.680\nI have no idea what's happening.\n\n01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680\nThat's probably, yeah.\n\n01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.680\nYou're playing Schrab's character, Gary.\n\n01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:37.680\nYou're a big plant man.\n\n01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.680\nYou're like a swamp thing.\n\n01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.680\nThere it is.\n\n01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.680\nGreat.\n\n01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.680\nGot it.\n\n01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.680\nAll right.\n\n01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.680\nI wasn't listening to a lot of that.\n\n01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.680\nWhat's deconstructed?\n\n01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.680\nWhy?\n\n01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:56.680\nI used the D&D opening to gather my thoughts about how the show went.\n\n01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.680\nIt's the problem.\n\n01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:03.680\nIt's like my first chance in two hours to go, should we keep doing the show or not?\n\n01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.680\nI'm thinking about a million things.\n\n01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.680\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.680\nMy apologies.\n\n01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:10.680\nIt was an awkward handoff and Spencer picked it up.\n\n01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.680\nNo, it's not your fault.\n\n01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:16.680\nNo, it's that space of time that's like a snowdrift I have to pee on.\n\n01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.680\nOh, of course.\n\n01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.680\nFor 90 minutes, I'm like, it's up to me to, okay, let's keep the show going.\n\n01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.680\nYou guys can tell how responsibly I take this job.\n\n01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.680\nThen I hand it off to Spencer and then I'm like, I just decompress into that space.\n\n01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:39.680\nSpencer's talking about what happened and I'm just going like, all right, well, so get\n\n01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.680\nhome tonight.\n\n01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.680\nI'll let the dogs out.\n\n01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.680\nMy life's going okay, isn't it?\n\n01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:48.680\nDo I enjoy myself here?\n\n01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.680\nAre there?\n\n01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.680\nWhy?\n\n01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.680\nWhat's with the empty seats?\n\n01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.680\nIt's your get ready space.\n\n01:30:54.680 --> 01:31:00.680\nWhat else can I rhyme with mouth other than south?\n\n01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.680\nMaybe we started some fires.\n\n01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.680\nI like that.\n\n01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:08.680\nThat actually made me feel a lot better because that makes just perfect sense.\n\n01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.680\nYeah.\n\n01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.680\nIt's not like about me being bad at this.\n\n01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:12.680\nOh, God, no.\n\n01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.680\nNo, no, not at all.\n\n01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.680\nAs a matter of fact, let's get one more.\n\n01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.680\nNo, no.\n\n01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:17.680\nThat's the worst.\n\n01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.680\nI mean, I appreciate the thought, but no, that's the last thing I want right now.\n\n01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.680\nI want to play games with my friends.\n\n01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.680\nHell yeah.\n\n01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.680\nLet's get into it.\n\n01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:33.680\nSo we're outside of the town.\n\n01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.680\nYou ran away.\n\n01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.680\nThe town was fighting a fire and you were like, well, we still got to find Patchens.\n\n01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.680\nSo then you went in and you were like, where's Patchens?\n\n01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.680\nAnd they were like, well, there's a fire.\n\n01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:48.680\nAnd then you put out the fire and then you were asking for Patchens and they were like,\n\n01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.680\nweren't you guys the guys that start the fire?\n\n01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.680\nAnd you were like, I think the winds are turning.\n\n01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:57.680\nAnd then you hightailed it out of there, but then you were being chased and you were running\n\n01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.680\nbecause you thought you were being chased by an angry mob.\n\n01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.680\nBut the farther you got, the more turned out to be just three people.\n\n01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.680\nAnd then you're like, well, fuck this.\n\n01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.680\nAnd then you felt bad because you just like, you slashed one of them in the cut or something.\n\n01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.680\nYou really started taking them to task.\n\n01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.680\nAnd then it was just kind of sad because it's like, well, they were just trying to do their jobs.\n\n01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:22.680\nAnd that's when DJ threw the vampire dust in everyone's face.\n\n01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:23.680\nAnd that didn't do it.\n\n01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:24.680\nThat just made everyone cough.\n\n01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:27.680\nYeah, it was just like dust.\n\n01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:30.680\nBut you know, you might have diseases now, but...\n\n01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:34.680\nIf anything, it's like an ingredient for maybe an invisibility potion.\n\n01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:37.680\nYeah, realistically, you did get rid of a magical reagent.\n\n01:32:37.680 -->

People need us.\n\n01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.680\nThere's a civil war happening or something.\n\n01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.680\nIs a church involved?\n\n01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.680\nThere's always a church involved.\n\n01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:28.680\nLet's go to this mining town and steal the gold from the church.\n\n01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:30.680\nAll right.\n\n01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.680\nCan I reread the part about what's happening in the mining town?\n\n01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.680\nYeah, there's a dispute between the miners' bureau\n\n01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.680\nand the church's district prelate.\n\n01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:41.680\nSo remember, you came into the first town you came in\n\n01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:44.680\nbecause there was some shit going down to the local church.\n\n01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.680\nSo it's kind of like the church is in a dispute\n\n01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.680\nwith the miners' bureau.\n\n01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.680\nSo it's miners' v. church.\n\n01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.680\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.680\nThat's where we're headed.\n\n01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.680\nMan, do you guys remember how crazy that was back in...\n\n01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:58.680\nThat was a year ago.\n\n01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.680\nNo, it wasn't.\n\n01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:02.680\nIt was very recently.\n\n01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.680\nIt feels like a year ago.\n\n01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:07.680\nID10 T-Fest, do you remember?\n\n01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:09.680\nIt was good times.\n\n01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:12.680\nIt was a year to the sadly mistaken gods\n\n01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.680\nthat believe their lives are more important than ours\n\n01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:19.680\nand who actually just fill time between our adventures\n\n01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:22.680\nas they control the planets.\n\n01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.680\nI'm right there with you, bro.\n\n01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.680\nYeah.\n\n01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:30.680\nThey would probably look upon us as pieces on a chess board\n\n01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.680\nor characters in some poem.\n\n01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.680\nAnd yet, I'm sure their life is riddled with\n\n01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:38.680\nfucking confusion and inconsistency and alcoholism.\n\n01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.680\nOf course.\n\n01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.680\nBut that's why we belong to the church of the Silver Flame.\n\n01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.680\nSo we don't have to think about that stuff as much.\n\n01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.680\nWe have lives of consistency and virtue\n\n01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:50.680\nand we can tell the good guys from the bad guys\n\n01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:53.680\nlike we're not mistaking each other for our fathers.\n\n01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:55.680\nAt least we're working at it.\n\n01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.680\nYeah, we're trying.\n\n01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:59.680\nOff to the mining town!\n\n01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:01.680\nFor their gold!\n\n01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.680\nIt's...\n\n01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:05.680\nAnd to help with the dispute.\n\n01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.680\nWhen we get there...\n\n01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:09.680\nI mean, if I'm moving too fast, I thought it would happen.\n\n01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:11.680\nNo, no, okay.\n\n01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.680\nSpencer tells us.\n\n01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.680\nI thought you were going to do Jeff's bit.\n\n01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.680\nWhen we get there, let me do all the talking.\n\n01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:19.680\nIs that what you're going to say?\n\n01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.680\nNo.\n\n01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:24.680\nWhen he had his vocal cord surgery,\n\n01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:26.680\nthe amount of times that was said per week\n\n01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.680\ndropped worldwide, 20%.\n\n01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.680\nBut...\n\n01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.680\nWhat were you going to say, though?\n\n01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.680\nWhen we get there...\n\n01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.680\nOh, you just wanted to know.\n\n01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.680\nOh, man, getting here is going to be a real hassle.\n\n01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:42.680\nIt's several days' journey\n\n01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:45.680\nand it might cause monster fights.\n\n01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.680\nIt doesn't.\n\n01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.680\nWhat?
