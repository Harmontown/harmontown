00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
How do you feel?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
If you're at home right now, pull your pants down.

00:13.000 --> 00:22.000
Please welcome to the stage, Dungeon Master, Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden.

00:22.000 --> 00:32.000
Here we are together, just us.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
And it wouldn't be just us unless we welcomed out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Yes!

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
I am Brandon Johnson. I'll be sitting in for Jeff Davis. We love you, Jeff Davis.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Thank you. Thank you, Guest Comptroller, Brandon Johnson. Thank you.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
He just said it. He said it.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
I think I'm just going to get right into it. I don't really have a...

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't think I have... I've been purposely avoiding current events.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
I don't think that's why anyone listens to this show.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
You tune in to hear about me.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
I forget about this Russia investigation. How is Dan taking it?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Right.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
And so the only news on that front is that Dan is trying to...

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Dan is experimenting with ignoring it.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
And Dan understands that that is a full-on coward move.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
There's nothing that you can say to me.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't think that would make me go,

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Now wait a minute about what I am right now.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
I am a fragile white closet libertarian.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
I don't know whatever I was.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm a coastal elite that just wants his Obama back.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
Or any mannequin dressed like Obama that wants to just carry on the fucking status quo.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Drone strikes on Benghazi, whatever the fuck was the problem before.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
I don't care. Just get it back up and running.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I do not want Nazis in Atwater.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
I don't want one of the five places that I used to go drink

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
when the other four places were shitty.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
I always had a weird vibe about that place.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I always thought I could smell a little Nazi on that place.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Did you see the... In case LA people were talking about a local bar,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
did you know what I'm talking about?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Fuck you!

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
This is not politics. By the way, none of this is fucking politics.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
It's a fascist coup of whatever, but an asteroid coming at the earth

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
isn't politics just because Republicans want to say it's not coming at the earth.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
That doesn't make it politics.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I don't give a fuck about Republicans and Democrats.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I'm scared of asteroids.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
There's an asteroid called fascism.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
A lot of my friends that I talk to, they go like,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I think it'll swing and it always swings.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
I know it always swings. We're always addicted to the swing.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
We love the swing. We love the four years of this and the eight years of that

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
and the eight years and the four years and the four years.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
The swing that we're on right now is a 30-year swing.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
It's a big old swing and the front porch is called the end of a country.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
It takes 30 years to swing back.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
And it's going to swing back to some horrible form of militant socialism

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
when it does swing back. We're fucked no matter what.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Okay, so that's the end of my politics corner.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
And what the fuck was I...

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Oh, just in the culture realm,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
I just found it interesting. Did you see the apology for the owner of that place?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I did.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
This is not politics. This is just...

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
As you guys know, I teach a masterclass in apologies.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Apologies are...

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I missed it.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
The guy's apology was essentially,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
hey, I'm Jewish. My bouncers are gay and black.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And they love these guys.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
And I didn't know they were Nazis because I didn't see no uniforms.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Right.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
It was just sort of a...

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
It was really defensive.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I would summarize his apology as this.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
He was saying, look, I'm a businessman.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't know for sure that I can close the financial gap between

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
a fascist or welcome here bar and a fascist-only bar.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm going to need a couple more months.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
So please keep having your liberal rat parties here.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Because I need to tell, like, I think 2019.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
I think by then, then I can just say fascist-only and then, like, it'll be fine.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
They did need a little convincing to start throwing those people out.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
That is the truth.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
They said that the only color we see is green.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Which is my favorite answer to any sort of racist question.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Like, oh, they're beating black people in the streets.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Hey, man.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Kermit the Frog. Motherfucker Kermit the Frog.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Plant life, bro. Plant life.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Green. That's all we see.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
All right.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
So it's crazy that it's, like, literally now right behind your house.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Right.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Well, you made fun of me.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Last time, what, two years ago, when Kumail had his story that happened in Silverlake.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And I was like, this happened in Silverlake.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And you're like, Silverlake.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Wow.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Way to rub my oppression in my face, Dan.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
It may as well be happening in our basements.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
I mean, I don't even, it's not even like, oh, shit, it's at-at water.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
But it does, it does sort of signify a little bit of a shift that it's now in places where

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
you thought there were going to be hip white people sort of helping you out.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Yeah.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Or gay black bouncers, be fair.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Well, you know, the bouncer is black and the other one is gay.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
He merged the two to have a super bouncer.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
So yeah, it does mean a little something when you hear it like, oh, shit, it's going down

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
and like, well, it's fearless.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
Because you getting chased out of little dorms of shit is when it's going to get, like, pretty critical.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
I got to say, I do like the forced kind of survival behavior of some of these groups where

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
these groups are almost in a mocking or like Psyops way.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
They're like, hey, look, if we were, if we were racist, we wouldn't have this guy or this guy.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Because it actually does for, I do think, I see a million flaws in the mirror when we were like, like,

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
hating some of these guys is making it, you know, hopefully the positive side.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
It's like, oh, what, what do you hate and why?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
And the answer is nationalism.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
The answer is all these, you know, ideology, let's not be fooled by, like, you know,

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
let's not be too so fashionable that we're blinded by this shit.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
That's kind of, that's what, that's what trolling helps.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
It's like this bleach you scatter across things and like kind of like it's corrosive,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
but it kind of like also gets some shit off the counter.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You know, it's like, let's talk about good versus bad.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
Let's not talk about fucking like, yeah, like, you can tell how liberal you are

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
by how many black people are in your club.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
But you can't edit, you can know it is a good indicator.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
And I'm doing pretty good.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
As long as Jeff, as long as Jeff keeps getting sick, man.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
This is the most liberal podcast in town.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
We want to invite you, but you ate too many lemon bars.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
All right, so I have a special story.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
That's enough of that.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
I know 30% of my fans are Nazis and that's why there's probably, there's empty seats here now.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
The show is failing.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
It's 30%, 30% of the seats are empty.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I mean, not 30, right guys?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Oh, Jesus.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Well, you can't believe them.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Those are full seats. They're biased.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
They're like, whoa.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Hey, empty seats.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Are you not here?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
What?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Weird.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
What are you doing?

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
So here's a, here's a, here's a story I have to sit down for.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh shit.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
A sit down story there.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Oh shit and a heart sit down.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Okay, get your mic.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Okay.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
All right.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
All right.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Okay.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
All right.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
Papa Bear is going to tell you a story.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Okay.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Here we go.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Where is this?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Okay.

08:50.000 --> 08:58.000
So, the story starts on Thursday when I get a text message from dad on my phone.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
And it's very, it's very nice.

09:03.000 --> 09:12.000
Thursday, 12, 28 PM, as your father, I wanted to text you to tell you how proud of you I

09:12.000 --> 09:27.000
am for your Emmy nomination for that pickle show you work so hard on.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
And as a good son, six hours later, I text dad, thanks.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
But here's something of even higher value.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
I got a Tesla because my dad, I'm like, I want to bond with my dad.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
He's a car guy.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Because stuff, you know, it's like, oh my God, I'm bonding with my dad.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm texting you right now while it drives itself.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
It was true.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Don't judge me.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Also the last thing that we ever read.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
And then so, so this is where my dad starts to really blow my mind.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I was like, that was nice.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Congratulations.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
But he says, but what about the smudges on the touch screen?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Couldn't you afford the Edison?

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
And I went, holy shit, my dad is making references to my television show, great minds with Dan

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Harmon, which is a really deep cut.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
On top of an Edison joke, which you never hear.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
And then my dad goes, nothing like self-congratulatory callbacks.

10:24.000 --> 10:32.000
I'm like, well, my dad is like so hip.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
So at this point, it's important.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
The story happens in layers and it gets a little thick and there's shit to unpack.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
But the first thing I need to do now is bring up the director of great minds with Dan Harmon,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Heath Cullins.

10:45.000 --> 11:00.000
So before we start to unpack this, he's like, I guess the first question is, do you remember

11:00.000 --> 11:08.000
when and why I put your number in my phone as dad?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
He asks everybody.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I forgot.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
For sure.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
No, no, no.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Don't feel bad because he asks everybody this question.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
How many people?

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
I do, in fact, remember.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
I wish it were more tawdry than it actually is.

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
So we, as Dan mentioned, worked on great minds together and it was not the highest of budgeted

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
shows, so we didn't have like VFX for things necessarily other than the really awesome

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
stuff in the lab that I'm sure you all saw.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
But we couldn't burn in the image of dad calling on his cell phone.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
So we had to have, to shoot it, we had to have an actual phone, probably not this one

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
because you have a Tesla now, so you've got a newer phone probably as well.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
The Ron Funches episode, he plays Edie Amin.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And dad had to call.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
And the resolution to the conflict with Edie Amin, who like, it turns into a hostage situation,

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
but then like my dad calls on the phone and Edie Amin enjoys talking to him about politics

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
and they kind of call, I don't know, they call each other down until Edie turns into dust.

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
But so we had to put someone's, we put your phone number in my phone as dad so that when

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
you called me, it would say dad and then I forgot.

12:25.000 --> 12:31.000
But it's notable, the important thing about the story, the absolute tragedy of this story

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
is that it's not just me thinking that I have a new wonderful relationship with my dad.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
And Heath is not trying to deceive me.

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
If you scroll back through this window, there are a half a dozen times over the years where

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
the following conversations happen.

12:52.000 --> 13:01.000
Like, it'll say like, let's see, let's see.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
Thursday, May 10th, 1242 p.m., he texts, congrats on that ginormous renewal.

13:07.000 --> 13:16.000
As recently as the 70 episode thing, I remembered and I say, thanks dad.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
You're still in my phone as dad.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
So I remember and I know.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
So Heath thinks I remember and I know.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
So the really sad part of this, the whole thing that happens that starts on Thursday,

13:31.000 --> 13:38.000
is that I'm thinking I have a new late life friendship with my dad and Heath thinks that

13:38.000 --> 13:46.000
Dan Harmon's being really nice to him.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
So now knowing that it's Heath and that Heath doesn't know I don't know it's my dad and

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
that I don't know it's not my dad.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Let's start just over again and you can read your part and I'll read my part.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
Because then it continues until last night at which point I realized when Cody, I think

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Cody pointed out, no, you did.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Oh, God.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
And then at a certain point I was like, you have to come on the show and we have to share

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
this.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to end to two people.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Okay.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
So yeah, you want to just start with As Your Father.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
As Your Father?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Yeah.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Thursday, 1228 p.m.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
As Your Father, I wanted to text you to tell you how proud of you I am for your Emmy,

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
spelled E-M-M-I-E.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Because I thought that would be more dadlike.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
For your Emmy nomination, for that pickle show you worked so hard on.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
And now I get it, you're acting, you're talking like a dad, but you weren't trying to fool

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
me.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
No.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You were doing the same bit that we kept doing.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Verisimilitude.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I just forgot.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
I just drank that part of the roll of decks away.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
And so I go, dad, thanks, but here's something of even higher value.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
I got a Tesla.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm texting you right now while it drives itself.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
But what about the smudges on the touch screen?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Couldn't you afford the Edison?

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Nothing like self-congratulatory callback.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
Self-congratulatory, because he knows that it's the director of the show that he's referencing.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
So he's not trying to fool me.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
But I'm like, oh my God, I'm texting Cody in the meantime.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I'm like, my dad, look at those, they're sending her screen grabs.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I'm looking, he's making Greek minds references.

15:37.000 --> 15:45.000
So this is on some Make-A-Wish shit.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
So I sent a video of the inside of my Tesla.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
It was a video of just going from the dashboard to the steering wheel, because I wanted to

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
show that it was driving itself, but it doesn't look like any.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
It looks the same as a normal car, because you're just shooting from here.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
You can't tell that it's driving itself.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
And so I just sent an unremarkable video showing that, and I said,

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
I always want to show people a video of me not driving, but the LA cops are too aggressive

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
about pulling over for texting and driving.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
They're not too aggressive.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
I support the law about distracted driving.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
But I just meant they're too aggressive for me to get that video in full.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
I'd have to do so much that I would be distracted driving.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
So then my dad says, I sent a video of me

16:39.000 --> 16:47.000
fakingly self-driving my Hyundai Elantra on the highway, and it says NBD.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
I'm like, oh my God, my dad says NBD.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
My Hyundai can do that too with the video.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
And then he shows a video, and it's like the Hyundai dashboard,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
but then like a crazy camera shake.

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
And the sound of what I thought was my dad doing a crazy character going, oh, God damn it.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
And he was like affecting this fun voice and doing this comedy bit.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
And Heath just pointed out backstage that had I watched the entire video,

17:21.000 --> 17:28.000
which I always stopped, even though I kept showing it to Cody and going, my dad's doing bits.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
It cuts to black because the phone falls down.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
After six seconds of which, Heath picks up the phone, looks into the lens,

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
and goes, whatever, does some self-effacing bit, which I've never seen.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
And so that, if only I had watched the video all the way.

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
Instead, I just text absolutely sincerely, ha ha.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
So then days go by.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
So I walk into Little Dom's the other day.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Last night's, well, Saturday night.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
No, Saturday? Yeah, it says Saturday.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Okay, yes, Saturday night. Two days later.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
I walk into Little Dom's with Cody.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
John Hamm is sitting there.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I'm just going to go ahead.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh wait, who cares?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Wait, whatever.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
He's sitting there with Edgar Wright and...

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Paint the picture. All of them.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
I'm not going to name everybody.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
But like Joaquin Phoenix and like Cicely Tyson.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
It was a table of stars.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
A Batman.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
A table of stars.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Perched in the booth there, not the head, it was just a little booth.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
And it's very clearly Warren Beatty.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
And it's like, ugh.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Like that's famous even for LA.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Crazy famous.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Like legendary icon.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
You don't expect to see Warren.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
You expect to see Quentin Tarantino in a drive-thru

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
or something like the back of his head.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
That's Quentin Tarantino.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Maybe even Harrison Ford.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Like, oh, look, he's jogging.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
You just never expect to see Warren Beatty.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
And I saw him and then...

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
I did what you're supposed to do.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I ignored him and pretended he was a ghost

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
and like talked to John Hamm about, how's business?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Where do you live now?

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Oh, that's a good neighborhood.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
And then we go over to the booth

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
and we're like Cody and I are like, wow, that's pretty neat.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
That's the real deal.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
That's a big deal, like seeing Warren Beatty.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
He didn't really meet him as such.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
I was introduced to him, but this is Warren.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
So I met Warren Beatty.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Technically.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
And also, what more do you need?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
From that exchange, I met Warren Beatty.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
That's peak Warren Beatty relationship, right?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I met him.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I'm not saying there's not more fulfilling things

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
in store for you if you are his neighbor.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I'm just being me.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
What am I going to do with a Warren Beatty friendship?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
I'm like, this is it.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I got to share it with somebody.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
But who do you share it with?

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
I don't want to come off like a star fucker to my LA friends.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
And the truth is, even Cody's a little young to understand

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
what a big deal it is to see Warren Beatty in person.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
Do I have an older friend who's from out of town?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Nope.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Wait a minute.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I think I said it out loud and Cody was like,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
well, your dad's been pretty cool lately.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
So now I text my dad.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But it's not my dad.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
I'm texting Heath Cullen, the director of Great Minds,

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
who thinks he's my friend.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
He has good reason to think that I would just text him

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
the following.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I just met Warren Beatty at a restaurant.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Exclamation point.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
What?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Who are you?

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
1930s Hollywood royalty?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
If I wasn't playing a dad,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I promise I would have come up with something better than that.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
But I was trying to stay in the voice.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
Parentheses, in my mind, he's 120 years old.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Then I said, was it at Chick-fil-A?

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
I heard he loves waffle fries.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
And then meanwhile, I'm trying to take a picture.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Like I'm trying to do a selfie thing,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
because he's in a booth behind us.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I didn't want to be like, I just thought maybe,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
you never know if the camera's on top.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Maybe if I do one of these,

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
maybe you'll see like the top of Warren Beatty's head

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
over me and Cody.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
But it ends up just being a nice selfie of me and Cody.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
And that's fine too.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
And I send it to my dad and I say,

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
this would have been my attempt at a periscope shot, Adam,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
but there's no way.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
So it's just us having met Warren Beatty.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I'll tell you what, man,

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
he looks way older than you.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Because it's important to compliment your dad.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And this is, I feel bad,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
but I'm trying to flatter my dad.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I'm like, he looks like a mummy that went to a barber

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
and said, make my hair look like Warren Beatty.

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
Maybe that's why you don't get to meet people.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
I'm really excited that Dan is texting me these

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
on Saturday night, like, unsolicited, unannounced.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
So I keep playing along.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
So he looks better than I expected.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
But you see, you're not playing my dad at this point, right?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
You're just being Heath.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
You think I know you're Heath.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yes.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah, okay, all right.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I don't want to fuck up the bit.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I thought you were still enjoying that.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Okay, so you...

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
But you knew it was me.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Okay, yeah, okay.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm not going to not, yes, I do.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
So you think I know that it's you.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yes.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
And you think that even though I know it's you,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I'm still treating you like my dad.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
I thought you...

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Okay.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
We're entertained by it.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
And so you say...

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And Cody being there also made me feel that way.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Right.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
Please don't fight, guys.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
So then you say, no, it's your...

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
So I say, so he looks better than I expected is what I ask.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Right.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
And I say, here's the important takeaway.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
You are like three times sexier than Warren Beatty.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
This is how...

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Don't look at me.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
This is how cool a son I would be, by the way.

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
If you just, like, look how low my bar is for a dad.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
Before I open the fucking floodgates.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
And I'm like your pal.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
Like I'm giving you like inside Hollywood shit.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I'm calling you sexier than Warren Beatty.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
Like all you got to do is like congratulate me on an Emmy nomination.

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
And I will be your son every eight hours via text message.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
And yeah, so I say you're three times sexier than Warren Beatty.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
I say, boy, you two look like you have that post Beatty glow though.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Are you both pregnant now?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
He's old but virile.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
This is where it gets really sad to me.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
This is real.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
It takes a turn.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
Because Cody and I are talking the whole time.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
And the conversation isn't about Warren Beatty.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
It's about my dad.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I'm like, okay.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
So then I text, Cody says you and mom should come out to California

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
and we could go to Death Valley with Cody's dad.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
You'd probably like it in the desert.

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
I want to let you all know that you are falling for the same shit.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
What do you mean?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
What are they falling for?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
They're, they're going like, oh, this is.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
No, there was a, there was a, oh, like, oh, he, daddy, oh.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
We all got, we all got wrapped up in this shit.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
It's beautiful, but it's sad.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
But it is beautiful.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
It's, it's sad.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
And it's sad.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
I mean, the beauty, the only, the beauty is only just go in.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
It's a sad balloon.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Maybe it's inflated by beauty.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
Like we blow it up with beauty, but it's a, it's a balloon made of sadness.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, we like to call it the old pistain clown.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
All right.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
So I invite you and mom out to California and you say,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
I'm not sure we can handle the heat.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
It is a dry heat though.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
So now at this point, I'm thinking, am I correct in assuming that maybe you're

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
starting to go, oh shit.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Does he think I'm like, I want to put on it.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
The dad foad dadness of it enough that you're like, ha, ha, fuck you, whatever.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Dry heat.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Oh, he's really going over the top with this dad character.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
But also at this point, and Emma, my wife can attest to this.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
I'm like, oh, he's really like playing, we're like riffing.

26:15.000 --> 26:24.000
And I didn't want to ruin it, but I was also just like, what do I say now?

26:24.000 --> 26:31.000
But and here's the sad part from not this is much sadder, but the sad part from my

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
side is like, I don't want Dan to think now I'm not funny.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
Like that I can't keep it going.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Like a dad would think.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Yeah.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
You'd want to be cool to your kid.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Or also like a son would think to for his, it was.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
That's right.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
This is the whole.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
I'm telling you, it was dynamic.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
It's dynamic.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
What an emptiness here.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
I'm just swooning.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
I just, I go, it's so dry.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
I'm a bigger pussy about heat than you and I was fine.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
It's incredibly quiet and free and you can do whatever you want.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Just a thought.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Cody's dad loves the desert.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
And so Cody kind of grew up going out there with him.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
It was like her Dells.

27:09.000 --> 27:21.000
That's a reference to the Wisconsin Dells where my family would go when I was a kid.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
The next bit require a little context with the brothel thing because.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Yeah.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
I mean, it does.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Because like, like Cody's dad.

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
So I, so I know Cody, Cody, who you all, I'm assuming know since you watch the show

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
and know who she is.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
She's a great writer, wrote a show that I worked on as well.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
That's how I met Dan through directing the show that she wrote.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
One of the things she told me, her dad is very cool, artistic.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
And when she was a youth, they would go to the desert.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
You've learned, heard about that so far.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
But there was a brothel that he went to with her and he was like friends with some of,

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
I don't know what happened there, but they were friends and it would seem sweet.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
And I was like, that's crazy.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Cody.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
And then we would always joke about it.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
And then Cody and her father recently went on a trip out there and the brothel has since

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
closed and he like collected a sign from the exterior of it.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
And it was like sweet, but funny and, and just a cool little side story.

28:16.000 --> 28:23.000
So I text after he suggests we go out there, it's tempting.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
And you know how I feel about brothels.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Does Cody's dad still know a good spot?

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
I know his favorite spot is closed, but maybe you, he and I could find a new one together.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
So then I turned to Cody and go,

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
Did you tell my dad about the brothels?

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
And Cody goes, I don't know, I tell everybody.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
So, so on we go.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
And so I go, I go, we could start one.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I'm going to pitch it to Warren.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Oh, I bet he has some great thoughts on that.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
He'll class up on that.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
I'm going to pitch it to Warren.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Oh, I bet he has some great thoughts on that.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
He'll class up the joint for sure.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
And then, hey Dan, I'm really enjoying our father's son, Rep Arte.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
I just want to make sure you remember this is actually he.

29:22.000 --> 29:36.000
The time stamp on this was 1052 p.m.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
On Saturday night, this started at like 830 p.m.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
That night.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
And so, and so in my next text, I said 1110.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
So that's 18 minutes later.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
And I didn't get anything else done.

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
Like, I just read that and took 18 minutes to respond.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Oh my God.

29:57.000 --> 30:07.000
Somebody just got dad fished.

30:07.000 --> 30:18.000
I wish there was a way to cheer with a rotten tomato.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
You don't like my Steve Harvey line of jokes?

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
They come with a briefcase and a peacock.

30:26.000 --> 30:33.000
You deserve cheer booze for that.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Anyways, oh my God.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
And then, oh my God.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
And then, I just finished explaining this to Cody.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
So that's what the 18 minutes is.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
This is, wow.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
This is really so sad.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
I kept showing messages to Cody and being like, this is so cool.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
I don't know when my dad got so cool.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
And Cody was like, I love your dad.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
I told you he was cool.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And I was like, yeah, but he just seems different.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Like, he's funnier now.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Oh my God.

31:12.000 --> 31:21.000
The darkness of this makes it worth it.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
I had 12 hours of the nicest, closest, most human relationship

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
I've ever had with my dad.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
So Cody says you have to come on Harmontowns

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
and we can explain this whole story and read these texts

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
and walk through it.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
You do understand that I really thought you were my dad

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
the entire time from all the way back to you

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
congratulating me on the Emmy nom.

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
I thought my dad was revealing he watched great minds.

31:48.000 --> 32:01.000
That's about it.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
So many people in the back crying right now.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
It's okay.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
What did you learn about this moment of love?

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
That it was fake?

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
I mean, is there a takeaway from that?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
There is.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
There is.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
There is.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Okay.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
There is because it's clear.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
It's like, oh my God, are we all?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Well, forget we.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I use my I statements.

32:28.000 --> 32:39.000
I am literally one sentence texted away from like reaching out

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
emotionally to my loved ones.

32:42.000 --> 32:50.000
Like lowering my guard of being, you know, like it makes you

32:50.000 --> 32:57.000
wonder how many sentences are we away from just like the flood

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
gates opening with people that don't have, we don't necessarily

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
have a 45 year back story with, but maybe the, you know,

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
what if the postman said, or what if the postman said,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I'm a post lady?

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
What if the, what if the, what if the, what if the,

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
what if your male person, you know, what sentence lies between

33:16.000 --> 33:24.000
you and a friendship with your post deliverer, your aunts,

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
your uncles, your neighbors, your intimate others,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
like how many of us are in relationships where maybe you're

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
in a funk for six months and like what could one of you say

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
that would like break the spell?

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
It's like, and it's, it doesn't even have to be, it's a text.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
What's great is there were, excuse me for this,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
but you were super brave.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
Once somebody leaned out to you, reached out to you,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
you became a whole different motherfucker.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
You got super brave.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
You started sharing, you did all these things.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Brave.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
Is it, is it, is it, is it brave to fawn and be like,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
it's brave to reach out to somebody who might smack your

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
hands and remind you of why you don't.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I don't think my dad to be clear.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
I don't think my dad would, in case this is.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
You're going to take this bravery.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
But I don't think, I mean, I think.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
People just why you don't meet nobody.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
With my family to be clear, and I think this is an important

34:19.000 --> 34:27.000
point to make, like, you know, the, do you need a glad?

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
Can somebody get a heath a glass?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Steve will probably get a cup.

34:33.000 --> 34:40.000
There's a coffee mug that says, world's greatest director.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
You were saying to be clear with your family, there is.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Steve Levy, ladies and gentlemen.

34:47.000 --> 34:53.000
And I think, I don't think there's a lot of, like, harm

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
that could come of a tentacle reaching out, you know, like,

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
like, it's, it's, it's not like.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.000
There's a, there's a wall between, that exists between

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
that happening in real life between me and my dad that's

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
like, doesn't make really any sense.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
That's why, as you can see, as soon as it was perforated,

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
I never, and in spite of all of the signs that should have,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
if I, if I thought I was, like, such an expert on why I

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
don't, like, regularly text my dad, I love you, or something

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
like that, like, if, like, why don't I recognize, why can't

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I tell him from a friend?

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
The answer is because, because I, because I like him.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Right.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Love him, whatever you call it.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
But, but, but, like, my family doesn't, you know, it's,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
like, there's, there's a lot of, like, it's just, it's just,

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
you know, like, a lot of people can relate to this is,

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
like, there's families that are, like, they're, like, they're

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
proactive about, like, you know, this is how I feel about you

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
and I love you and I'm proud of you or whatever.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
And then there's families that are, like, you know, they throw

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
shoes at each other and all this stuff and, like, and then

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
there's, you know, there's probably a good 70% of us,

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
like, somewhere in the middle where we're kind of, like,

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
strained and, like, you don't, I don't know.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Yeah, but in this situation, when it was presented to you,

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
you made the choice to be fucking a bigger, better person

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
than you might normally walk around as.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
That's the only thing that I want to, I get in this argument

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
with my therapist all the time, so maybe I'm doing this thing

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
that she yells at me about, which is, like, but I don't really

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
think I deserve any accolades for my behavior because I wasn't

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
really risking anything.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
In my opinion, maybe you're seeing that differently.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
That's interesting.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
I didn't think about it that way.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
I was just, I think of myself as being the selfish one, too.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Like, it's a two-way street.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
My not, you know, I don't, like, I could text my dad anytime

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
I wanted to go.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
I do it once a year, maybe, like, Father's Day.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
So should I give you the old challenge to say that you should

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
text your dad about the Emmy just to see what this conversation

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
would really look like?

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
Text him, text my dad that I got.

37:00.000 --> 37:07.000
I think he'd be more impressed with the Tesla, you know.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Okay.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Either one.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Either one.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
And we also witnessed somebody fucking being super generous.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Oh, you want me to do it now?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
You do it right now!

37:15.000 --> 37:24.000
Everybody, get out your phones and call someone you love right now.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
I'm also going to need a dollar on each one of those phone calls.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Hi.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
My neighborhood's overrun by racism.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
I just, I also want to say that we got to see somebody be so generous

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
and just keep up a super loving act.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
Which is like, I don't know why this dude asked me to rub his back,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
but I'll rub his back.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
It's kind of the coolest fucking thing in the world.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
I was waiting for Heath to look at his phone and notice that.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Oh, Jesus.

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
I wanted to do the bit and he was like, no, you just did it again.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Oh, that's me.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
All right, all right.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Oh, it didn't go through.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
There's no service here.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Heath, was anybody on your end watching as well?

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
My wife.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Okay.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Did she give you tips at all?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
What was that?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Did she give you tips at all?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
She's funnier than I am.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
I run them by.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I run a lot of them by.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
No, she was the one that finally was like,

38:22.000 --> 38:30.000
are you sure that he doesn't think that you're his dad right now?

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
And I really didn't want to believe that was true.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
But then, I just wanted to think that he and Cody were shooting the shit

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
and getting drunk and were like, we should text Heath a joke.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
That'd be fun.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
It's like, I'm only doing this to, yes, and the suggestion.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I think it's kind of a douchey thing to text your dad

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
that you got nominated for an Emmy.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
I find that to be not like.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Here's the thing.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Last week you said, I'm happy.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Right.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Right.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
So like there's steps to being happy.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Right.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
And one of the fucking steps is to celebrate the good shit.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
By bragging to your dad.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Your dad, it's not bragging when it's to your parents.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
They're proud of you for fucking wiping your own ass one day.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
They're like, I did that.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I won that Emmy.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
I'm like, I made that.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Yeah.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
I mean, I want to say that's not how my family works.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
I believe it.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
But then you'd say, oh, this is the problem.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Is you thinking that?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
I'm not going to judge you.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
You can do whatever you want to do.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
I mean, don't you think it would be better to say like, how's your boat?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Go get that shit.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Like to ask him something.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Go get that thing you wanted.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I don't want nothing.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
I don't want nothing.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Yeah, you do.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Go get that thing you wanted.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
Okay, I got busted kind of wanting something during this story, didn't I?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
So that's the key.

39:44.000 --> 39:50.000
If you're 45 years old and your weekend can be eclipsed and derailed by an accidental

39:50.000 --> 39:57.000
radar ping that makes you think your dad loves you for a second, then you don't have a right

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
to be like, I don't need nothing from nobody.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
You should reach out to your dad.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
And since you're clearly still in childhood with that relationship, you may as well say,

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
I made a poopoo in the Emmy potty.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Okay.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
All right.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Now I see the logic of it.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Okay.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
My show got nominated for an Emmy exclamation point.

40:23.000 --> 40:32.000
I mean, it's by the way, it's midnight in Florida, so he'll love that.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
Because he's been asleep for six hours, so he's probably getting ready to get up.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Leave a voicemail.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Leave a voicemail.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
It's also not going to, what's that?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Leave a voicemail.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
No, come on.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Stop it.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
No.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
No, no, no.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
That's a deal breaker.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
No, I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure 40% of my divorce with McGathey was like my inability

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
to FaceTime.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
Like, come on.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
I'm allowed to be part of society because of the invention of text messaging.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Like, I don't do the phone.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Okay.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
So, yeah, I sent it and there you go.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
It went through.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Yeah.

41:14.000 --> 41:21.000
But I'm telling you, I'm telling you, like, it's, come on.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
It's, I'm already the obnoxious Hollywood son.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
Like, I really don't think, I think he's going to be like, he'll make a joke.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
He'll say like, ah, don't get AIDS from it or something.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I don't know.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Now I can capture his voice.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Now I'm ready.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Next round when you forget again.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I really got his voice now.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
It's AIDS jokes, that's all right.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
That's the rock I needed to overturn.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
When you make jokes around your family, do they still laugh or do they roll their eyes

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
and laugh?

41:55.000 --> 42:03.000
I don't think, I don't know if I get, my family, my family, my mom and dad, like, if they're

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
laughing, like, we'll laugh together at something.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Like, if, you know, something funny happens.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Like, I'm not, like, making anybody laugh.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Do you point it out, though, first or is that in the jeep?

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Point out what?

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Like, whatever happened.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
If somebody fell in front of you guys, who's going to fire first?

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
It's kind of like my dad.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
I think my dad's kind of in charge of when everyone starts laughing.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
Because, like, he's not, you know, like, he's not on board.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Everything's going to just, like, sink anyway, you know?

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
Like, you could do all the jokes you wanted, but then, you know, like, it's funny.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
It's more fun if my dad's, like, in the picture.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
You feel like that dude sort of has to bring you on stage a little bit because it's his

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
house?

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
My dad was super funny, too.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
That's why I asked.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
I was like, you know, you have the first clown you see as your dad, really.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
He takes these big risks in front of you and you're like, all right, let's see.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
And there's this thing about puberty where you're like, I hope I'm as witty as that individual.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
I want to smack him.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
With my father, it was fake cursing from Johnny dangerously.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
So I'd be at the table and I'd be like, you Fargan Eisberg?

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
Or I'd give him this finger and he'd be like, okay.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
Okay, Brandon, very funny.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
I felt like when I hit puberty, like, when you said those glands start overacting, like,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
yeah, I look back with kind of shame on that.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
I was like bouncing off the walls and, like, trying to be funny.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
And I don't think my dad was probably very incredibly entertained by it.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I think he was sort of confused.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
You know, it was like, like, bemused.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Like, he'd be like, what the f...

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
All right.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
But then you killed him because we all know when you're a professional, there is a moment

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
where you've made your family laugh in a way that you didn't before.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
You know what I mean?

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
Like, you use all the shit you've learned sort of to come home and be like, this is fucking funny.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
You can't debate that.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
So do you remember the moment when you said something funny to your father and you were

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
like, I got you, old motherfucker?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
No.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
No.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
No.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
I used to...

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
When I was a real little kid, I would do like little shows.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Right.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
And I would like...

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Because I just like the...

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
You know, like everyone...

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
You'd force people to gather around and you would do...

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
I would do like magic tricks and like Carson bits that I didn't understand.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
And it was like, yeah, I wanted the attention and I wanted to be funny, but...

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
And yeah, I didn't understand what humor was.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
You know, my dad was the funny one.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
My dad was the one that made everybody laugh.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Like he would...

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
My dad would read towards the night before Christmas.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
And then he'd do like commentary on it.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
Like he'd be like...

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
And then I'd put his finger on his nose and it would shot up the chimney.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I don't know how he got up the goddamn chimney.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
He's so fat, you know?

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Suddenly he'd just make comments.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
I'm making him sound a little lammer than he is.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
But it would be like little comments.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
And then I remember being like at a certain age, like that puberty age.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Like I remember like, now I want to do it.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
I want to do it.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
Like after my dad just killed and it was like we could have moved on to have hot cocoa

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
and fucking put in a happy family.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
But I was like, now me, now me.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
And like 11, you know, like a fucking adult basically.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
I'm like as big as a golden retriever.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
Like hard to hit with a whip, you know?

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
And then I'm like, everybody.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
And then I kind of made everybody like, now me.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
And I like went through it and made my own comments.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
Like, oh boy, how do you get his fat butt up the chimney?

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
And I remember just thinking of my dad being like, what?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
He's just my bits.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
Like I remember him like, I remember him calling it out and being like,

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
you're just doing that.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
I already did that bit.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
He didn't call it a bit, but he was like, man, I just did that.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Yeah.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
I was kind of associated comedy with like a thing that I wished I could do.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I never really saw myself as a...

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Other people would be laughing.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Like when I went to school, like then after a certain point,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
then people are like, you're so funny.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
And I'd be like, oh shit, fuck.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Classroom or cafeteria?

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Playground?

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
What was your stage?

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
Well, starting with just like, like two nerds in the back of the room

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
because I was a nerd.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
So I wasn't going to make anybody laugh.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Like I was like, just right in the back corner and the English class

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
like mutter under my breath and be like, man, this is stupid.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
And then like the kid next to me who was also a nerd and crammed back there

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
and be like, that was funny.

46:32.000 --> 46:39.000
And then that kid started a comedy sports team at my high school.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
And then I got into like drama and improv and forensics and all that stuff

46:44.000 --> 46:49.000
and got a little more training in like, yeah, just honestly,

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
just hit the back wall with your voice and just keep talking

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
even if you don't have anything to say.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
And just kind of exercise it.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
And then we would do stuff and then the school would come

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
and then strangers like in the school were like, oh, you're funny.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
You should be on Saturday Night Live.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
And I'd be like, you didn't know what you're talking about.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
You're dumb.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
But this feels like power to me.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
So I'll take it.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Yeah.

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
And yeah, that's the story of becoming funny.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
But never, never, my dad never was like, this guy's hilarious.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Yeah.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Yeah.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
And I think that might be important, right?

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Like the same with your dad.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
You're kind of like, he was like a heckler almost like or like an unbeatable like.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
You know, it is, I think so your dad's side of the family is funny.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
I take it.

47:36.000 --> 47:49.000
Funny year than my mom's side at the risk of offending a bunch of very unfunny people.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
I've talked about my great-grandma Boucher who's now who's now passed.

47:53.000 --> 48:02.000
I mean, she was funny in the sense that she was a probably a murderer and and also like

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
several people attempted to murder her and she survived.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
That's funny because she was really old.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
Like when she got her throat slashed and she walked to the hospital with a towel wrapped

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
around her neck.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
I mean, funny, like weird.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Yeah.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
But no, not a lot of humorists on that side.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Yeah.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
So when you met with, when you would hang out with like, do you ever hang out with your

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
uncles on your dad's side?

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
When those guys got around, there is a potential joke circle because he's got the funny gene,

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
right?

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Am I right about that?

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
Were his brothers just like little, we're not funny.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
He's funny.

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
My dad's sister, half sister, you know, she's very jocular, very funny, like, like very

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
outgoing.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
What's your bit?

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
You got a bit?

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
What's that?

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Do you know a bit?

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
She does?

48:45.000 --> 48:50.000
No, I just mean, you know, gregarious, like, like just, just having fun, you know, like,

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
like, like at the party, like, like, like if something, if there's something fun to happen,

48:55.000 --> 48:59.400
like, you know, yes, ending it and being fun and going with the flow about the funny stuff

48:59.400 --> 49:04.000
and not being like a passive aggressive kind of like threshold guardian about crazy craziness

49:04.000 --> 49:07.400
just like moving with it and being like, that's funny.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.400
Like she's not going to turn the room down.

49:09.400 --> 49:10.400
She's going to keep it going.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.400
Right.

49:11.400 --> 49:15.800
I just wonder, because when you, you know, to answer your question about your dad is

49:15.800 --> 49:20.400
if he comes from funny people too, it's even more daunting when you're in a family situation

49:20.400 --> 49:22.160
to chip at the throne.

49:22.160 --> 49:26.200
So like, thanksgivings and Christmases, you're trying to get in there and sort of do your

49:26.200 --> 49:27.200
material.

49:27.200 --> 49:31.200
But you also have this dude who is now surrounded by his team.

49:31.200 --> 49:35.760
Was that anything, you know, now, I think, I think, I think with my dad at the risk of

49:35.760 --> 49:40.120
talking out of school or whatever, like, because I don't really know that much about the family

49:40.120 --> 49:41.720
tree as it goes back beyond that.

49:41.720 --> 49:47.360
But I get the impression that my dad and his siblings, like, they all have one thing in

49:47.360 --> 49:48.360
common.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.760
Like some of them are crazier than others.

49:49.760 --> 49:54.000
Some of them are like more fun than others or whatever, but all of them are kind of like,

49:54.000 --> 50:00.960
I think there was a lot of trauma and anxiety, and I think they all dealt with it by like

50:00.960 --> 50:09.160
really chesting up and like being like either incredibly cynical or incredibly like gregarious

50:09.160 --> 50:14.320
and in any case, like, not going gentle into that good night and just being like more kind

50:14.320 --> 50:21.000
of like, like, is that all you got, God, like, fuck it, like, I think that's funny then kind

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
of thing.

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
Like, I don't think there was anybody hilarious over them.

50:26.000 --> 50:33.080
I think quite the opposite, I get the impression that there was like bad people going up that

50:33.080 --> 50:37.480
chain and that that's why they're like kind of like, you know, I can take a punch kind

50:37.480 --> 50:38.480
of funny.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.480
Yeah.

50:39.480 --> 50:40.480
Literally.

50:40.480 --> 50:44.800
What about you, Heath?

50:44.800 --> 50:45.800
What about me, Dan?

50:45.800 --> 50:49.120
Heath, who are you and your family, where do you fall in terms of funny?

50:49.120 --> 50:51.000
When did you become filled with toffee?

50:51.000 --> 50:56.560
Well, Dan, never, never heard that before.

50:56.560 --> 50:57.560
Never.

50:57.560 --> 50:58.560
You never.

50:58.560 --> 50:59.560
Candy bar.

50:59.560 --> 51:00.560
I don't have an answer about that.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.560
I mean, candy bar comments.

51:01.560 --> 51:03.360
It's the first time ever to hear that.

51:03.360 --> 51:04.880
Are you siblings?

51:04.880 --> 51:11.320
Uh, two older, I'm nine years older than my brother, 11 years, I mean, nine years younger

51:11.320 --> 51:13.960
than my brother, 11 years younger than my sister.

51:13.960 --> 51:19.360
Uh, definitely the funniest one in the family, but that was not saying much.

51:19.360 --> 51:20.520
Can you fuck them up at will?

51:20.520 --> 51:21.520
Yeah.

51:21.520 --> 51:22.520
Yeah.

51:22.520 --> 51:23.520
Yeah.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.520
Yeah.

51:24.520 --> 51:25.520
You're certainly the funniest one in my family.

51:25.520 --> 51:26.520
Yeah.

51:26.520 --> 51:27.520
I am.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.520
I am.

51:28.520 --> 51:39.040
Um, so my dad's funny, but it's like, nah, it's sarcasm, like mean, like, um, my brother

51:39.040 --> 51:43.000
and sister were two years apart, so they would fight a lot, like, you know, four-year-old

51:43.000 --> 51:47.240
and six-year-old or three-year-old and five-year-old fight, like that kind of bullshit.

51:47.240 --> 51:52.720
And um, there was a Siberian husky dog, I was yet to be born, and my sister was calling

51:52.720 --> 51:55.760
my brother a butthole, and my dad was like, that is not a thing.

51:55.760 --> 51:56.760
You don't use that word.

51:56.760 --> 51:57.760
Don't use that word.

51:57.760 --> 52:01.680
And he finally picked up the dog ass end and like lifted its tail up and was like, that's

52:01.680 --> 52:02.680
what you're calling your brother.

52:02.680 --> 52:03.680
Is that a nice thing?

52:03.680 --> 52:05.760
That's a real pretty thing, isn't it?

52:05.760 --> 52:08.960
Um, and that, that, that put an end to all of it.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.360
That put all into the buttholes.

52:10.360 --> 52:13.800
All you needed to do is see a real, pretty asshole.

52:13.800 --> 52:18.080
Yeah, uh, that's real pretty, isn't it?

52:18.080 --> 52:19.680
That's real pretty, isn't it?

52:19.680 --> 52:25.840
It would be like that kind of, um, I do have one, I do have a second.

52:25.840 --> 52:29.680
What was the thing about the hose, I remember something about the hose and mud or something

52:29.680 --> 52:30.680
like that.

52:30.680 --> 52:33.920
No, no, no, it was dog shit and, and, and throwing it, oh, so this was the story I was

52:33.920 --> 52:42.400
going to, yeah, so, so now we, I'm now born, seven, nine, I don't know, uh, and we have

52:42.400 --> 52:47.280
a dog and, uh, I had to clean up his shit was the job that I had to like scoop it, put

52:47.280 --> 52:51.600
it in a bucket and then throw it in the trash and we had a fence in the backyard and I figured

52:51.600 --> 52:55.920
out like a lot faster to just throw it right over the fence and to just a field, it was

52:55.920 --> 52:58.200
just a field, it wasn't someone else's yard.

52:58.200 --> 53:04.160
So my dad's over in one part of the yard, gardening, and, uh, I'm scooping the shit

53:04.160 --> 53:08.600
and I'm like, I'm just chucking it, chucking it, like hard white, hard, hard, like, oh,

53:08.600 --> 53:10.280
that's white and chalky, gonna fly.

53:10.280 --> 53:16.840
So dark, like fine, and then I get to one that's fresh and not solid and doesn't have

53:16.840 --> 53:18.440
the density to clear the fence.

53:18.440 --> 53:28.440
And so it just like, across the fence and I froze and my dad's like on the, on his knees

53:28.440 --> 53:45.800
like with a trowel and I see him freeze, oh, that's great.

53:45.800 --> 53:46.800
That's great.

53:46.800 --> 53:47.800
That's a work of art.

53:47.800 --> 53:53.080
I don't know why I'm so glad you didn't do it the way I told you to do it.

53:53.080 --> 53:54.080
That is it.

53:54.080 --> 54:00.800
That is it God, honey, honey, get a marker, we got a Picasso and just like fucking paraded

54:00.800 --> 54:08.400
my eight year old self with this just blistering, like it would have hurt less if it were an

54:08.400 --> 54:11.440
actual pull a switch kind of thing.

54:11.440 --> 54:14.200
It was an emotional switch.

54:14.200 --> 54:20.920
You guys have any real early memories of straight up eating cat shit out of a cat litter box?

54:20.920 --> 54:25.680
I swear to God, I remember, I have this like the biggest memory of being like under the

54:25.680 --> 54:33.040
stairs playing and what I thought was like another sandbox with like a brown car and

54:33.040 --> 54:41.800
like and the reason I remember it was like someone, either my brother or somebody coming

54:41.800 --> 54:50.720
up like, what the fuck are you doing and like I'm playing in the sandbar probably smoking

54:50.720 --> 54:58.920
it like a cigar and like everyone like the family meeting, like I don't remember like

54:58.920 --> 55:03.320
anybody grabbing me and going, come on, it was just more like everyone get over here

55:03.320 --> 55:04.320
and watch Danny shit.

55:04.320 --> 55:07.840
Because it was probably time to argue about whose fault it was that this happened, you

55:07.840 --> 55:15.560
know, like who's supposed to be watching Daniel, he is in the fucking cat shit eating it.

55:15.560 --> 55:21.480
That's not where shit eating came in, Pickle Rick, is it?

55:21.480 --> 55:27.080
Is that like, was that like a memory that found its way?

55:27.080 --> 55:31.280
Because isn't that what the psychiatrist, it's family therapy and shit eating?

55:31.280 --> 55:37.800
Oh, okay, I mean, I don't know, I mean, I ate shit once when I was a kid.

55:37.800 --> 55:47.800
Did you, did you, did you have a cat?

55:47.800 --> 55:48.800
Three.

55:48.800 --> 55:54.600
Spencer, did you ever eat cat turds?

55:54.600 --> 56:01.120
I feel like, I don't know, I feel like that like someone of the kids, like my parents

56:01.120 --> 56:06.320
told stories about that and I don't know, I remember being in a bathtub and my brother

56:06.320 --> 56:11.440
pissing into my mouth.

56:11.440 --> 56:15.240
Not really consensually, but, yeah.

56:15.240 --> 56:21.320
Please join us on this very special family episode of Hotter Town Jesus, Jesus.

56:21.320 --> 56:30.160
Was it, was it, was it like, was it, were you going, stop, don't, or was he like, were

56:30.160 --> 56:31.360
you so young that he was like, open your mouth.

56:31.360 --> 56:36.280
I was going, stop, don't because I was taking a bath and I did not want the bathtub to be

56:36.280 --> 56:38.640
urinated in.

56:38.640 --> 56:42.480
I wasn't even thinking that it might go into my mouth.

56:42.480 --> 56:50.400
I just already saw that trouble was a Bruin, but, yeah, no, he pissed in my mouth and I

56:50.400 --> 56:55.800
just, I remember and I can't not remember, but my parents told me because it's the funniest

56:55.800 --> 57:02.440
thing to them and yeah, it's probably funny, but like, I was like, it's, it's warm and

57:02.440 --> 57:10.040
it's sour and it's real bitter, just like, just live commentating the experience.

57:10.040 --> 57:13.280
Like I stopped screaming to, to commentate.

57:13.280 --> 57:17.120
I, I demand a boycott.

57:17.120 --> 57:19.640
That happened.

57:19.640 --> 57:25.280
Hashtag peeing in my mouth is over party.

57:25.280 --> 57:26.920
Was there any sort of payback?

57:26.920 --> 57:30.320
No, I was a good person.

57:30.320 --> 57:35.440
I didn't pee in things that, you know, would cause problems for people.

57:35.440 --> 57:37.680
It was great.

57:37.680 --> 57:45.520
I cut the tail off of one of my, like a rubber whale toy that my brother turned out to have

57:45.520 --> 57:50.400
a lot of affection for, I remember that, but I think it's because, and I think I was just

57:50.400 --> 57:55.520
a kid, I was so young that I was just like playing with scissors and was, I didn't understand

57:55.520 --> 57:56.520
permanence or anything.

57:56.520 --> 57:57.520
Right.

57:57.520 --> 58:03.320
Like this rubber thing and then my, but I remember my brother like revealing how valuable

58:03.320 --> 58:10.320
that rubber whale was and I, and I remember thinking like, fuck you, a rubber whale.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.840
That's like your thing.

58:11.840 --> 58:12.840
Like this is your thing.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.840
Spider-Man's your thing, motherfucker.

58:14.840 --> 58:20.200
I know because I cut his head off.

58:20.200 --> 58:24.280
But I had to, yeah, it had to be hard to have a little brother like, you know, I'm sure

58:24.280 --> 58:25.280
it can't be.

58:25.280 --> 58:26.280
It's not easy.

58:26.280 --> 58:28.320
You know, like siblings don't have to fight and stuff.

58:28.320 --> 58:35.440
Like Cody's sister, she's got two kids and like, I've been listening to these books about

58:35.440 --> 58:40.840
optimism and happiness and how, like, because, you know, my therapist told me, okay, so you're

58:40.840 --> 58:43.120
happy now, maybe.

58:43.120 --> 58:46.080
So maybe are you going to drink yourself to death or are you going to be actually, you

58:46.080 --> 58:47.080
are going to have a good life?

58:47.080 --> 58:52.560
And part of it is like, I don't, there's a, and I think this is endemic to our society,

58:52.560 --> 58:57.680
which is kind of a nice thing about us, but we think happiness is like, well, there's

58:57.680 --> 59:01.920
got to be, you know, we're cynical about it, which, you know, is not to say that, oh, everyone

59:01.920 --> 59:06.840
should be happy, but it's like we have an attitude about happiness where we're like,

59:06.840 --> 59:14.800
if it's, if something seems happy, then you got to, it's more real to get to the unhappiness

59:14.800 --> 59:21.960
underneath it, like the, we just sort of, it's sort of built into us to think that tragedy

59:21.960 --> 59:28.120
is reality because, makes sense, life ends in death and then comedy is fake, happiness

59:28.120 --> 59:29.840
is fake.

59:29.840 --> 59:33.480
This is a popular opinion now among our little Nazi friends.

59:33.480 --> 59:38.560
They have this virtue signaling like phrase that they use if you're trying to help somebody

59:38.560 --> 59:43.600
out or just say a nice thing or a supportive thing or an anti-fascist thing.

59:43.600 --> 59:49.720
It's like, oh, you're virtue signaling because the idea is if you're positive about something,

59:49.720 --> 59:55.000
if you're hopeful or optimistic or called to action, then you're, there's a fake reason

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
for it.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.760
We even like mythologize our cultures like artists and pioneers.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:09.200
We say things like, oh, so and so invented this and that, and then their biography will

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:15.280
come out and it'll say, which means he must've really wanted his father's approval.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:21.640
We love getting to the bottom of the stuff and making it more gritty and dirty and real.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.120
Otherwise, we don't believe it's real.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:30.600
And so, you sign a deal to do 70 episodes of your favorite show, if you've been waiting

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.640
for a really long time to have job security, there's like a little bit of an obstacle

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.800
you hit there where you're like, okay, so I have everything I've ever wanted, okay,

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.520
so now I'm hitting like a vapor lock here, I'm like, well, then what's wrong?

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.640
Well, Nazis are taking over America, that helps.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:55.000
This is fitting, this makes sense to me, like God would do this to me, or I can always just

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.400
find a lump in my, you know, wherever, like that'll happen or, you know, we can't control

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400
that.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.360
You start dwelling on that stuff, you're like, I swear every time my agents or lawyers

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.760
are on the phone now, I used to get excited and now I'm like, oh God, wow.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:13.600
Okay, here it is, here it is, here I'm going to find out that I hit a baby with my car

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.560
or something, like I don't know about it, they found it in the bumper.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:23.440
I wish I had reps that cared that much.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.400
Or they're just going to be like, oh, we're going over this contract that we're still

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.400
working on for Rick and Morty.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:34.480
Did you know that the guy that you were talking to on the phone the whole time escaped from

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.480
an asylum?

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.000
Like, just some shoo will drop.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It was just me.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
It was just me.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
It was just me.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.120
Did you have Heath in your phone as Mike Lasso, Cartoon Network?

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.680
It's going to be a sweet contract, don't worry.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.640
But there's an, I'm reading this book, like, I'll be with this guy, I don't know if I,

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.640
you know.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.960
It's true that if I remove the threat, not I, if you remove the threat, people will

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.600
find another threat because it's part of our wiring.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.720
I should give some credit where it's due in case anybody wanted to, you know, it's like

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720
a short book.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:11.960
And there's this thing called Authentic Happiness, who's it by, this guy, Seligman, Martin Seligman.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.760
He's like a guy that was like, it's like, like, like, there was a, there was a turning

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:20.040
point in the psychology industry where I think it was this guy, Seligman, I think, or, or

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.160
maybe there's some other guy, but who cares.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:29.360
There was some guy that was like sort of like famous for standing up at a big seminar for

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.200
all the shrinks in the world.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:37.240
Like they would always have their big organizations and this guy got up one year and said, look,

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.640
we've gotten really good at diagnosing mental illness.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.680
We've gotten really good at, we're doing great business, like, the world is crazier than

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680
ever.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680
Yeah.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:54.240
It doesn't mean we're fucking up, like, like our, if we all bought into the myth that, that,

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.400
that happiness is impossible, like, are we also fucking miserable?

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.520
And I was like, are we not supposed to be making people happy?

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.520
We have cured nothing.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.520
Yeah.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.520
And we've, we're not doing anything.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.400
Like if we were real, if we, if, if, if, if being sad was a broken arm, we would be

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.200
the worst medical industry in the history of culture.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.200
And people are like, boo, you suck.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.320
And he's like, see, that just missed my point.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320
No.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320
I'm kidding.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.920
I don't think anything that interesting ever happens in a psychology seminar, but, but,

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.400
but he kind of, he made waves, you know, and I'm sure by waves, I mean, like a bunch

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:31.160
of people tenting their fingers and percing their lips and like writing, scribbling marks

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.440
down hoping that he'll get insecure.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.600
But he was, he was, he was, he, he then that sparked this kind of wave of psychotherapy

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.160
that was like, what if our, what if our goal was happiness?

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.720
What if we just experimented with that?

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.800
And I think that's where cognitive behavioral therapy comes in and stuff like, is this working

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.800
for you?

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.120
If not, you know, changing all that crap.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.120
It's interesting.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:58.280
And I already like took some weight off my shoulders where they get, there's like, like,

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:05.960
like the idea of like, like, you know, like, like happiness is a, yeah, it's a privilege.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.120
It's like a good thing that you have it.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:15.120
But like, if you have more of it than your immediate surroundings, you, it's not necessarily

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.840
because something unfair is happening.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:23.280
It's you're lucky, but you're not necessarily, it's not necessarily because you're rich,

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.320
for instance, because it's just all this science that goes into it, like, like, like, like,

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.200
oh, who's happier rich people or poor people?

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.440
It's like, yeah, they're, they, they even have who, then there's like these weird kind

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.960
of differences, like as much as I'm sure scientists didn't want this data to come in

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.960
this way.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.360
The truth is people that have a religion, they, they're, they're a little happier.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.720
They live a little longer, I think, and they, they're a little happier data.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.720
You collect it.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:57.760
There's not enough of a difference that we should all run out and join a cult.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.560
There's like, there's like strange, what you'd think is almost arbitrary, like, things.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:06.320
And then there's all these other factors that you would assume are like, oh, well, that

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320
would affect your happiness.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.600
And it's like, no, that's, that's nothing.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600
That's negligible.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:16.040
And then there's, but I just like hearing it broken down to numbers because it demystifies

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.040
it.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040
Like, I have this religious fear of being happy.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:24.760
I really think that if I'm over 50% happy, and I took this, I took this online thing,

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.760
I got my happiness index is 3.12.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.240
Donald McDonald's survey.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.880
Who was the, what was, who did this survey?

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.880
Do you know?

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.680
It's like something on the site that goes with this book.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.840
It's like, they kind of, you can go there and you can like, you just fill in a couple

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840
of questions in there.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:47.560
They're kind of taking your data because they want like more data from, but it's like between

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.840
zero and five, I'm like 3.12.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.920
It's like all the bar, it's like, oh, uh, how much happier are you than people that are

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920
your age?

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:59.320
It's a 50% people in your income, 50% people, your gender, 50.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.960
I'm like right in the middle.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960
Now, okay.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.960
It's the three I was going to ask you is the three on the good leading side or the bad

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960
leading side?

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960
I assume the good.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960
Yeah.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.960
Okay.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.960
Yeah.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960
Yeah.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960
I don't think it's star meter.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960
I don't think it's like, it's all.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.800
Yeah, but it's like, it is fascinating because we're trying to figure out how much of it

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.560
we should actually have in order to keep going.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.320
So I think people study their happiness and depression because they really want to relate.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.560
How much can I accomplish?

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.960
Oh, and here's a, here's a really interesting about happiness.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.760
Like everybody that you ask, like, do you want to be happy?

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.960
Obviously the answer is yes.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:39.520
Only one idiot would say no, but, but everybody that you ask, uh, if I were to give you a

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:44.400
magic wand that you could point at your head and make yourself happy, would you, everyone

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.400
starts arguing.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.320
Like everyone's like, well, no, no, not like that.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.800
It's really interesting.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.640
People don't just want to be happy.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.960
People want, people want gratification.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.480
They want to earn their happiness.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:03.240
They want to feel accomplishment, which is where the, uh, uh, it makes all these scientific

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:08.120
cases for like anthropologically, like why happiness, which has long since been dismissed

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:13.480
as like just a byproduct of emotional thinking that we need to feel anger and we need to

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.160
feel fear in order to survive.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.680
You need to be like, oh, shit, there's a leopard of, you know, like I'm mad at you for taking

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.180
my banana.

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:25.160
And, and, and then happiness is just like, oh, no one's taking my banana right now and

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.880
there's no lion, but it's like, he's made, he makes the case that no, happiness is like

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880
the thing.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.960
It's like, because it makes you, I can't even, I wouldn't do a good job of selling it,

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.800
but it's like, you hear it and you go, shit, this could be scientific.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:43.520
You could be like Asperger's about being happy, like being, being like, like, like into it.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.920
You could, you could, you could, you could turn being happy into Minecraft.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.640
You could like try to knock it out, you know, like organize it and like do it right.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.840
And you wouldn't be cheating.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.280
You wouldn't be like, you know, destined to, to have an anvil fall on your head.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.480
And, and, and, and that, and that, like a mountain climber, like, like she talks about

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.080
the difference between pleasure and, and, and gratitude and gratification.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:10.280
So we're like, like a mountain climber is like, is, is, is happy because they're like,

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.480
they're climbing a mountain, but it's fucking hard.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.520
And then like, there's a point where they're like, going to fall off the mountain.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.800
And they, they're, they're not dumb.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.560
They wouldn't be like, I hope I fall off this mountain.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.160
They're like, I hope I don't.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:28.200
And I wish I, I wish I, I wish this rope was working better or whatever, you know, like

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.480
they can have regrets about their situation and wish that it would, and hope that it like

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.740
goes better.

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.280
But that's different from being like, I wish I'd never climbed this mountain.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.480
I mean, they knew climbing a mountain is a bunch of fucking hard work.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:44.960
And they chose to like, but they, they were pursuing this like happiness high that they

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.640
knew would only come if they like, if they did all this shit that was hard.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.200
And there's a big difference between like, well, for instance, playing Minecraft, which

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.200
isn't hard.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.080
It's like a comfort thing for me or like eating a Twinkie or, you know, like just, there's

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.960
nothing wrong with like pleasuring yourself, but you, but pleasure is just like, we feel,

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.600
we feel like it's fake.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.400
We don't feel gratified by it.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.920
Your mountain analogy is the same sort of money where people work really, really hard

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.760
to get a ton of money and then get a ton of things, big houses and a lot of grounds.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:19.000
And they're still not happy because it's the difference right between gratification and

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
actually being satisfied.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Yeah.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
There's all this.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It's an interesting read.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.160
I mean, I got the book on tape and I only listened to it.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.160
It was like a couple hours.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.720
And at the end I was like, that's it.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720
Fuck this book.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:36.440
But, but, but the first half I thought was really interesting and throw a lot of science

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440
at you.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.440
It might, if it helps demystify, I think we get, I think smart people get in a funk

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.480
about, about, about happiness and then we, we, we are suspicious of it.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.920
There is this thing that we take it for granted the way we take for granted that rich kids

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.240
don't have a hard time growing up with money.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.840
So we just sort of assume that if your parents had money and you have money, you know how

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.840
to keep it, you know how to make it, you know how to earn it, you know how to value

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840
of it.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.840
That's true.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.840
There should be sort of a course.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.320
And there's no question that, you know, people who, if you want to be unhappy and you want

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:10.400
to hit all the points that make people scientifically less happy, one of the top things is live in

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.680
an autocratic third world like country that where, where like you have no freedom and

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.880
like there's, there's less nutrition and there's less, less like wealth and there's

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.240
less like, there's more, like those people are made unhappy by that environment.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:31.240
So it's not, it's like poverty does make you unhappy because you're being deprived of fucking

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.880
shit that an ape would have in the wild.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:41.480
I mean, you're being deprived of like really like minimum levels of like comfort and emotional

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.480
comfort.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.720
Like, like, do I belong in this family of apes like to like, are these people cool with me?

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.720
If you're sleeping on a sidewalk, you're like more bummed out.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.120
So, so, you know, I thought there was that documentary is like, yeah, it tops out like

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.360
the way the guy says it is like, if you, if you could afford this book, you've, you've,

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.240
you've, you're past the threshold where money affects your happiness.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:06.400
Like you're, you're, you're, you're, it's, it only works to a, to like 70 grand a year

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400
or something.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.400
Uh, anyways, go fuck yourself, everybody.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.480
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.560
And then he talks about how to, how to be happy in relationships and have kids and stuff

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560
or whatever.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.760
Like, I guess your kid, I guess your kids, you're supposed to like, let them do shit

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.320
and like not yell at them and stuff like, uh, but, and, and I would normally not believe

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.320
it.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.640
Like the way he talks about kids, but I said, like Cody's sister, like, like, I, everything

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.520
I hear the guy saying, I'm like, oh, that's how your sister, that's how she's raising

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.520
her kids.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.880
That's why they're like, and then the sibling rivalry thing, which we take for granted,

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.760
we think that siblings are supposed to like resent each other.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.520
And, but it's not really a, it's not a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.400
a pervasive thing, but it's not, it's not a natural thing.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.880
It's not necessary.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.880
What?

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.880
What is it?

01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880
What?

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880
Oh man.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.280
You don't have to like be mad at your brothers and sisters just because they're older or

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280
younger than you.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.520
Like that's, it's not, it's not, it's not a thing that just happens like because you're

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520
babies.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520
What?

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520
Why does it happen?

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:17.320
It happens because there's like, I hate to throw 90% of American families under the

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.480
bus, but it happens because it happens because of a trickle down of like a culture of like,

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.000
the parents expect it to happen.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.640
Like a, like a, be nice to your sister.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.440
Like it's just that everything is like, it's not based on, on, on.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.480
They're setting norms that it's normal for them to fight like that.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.480
And so they're taking it.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.480
They create a share.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480
And I don't know.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.680
It just, it just has everything to do with like the nuances of like, are you, are you

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.000
projecting onto your kids?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.320
Like they're going to pick up from you.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.320
Right.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.720
Like, oh, I'm like a hockey team and my sister's like a different hockey team.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:50.000
Like they just, you just, you, you put it onto them on accident because you learned it

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
that way.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Like it's cause we're close.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
We're all in the same car.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
We're all in the same house.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
We're going to fight.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It's just how it gets out.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Yeah.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I would have thought so too.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.280
I mean, and, and, and you know, it's not like unhappiness is a myth.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.440
It's not like it doesn't fall out of trees and stuff, but like I, it is comforting to

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.600
feel like, oh yeah, but happiness is like kind of, it's easier for some people than others.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.640
And then like some people have to work for it a little bit more, but it's like a thing

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:19.280
that you could just decide to be kind of like, that sounds, that sounds very naive and privileged.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:22.840
That's, that's, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's not, it's not because there's

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.000
this thing that says like, you know, you can decide when you want to be happy and people

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.960
scoff at that because they're like, well, what if you're in a jail cell or what if you're

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:33.200
whatever, what if you're an auto person, but the truth of the matter is so much great art

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.360
and life and joy comes out of slumps, to be honest.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.600
So there's, it's obvious that happiness doesn't know geography.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.960
It doesn't know any sort of social class because if we can't get access to museums, somebody's

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.960
going to spray paint something.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.800
If we can't get access to instruments, somebody's going to figure out a way to put two turntables

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:49.800
together.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.400
Like people always figure out a way to bring joy regardless of, you know, where, or how

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.280
bad it truly is.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.680
Especially the streets.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.680
Hit it.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680
Minor always.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680
You know.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680
Yeah.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.680
Yeah.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.680
Yeah.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.680
Yeah.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680
Yeah.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680
Yeah.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.680
Yeah.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.680
Yeah.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.680
Yeah.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.680
Yeah.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.680
Yeah.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:20.680
Yeah.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.680
Yeah.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.680
Yeah.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.680
Yeah.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.680
Yeah.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.680
Yeah.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.680
Yeah.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.680
Yeah.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.680
Yeah.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.680
Yeah.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.680
Flying high, flying low.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680
I fucked your mama like a Bologgelo.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.680
Fuck your inner.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.680
Face.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680
Yeah.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.680
Just.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.680
All right.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.680
Yeah.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:43.680
Maybe, uh, maybe kick a little something in, in honor of your fake dad.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.680
Oh, yeah.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.680
Okay.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.680
Yeah.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.680
Yo.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.680
Yo.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.680
This one goes out to.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.680
Pops.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.680
Big pops.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.680
My dad.

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:53.680
My dad.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:54.680
Feel free to jump in.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:55.680
Feel free to jump in with a pop.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.680
You can even, you can even pass it back and forth on the A and B rhymes.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:00.680
You know what I'm saying.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.680
Oh, I'm just curious though.

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.680
What is it about my rapping that had no limitations on it that made you think what I needed was

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:07.680
limitations.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.680
Oh, maybe you should, maybe you should draw boundaries around your.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.680
Just make sure that you have gotten enough sleep before you rhyme.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.680
Yo.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.680
Yo.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.680
Yo.

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.680
Yo.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.680
Yo.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.680
Yo.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.680
Combs.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.680
Hair.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.680
Sky.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.680
Air.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.680
Eyeballs.

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.680
Nose.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.680
I fucked your mama and then I smelled a rose.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.680
I put my shoes on tight.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.680
I fucked your mama all day and all night.

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:43.680
I put my suspenders on and I rolled around and made an angel on the lawn out of clippings.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680
Then I just mowed.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.680
I fucked your mama when it was 10 below.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680
It's cold.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.680
I warmed her up.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.680
I fucked your mama and then it drank out of a cup.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.680
It was my own cum.

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.680
Straight rod, steward.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.680
Straight.

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.680
I drank my own cum.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.680
I love to drink my own cum.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.680
I know you asked why.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.680
I thought you might have some limitations.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:15.680
Yeah.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:23.680
Well, that's enough I think for now.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.680
Bring your board.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:32.680
Oh, Affinity Designer came out for the iPad.

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.680
Yeah, just very excited about that.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.680
What's that like?

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.680
The ongoing drama.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.680
The Schrab drama.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.680
Schrab drama?

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.680
Yeah, there's a Schrab iPad drama.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680
Oh, I don't know.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.680
Schrab got some old ass iPad from Kevin Day and he tried to high road me with it.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.680
I could see it was like a legacy iPad.

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680
Shots fired.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.680
Yeah, I mean, like, fucking Schrab.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.680
And where has Schrab been?

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:03.680
Like, he came and he campaigned and he got a first class ticket to Long Island and then

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.680
he just boned out.

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.680
He's probably trying to unload Skud t-shirts in Boston or something.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.680
You know, there was some scam to it.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.680
Like, where is he?

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:17.680
Like, that friendship's not real.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.680
He's always accusing me of being unfeeling.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.680
But look how emotional I am.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.680
Like, it's always me.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.680
He's always putting it on me.

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.680
He's like, oh, the big joke, oh, Dan's so mean and he's so unfeeling.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.680
But this is all heart.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.680
But if that were true, you wouldn't be the one reaching out.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:36.680
Yeah.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.680
Yeah.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.680
You want me to text Rob that I want to know me?

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:40.680
Yeah.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.680
Got nominated?

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.680
Let him know, let him know.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.680
Leave a voicemail.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.680
Yeah.

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.680
Uh, oh, let's bring Steve Levy up.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.680
Steve Levy.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.680
Steve Levy, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:03.680
What's happening?

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.680
Hey, Steve, what's up with the 20 empty seats?

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.680
Should we stop doing the show?

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.680
Uh, no, we should keep doing the show.

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.680
As the audience dwindles?

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.680
I think, yeah.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:19.680
For this show, yeah, it seems like our numbers, our numbers.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.680
Well, should we target like a year though?

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.680
If we're going to stop doing the show, we have to decide a year in advance.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:28.680
Yeah.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.680
That's on you, I think, right?

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.680
Yeah.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:36.680
I don't like to be dramatic about stuff, but I also can't afford to.

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:40.680
I don't have the option of just being following my bliss with the show.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.680
So we have to decide, like, now-wish if we want to, like, oh, let's spend this year

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.680
wrapping things up, because then the subscriptions, like, six months from now we can go,

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.680
okay, no more six month subscriptions.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.680
All right, well, I'll get one more week, and then I'll make an official,

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.680
like, Jeff should be here for the decision.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.680
Yeah, I think so.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.680
Not that I'm going to let any, I'm not going to take a vote.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.680
I'm the one that has to be here every fucking week.

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:14.680
Like, everybody else is like, oh.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:25.680
I did it.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.680
This place is cutthroat.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:30.680
I actually need that.

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.680
No joke.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.680
That's not funny.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.680
Dad.

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.680
What do you think, Spencer, in terms of the D&D business?

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.680
What do you think?

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.680
Whatever you guys want, man.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.680
Don't always say that.

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.680
Let's do it.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.680
What about you?

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680
What do you want?

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.680
I want to play D&D.

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.680
Aw.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.680
Aw.

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.680
Let's do it for the people at home.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:00.680
The people at home.

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.680
Does it make you happy, Spencer?

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.680
Uh, I don't know.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.680
It makes me happy.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:15.680
It certainly makes me feel wanted.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:20.680
That's a big part of the biological necessity of happiness or whatever, the drive for it,

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:25.680
because it has to do with, like, if you're, it's, happiness is like this, like, velcro

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.680
that holds a tribe together, because, like, and they, and they immediately, the first

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:35.680
thing they did is they were like, oh, are, is it just, is it just cute people?

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.680
Are cute, are people that are attractive just happy because everyone likes them and

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.680
has nothing to do with happiness?

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.680
Like, is there just another factor and they, they had to eliminate all that stuff and some

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.680
very uncomfortable experiments, I'm sure.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:47.680
Excuse me, sir.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.680
Would you like to answer some questions about your life?

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.680
Why?

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.680
Well, you seem very happy.

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:55.680
Okay.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.680
Why am I in a room full of, uh, half-handsome people?

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.680
Which one?

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.680
Uh, because you're, maybe you're handsome.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:04.680
I don't know.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:12.680
Why am I sitting on the other side of the room with a lot of ugly people who are also

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.680
happy?

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:18.680
And why are the beautiful people frowning at us?

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.680
Ah, happiness.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:23.680
You know about those carrier pigeons?

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.680
I, I've been listening to this, uh, podcast.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.680
No, no, no.

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.680
Go on.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680
Not so easy, is it?

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.680
I've been listening to this podcast, Business Wars.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.680
Do you guys know about the Business Wars?

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.680
All the time, baby.

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.680
There are some good wars between those businesses.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:45.680
There's, uh, Netflix and Blockbuster and Adidas and Nike and Marvel and DC, some really,

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:52.680
some really fun companies and, and right now, um, they're doing Hearst, uh, versus Pulitzer

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.680
and the news business back in the day.

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.680
You're talking about all-time corporate rivalries, like 30 for 30, but corporate.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:00.680
Right?

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.680
Yeah.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.680
It's a really fun podcast.

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.680
Anyway, today, they're talking about, um, carrier pigeons.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.680
Which is the, which is the Rothschild.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.680
So there was versus the gun.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.680
Versus, no, like, versus the cell phone.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:21.680
So Hearst, like, invested heavily in pigeons that would carry, like, actually carry messages

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.680
throughout New York City.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.680
They would go 90 miles per hour and know exactly where to go.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.680
And there was this big trial that they were trying to get the scoop on before the, before

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.680
Pulitzer.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.680
Where did you come from before this, man?

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.680
What?

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.680
I just found it fascinating.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.680
What were you doing backstage?

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.680
You know, catching up some work, listening to some podcasts.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.680
Um, I don't know.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680
It's crazy.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:50.680
You know, the Rothschilds, the Rothschilds also used carrier pigeons.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.680
You don't give a shit about what I'm, okay.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.680
Rothschild, I'm trying to help you.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:02.680
I'm trying to talk about 1930s New York railroad barons.

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.680
You think I wanted to do this?

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.680
Just try to put a smile on your face.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:07.680
Yes.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.680
So I do cosine what you are saying.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.680
The Rothschilds also used carrier pigeons.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.680
You were.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.680
But they're extinct.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.680
Wow.

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.680
They went out of business.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.680
They went out of business.

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.680
1910s.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.680
I don't know.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.680
You know what else about optimism and happiness?

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:27.680
Martin Luther King, uh, uh, his branding optimism.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.680
Use your eye statements.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.680
Like I heard that Ted talk or the person that talks about the effectiveness of

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.680
leaders and stuff.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:34.680
Martin Luther King.

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.680
Why, why was his branding so effective?

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.680
He wasn't the first guy to notice things were bad and all that stuff.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:45.680
He used his eye statements and he said, I believe I have a dream.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.680
His speech wasn't called, I have a plan.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.680
Or, you know, I have, I have, I have, I have, I have 10 rules about how everyone

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.680
should operate.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.680
It was like, I, I, I have a dream.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.680
And his dream was like two kids holding hands.

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:02.680
And if you couldn't get behind that, then you're, you know, you're like, all right,

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.680
you're in the minority.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.680
And like, like most people are like, yeah, well, when you put it that way, I can

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:08.680
access that.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.680
It's like a vision.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.680
It's like, that's what leadership is.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.680
You go, I believe like first, like the most important thing.

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:19.680
It, optimism is the opposite of pessimism.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.680
Pessimism is the thing that like infects you and it fucks everything up.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.680
Everybody that's mad right now, they're like, they're pessimistic.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.680
And so some people are moving to try to get behind the thing that they're scared is

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.680
going to happen.

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.680
So that, because no one wants to be a fool.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.680
So they're like, okay, the world's falling apart.

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.680
That's kind of what I've been doing, like hiding.

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.680
Like I don't want to be a loser in that battle.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.680
Like, okay, let me scoot away and are over here and stuff.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.680
And then like, but optimism is the only thing that's going to actually counter that

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.680
sickness, but it seems stupid to us.

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:59.680
Like, optimism seems stupid to us because they're, they believe more crazy shit.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.680
And they're actually less accurate.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.680
They do these studies.

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.680
Oh, there's this study that was hilarious on the book.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.680
So they take people and they put them in a room with a light switch that straight up

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.680
just works randomly.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:15.680
So, and they go like, hey, turn on the light 20 times or something like that.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.680
And then the light switch is like programmed to just be random.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:23.680
So like, it just, when you turn it on, sometimes it comes on, sometimes not.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.680
When you turn it off, if it's on, sometimes it goes off, sometimes it doesn't.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:32.680
The depressed people that they pre-screen for are like, are you depressed?

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.680
Come do this experiment.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.680
They're like a control group.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.680
They, they, they asked them like, hey, what was going on with the light switch?

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:41.680
Huh?

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.680
And the depressed people nailed it.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.680
They're like, well, it's fucking random is what it was because I turned it on the first

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.680
time and I was like, what the fuck's going on?

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:50.680
And so I tested it.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.680
And they're like, clued in, like they get reality.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.680
If you're depressed, like you understand what's sad about the world and what's not

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.680
working, you're like, finely tuned to it.

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.680
The, the, the happy people, they were like, what's up with that light switch?

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:07.680
And I know 30% of the time it was just out of control.

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.680
Yeah.

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.680
They don't believe a conspiracy.

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.680
Yeah.

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.680
They're like, they're just like, they, they, they, they're delusional.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.680
Right.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:21.680
And, and, and so, but there's, there's a difference between that delusion and being delusional

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:22.680
about the things that matter.

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:27.680
Cause the thing is in terms of society, that delusion makes shit happen.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.680
Right.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.680
And happy people go, that shit happens.

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.680
And depressed people go, that shit's happening to me.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:32.680
Right.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.680
And yeah.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.680
And like, if everyone is depressed and everyone is like noticing how the light switch doesn't

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.680
work, the light, when the light switch is a real light switch, that's incredibly helpful.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:43.680
Thank you.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.680
You're Vin Diesel in pitch black.

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.680
Like, thank you.

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.680
You can see, you can see things that I can't see.

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.680
Thank you for saving me from the monsters.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.680
But this isn't a real light switch when you're talking about like fucking democracy or you're

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:59.680
talking about like mankind deserving a chance against giraffes or asteroids.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.680
You actually need, you need that fucking Bill Pullman to get out there and be like, hey

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.680
everybody, let's fight together the aliens.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.680
Like there's no reason to do that.

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.680
If there's anybody that's sad out there, they're like, this is bullshit.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.680
I'm flying away from the aliens because we're all going to die.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.680
That person's correct, but not going to win.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:19.680
All right.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:20.680
Whatever.

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:21.680
But you're exactly right.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.680
It's kind of why they start with the first images of just straight bullshit.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.680
So you kind of knew that this administration was going to go after women and children first

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.680
because that's the most shocking and jarring.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.680
It's sort of designed to make you freak the fuck out.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.680
So they, they show you the hardest of hard.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.680
It's a, it's a little bit of a like precursor to what's about to happen to wear you down.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.680
But don't be, we're not going to be worn down.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:48.680
Well, I'm pretty worn down, but finally I'm someone.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.680
I was at home on my couch when I got this phone call.

01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:01.680
Hey guys, I just wanted to step in and say everybody be aware of guns.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.680
Yeah.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.680
MC gun control.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.680
Just to, that's it.

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.680
I've got, I've got, I'm proud of our audience.

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.680
They're tired of that bit.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.680
That was a test you guys passed.

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:25.680
Spencer, do you bring us up to speed?

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.680
Tell us where we're at.

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680
What's been going on?

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.680
Yeah.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:41.680
Oh, last time on Harmon time, our heroes had just put out the fire.

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:45.680
And I think then they started another fire.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.680
I'm not sure about that.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.680
That might not have happened, but they were certainly putting their foot back in it.

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:57.680
And ended up escaping from the town, but farmers were in hot pursuit.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:06.680
After making it out of the perimeter of the town, they weighed up their options and decided they were outnumbering the farmers and decided to attack.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:14.680
Untrained, the farmers took several blows and were instantly overwhelmed, but they fought valiantly.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:21.680
And then Diarrhea Jr. threw a bunch of vampire dust in the air and everyone started choking.

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.680
That's what's happening now.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.680
All right.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.680
Anyone got any questions?

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.680
I hope so.

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.680
I have no idea what's happening.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680
That's probably, yeah.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.680
You're playing Schrab's character, Gary.

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:37.680
You're a big plant man.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.680
You're like a swamp thing.

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.680
There it is.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.680
Great.

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.680
Got it.

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.680
All right.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.680
I wasn't listening to a lot of that.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.680
What's deconstructed?

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.680
Why?

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:56.680
I used the D&D opening to gather my thoughts about how the show went.

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.680
It's the problem.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:03.680
It's like my first chance in two hours to go, should we keep doing the show or not?

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.680
I'm thinking about a million things.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.680
That makes sense.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.680
My apologies.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:10.680
It was an awkward handoff and Spencer picked it up.

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.680
No, it's not your fault.

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:16.680
No, it's that space of time that's like a snowdrift I have to pee on.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.680
Oh, of course.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.680
For 90 minutes, I'm like, it's up to me to, okay, let's keep the show going.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.680
You guys can tell how responsibly I take this job.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.680
Then I hand it off to Spencer and then I'm like, I just decompress into that space.

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:39.680
Spencer's talking about what happened and I'm just going like, all right, well, so get

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.680
home tonight.

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.680
I'll let the dogs out.

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.680
My life's going okay, isn't it?

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:48.680
Do I enjoy myself here?

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.680
Are there?

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.680
Why?

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.680
What's with the empty seats?

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.680
It's your get ready space.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:31:00.680
What else can I rhyme with mouth other than south?

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.680
Maybe we started some fires.

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.680
I like that.

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:08.680
That actually made me feel a lot better because that makes just perfect sense.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.680
Yeah.

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.680
It's not like about me being bad at this.

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:12.680
Oh, God, no.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.680
No, no, not at all.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.680
As a matter of fact, let's get one more.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.680
No, no.

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:17.680
That's the worst.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.680
I mean, I appreciate the thought, but no, that's the last thing I want right now.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.680
I want to play games with my friends.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.680
Hell yeah.

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.680
Let's get into it.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:33.680
So we're outside of the town.

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.680
You ran away.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.680
The town was fighting a fire and you were like, well, we still got to find Patchens.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.680
So then you went in and you were like, where's Patchens?

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.680
And they were like, well, there's a fire.

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:48.680
And then you put out the fire and then you were asking for Patchens and they were like,

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.680
weren't you guys the guys that start the fire?

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.680
And you were like, I think the winds are turning.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:57.680
And then you hightailed it out of there, but then you were being chased and you were running

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.680
because you thought you were being chased by an angry mob.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.680
But the farther you got, the more turned out to be just three people.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.680
And then you're like, well, fuck this.

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.680
And then you felt bad because you just like, you slashed one of them in the cut or something.

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.680
You really started taking them to task.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.680
And then it was just kind of sad because it's like, well, they were just trying to do their jobs.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:22.680
And that's when DJ threw the vampire dust in everyone's face.

01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:23.680
And that didn't do it.

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:24.680
That just made everyone cough.

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:27.680
Yeah, it was just like dust.

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:30.680
But you know, you might have diseases now, but...

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:34.680
If anything, it's like an ingredient for maybe an invisibility potion.

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:37.680
Yeah, realistically, you did get rid of a magical reagent.

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:38.680
Yeah.

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:39.680
All right.

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.680
But that's fine.

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:48.680
So the farmers are all coughing and one of them's like on the floor, bleeding half to death.

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:51.680
Rawr!

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.680
A bear appears.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.680
Wait, is Brandon playing both Bernie Mac and...

01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.680
I guess if you want, you could play both.

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.680
Uh, what was Jeff's...

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:03.680
What's his name?

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:04.680
I don't want to mess up Jeff's...

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:05.680
Chad the Firelighter.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.680
Oh, no, mess it up.

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:07.680
It'll be great.

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:08.680
Great. Chad here to play.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:09.680
You like fire.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.680
Awesome.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:12.680
So, uh...

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:20.680
So I immediately stand up as Chad, look around, and set my hula hoop on fire.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.680
You do it.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.680
You like it.

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.680
Okay.

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.680
To start...

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.680
Yeah.

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:31.680
I kind of find patches.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:35.680
Spencers, what...

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.680
What? Ask me a question.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680
This is the game.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.680
What, um...

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.680
Yeah, I mean, I...

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:41.680
What...

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.680
How do we find patches?

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:44.680
How do you find patches?

01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:47.680
Um, okay.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:52.680
He's rolling to see...

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.680
Just how many months he wants to go by.

01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.680
You...

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:05.680
You use your intelligence to determine that the best way to find patches is to ask if anyone's seen a strange, mysterious child nearby.

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.680
Child?

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.680
You know, recently.

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.680
Is he really a child?

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:09.680
Well, he's like a...

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:10.680
He's like a young...

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.680
I mean, you call him maybe 16 or something, but like, by these people's standards, yeah, he's like a kid.

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:16.680
Oh, wow.

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:18.680
I always imagined him as like a 30-something...

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:19.680
No.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.680
...beard, sleepy kind of guy.

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:23.680
For me, at most, he was like 19.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680
Wow.

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.680
But, yeah.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:27.680
He immediately went to dog, having never...

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.680
Patches?

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:29.680
...been here before.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.680
I can see how that connection could be made.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.680
So his patches is a man.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680
Yeah.

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.680
Okay.

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.680
Well, a boy.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.680
A boy.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680
Not yet a woman.

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:40.680
I didn't get clarity on that.

01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:43.680
I slashed one of the stomachs of one of these three people that was chasing us.

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.680
There's still some two of them like...

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.680
Yeah, but they're coughing.

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.680
That was like the last thing that happened.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:49.680
Right, they're coughing.

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:54.680
So I grab one of them and I go, listen to me, or face the wrath of God.

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.680
All right.

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:56.680
You do that.

01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:59.680
He seems stricken with fear.

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.680
Have you seen a strange child?

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:08.680
He goes, yeah, I think someone was wandering off just tonight.

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.680
I think it was right before the fire started.

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:11.680
Where?

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.680
Actually, after the fire started.

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.680
Sorry.

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:15.680
Where?

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:17.680
He went towards...

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:18.680
Sorry.

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.680
It's all right.

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:23.680
You can scroll through your memory.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:27.680
He seemed to be going in the direction of Blade Glen.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.680
It's a big, big city.

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:32.680
One of the bigger cities around here.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:33.680
Blade Glen?

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:34.680
Blade Glen.

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680
Blade Glen.

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:36.680
Exactly.

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.680
Thanks.

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.680
Thanks for answering my question.

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:47.680
And then I turn to the other guy and I go, would you have answered my question?

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:50.680
If I had focused my aggression on you.

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:57.680
He says, yeah, I would have, but you guys got to come back and face justice for doing all the damage.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.680
So here's...

01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.680
I do one of these.

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.680
Here's the thing.

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.680
I go like, that sounds like a great idea.

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:09.680
And I put my foot around behind his ankles and I push him.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.680
I just straight up third grade.

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.680
Just push him.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:19.680
Into the guts, into the open guts of the guy that you slashed open.

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:22.680
He falls into the guts.

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:25.680
And I just laugh.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.680
You fucking nerd.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.680
Jesus.

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.680
I'm not facing your justice.

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:35.680
I work for the fucking lord.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:36.680
That happens.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.680
You big defail, baby.

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:45.680
I'm ignoring Carlos's bullying and focusing on Chad's amazing hula hoop skills.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.680
What is the fire?

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.680
This is incredible. It's blowing my mind.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.680
I'm juggling rotisserie chickens and hula hooping on fire.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:55.680
It's delicious.

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:58.680
The fire is terrifying me as a swamp thing.

01:36:58.680 --> 01:36:59.680
Yes.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.680
It'll tear you out.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.680
I suggest that we move to another town.

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.680
To Blade Glen.

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.680
To Blade Glen, yes.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.680
So I lead the pack.

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.680
We head out.

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.680
I am now doing those things, those fire lamps.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.680
To guide our path.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.680
To guide our path.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.680
Who knew Chad was a fire dancer?

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.680
I told the two guys, I go,

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:29.680
if you guys tell anybody in town that we went to Blade Glen,

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:35.680
your sister will explode.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.680
They look at each other and then look at you and then look at each other.

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:39.680
Do they have a sister?

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:40.680
You have sisters, right?

01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:41.680
Both of you do.

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:44.680
No, we don't.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.680
That's right, you don't.

01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:47.680
Not anymore.

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:51.680
Because they exploded in the womb.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.680
And that's on you.

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:56.680
Pay it forward.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:05.680
Does anyone, do either of you have a loved one whose name starts with D?

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:08.680
I'm hearing a D.

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.680
No, no D.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.680
A G, I think I'm hearing.

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.680
That's the middle name, the G.

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.680
A loved one is departed.

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.680
One of you has a departed loved one.

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.680
No, no G.

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:24.680
No one has a departed loved one.

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:26.680
Gregory, is it Gregory?

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.680
No.

01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:30.680
It doesn't work if you...

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:33.680
Sorry, I was getting into it.

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:35.680
Can you really...

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.680
It's a cold reading.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:40.680
I just realized you need a bigger audience.

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.680
Sorry, sorry.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.680
You're so talented.

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:45.680
I don't have a sister.

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.680
Fucked up.

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.680
Alright, well here's the thing.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.680
Let's do it the old fashioned way.

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:54.680
You talk about where we went, and we're going to come back and beat you up.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.680
You've seen him a bully.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.680
Yeah.

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.680
You saw me laugh at you after I tripped you.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.680
Like, if I were you, I wouldn't give me a chance to be mean.

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.680
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:08.680
Yeah, I love it.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:11.680
Okay, let's try a little bonus here.

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.680
If you don't tell anybody for the next year,

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:17.680
you're going to get a chocolate bar.

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.680
I love chocolate.

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.680
Not...

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.680
What's your name? What's your name, sir?

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:26.680
Tron.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:27.680
Tron?

01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:29.680
Was your mother 16 when she had you?

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:31.680
No.

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:36.680
Sorry, we're laughing at you, but...

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.680
What's your name, Tron's friend? What's your name?

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.680
Ron.

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.680
Okay, Tron and Ron.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.680
Jesus Christ, this town.

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.680
Tron and Ron, I'm remembering, I'm committing it to memory.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:54.680
Oh Lord, oh Lord of the silver light,

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:58.680
if Tron and Ron keep their fucking mouths shut for a year,

01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:01.680
give them all the chocolate bars.

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:03.680
That's a lock.

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.680
Why don't you do that prayer for us?

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.680
I want all the chocolate bars.

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.680
You guys are so lucky.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:16.680
So long, Tron. Bye, Ron.

01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:17.680
Bye.

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.680
Are you going to tell people?

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.680
No, no.

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.680
Okay, okay.

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.680
I feel like I believe them.

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:26.680
Do you guys sense motive on them?

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.680
All right, what's yours?

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.680
Oh.

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:31.680
It might be insight or sense motive.

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:32.680
It's been lost.

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.680
Well, I don't think I have it as an actual...

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:38.680
Then wisdom. Wisdom is 16.

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:40.680
All right.

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:42.680
Oh yeah, he's lying.

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:45.680
So we are in trouble.

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.680
They're going to tell people.

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.680
But the odds, I mean, nobody's going to come after us.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:51.680
He'll be gone by then, right?

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:52.680
No one's going to.

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:54.680
Imagine them going back to town.

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:56.680
Oh, they went to Blade Glen.

01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.680
No one's going to be like, oh, then I'll go there too.

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.680
They're towns on fire.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.680
Don't think bad publicity is no publicity.

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:06.680
Yeah, so it just keeps our word about us going.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.680
Travelers, reputation.

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:10.680
Let's just head to...

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.680
Dumber fire.

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.680
I got it. Yeah, that's great.

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.680
All right, they're going to fake them out.

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.680
Yeah.

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.680
Dumber fire.

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.680
So now we are on the road.

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:24.680
Oh yeah. Oh wait, no.

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:27.680
Before you get on the road, it's...

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.680
I guess it's suspicious almost.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:30.680
What is...

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.680
You get a crow, like from Game of Thrones.

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:35.680
Like a carrier pigeon?

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.680
Yeah.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.680
Oh boy.

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.680
It just flies up to us.

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.680
I thought these were extinct.

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:47.680
Can we keep it as a pet?

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.680
You don't have a cage.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.680
I think you're supposed to keep them in circulation

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.680
so that they are of use to people.

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:57.680
Yeah, that's true.

01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:59.680
That's how they went extinct.

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:01.680
Okay, well then I take...

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.680
Or maybe we're supposed to keep ones

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.680
so that we can use it then.

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.680
No, well, I guess it doesn't make any sense.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:09.680
Well, if you want to buy one,

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:11.680
that's like buying a cell phone.

01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.680
I rip off a piece of my map

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.680
and I curl it around its foot.

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:17.680
Oh wait, I want to write a message.

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:20.680
To whoever gets this message...

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:22.680
I love you.

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:25.680
Exclamation point from Diarrhea.

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.680
And then I tie it around the pigeons,

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.680
the crow's foot,

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.680
and I go,

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.680
buy crow

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.680
and send him back off into the world.

01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:37.680
Alright, well do you get the message from the crow?

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:39.680
Yeah, it seems like you took it, right?

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.680
You took the message.

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.680
It wasn't like offering you the opportunity

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.680
to send a letter.

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:48.680
Also, now what if we read the message it's from

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:51.680
and it's like we intercepted a message from Al-Qaeda

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:53.680
and you just sent them like...

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.680
Right back.

01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:57.680
You like, Geraldo'd it.

01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:01.680
I feel like I've got a connection with nature as this beast.

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:03.680
Alright, well, I still... I call it back.

01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:05.680
Well, he got the message, didn't you?

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.680
I heard you say it.

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:09.680
Of course you did.

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.680
But that's not the important thing to me.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.680
So I give the message to Chad.

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.680
Here's the message.

01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.680
It says...

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:19.680
Oh, it's from...

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:21.680
No, that's the message you put on there.

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:23.680
It's the other message.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:25.680
It says...

01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:27.680
It's from an old NPC that you guys remember.

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:30.680
His name is Brother Absalom.

01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:32.680
Hope this note finds you well.

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.680
I'm not in a position to reassign you,

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.680
but as of now you're being reassigned.

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.680
Head to the mining town of Faunches,

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.680
just south of Blade Glen.

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.680
There's a dispute between the miners' bureau

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.680
and the church's district prelate.

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:47.680
Call it a hunch, but from what I've been hearing from your work,

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.680
you're just the man to blast through this log jam

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.680
and help Faunches get back to mining

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:54.680
and help the church get back to purifying.

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:57.680
When you can, seek a meeting with Zellie and Faunches.

01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.680
She's in vacation there, and we'll be able to brief you.

01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:02.680
Burn bright, take flight.

01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:04.680
Okay, but that's written down.

01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:06.680
So we can reread that?

01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.680
So we can just reread that anytime we want, right?

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:10.680
Oh, yeah.

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.680
How big is this bird that it has a scroll like that attached to it?

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.680
It's a crow.

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.680
10 foot wingspan.

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.680
It's a crow.

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.680
It's a very small writing.

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.680
I'm not going to read from a crow, man.

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:24.680
I'm going to take a pigeon word.

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:27.680
All right, well, nobody loses that

01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:29.680
until we get a pen and paper

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.680
and can write something down.

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:33.680
I'll hold on to it.

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:35.680
I put it in my pack.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.680
Great. It is already written down.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.680
That's a mess.

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.680
I think it's best for us to have a little redundancy.

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.680
Sure. No, no, I agree.

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.680
Yeah, we'd photocopy it if we could.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.680
That could be something.

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:50.680
So it sounds like...

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.680
We got to choose a path.

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.680
Do we go to that mining town first,

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.680
or do we go to Blade Glen to find patches?

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.680
What would we come across first, the direction we're headed?

01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.680
It's just that it's on the way.

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.680
That was part of the letter.

01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.680
Yeah, it's just south of, and we're south of that.

01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:07.680
We're very south of. I'm assuming.

01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:09.680
We go to this mining town and see if we can get some gold.

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:11.680
Well, it feels like gold.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.680
Well, I've heard there's another...

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:15.680
Is there a gold rush?

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.680
There's another reason to go to the mining town

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:19.680
that's not to mine. People need us.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.680
There's a civil war happening or something.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.680
Is a church involved?

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.680
There's always a church involved.

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:28.680
Let's go to this mining town and steal the gold from the church.

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:30.680
All right.

01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.680
Can I reread the part about what's happening in the mining town?

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.680
Yeah, there's a dispute between the miners' bureau

01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.680
and the church's district prelate.

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:41.680
So remember, you came into the first town you came in

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:44.680
because there was some shit going down to the local church.

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.680
So it's kind of like the church is in a dispute

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.680
with the miners' bureau.

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.680
So it's miners' v. church.

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.680
Mm-hmm.

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.680
That's where we're headed.

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.680
Man, do you guys remember how crazy that was back in...

01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:58.680
That was a year ago.

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.680
No, it wasn't.

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:02.680
It was very recently.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.680
It feels like a year ago.

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:07.680
ID10 T-Fest, do you remember?

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:09.680
It was good times.

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:12.680
It was a year to the sadly mistaken gods

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.680
that believe their lives are more important than ours

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:19.680
and who actually just fill time between our adventures

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:22.680
as they control the planets.

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.680
I'm right there with you, bro.

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.680
Yeah.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:30.680
They would probably look upon us as pieces on a chess board

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.680
or characters in some poem.

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.680
And yet, I'm sure their life is riddled with

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:38.680
fucking confusion and inconsistency and alcoholism.

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.680
Of course.

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.680
But that's why we belong to the church of the Silver Flame.

01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.680
So we don't have to think about that stuff as much.

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.680
We have lives of consistency and virtue

01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:50.680
and we can tell the good guys from the bad guys

01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:53.680
like we're not mistaking each other for our fathers.

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:55.680
At least we're working at it.

01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.680
Yeah, we're trying.

01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:59.680
Off to the mining town!

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:01.680
For their gold!

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.680
It's...

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:05.680
And to help with the dispute.

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.680
When we get there...

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:09.680
I mean, if I'm moving too fast, I thought it would happen.

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:11.680
No, no, okay.

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.680
Spencer tells us.

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.680
I thought you were going to do Jeff's bit.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.680
When we get there, let me do all the talking.

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:19.680
Is that what you're going to say?

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.680
No.

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:24.680
When he had his vocal cord surgery,

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:26.680
the amount of times that was said per week

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.680
dropped worldwide, 20%.

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.680
But...

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.680
What were you going to say, though?

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.680
When we get there...

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.680
Oh, you just wanted to know.

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.680
Oh, man, getting here is going to be a real hassle.

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:42.680
It's several days' journey

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:45.680
and it might cause monster fights.

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.680
It doesn't.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.680
What? You could tell that in one roll?

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.680
I can for that day, yeah.

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.680
So should we leave it that we're on the road currently on the way?

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:58.680
You are, and then you see a mysterious sight,

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.680
a bunch of cultists doing jumpin' jacks.

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.680
What?

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:05.680
I love jumping jacks. Come on.

01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:07.680
We practiced this in the town.

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.680
Cultists.

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:11.680
What does that mean?

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.680
Not churchists.

01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:15.680
I take out my fire sword.

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.680
What?

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.680
Whoa.

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.680
And I kill the leader.

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.680
What the...

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.680
Jesus.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.680
Cliffhanger!

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.680
Cliffhanger!

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:25.680
Whoa!

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.680
All right, that's...

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:30.680
We'll see you next week.

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.680
Hit those B-drow.

01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:34.680
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been Harmontown.

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:36.680
Thank you so much for showing up.

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:38.680
For tuning in.

01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:40.680
Thank you to Chris Cora, Zach McEver in the booth.

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.680
Church, we love you so much.

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:44.680
We miss you, Jeff Davis.

01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:46.680
Our guest tonight, Heath.

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:48.680
Last name.

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:48.680
Colin.

01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:50.680
Heath Cullen. No S, no Heath Cullen.

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:52.680
With an S.

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:52.680
With an S tonight.

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:54.680
Heath Cullen, ladies and gentlemen.

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.680
Spencer Clinton.

01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:59.680
Steve Levy.

01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.680
Dan Harmon.

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.680
Good night.

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.680
Snake chances.

01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:27.680
Drive quickly.

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.680
Did you get any of that?

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:39.680
It's a good show.
