WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
What's the first lyric of that spring that's ever waiting for us here?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
It ran one step ahead.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
We followed the dance.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Give it up for Carmen Town.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
We're just now in session, everybody!

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Let's bring out our Game Master.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Although we don't play games anymore,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
but still he's our Game Master.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Spencer Crittenden.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
The Well-Shorn.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
You got a side pony going on right now.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh yeah, I need it.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I live.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You know what else we need, Spencer?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Why?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
We need a mayor.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Let's bring out Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Yo, I got a microphone back on the stage.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It's all the way back.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
A deeper mic for a deeper show.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I fucked your mama in her big toe.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Whoa, yeah.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Inside her big toe?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah, well, let me explain.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Your mama was a virgin.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
She wanted to stay that way,

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
so I said come out to my house the next day,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
that I have off of work,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
and I'll do a little experiment that I've been wanting to do.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I need you to sign this waiver, girl.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm gonna be the most famous orthopedist in the world.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm gonna fuck your toe,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
and you're gonna get to stay a virgin,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
and I'm gonna be a famous surgeon.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
We're gonna be on the cover of people.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Wait, you didn't want to sign her toe?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
No, I've got a very small wiener.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
You're a...

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
You're a wiener.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
When I was born, the doctor said,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
whoa, I think that's a girl.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
My mom said he's gonna fuck a toe.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
This is the sexiest fucking rapper we've ever done.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm a weird surgeon with a tiny penis

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
that invites women to his house

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
and puts a hole in their toe,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
and then fucks it.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Wait, wait.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
You put a hole inside the toe?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I put a hole inside the toe.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
We've been over this.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
That sounds more invasive than I imagined.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I had them sign a waiver,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
and the whole point was the person wanted to fuck

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
but didn't want to be a non-virgin.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
They wanted to retain their virginity,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
and so I had a plan that might have some affinity

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
for people of the kind of persuasion

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
that doesn't want to lose the hymen

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
and the props with the God above.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I don't know, at least she was Catholic, is what I'm saying.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
She wanted to maintain her maiden head.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Can I ask you the procedure

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
where you make the hole in the toe?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
It's called the topoziatomy.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
And it's smooth and sexy.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Welcome to Hymen Town, everybody.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
We did it again.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Well, if that wasn't worth coming out

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
on a holiday weekend.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Tonight's show is brought to you by Steve Levy,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
who forgot to cancel the show.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I was told there was no show tonight.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
You were told that by me.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Right. I was told that by common sense.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's a national holiday.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Men and women have fallen for our freedoms.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
And yet we have almost a full house right now.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
I know. Well, I guess it turns out to be a good night to do a show.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
That's the upshot.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
I mean, yeah, since we're all here, we'll make it worth it.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
But, you know, I think the fact that we are here is a crime.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
And treasonous, really.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
These aren't times to be fucking around

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
with the definition of what it means to be a proper American.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
You know, that's a razor thin high wire

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
that we have to walk every day with a lot of nuance.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
What kind of American do you think you are?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I don't mean to be glib, but, like, what...

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
define your Americanism?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Like, what kind of patriot are you?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Uh...

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Can you give me, like, some categories that exist already?

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
I don't know. Are you a, like, cynical patriot?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Are you... Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Well, that was easy. Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
I mean, it's like, you know, you don't have to...

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
you don't have to try to think of things for me to talk about.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I guess the point is that the...

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
like, being a patriot right now is complicated.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Oh, yeah. No, it's like I was saying.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
You know, it's incredibly nuanced, incredibly subtle, paradoxical.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I mean, it's just...

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
you need a surgeon's touch to...

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
I didn't want you to connect that, Todd, but...

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I didn't say anything. I didn't.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
You're gonna make a hole in a person's toe and fuck it.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah, anyways. So, yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, you know, yeah, I was obviously being sarcastic.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
You can literally be a semi-literate fucking...

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
fucking crazy.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
He's a... We have a madman on the throne.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Did you see he had that? He had those speech notes.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Hey, guys.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
What's up?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
He had those speech notes that someone took a picture of,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and he wrote a chomlishment.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
A chomlishment?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Like, instead of accomplishments like ACH and then no P,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
like a chomlishment.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
I mean, there's a lot of words to misspell,

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
but I feel like accomplishment's not high up on the list.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
If this were an ideal world, he would be allowed to be dyslexic.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
That's not dyslexia.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Sorry, sorry, continue.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I think it is dyslexia.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
He doesn't know how to read or write,

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
because when he looks at letters and words and things,

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
they're jumbled, and so unlike a lot of our friends

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
who had that learning disability diagnosed for them

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
in their third grade and put the extra effort in

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
to re-unjumble the shit as it comes to their brain,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
he just was dishonest about it.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
He just was like, oh, I'm not going to go to school,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
and then here you do my homework.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Whatever the fuck he did, I don't know.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
We've got a lot of people in the world

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
in a lot of states of literacy.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Literacy is a spectrum.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
It is.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
There's a ton of people who are illiterate in America.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
What I'm saying is...

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
It's a crazy figure.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
I can't say he's illiterate because he has read a teleprompter before,

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
but we do know that I would be comfortable diagnosing him as dyslexic.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I believe the frustration that he experiences

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
when he tries to read a prompter

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
and when he tries to say things and stay on book and stuff,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
and he's obviously gotten a lot more dopamine spikes

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
from going off book,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
and that's why even though he's kind of dumb,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
he has that ilan.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
He feels like he's flying as long as he's not reading.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
So even though he's saying the dumbest shit,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
he's like, this is so much better than reading!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah, but he...

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
I guess that's like me with math.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
If I was just like, 8 plus 8 is 99!

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
I'd be excited too because I'm like, don't make me think about it.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I almost don't know it's 16.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm going to get yelled at.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Anyways, what I was going to say is in an ideal society,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
it would be great.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
We've had presidents that are holding themselves up at the podium

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
because they've got polio legs.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
In the midst of, we need the strongest person in the world right now.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
We need to be so strong.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
It's like, my polio legs, they hurt so much and I can't...

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
But then the photographers are like,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
don't take pictures of those polio legs.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
What do you do?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
An American needs strength right now.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
And you know...

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And we had presidents who were like,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
their wives are really running the country

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
because they're having insulin attacks or something in a caboose.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I think that's the same guy, I can't remember.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
In a caboose?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, wasn't there like a train going around

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
and there was like a president's wife who was like,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
he says he's proud and you guys are doing great

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
and you need more canals.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
And he was like...

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Whose wife is this?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
One of the Eisenhower's.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
I think there's only one Eisenhower.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
It was like the third Roosevelt before the second Bush.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah, but there were four Eisenhower's.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Four Roosevelt's, yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
Anyways, it's sad that the culture of dishonesty, Jeff,

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
is what I'm saying.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Thank you.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Like why does the truth have to be a bad thing?

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
When we now know how much obvious lying can be tolerated,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
it's so close to saying it's okay to be honest

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
when you're just like, I'm not dumb

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
and you have a dumb hat on, you know?

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
You're one lie away from us, no need for the hat

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
and you can just say you are dumb

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
and then we can open a book with you

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
and you can look at it and you can go like,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I still don't like this book, it makes me feel dumb.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
That's because you are dumb and keep working at it.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I can't work, I'm president.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Well, yeah, we know and we elected you because you're dumb.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
There's a lot of dumb people in the world.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
We love dumb people, but let's try to get smarter.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
You know, it could all be honest.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
But no, it's all just lying.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Everything's lying now.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh, yeah, I can't believe that person said that.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Oh, did you hear what they said?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
And it doesn't matter if it's true or not,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
it's just like whether they said it.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
It opens the door for vampirism.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
People that lie, they've figured it out.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
They can say the things that you're supposed to say,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
whether anyone believes them or not,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
that's a terrible world to create

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
for your shitty little children.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Are you ever going to have a child, Zink?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
No, well, I don't know.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Well, I can't declare that.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I don't know if I do.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Walk me through that.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
When a man loves a woman.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Children are made by two people.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
They take a Spencer.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So I can't be the arbiter of like,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
oh, no, I'm definitely not that one.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Would you like to be a father of a boy or a girl?

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
I'm getting up there in age and I don't...

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I still, no.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Cody and I are up in the air

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
and we're staying there about it.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And I just...

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
It's getting to be a harder sell every day.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Do you think that's something that you could enjoy?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
I don't know.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
I think I kind of feel like if you got to ask yourself

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
that about something, you know,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
then maybe you take a pass.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
You're going to be 46 soon.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
When's the last time you ordered in a restaurant

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
and we're like, do you think that's something you could enjoy?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
You know, like you don't order that stuff.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah, now like, who are you?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Charlie Chaplin?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
You don't want to be a 46-year-old dad now, do you?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Sure.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Also, whatever factors are in...

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
If I don't know for sure that I want to be or not,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
then why do it until I'm for sure...

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
If you had to pick, would you want a boy or a girl?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I don't...

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
I just would want it to be, you know,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
able to take care of itself.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
What a great dad.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Which is the gender that feeds itself

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
as soon as it comes out of the womb?

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Like a deer that just like spends some time being adorable

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and then just like runs off and starts eating leaves?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Is that a boy or a girl?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
That's a girl.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Boys are fucking nonsense.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It doesn't matter.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
I mean, you know, there's no...

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Let's face it, both genders are fucking garbage.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Can we at least rise to that level of awareness?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
They're equidishly bullshit.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I will absolutely cop to it.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
There's a million things that only guys do that are fucking awful.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I listened to true crime podcasts.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
There's not even a debate about that.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
It's not a philosophy.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
It's not like, ooh, we're socialized to believe that.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It's like crazy, like men are monsters,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
physically violent monsters.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
However, when it comes to who's garbage,

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
like all humans, 85% of all humans,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
no matter what category, just dummies.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
But if you had to pick, you would pick what?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I don't know. Honestly, I don't know.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I can't figure out which would be worse.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Would you rather be a father of a boy or a father?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I understand the question.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
I'm saying, who do you think is better, male or female?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
What do you think is easier for you?

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
Honestly, I don't know because it's pros and cons in both.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I mean, from a crime perspective,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
you're talking about, do you want to worry about someone

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
or do you want to worry about a million people

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
that that person leaves and goes and...

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
Spencer, would you rather sire a daughter or a son?

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
I don't know. I don't know.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
If you go by stages...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I go by stages.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Boys suck more earlier.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
That's what she says.

14:19.000 --> 14:27.000
Girls are cooler, like zero through three and a half.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
It's like, why is she so cool?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Her brother was a bag of dicks.

14:34.000 --> 14:43.000
Boys start to get a little more whiny and throwin' shit around

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
more earlier, but then everything starts to rolly coaster.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Go on.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
I'm saying there's sign waves of ugly adjustment periods

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
and stuff from what I've seen.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
There's no science to it.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
I would accept if somebody had a report that said,

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
like, I'm speculating from my anecdotal observation.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
I think little girls, baby girls, are initially,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
like, if you spend two years watching them from birth

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
and then parallel to them, you're watching a little boy.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
From my experience, it seems to me,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
and I paste this largely on watching videos

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
that I get texted by ants,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
but, like, it just seems to me,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
like, the girl makes you want to go,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
like, I hope we have a girl.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
What is that reaction?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
No one knows what that reaction is.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
It's just all it is is mugging.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
There's nothing to that.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
No one knows what you're doing other than not liking me

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
or what I'm saying.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
You said you get a video from ants.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Okay, okay.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
Has anyone gotten a video from an ant in their lifetime?

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
Okay, yeah, we see some hands there.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
We're going to be okay.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
All right.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Did you think I meant the insect?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I just thought it was funny.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
You're scared because you've always said

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
you're scared that ants are getting smarter.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
The insect.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
And I keep saying, Jeff, it's summertime.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
They get more active in the summer

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
because they're, like, heat-based insects.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
They like water.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
But every year, you forget the previous summer

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
and you're like, they're taking over.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I'm like, no, it's just you left a sandwich out.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
That's it.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Okay, all right.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I just never receive videos from the ants.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I don't get ant videos.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Does your mom have a sister?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Does she?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Does your mom have a sister?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
She used to.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Damn.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
Okay, well, she doesn't anymore.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Someone's walking out because of that.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Just walk that guy.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
He didn't like it.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Does your dad have a sister?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
He used to, too.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Did they have phones?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Uh-huh.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Did they have phones?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Yes.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Oh, yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Did the phones have video cameras in them?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
No.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
See?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
That's why you're confused.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
But why ants?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Why?

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Because moms and dads aren't the only things

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
that come out of grandma's.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Why ants?

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Because if I got a video from my mom of a two-year-old boy,

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
she'd be a kidnapper.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Oh, God, damn it.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Happy Memorial Day.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
We have, as every year, because we're proud to do the show,

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
on Memorial Day, we have some of our war trivia.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
I read an article that said that the first Memorial Day

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
was like freed black slaves that were memorializing the fallen,

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
and then everyone was like, nah, we're starting Memorial Day,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
and kind of just crushed that out of history for a while.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah, I've got that right here.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Shit.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I stole your thunder.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
There was a big battle over it, and there's a cemetery

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
where you can go see all the Memorial Day soldiers

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
because it was a big war over who started Memorial Day.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
It was like a Second Civil War.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I got it right here.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Nantucket, 1897.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
So this is well into the reconstruction,

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
and like Spencer said, black soldiers, or they weren't soldiers.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
They became soldiers because they were trying to celebrate

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
a new thing they called Memorial Day.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Thank you.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah, yeah.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
And then a white, the cavalry, it was a cavalry unit,

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
came by and said, stop that, and they got in a big fight.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
And it's in Nantucket.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
You can go see the cemetery where all their bodies are buried.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
They all killed each other.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
It's the only war that ever happened where everybody on both sides died,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
and that's how the war ended.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Usually there's a winner.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
They couldn't call it a reservoir of dogs ending back then

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
because they didn't have that movie yet,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
but they didn't have any names for it

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
because the only people there, they all died.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
They got in a big fight, and they all drew up at the same time.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
About whether or not there should be a Memorial Day.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
About who started Memorial Day.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Okay.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah, and they all died.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
And eventually someone had to come by and bury them all,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
and they gave them special graves.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
It's just outside Nantucket.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
You can go see it.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Just outside Nantucket.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Yeah.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Which means in the Atlantic Ocean.

19:37.000 --> 19:45.000
Well, I mean a lot of people believe that Nantucket is the mythical Atlantis.

19:45.000 --> 19:56.000
That they brought math to Phoenix and agriculture.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
That's what the Peruvians are referring to as Quetzalcoatl.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
It's just hillbillies that came by in a boat.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Why do you think the Peruvians were so involved in Quetzalcoatl,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
like Mexican mythology?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I don't know.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
They saw the Mayans doing it, and they're like...

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
I'll take a piece of that, actually.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Let me get in on some of this ancient civilization business.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
I want to be an equatorial lost people.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
What do we got to do?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
We got to build a pyramid?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Fine.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
What do you think is...

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
What's your favorite fun fact about Peru?

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
I like that its capital is not what you think.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
If I may ask, what do you think the capital of Peru is?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Well, a lot of people think it's Colombia.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
They think the capital of Peru is another country.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Yeah.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
But they'd be wrong.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Yeah.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
But it's not.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Who thinks that?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
A lot of people.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Just terrible people.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Like bad.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
If you went right now...

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
If I went to Peru right now?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
You and I were on a road trip.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
We're in Peru.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
What road did we take?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
What's your first stop?

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
What's our first stop in Peru?

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
I would like to go see the famous canyons.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Right.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
They're not called famous canyons because they're bullshit.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah, exactly.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I kind of...

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
When I'm a tourist, I don't try to think lateral.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I'm not like, take me to the real Peru.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
That is the real Peru.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
It's waiting there.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It's waiting there for you.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
There's a reason why people go to take pictures of the Peruvian canyons.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
The famous Peruvian canyons.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
That's the first place I'd go.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
That's your first stop.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
That's where the George Washington of Peru...

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Let's go off the beaten track.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
What's your hipster?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
We're going to go somewhere groovy.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Look, I just told you.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I don't do that.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
But let's say you're going to be...

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
There's a big hipster scene in Peru right now called Neo-Peruvian fusion, whatever.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
I don't need that shit.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
I could get that shit on the sunset strip, man.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
I'm not going to fucking downtown Peru.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I'm going to the canyons.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I'm going to the canyons, baby.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Where it all started.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
That's why they're called canyons because it starts low.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Yeah.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
All right.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
We're going to do horoscopes now.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
We're going to do more segments in the show.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
That's cool.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Oh, did I finish with my Memorial Day trivia?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
No.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
It was just supposed to be war trivia.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
And then you guys started biting your head off.

22:59.000 --> 23:06.000
It just started sharing some stuff and then I just handed it and then we saw how that went.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
What horoscope?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
War trivia.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
War trivia is the first thing I said.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I mean, we can skip that.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
I got a bunch of war trivia.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Do you want music for this?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Sure.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Let me...

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
All right.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Okay, so 1943.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Right.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
The bloodiest battle of World War II.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Where was that staged?

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
It was an island in the South Pacific called Guadalcanal.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Your dad died there.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Grandpa.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
My dad died there.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
But he wished...

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Killed a lot of people, probably.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Never talked about it.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
The silent generation, they called him.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Didn't say much.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
I mean, he talked a lot, but not about the war.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
All right.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
What did he talk about when he wasn't talking about the war?

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
What was his topic of choice?

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
He liked to build stuff like decks.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
He was a welder.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
He kind of would make fun of my great-grandma.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Butcher?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
But, you know, I wasn't around to...

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
But didn't grandma Butcher kill a...

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
She stabbed a person.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah, but these people are all dead now,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
so I feel like we can't even...

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
I'm so sick of sharing my family goodies,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and then when I talk to my mom about it,

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I'm like, I always...

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
She's like, where'd you hear that?

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
And I'm like, I don't want to be a part of this disintegration

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
of all of the truth of my family, you know?

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
There's so many little details.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I don't know if this is happening to you guys.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
You talk to your...

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Maybe you're younger, but it's just like...

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I don't know if this is a...

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
It's like the inversion of the terrible twos.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Your parents just start learning the word no.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Like, as they become adult children,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
they're just like,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
and then remember that one thing we always joke about?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
No, we don't.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
It's just like, yeah, I'm gonna take as much as I give now.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I'm 70.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Like, it's just...

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
They just start to get a little snotty at the end there.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
They're just like, maybe not.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
I don't know.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Maybe you weren't a good kid.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
I don't know.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
You know, they're just sort of like hacking everything now.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
It's this Trump that's made the baby boomers all fucking nutty.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
They're just like, what's truth?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
I don't know.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Fake news.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
And so I don't even want to bring the precious stuff over.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
I want to keep that lore.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Because now everything's up for debate.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
I asked my mom for...

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
You got any of the home movies?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
She's like, what?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Home movies?

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Like, looked at me like I had just a fucking piece of shit.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Your mom?

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Like, I was talking in Martian or something.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
I'm like, yeah, the home movies.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Like, I don't know.

26:18.000 --> 26:25.000
Don't you have like that CD, the DVD with like all the shit you compiled that's like

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
on all the old Super 8 stuff?

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
It's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
And then she looked at Cody and she's like, we were a poor family.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
We couldn't really afford cameras and things when we were a thing.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
And I was like, mom, what?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
I don't know.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Your dad's business was recording stuff.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Yeah.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And here's the thing.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
Right now, one way or another, my mom's going to hear this.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
And then it's more fucking butter in the churn.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It's just more fucking shit.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.000
Like, the next thing I'll hear if I hear anything is, I didn't say that.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
We didn't have that conversation where I said we never had cameras.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I don't care.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
I love her.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Mom, I love you.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
I'm like, I promise I won't talk about my family anymore.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Jesus Christ.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I just want it to be like a fucking crater.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
But there is video evidence of the things you're talking about.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Yeah.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
I mean, yeah.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Like, it's fucking insane.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Like, the shit.

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
And then the shit she remembers, she went through a 20 cat list of all the cats we've killed.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
It was like, she was like, she got lost in that shit.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Let's talk about that.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
It was like the fucking, like, I was like gripping Cody's hand.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
I was like, this is some fucking podcast shit.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Like, I mean, like talking to like, what's his name?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Israel Keys tapes and shit.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
Like, she was just going through the, like she just got lost.

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
Like it was like, she was talking about the, you know, the cats that they do have.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And then there was like the cats that we did have.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
And then the cat, and then like, you know, and then she's mentioning like, well, then

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
that cat got sick.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
And then, you know, it's hard with cat.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
And then she was just like, kind of backtracking through this big long list.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
And then a lot of them had like questionable kills in there.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Like, it was sort of like, oh, and then Mr. Peanut, you know, he kept going.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
He kept going near the pool and you can't have a cat go near the pool.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
So, you know, it was like, holy shit, she's Dexter.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
She's cat Dexter.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
Like, she's just making up reasons now.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
I didn't even know this until like, she's just like, oh, and he was, he, he didn't

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
like how loud the fridge was.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
So arsenic in old place.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
Like just fucking, God damn this bitch kills cats.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
And remembers every goddamn one, but she thinks cameras don't exist.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Like, I'm tired of it.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
And don't even be telling me about no dementia or Alzheimer's.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
It ain't that.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
It's not that.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
It's like, it's this, it's this, it's this Facebook, like Trump, like fake news thing.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
It's like this fucking Fox news.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Like, and my mom's not a conservative.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Not that that matters.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
But I'm just saying like, it's this fucking world that's been created around them.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
We took, we took a generation that was like, so fucking orgasmically proud of itself.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
Like just, oh, this is like, they're like, like, like, it's watching a dude bounce around

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
on the moon.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
And like, he's just going like, I'm on the moon.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
You did it.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
You did it.

29:27.000 --> 29:34.000
Teenagers thinks here's Elvis and the Beatles as a reward for putting me on a moon.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
And they were just like, ah, ah, ah, and like, we should have as many babies as our

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
parents did, even though the reason they did is because they fought Hitler.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Let's do it.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
We earned it.

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
We put a guy on the moon and then they're like, peace love and all that forest gum

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
shit.

29:51.000 --> 29:57.000
And then like, like, they're just like, it was just a dangerous animal to put in a digital

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
box.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
That was just a fucked up thing to do.

30:00.000 --> 30:09.000
Like they weren't ready for the, they weren't ready for the fucking lawnmower man threshold.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
They weren't ready to become cyber Christ.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.320
Like, like, like, I should have known from the look in my mom's eye the minute she got

30:18.320 --> 30:20.000
a hold of a Tetris paddle.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.440
Like I should have recognized the look, but I didn't know I was like addicted to video

30:24.440 --> 30:25.440
games and stuff too.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.800
It was just like, oh, they're not ready.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.800
They're not ready for the dopamine.

30:29.800 --> 30:35.000
They're like, oh my God, Jesus, there's a farm on my, on the same screen where I can

30:35.000 --> 30:37.120
check it with my grandkids.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.440
They're just, they've lost their fucking mind.

30:39.440 --> 30:43.880
And then the, and then 9-11 happened and they're like, that eagle's crying in the email.

30:43.880 --> 30:47.000
The eagle's crying in the email.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.120
They freaked the fuck out.

30:49.120 --> 30:53.120
All of us are getting all these emails and all the emails, the coat hanger band and he's

30:53.120 --> 30:54.120
coming for you.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.200
Where's building seven?

30:55.200 --> 30:57.440
The eagle's crying.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.440
It became like a meme.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.080
They're like, dad, stop forwarding.

31:00.080 --> 31:04.800
You know, it's like, oh, here's a Polish joke and here's a fucking crying eagle and here's

31:04.800 --> 31:08.680
a warning about you, pantyhose are giving you cancer and I was like, they're just kidding.

31:08.680 --> 31:13.400
And then, and then, and then, and then the key, you know, some, some fucking clever little

31:13.400 --> 31:18.440
AI figured out, it only took them 25 years ago, like, gee, I guess you could win an election

31:18.440 --> 31:19.440
this way.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.880
I mean, these people technically are allowed to vote.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.880
Fuck it.

31:22.880 --> 31:29.840
Hey, did you hear, there's a black guy under your car, Minnesota, vote for Trump.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.000
And they're just like, click, click, click, click, clickity-clack, clickity-clack, they're

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
fucking idiots.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.240
They weren't ready for it.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.760
They just weren't ready.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.160
My mom, my mom's a similar story.

31:41.160 --> 31:46.680
Like even when I was like early 20s, like there's stuff where it's like very clear, vivid memories

31:46.680 --> 31:50.720
of stuff that happened and stuff that was validated by their stories later on.

31:50.720 --> 31:54.840
Like remember when we did this thing and then it's just like, they just have no recollection

31:54.840 --> 31:55.840
of it.

31:55.840 --> 31:56.840
It's like, okay.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.840
Well, I think it kind of mad too.

31:57.840 --> 32:02.440
And I think there's a little bit of edge to it with me where it's like, oh, Dan, the,

32:02.440 --> 32:09.320
the, the black sheep, you know, the guy with the motor mouth, Mr. Podcast, Mr. fucking

32:09.320 --> 32:14.800
TMZ, Mr. you know, and my mom's super into like health stuff and always has been like

32:14.800 --> 32:16.760
caring about health and alternative health.

32:16.760 --> 32:20.400
And so she's on Facebook now and she's like, you know, these people are drinking down watered

32:20.400 --> 32:21.400
down bleach.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.400
It's curing their cancer.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.480
And I'm like, I don't, I don't think that's happening.

32:25.480 --> 32:28.520
I think you got a, yeah, it's scary stuff.

32:28.520 --> 32:31.920
You got to water down your bleach, by the way, you do, especially if you're going to drink

32:31.920 --> 32:32.920
it.

32:32.920 --> 32:33.920
You can't drink it.

32:33.920 --> 32:34.920
You can't drink it straight bleach.

32:34.920 --> 32:35.920
You got to, you got to, you got to water it down.

32:35.920 --> 32:42.080
I mean, the, truly, like, they got on, they got on that Facebook arc and they were just

32:42.080 --> 32:43.680
like, oh, this is wonderful.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.680
I like the cushions.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.920
There's a slot machine.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.720
How many fucking Muslims are there?

32:49.720 --> 32:51.720
They were just like, what is with this?

32:51.720 --> 32:52.720
What is happening?

32:52.720 --> 32:56.360
There's a SWAT with the Congress and the, what is happening?

32:56.360 --> 32:58.120
They were like freaking out.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.960
And then it was like easy to grab them.

32:59.960 --> 33:03.680
And I, I'm 46 and I was, I wasn't ready.

33:03.680 --> 33:07.960
Like, these fucking, fucking potato people.

33:07.960 --> 33:08.960
How many Muslims are there?

33:08.960 --> 33:09.960
Do you think?

33:09.960 --> 33:10.960
Like, I don't know.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.960
Too many for anybody.

33:11.960 --> 33:12.960
Like, right?

33:12.960 --> 33:14.800
Oh my God.

33:14.800 --> 33:21.920
He said those, that combination of words and then they, it's just the worst.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.400
Like, like, don't, don't fuck up my already bad mood.

33:24.400 --> 33:31.960
Get a bunch of fucking raisinets, raisinets, that's the worst thing you could call somebody.

33:31.960 --> 33:36.680
I mean, thanks for coming out and everything.

33:36.680 --> 33:41.720
I hope you have a safe drive home, but please don't be so stupid that I have to get angry

33:41.720 --> 33:43.520
at you.

33:43.520 --> 33:49.040
And by stupid, I mean, don't have a visceral, autonomic unconscious reactions to things

33:49.040 --> 33:52.800
that sound racist.

33:52.800 --> 33:58.760
Be sophisticated, suck up the toxicity and just process it and just let it go through

33:58.760 --> 34:08.560
all your veins and take it home with you and like wipe it on your significant other.

34:08.560 --> 34:13.400
Seize it in the shower, in a, in a, in a nice, in a steam.

34:13.400 --> 34:18.280
That's what my generation used to do is take it in, you read something stupid on a billboard.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.840
You can't, you can't go, you can't give it a thumbs down.

34:20.840 --> 34:21.840
We didn't have that luxury.

34:21.840 --> 34:30.560
We were just like, I hate it, I hate everything, I hate the sandwich, I hate, I hate Mickey

34:30.560 --> 34:37.240
Mouse, I hate Coca-Cola, I hate corporations, I'm gonna have a baby.

34:37.240 --> 34:41.880
Hey bud, hey bro, hey bud, hey bro, hey bud, hey, you're my bro, you're my baby, but you're

34:41.880 --> 34:44.600
my bro.

34:44.600 --> 34:51.240
I'm never gonna hit you and that's all I'm gonna do.

34:51.240 --> 34:58.560
That's it, that's the Mount Everest Apparenting, hey bro, hey bud, same level, equals, right?

34:58.560 --> 35:02.800
I'm gonna be a fucking horrible person.

35:02.800 --> 35:08.880
That's cool, cool with me bro, I didn't hit you though, never laid a fucking finger on

35:08.880 --> 35:09.880
you.

35:09.880 --> 35:11.880
See, you, you should have a kid.

35:11.880 --> 35:12.880
Yeah.

35:12.880 --> 35:13.880
Nah, dog.

35:13.880 --> 35:21.280
Don't, don't dog me after all that.

35:21.280 --> 35:29.840
I don't want no kid running around my house, I don't know, sometimes, sometimes I, sometimes

35:29.840 --> 35:36.280
I think maybe, I like, I like that they like, I like that they like, like bits, you know,

35:36.280 --> 35:39.880
like, I like that they like songs, like you can make up a song and they'll, they'll like

35:39.880 --> 35:40.880
the song.

35:40.880 --> 35:41.880
Yeah.

35:41.880 --> 35:42.880
I mean that's cool.

35:42.880 --> 35:46.000
But they'll, they'll like, they'll be a fan of the song that you make up, like they'll,

35:46.000 --> 35:51.920
you can like, you can go like, my name is poopy butternut silo, to eat the buttercup

35:51.920 --> 35:55.440
and they'll just be like, they'll start, they'll memorize it, start singing it.

35:55.440 --> 36:00.680
Like they'll, my dad's saying like, like hilarious improv songs all the time, I think that's

36:00.680 --> 36:03.640
why I like bad improv songs.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.760
So that, but, but that seems like a bad reason, that doesn't seem like a good reason to have

36:07.760 --> 36:11.160
a kid, but then you start thinking, well what are you supposed to follow your bliss when

36:11.160 --> 36:13.520
it comes to having a kid, then don't have a kid, right?

36:13.520 --> 36:15.960
Like, like, cause that kid's gonna poop there, pants.

36:15.960 --> 36:19.400
Oh, speaking of pooping.

36:19.400 --> 36:24.920
So we, we went house hunting this weekend, found a really, we've, we've been very picky

36:24.920 --> 36:26.760
and they've taken it very slowly.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.980
This isn't, this isn't like, we need a house.

36:28.980 --> 36:32.480
This is like, where do we want to die or whatever?

36:32.480 --> 36:36.040
Like, like, like, what, what's too much, you know, too much bliss.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.880
Like we're already happy.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.520
What would make it a little ridiculous?

36:39.520 --> 36:44.480
What would make me come home from work every day and go, fuck you.

36:44.480 --> 36:48.120
That's the standard I'm holding it to when I go, I go to these open houses and I want,

36:48.120 --> 36:51.880
I want so much house, I want to like, like take a couple turns and be like, where the

36:51.880 --> 36:52.880
fuck am I?

36:52.880 --> 36:57.360
How many fucking, how many fucking ways to get to the pool are there?

36:57.360 --> 36:59.800
Jesus Christ.

36:59.800 --> 37:00.800
What is this a guy?

37:00.800 --> 37:02.200
Are you, are you, are you, are you, are you a governor to live here?

37:02.200 --> 37:03.200
I'm gonna punch someone.

37:03.200 --> 37:07.080
You showed me a photo of this house, are you, are you gonna be in the pool?

37:07.080 --> 37:09.920
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, you don't strike me as a pool goer.

37:09.920 --> 37:16.800
That pool is all about, dude, that's, that's Cody's gotta have a pool.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.480
And I gotta have a Cody.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.840
You gotta have a Cody that I agree with, but like, why do you have, like, you're not gonna

37:21.840 --> 37:22.840
go in that pool.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.960
So what do you want me to do to, how do, how does this work with your mind?

37:26.960 --> 37:30.280
I'm saying, Cody, I don't need a pool and you do need a pool.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.280
Let's compromise.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.280
No pool.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.280
Are you, are you gonna have pool parties?

37:33.280 --> 37:34.280
Are you gonna be the pool?

37:34.280 --> 37:35.280
Yes, of course I will have pool parties.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.280
No, you're not gonna have a fucking pool.

37:36.280 --> 37:39.280
Why did you ask the question so that you could fight with me?

37:39.280 --> 37:41.280
What kind of co-host are you?

37:41.280 --> 37:45.280
I don't think that you're gonna, you're ever gonna go in the pool.

37:45.280 --> 37:46.280
Okay.

37:46.280 --> 37:49.560
I mean, what do you, you're like, Oscar the Grouch or something.

37:49.560 --> 37:54.280
What do you, you're looking, you're actively looking for like, things to argue about?

37:54.280 --> 37:59.880
I'm just saying, is there a world where Dan Harmon is a pool swimmer?

37:59.880 --> 38:06.200
I'll get in, I'll get in a pool as, as, as little as the next guy.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.200
I mean, I'm gonna.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.200
I want you to go in the pool.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.200
I'm not saying I don't want you to go in the pool.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.200
I don't know.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.200
I just wonder whether you're gonna go in the pool.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.200
I'm going to have a pool.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.200
Right.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.200
I'm gonna own the pool.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.200
Right.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.280
Cody is gonna be very happy.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.280
Be in the pool.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.280
To be in the pool.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.280
Okay.

38:23.280 --> 38:28.320
And the pool is gonna be right there at my house, making Cody and I a very happy functional

38:28.320 --> 38:30.800
couple where I like, I could sit next to it.

38:30.800 --> 38:35.440
If I don't want to get in it, I could sit next to it and make music on my iPad.

38:35.440 --> 38:39.080
Do you think that you might become a pool person after you have a pool?

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
Never know.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.720
Not necessary in order for me to continue to enjoy the pool though.

38:42.720 --> 38:43.720
Right.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.080
Because I'll be like, well, I got that pool.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.920
It's not pool based.

38:46.920 --> 38:47.920
You having a pool?

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
I'm not.

38:48.920 --> 38:49.920
Yeah, exactly.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.320
I'm not like, I can't wait to be a pool guy.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.600
This pool is gonna change me.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.240
It's like this, this pool is gonna be a great thing to have.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.240
I'm picturing you becoming very tan.

39:00.240 --> 39:04.480
Like you're gonna be Ray Winston and sexy beast and you live in Greece and you have a,

39:04.480 --> 39:08.480
you have a pool and that you're just, you're just really tan.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.480
Yeah.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.360
I'll probably just clip my toenails more.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.360
I think that'll do.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.280
Wait, why, why is that a pool connected thing?

39:15.280 --> 39:20.600
Well, because I feel like the pool lifestyle involves more like bare feet and plus like

39:20.600 --> 39:22.880
more company.

39:22.880 --> 39:28.080
And right now, Cody's being way too tolerant of some fucking gnarly shit going on.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.320
Like, I, it's just, I don't.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.320
Break it down.

39:31.320 --> 39:32.320
What do you mean by that?

39:32.320 --> 39:36.800
Like nasty, disgusting toenails right now and I always do, I clip them and then I get

39:36.800 --> 39:39.720
to spend like two days being proud of myself.

39:39.720 --> 39:44.600
Like I'll walk around in the sandals or, you know, I'll get the food and the bare feet

39:44.600 --> 39:51.320
and then I'll, from the, from the door, that's where food comes from, front door.

39:51.320 --> 40:00.640
And I'm just like, hey, thanks, I put a little, little, like, do you ever go get your, your

40:00.640 --> 40:01.640
nails did?

40:01.640 --> 40:06.960
No, I'm never going to do that because I'm, but then the thing is they just shoot out

40:06.960 --> 40:11.880
everything in my body, the hair and the nails and everything just, everything just shoots

40:11.880 --> 40:18.760
out like, like I'm just like a fucking like pustule of like hair and oil.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.000
Let's you and me go get our nails done together.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Okay.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.800
Uh, so anyways, we're doing this, we're doing this, we went to this house, we like this house

40:26.800 --> 40:31.000
and uh, me and Cody liked the house.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.320
Did you say who did pooping?

40:32.320 --> 40:33.320
Oh, pooping.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.320
Uh, yes.

40:34.320 --> 40:41.640
Uh, uh, I was like, really, we're getting so excited because we've been, we've been so

40:41.640 --> 40:42.640
picky about that.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.960
We've been looking at a lot of houses and it's like starting to wonder, I mean, this

40:46.960 --> 40:47.960
is kind of crazy.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.800
Is it possible to please us?

40:49.800 --> 40:53.120
Like, are we ever going to like, and I guess that's okay.

40:53.120 --> 40:56.600
I already got, I mean, there's no hurry, but at the same time you start to think like,

40:56.600 --> 41:01.400
wait, what is, what's like, I guess maybe, maybe houses just suck.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.800
Maybe just all houses, doesn't matter.

41:03.800 --> 41:07.800
And then, and then finally you just walk into one where you're both are vibing it and then

41:07.800 --> 41:10.960
we're walking around like, oh my God, oh my God, this is the best house.

41:10.960 --> 41:11.960
This is the best house.

41:11.960 --> 41:20.080
And it was like a, like a new house and they just built it, uh, and uh, uh, and so they

41:20.080 --> 41:25.840
were having an open house and there were these old ladies hanging out, they were just hanging

41:25.840 --> 41:26.840
out.

41:26.840 --> 41:27.840
It was like a gang of old ladies.

41:27.840 --> 41:31.600
I swear they just live in the neighborhood and they just came there, oh, it's an open

41:31.600 --> 41:32.600
house.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.800
Was it cactus punch?

41:34.800 --> 41:35.800
Cactus punch, yeah.

41:35.800 --> 41:41.640
They, they, they, they were sitting, uh, in the, in one of the, in the, in the side room

41:41.640 --> 41:43.720
and they, one of them had a bag of groceries.

41:43.720 --> 41:46.360
Like they, it was just like, they, they, they just, hey, it's an open house.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.920
Let's go look at these houses and we'll just hang out.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.640
They were just sitting and hanging out with it.

41:50.640 --> 41:54.480
Were they looking for houses or they just, my suspicion is no.

41:54.480 --> 41:58.720
I mean, it just, I, but I don't want to be, you know, I mean, like, I guess maybe one

41:58.720 --> 42:03.400
of them be like, okay, I, I'm going to buy it because I can, I, I just needed to break

42:03.400 --> 42:08.680
it in and feel like I could get, be coming home from groceries and hang out with my friends.

42:08.680 --> 42:11.840
And I don't think, I think they were just lucky lose, you know, they were just like,

42:11.840 --> 42:16.120
uh, they were just hanging out, so, so not, not a crime, but, uh, kind of in the way a

42:16.120 --> 42:17.720
lot, but, uh, but a big house.

42:17.720 --> 42:18.960
So they weren't really in the way.

42:18.960 --> 42:23.280
And then like the lat, it was like, I'm the tail end of, I'm so excited, so excited about

42:23.280 --> 42:24.280
this house.

42:24.280 --> 42:25.280
It was like getting really excited.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.360
I think we're going to actually put an offer on this place there.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.360
You really say, yeah.

42:28.360 --> 42:29.360
Oh my God.

42:29.360 --> 42:34.480
Oh, oh, and there's another, oh, did you, did you see the other bathroom over here?

42:34.480 --> 42:38.920
Oh, and they're like, went in there and it was like, oh, this is a good bathroom.

42:38.920 --> 42:42.920
Oh, oh, like one of those ladies took a huge shit.

42:42.920 --> 42:43.920
No.

42:43.920 --> 42:44.920
In the open house.

42:44.920 --> 42:45.920
What?

42:45.920 --> 42:48.080
It's like marked for life now.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.080
It's crazy.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.480
I'm kind of stoked about it because it's going to be legendary.

42:51.480 --> 42:54.240
Like, oh, I just, but, but it was, I just couldn't believe it.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.240
Yeah.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.240
I took the first poop in your place.

42:58.240 --> 42:59.240
Yeah.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.240
But it wasn't an open house.

43:00.240 --> 43:02.440
I just, you go into an open house and you took a dump.

43:02.440 --> 43:03.440
It's pretty amazing.

43:03.440 --> 43:07.800
That's what the kids would call baller, I guess, for an old lady that's like, like gangsta

43:07.800 --> 43:08.800
old lady.

43:08.800 --> 43:12.960
Like she just took a dump in the open house toilet and then just sat next to it and was

43:12.960 --> 43:13.960
like, what is that?

43:13.960 --> 43:14.960
That's the game.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.200
Like they just go around pooping in people's houses.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.200
So we liked it.

43:18.200 --> 43:22.160
This other place and, and Cody's immediately, she's like, I don't like, I don't like the

43:22.160 --> 43:23.160
vibe of this place.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.160
Like, what's the vibe?

43:24.160 --> 43:25.840
You got to, it's okay for you.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.000
I don't like, I just want to make sure you're not talking about the wallpaper because that

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
can change.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.160
You know, it's like, it's hard to talk about whether you like a place or not.

43:33.160 --> 43:37.000
And like, like, and I don't, I just don't like, I just don't like the feeling of the

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
place.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
I don't like the feeling of it.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.760
And like, I guess the layout and it's like, whatever.

43:43.760 --> 43:48.200
And then the realtor guy is like, you know, and it's great.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.200
It's a great neighborhood.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.200
A lot of great places to eat.

43:50.200 --> 43:53.240
I don't know what's over there is a cafe such and such.

43:53.240 --> 43:59.840
And, and Cody goes, oh yeah, isn't that a, isn't that where Robert Blake shot his wife?

43:59.840 --> 44:01.600
Oh yeah, I think so.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.920
I think that, I think that might be, I think that might be it.

44:03.920 --> 44:04.920
Yeah.

44:04.920 --> 44:05.920
And then we continue looking at the house.

44:05.920 --> 44:06.920
I know that place.

44:06.920 --> 44:07.920
They changed it now.

44:07.920 --> 44:08.920
And we go home.

44:08.920 --> 44:09.920
We get in bed.

44:09.920 --> 44:10.920
We're like the thing.

44:10.920 --> 44:12.440
We're like, I'm like, sure you don't like that.

44:12.440 --> 44:18.640
And then the email Bing and the real, the, it's our realtor say that realtor just emailed

44:18.640 --> 44:21.320
he's saying it was Robert Blake's house.

44:21.320 --> 44:27.240
I was like, but you were talking about you, you, if it's listed, you might want to move

44:27.240 --> 44:29.200
into the, I don't know.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.840
I never said I might want to move.

44:30.840 --> 44:34.560
Well, I mean, like, like what you just talking about the, and by the way, I don't know why

44:34.560 --> 44:36.160
I thought it was listed.

44:36.160 --> 44:41.040
I don't know how I got that conflated, but it goes up for a sale once in a while because

44:41.040 --> 44:43.320
nobody wants to live in the house where the murders happened.

44:43.320 --> 44:48.360
The George Hodel house, Hodel, the Black Dahlia.

44:48.360 --> 44:49.360
Yeah.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.400
The guy who probably maybe killed the Black Dahlia.

44:51.400 --> 44:52.400
Probably in that house.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.400
He killed her.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.400
Yeah.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.400
In the basement.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.040
And that it's a house on a, yeah, whatever.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.040
But it's like, it's like.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.040
It's a Lloyd Wright.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.040
It looks like a stone butthole outside.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.040
Yeah.

45:01.040 --> 45:02.040
It's got this weird.

45:02.040 --> 45:03.040
Kind of architectural.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.040
I don't know.

45:04.040 --> 45:05.040
I would never.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.040
I would never.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.040
I don't know.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.040
Yeah.

45:08.040 --> 45:12.160
Unless my partner was like through the roof about it was like, I want to live in the house

45:12.160 --> 45:14.520
where a famous murder happened.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.760
I, I, I, it would be like a pool.

45:16.760 --> 45:21.640
I mean, I'd be like, well, it's, I mean, you being happy is like very important to me.

45:21.640 --> 45:26.920
I, I, if it's haunted, I guess we can move.

45:26.920 --> 45:32.440
When they relisted it like a couple years ago, the police, like somebody was repraising

45:32.440 --> 45:36.840
the house and they brought cadaver dogs and they hit on the fucking room where all the

45:36.840 --> 45:37.840
murders happened.

45:37.840 --> 45:40.000
So like, like somebody died there.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Yeah.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
And you don't want to live in that house.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.640
It's kind of a closed case that, that, that little nugget.

45:44.640 --> 45:48.240
Well, cause he's dead and it never was official because it's like all the stuff.

45:48.240 --> 45:51.560
There's no, what do you call it, corpus delectus corpus.

45:51.560 --> 45:55.440
But you know, ASPyD, who was on the show, who, did you, did you, did you get, you guys

45:55.440 --> 45:56.440
enjoy it?

45:56.440 --> 45:57.440
Well, don't let me put you on the spot.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.400
Do you guys like, you like our friend, Ryan Kraus?

45:59.400 --> 46:00.400
You're like fuck.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.400
Yeah.

46:01.400 --> 46:06.000
Because we'll, we'll, we'll have him back all the time.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.600
I, I like him as a person.

46:07.600 --> 46:10.680
I think he's a great guy.

46:10.680 --> 46:17.040
But he was telling me that the, that guy who's like the hero of that story is like Hodel's

46:17.040 --> 46:23.360
son who became a cop and then, and then, and then he became convinced that his dad was

46:23.360 --> 46:28.200
the Black Dahlia murder and he basically like spent the rest of his life in retirement,

46:28.200 --> 46:33.040
like building the case and solving it like, like, yeah, that was my dad did it.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.240
And then it seemed pretty legit to me.

46:35.240 --> 46:36.680
And then you can listen to that podcast.

46:36.680 --> 46:37.680
I can't remember what it's called.

46:37.680 --> 46:38.680
Now God damn it.

46:38.680 --> 46:46.040
It's like a serial podcast that's produced by some of the Hodel children.

46:46.040 --> 46:51.360
But then ASPD was saying, yeah, but then that guy lost all his credibility when he started

46:51.360 --> 46:52.360
saying, oh yeah.

46:52.360 --> 46:55.880
And plus he might have been a Zodiac and I was like, really?

46:55.880 --> 46:56.880
That was him?

46:56.880 --> 47:00.640
And I didn't look that like, like, like, like, like, he wasn't the Zodiac.

47:00.640 --> 47:05.680
I mean, whether he was or not, it was like, I didn't, he made it sound like maybe the

47:05.680 --> 47:10.600
same guy that I thought was like a smart, the detective guy that retired and proved that

47:10.600 --> 47:12.920
his dad was the Black Dahlia murderer.

47:12.920 --> 47:19.160
Then later on was like, plus he was the Zodiac killer, which would change things in my head

47:19.160 --> 47:24.240
about whether or not this guy actually, I mean, anyways, not interesting, Dan Harmon.

47:24.240 --> 47:30.600
We don't care about your dumb conversations with yourself about a fucking crime within

47:30.600 --> 47:32.520
a crime within a true crime podcast.

47:32.520 --> 47:34.840
The rest of us are living our lives.

47:34.840 --> 47:36.480
We're into self care.

47:36.480 --> 47:48.760
We're not in a toxic tailspin where we play match games like Best Fiends or Candy Cookies

47:48.760 --> 47:53.800
while we listen to podcasts about murder because we're obviously like having a real hard time

47:53.800 --> 47:55.120
and we're not admitting it.

47:55.120 --> 48:04.800
Like, we're doing yoga and we only listen to shows about yoga.

48:04.800 --> 48:09.320
Are you going through a rough patch right now?

48:09.320 --> 48:10.320
No, I don't think so.

48:10.320 --> 48:12.480
They do.

48:12.480 --> 48:13.800
You heard them.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.520
That was them.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.520
Pay attention.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.520
What was it?

48:18.520 --> 48:19.520
Me talking.

48:19.520 --> 48:20.520
I'm fucking happy.

48:20.520 --> 48:22.520
What's Best Fiends?

48:22.520 --> 48:23.520
It's like a matchy.

48:23.520 --> 48:27.920
It's one of those matchy games where like the matching like shoots the bad guy.

48:27.920 --> 48:33.240
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, where you like it's like you get a bunch of different colored cookie

48:33.240 --> 48:38.280
candy things and then you like, you know, you connect them, connect the ones that are

48:38.280 --> 48:39.280
next to each other.

48:39.280 --> 48:44.080
Have you seen My Best Fiend about Klaus Kinski and Werner Herzog?

48:44.080 --> 48:45.080
Yeah.

48:45.080 --> 48:46.080
It's really good.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.080
Yeah.

48:47.080 --> 48:48.080
Is that what it's based on?

48:48.080 --> 48:49.640
Yeah, it's based on that.

48:49.640 --> 48:50.640
Yeah.

48:50.640 --> 48:53.440
You're killing, you're attacking Werner Herzog.

48:53.440 --> 48:58.840
It was advertised in this true crime podcast called the, I never remember the names.

48:58.840 --> 49:00.560
They're also bad at naming their podcasts.

49:00.560 --> 49:06.240
I think it's called the serial killer podcast.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.400
It's this Norwegian guy.

49:08.400 --> 49:12.760
His name is like Thomas Born Cyborg or something.

49:12.760 --> 49:13.760
Hello.

49:13.760 --> 49:14.760
Thomas Born Cyborg.

49:14.760 --> 49:15.880
Hello, dear listeners.

49:15.880 --> 49:25.320
It's me, Thomas Born Cyborg, Born, here, your Norwegian host, here to talk about the insidious

49:25.320 --> 49:27.640
Jeffrey Dahmer.

49:27.640 --> 49:32.080
And then every time he mentions like, if there's anything that happens in like Louisiana or

49:32.080 --> 49:36.920
Atlanta or anything like that, he affects this weird accent.

49:36.920 --> 49:40.560
Like he starts talking like a, like a, like a Southern American.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.200
Can you do it?

49:42.200 --> 49:43.200
I try.

49:43.200 --> 49:44.200
I try.

49:44.200 --> 49:45.360
I mean, it's hard to do his accent from the beginning.

49:45.360 --> 49:53.920
So like, but it's like, the Toy Box Killer was the most prolific serial killer, depending

49:53.920 --> 50:06.080
on who you believe, Texas authorities say that he might have killed as many as 500 people.

50:06.080 --> 50:11.640
Like he, he just, he just starts talking like his version of Southern Americans just because

50:11.640 --> 50:16.560
he's like, I'm going to give it a little cayenne pepper because we're talking Louisiana here.

50:16.560 --> 50:22.120
And it was like, normally it's charming, but then there was one episode where he was,

50:22.120 --> 50:29.680
the story was about the Atlanta Ripper, which was like this fucked up, like, I can't remember

50:29.680 --> 50:34.640
if it was like during Reconstruction or like if it was during the Civil War or before it

50:34.640 --> 50:41.840
was like around a time like when, unlike now, when things were not hunky-dory, like in terms

50:41.840 --> 50:44.840
of between people talking to each other.

50:44.840 --> 50:49.440
And there was like a serial killer who was like killing, it was, it was, it was like

50:49.440 --> 50:54.520
Jack the Ripper, but in Atlanta and, but, and steeped in racism, like in terms of the

50:54.520 --> 50:58.320
suspect and the, and the who was getting charged and what the cops were doing with all the

50:58.320 --> 50:59.320
time.

50:59.320 --> 51:04.480
And like that, that was like him, he didn't, he didn't, he's purely innocent, but it was

51:04.480 --> 51:11.760
just amazingly, the effect of it being like a train crashes was like he, him reading quotes

51:11.760 --> 51:19.960
from racist cops at the turn of the century, um, in this silly accent and also he sounds

51:19.960 --> 51:24.120
like, you know, the guy from the sugar cubes and like, it's just sort of like the effect

51:24.120 --> 51:29.560
was like, blah, and then the, and the next episode he was like, hello, dear listeners,

51:29.560 --> 51:36.240
it's time for more creepy crawly, a serial killer podcasting, a lot of reviews from the

51:36.240 --> 51:47.200
last episode saying, don't do that anymore, and I won't, my hat, my hat's off to people

51:47.200 --> 51:51.880
that read, read their reviews of anything, God damn, and then, and then take it right

51:51.880 --> 51:55.880
on the chin and make an adjustment or don't, you know, have you totally stopped doing that?

51:55.880 --> 51:56.880
I can't.

51:56.880 --> 51:57.880
I can't anymore.

51:57.880 --> 51:58.880
I can't.

51:58.880 --> 52:00.440
It's hard to get the podcast reviews.

52:00.440 --> 52:03.920
You really have to go out of your way to look for your podcast reviews.

52:03.920 --> 52:04.920
Yeah.

52:04.920 --> 52:10.600
You go on Reddit, right, like, oh, I go on Reddit.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.400
So shut the fuck up.

52:13.400 --> 52:16.160
Just back the fuck off because I'm there.

52:16.160 --> 52:19.120
No, but I'm just, I'm talking about the iTunes reviews.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.120
It's funny.

52:20.120 --> 52:24.640
You know, ASPD, like one of his earliest episodes, yeah, and I'm sorry if you're listening to

52:24.640 --> 52:25.640
this, no offense.

52:25.640 --> 52:30.760
This is reporting facts, but, um, he early on, he's like, give me, give me reviews.

52:30.760 --> 52:32.240
Even a one star review is fine.

52:32.240 --> 52:35.400
That helps me understand what I'm doing and like the next time he invokes reviews, he's

52:35.400 --> 52:39.520
like, give me a five star review and then like the next time he invokes reviews, he's

52:39.520 --> 52:40.920
like, give me a five star review.

52:40.920 --> 52:43.160
I know some of you won't, but please do.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.280
So it's like a real arc he goes on.

52:45.280 --> 52:49.280
Well, I liked it when he said something to the effect of like, give me a five star review

52:49.280 --> 52:53.880
because cool people would do that and don't tend to give reviews and a bunch of assholes

52:53.880 --> 52:54.880
give me one star reviews.

52:54.880 --> 52:59.120
So the fact is, if you don't give me five star reviews, if you think I'm doing good,

52:59.120 --> 53:03.560
like it, it, it, it, it, it, it fucks me up because everyone else is such a dick.

53:03.560 --> 53:04.560
That's the truth.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.960
But it might less say that defensively would right, but it might less be because people

53:07.960 --> 53:11.360
are dicks and more because he encouraged them to do that.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.480
Uh, right.

53:13.480 --> 53:19.040
Well, what I look, that's why I never, ever, ever have said in my life, even before podcast

53:19.040 --> 53:22.400
culture, like I, yeah, I, I don't want to even go near that feedback loop.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.840
I like that idea of having to ask people to rate, subscribe and like it stuff.

53:26.840 --> 53:32.640
I, I'm, I, I don't fault anybody who has to participate in that currency because, because

53:32.640 --> 53:33.640
that's what it is.

53:33.640 --> 53:35.160
It's a currency, but I'm, I'm out.

53:35.160 --> 53:39.240
Like I've, to me, that's like a greenback dollar and I'm like a carpet bag and like,

53:39.240 --> 53:41.600
like, I'm, that's, that's before my time.

53:41.600 --> 53:43.600
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

53:43.600 --> 53:47.360
You're really all about reconstruction in America.

53:47.360 --> 53:53.080
Uh, the, uh, what, what is your hangup with, with post civil war America?

53:53.080 --> 53:59.000
I just think they could have done a better job of, you know, I mean, you, you make a

53:59.000 --> 54:00.920
bed, then you, then you lie in it.

54:00.920 --> 54:03.480
Why, why were there, why were there bags made of carpet?

54:03.480 --> 54:05.800
Uh, I don't know, what is a carpet bagger?

54:05.800 --> 54:10.680
It's just, it's, isn't that like a northerner that's like coming down south to like, uh,

54:10.680 --> 54:13.520
exploit, uh, just everybody or what is that?

54:13.520 --> 54:14.520
Yeah.

54:14.520 --> 54:15.520
Is that what that is?

54:15.520 --> 54:20.480
To take over like, like by property because it's cheap because the whole, the whole autonomy

54:20.480 --> 54:21.480
is gone.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.360
It's like a northern elitist interloper.

54:23.360 --> 54:24.360
Yeah.

54:24.360 --> 54:25.360
Right.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.360
So yeah, nailed it.

54:26.360 --> 54:27.360
Yeah.

54:27.360 --> 54:30.520
That's the thing is like, like, like podcasting is just like, it is the, it's like this crazy

54:30.520 --> 54:32.040
Wild West like thing.

54:32.040 --> 54:36.320
And like, so anybody who's like, Hey, you gotta, you gotta give me, give me scalps or give

54:36.320 --> 54:38.160
me bottle caps or give me horse hooves.

54:38.160 --> 54:42.920
Like I'm not, I don't judge anybody like, Hey, that's terrible, but I'm also not trading

54:42.920 --> 54:43.920
in it.

54:43.920 --> 54:44.920
Yeah.

54:44.920 --> 54:47.840
Hey, do me a favor, give this podcast a one star review and then stick it up your ass

54:47.840 --> 54:50.280
and I'm never going to look at it and I don't care.

54:50.280 --> 54:54.160
Like that's my, that has to be my philosophy or I'd kill myself.

54:54.160 --> 54:58.600
But it does suck cause it's like, like then you're like, well, now you just removed the

54:58.600 --> 54:59.600
meaning from.

54:59.600 --> 55:00.600
Right.

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
It's all this, it's like the Uber thing.

55:01.600 --> 55:04.040
It's the five star reviews have no, no fucking meaning.

55:04.040 --> 55:07.280
It's so stupid because you just want to, you want to rate things.

55:07.280 --> 55:12.960
When you get a, you take a lift and you forget to hit the stars and you just say next.

55:12.960 --> 55:17.460
Someone gasped.

55:17.460 --> 55:20.640
That doesn't mean that you gave them a zero stars that meant that you just skipped that

55:20.640 --> 55:21.640
process.

55:21.640 --> 55:22.640
I think so.

55:22.640 --> 55:26.840
One time I accidentally slipped and hit like two stars and I was like, Oh no, how can I

55:26.840 --> 55:27.960
fix this?

55:27.960 --> 55:31.040
And I called like customer support or where I emailed them.

55:31.040 --> 55:33.840
They didn't get back to me.

55:33.840 --> 55:34.840
It is.

55:34.840 --> 55:35.840
It gives me anxiety too.

55:35.840 --> 55:38.680
I put up with a lot of shit because I don't want to be the reason.

55:38.680 --> 55:44.400
I don't want to ding someone's five, you know, intend to right.

55:44.400 --> 55:48.520
If you accidentally just say skip it and send to lips and you don't give them any stars,

55:48.520 --> 55:51.280
that means that you skipped that step, right?

55:51.280 --> 55:55.000
I think it doesn't mean that you gave them zero stars.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.960
I hope I believe that's the case.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.520
I do it all the time.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.520
Yeah, I don't.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.720
I keep picturing you guys with extra years tonight.

56:01.720 --> 56:04.360
Like Dan's been standing up.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.360
I keep thinking like, what if Dan had four years?

56:06.360 --> 56:07.360
Well, what about six?

56:07.360 --> 56:08.360
Are you on mescaline?

56:08.360 --> 56:09.360
What's going on?

56:09.360 --> 56:13.880
No, that's what's so fucked up is like, I'm like, why is this my brain doing?

56:13.880 --> 56:14.880
Okay, so.

56:14.880 --> 56:18.040
Why is this my brain doing?

56:18.040 --> 56:19.880
How many years do I have right now?

56:19.880 --> 56:20.880
Four is I can't.

56:20.880 --> 56:21.880
I can't picture you as six.

56:21.880 --> 56:26.160
I think because you're straight on like your face and you're facing me.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.160
We'll see now.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.160
I can see sick.

56:28.160 --> 56:29.160
That could be that could be a thing.

56:29.160 --> 56:31.280
You don't have a trick to make glasses tighter.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.280
Do you that?

56:32.280 --> 56:33.960
I got to I got to go to the thing, right?

56:33.960 --> 56:36.840
Well, where do you want them tighter on your ears area?

56:36.840 --> 56:37.840
Yeah, like that.

56:37.840 --> 56:38.840
I mean, they just fall off my head.

56:38.840 --> 56:40.120
They're like there are two.

56:40.120 --> 56:43.840
There's spreads to why I don't know what the terminal best podcast in the world.

56:43.840 --> 56:44.840
It's good.

56:44.840 --> 56:47.760
I think their hinges are to our hyper extended.

56:47.760 --> 56:49.440
You got like the plastic frame.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.240
So I think you need like a hairdryer or something.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.640
You can't just bend it.

56:53.640 --> 56:58.600
You can take it to a to a glass place and then they'll they'll bend them in definitely

56:58.600 --> 57:01.400
the place that sold me the glasses.

57:01.400 --> 57:02.400
Not a glass place.

57:02.400 --> 57:09.680
Not like like like a glass glasses player like a like a like like like Warby Parker.

57:09.680 --> 57:10.680
Sure.

57:10.680 --> 57:15.920
They're kiosks at their home try on kid.

57:15.920 --> 57:18.520
So OK, well, now tell us we don't have a guest.

57:18.520 --> 57:24.120
So oh, I only come here for the surprise guests.

57:24.120 --> 57:31.560
Let's let's bring a surprise guest out of the army of super special kind of a Harmon

57:31.560 --> 57:34.120
town live podcast fan.

57:34.120 --> 57:38.280
The person that's like I only come to this fucking thing because every once in a while

57:38.280 --> 57:42.560
Judd Apatow comes out, I was going to say Judd Apatow and they're like they're like

57:42.560 --> 57:44.240
they're like damn it.

57:44.240 --> 57:46.040
That's 90 in a row.

57:46.040 --> 57:48.200
Yeah, I'm fucking god damn it.

57:48.200 --> 57:56.080
These fuckers I was going to say to bring somebody up.

57:56.080 --> 58:00.480
Should we should we try to know what first I want to talk to Spencer about his surgery.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.840
Oh yeah.

58:02.840 --> 58:05.000
Your hip is OK or what's happening?

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
So I don't know.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.600
I got surgery, it was it was OK.

58:08.600 --> 58:14.160
Oh man, surgery talk.

58:14.160 --> 58:17.080
Can we can we you can we get that drop of that?

58:17.080 --> 58:20.360
Can you take this seriously for a moment?

58:20.360 --> 58:28.400
My man got his hip cut open.

58:28.400 --> 58:29.560
Yeah, I don't know.

58:29.560 --> 58:31.800
It was it was it was a it was a mess.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.360
Hope you get what I said.

58:33.360 --> 58:35.000
I wanted to do the low one.

58:35.000 --> 58:42.360
Have you got what what's the low low one that you want to be more male I won't know you.

58:42.360 --> 58:46.000
Okay, all right, that's a hat and a hat.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
Nope.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
That's sorry.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
That's a hat and a hat.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
Sorry.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
That's a hat and a hat.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
I had on a hat.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
That's a called a hat.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
A hat.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Not a hat.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Yo, I'm a hat on a hat.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
Yo, what you think about that comedic spin on top of spin?

59:02.000 --> 59:07.000
Nothing ironic here, ask him, yo, someone starts to do something weird.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
Then something else is weirdness is beard.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
So you got weird with a beard.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
That's double weird.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
And that's just confusing.

59:14.000 --> 59:20.000
Yo, sometimes they call it a sock barrel in some different kinds of writer rooms.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
It's an unnecessary connection that confuses people.

59:25.000 --> 59:33.000
Like if your character's name is I think if your character has cancer and then he's

59:33.000 --> 59:39.000
talking about the zodiac and then he's like I'm a cancer and then people are like is that

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
supposed to be a joke or what they're like.

59:43.000 --> 59:52.000
You got to change it to cap record because otherwise that's what they call a sock barrel.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:00.000
But comedically we call it spin on top of spin usually like if you're doing a hilarious

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Star Wars spoof.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
What are you doing?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
What are you hitting?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Come on.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Just let Spencer talk about a surgery.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
That's the point.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
That's been on top of spin.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I'm being the asshole.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I'm interrupting his surgery talk with like being a goof guy on the thing.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And then you're like the gas pedal.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
That's not a gas.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Well, that's two gas pedals done.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
That could be really funny.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I don't know or or maybe maybe or maybe you're maybe if someone's already got their foot

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
on the gas then the pedal that you're hitting is is the break is another way of looking

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
at it spin on top of spin hat on a hat sock barrel sock barrel.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
What do you call it when Jeff's doing that and then someone makes the lights all funky

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and crazy.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
That is.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
What is that?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
He hates it.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
He hates it.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
It's pretty funny.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
It's so mad.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I'm mad.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I must have resting mad face because I am fucking bored.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
All right.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I fantasizing about an iPad game.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Why is our show two hours?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I keep looking at the clock.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
We have 300 hours to go.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I don't know.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I mean, you know, show us so long.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Yeah.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Yeah.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I mean, who else has a two hour podcast?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Anybody?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Well, what's his name?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
P. Holmes has like a five hour podcast, but he's crazy.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
That's fair.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yeah.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Okay.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
So your surgery.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Yeah.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So I don't know.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.240
So yeah, I was I was gonna like my mom wanted to be involved and you need someone who you

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240
care about.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240
No, that's not a prerequisite.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:14.800
You need someone that you trust to get you home from the thing because you can't and

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.880
then they're supposed to watch you for 24 hours apparently, but you can't just like

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.560
call an Uber or taxi apparently because like if you die, like if you start dying in a taxi,

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.360
I guess they'll dump you out or something.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360
I don't know.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.000
I don't know where the thinking is there, but so it's like a cat starts puking on the

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
carpet.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Yeah.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
They're like, no, no, no, no, no.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
You just lifted.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Yeah.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.440
When my cat starts puking on the carpet, I try and stuff like a shirt under there so

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.560
you and she starts freaking out and run away and I'm like, no, you stay here and barf

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.440
like a good boy.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.720
So you went under general anesthesia and you have to have somebody take you home.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.720
Yeah.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.400
I mean, I wasn't going to drive myself home, but lift is like a thing now.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.240
It seems very easy to get someone and whatever.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.360
I did have a mug you when I when I went under there was a whole rigmarole there that I didn't

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.800
expect to be so because I was like I just want to take a car and they're like well.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.120
We have a car service that we can provide, but blah, blah, blah and all this stuff.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.640
It started to get so insulting that I was just like, yeah, fine, because I always perceive

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:16.720
that as like people trying to act like I'm like they're like, you know, that's going

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.880
to cost you money and I always have the opposite reaction I should have, which is like I get

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.040
mad and want to throw money at them to prove that I'm like, you thought I was a clamp it,

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.520
but I'm a Beverly Hillbilly.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.280
It's got to be like a liability thing, right, which is always the worst reason for things

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280
to happen.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280
You did take a lift home from the.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.280
No, no.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.920
So I got my mom, she was going to she was going to come over and take me there.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.480
And so I was like, okay, so be in my house at noon and then we could get over, we could

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.880
drive over and be there at one or whatever.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.800
And then so like I was taking a nap because I was getting nervous and I was like, I don't

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.880
want to be conscious anymore.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.920
This is thinking about stuff is a bad idea.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:01.680
And so I took a nap and then I woke up and my mom like sent me a text at like 1155 saying

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.400
like, all right, I'm on my way and she lives like an hour away.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.600
And I'm like, wait, what the fuck?

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.600
And then so I call her up.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.240
I'm like, well, how far are you?

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.840
And she's like, I'll be there by one.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840
Right.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.400
And I was like, no, we got to be there at one.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.760
And then I start freaking out and then she's like, okay, I'm sorry.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.360
And then I had to get a lift over there and then she met me there.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.040
And then we were kind of late, but it ended up being fine.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.120
And I thought like the surgery was going to start like shortly after one, but then we

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.240
had to wait for two hours for it to start.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.620
And I was like, well, Jesus Christ.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.960
And then I started getting like less ready.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.440
Like I was like, it's two hours.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.520
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not stand for this.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.920
Like this sucks.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.680
And I was just getting really nervous and stuff.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.800
And then finally they, they took me in and what they did normal stuff.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800
They, oh yeah.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.760
The anesthesia guy came by and he was like, are you ready?

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.280
And I was like, I guess, and he was like, you guess.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.760
And I was like, yeah, I mean, I guess I've been waiting for like two hours and I started

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.200
to like psych myself out and he's like, well, you know, usually people are always mad at

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.640
the anesthesia guy, save an earful for your doctor.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.720
And I'm like, I'm thinking like, what the fuck are you talking about, man?

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.600
And then, and then my mom like senses this tension or whatever.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.280
And then she's like, are you ready?

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.680
And the guy's like, I guess, and I'm like, what the fuck?

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.040
Like this is totally unearned.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.360
He has this chip in his shoulder because like apparently he, he feels like he takes a lot

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.320
of lip from nervous patients who are about to get cut the fuck open and killed and brought

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320
back to life.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:31.240
It's like the anesthetics, like the highest paying job in the hospital, right?

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.000
Like he could fucking take a knee for this.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.600
Like Jesus Christ, count your money.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.920
But it really pissed me off.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.280
Like it put me in a terrible mood.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:44.120
And and then like the doctor came by and I was like, well, this guy is doing just fine.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.920
Like I don't want to yell at this guy.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.920
Not that I was yelling.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.840
Like I was really just being nervous and explaining that I was nervous and the guy took it as

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.840
an insult.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.760
Like they, they, uh, they roll me into the operation room and then the fucking anesthetic

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:01.120
guy, he, I started, I see him start to just, uh, just to drip like my IV drip and stuff.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.200
And then he puts the thing over your face and he's like, this is just oxygen.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200
Just breathe normal.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.200
And then I'm like fucking out.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.200
And like the, the whole time before I'm out, I'm like, I don't think this is just oxygen.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.920
I think he's applied an anesthetic without telling me.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.360
And I think I'm just going to lose consciousness or handling.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.760
That's exactly what happened.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.760
And it was, it sucked.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.720
And then I came back up and I was like, wait, what the fuck?

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.920
That wasn't just oxygen.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.920
That fucking asshole.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.520
I don't know if he was like beat, he was like punishing me.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.440
Like he was being a dick because like he thought I was mad.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.360
Anyway, I, I come to and it's fine and I'm in pain and it's fine.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.680
It's like not that bad.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.640
It's always surprising at how like not bad.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.640
I don't know.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.000
Anyway, um, I was, I was pretty woozy and I threw up and then I was like, I think I'm

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
going to throw up again.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.580
And they rolled me in a wheelchair over to the thing.

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:48.040
And I had to like, I had to like, like, you know, get myself over to the toilet, like

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.840
to throw up properly and they were like, Hey, you just project all about it from your wheelchair

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.840
all the way into that toilet.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.840
That's impressive.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.840
I was like, hell yeah.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.440
And I explained to the, I explained to the nurse that I'm actually really good at throwing

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.920
up because, uh, when I used to smoke pot all the time, it would sometimes make you throw

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.440
up and I smoke pot in my car.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.400
So I'd have to learn how to throw up while I was driving.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.400
Oh boy.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.080
I became really good at throwing up is, is the long and short of it.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:17.600
I could throw up into my mouth and then fling it out of the car like a catapult, um, to

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.880
kind of get it to clear the side of my car, so it's not splattering all over the side

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880
of my car.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:27.040
And I was telling you, this is a, this is a, I'm not supposed to do this, but I'm just

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:34.640
letting you know I'm not married right panties were dropping and, uh, yeah.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.960
So we went home and I, I wasn't feeling great and I was just shaking our whole family because

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.480
has issues with anesthetic.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.840
So it wasn't great.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:47.580
They gave me Percocet because I had bad reaction to Vicodin and the Percocet, I wasn't feeling

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:52.200
it at all other than it just made me feel like I was like, uh, dizzy and losing my

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.360
fucking mind.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:57.280
And so I kind of weaned myself off of that and just was taking Motrin and that like,

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280
I don't know.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.960
I, the pain was a lot better than I expected to, and I had to be on crutches for a while

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960
until Friday.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.800
And then they said, I didn't have to be on crutches, but like, it kept being like I would wake

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.440
up in the middle of the night or my cat started vomiting and I would just react to the situation

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.440
and not use my crutches.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.040
And I would be like, Oh shit, I'm walking.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.040
This is nuts.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.120
Um, and then I would like realize I probably shouldn't be walking and stop, but like it

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.120
didn't feel bad or anything.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.320
So now I'm walking around.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.320
It's great.

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:22.720
Um, it's the worst thing is just you have to ice yourself and then you have to like

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.120
lay in bed all this time and I was like, lose my fucking mind.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.320
I've been going through some dark times, having like absolutely nothing to do with like the

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.120
pain I was in, just like, I like, and nobody likes me.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.120
I want to shoot myself in the dick.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:39.360
Um, speaking of my dick, um, one of the things that the doctor told me way too late in the

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.440
process is like your, your, your, your penis might be numb for a few weeks and I was like,

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.400
wait, this is not part of the deal.

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.120
I, I, I'd be like, I'll, I'll, uh, I'll see you on the ice.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.120
Yeah.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.120
Yeah.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.120
Yeah.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120
Yeah.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120
Yeah.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.120
Yeah.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120
Sure, buddy.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120
You try and stop me.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120
Yeah.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.440
Why, why, why was your penis a casualty of that surgery?

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.120
I think just the anesthetic guy.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120
Okay.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:12.320
No, um, he just, I guess, I guess Tony put in a request for the limp.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.320
Was he right?

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.320
Did you, did you have a numb penis?

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.320
Yeah.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:20.760
Um, I, I, I think I have a back, but it's not, I'm not, I'm not, that was very unnerving

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.760
out of everything.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.960
Um, but the idea is they, they, they get into your hip joint, right?

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.600
So they, they put a post between your legs and then they get you up on the thing and

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.200
then they put like an, uh, like, uh, a handcuffs around your ankle and then they just like

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.000
pull your leg really, really hard for the entire duration of the surgery.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.640
So it's mashing into your groin and then it's like the handcuffs are on your ankle.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:46.800
So you have like, I had pretty sharp pains in both of those areas from the surgery because

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:50.360
it's just like you're being stretched as if on a rack for like two hours while they're

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.560
doing the surgery.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:57.160
And so that wasn't great, but, uh, yeah, Percocet, uh, was suck like velvet on those

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.160
cuffs.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.560
I mean, yeah, or like, they can't like move my dick out of the way.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.560
Like what the fuck?

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.000
It seems like there's plenty of groin to go around.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.160
Like I don't, there's ways they could design, put a hole in it or something.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.160
I don't know.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160
There's ways around this stuff.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.160
I'm sure.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.240
They're doctors, but, uh, that's been my experience.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.400
I'm, I'm finally every day, like after the surgery, I felt like very noticeably better

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.040
and more mobile and more capable of moving around.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.640
Like to the point, like I was a bit shaky, um, even yesterday when I have weight on my

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.320
left leg and now it's, uh, it's, I can walk pretty, it kind of hurts to walk without looking

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.720
stupid, but if I want, I can kind of walk mostly normal, um, without, without looking

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.880
like, you know, a person with a limp or anything.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.240
I, yeah.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.760
So it just, it was just weird.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.120
I just felt like they were, uh, they were very business-y about it.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.520
And it's like, well, come on, man, I'm just, I'm freaking out over here.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.520
Yeah.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.120
We don't, uh, we don't, we don't, uh, heal people.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.720
We just, uh, wait, how's that, how's that saying go?

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.480
We cut the bad stuff out.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480
We're not healer.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480
We don't have healers.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.480
Wait, what is it?

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480
Something, I don't know.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.480
There's no, that's clerics.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.680
The, the, the medical business isn't about, it's, it's like an engineering thing.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.720
It's like science, you know, it's not a, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:14.760
there's, there's no healing, uh, to it, which, you know, if you, if you, it's, thank God,

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.400
there's science involved for sure.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:26.760
But, uh, but, uh, but it's also like, like a sick person is obviously like, they have

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.280
two things wrong with them minimum, the thing that's wrong with them.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.840
And then the fact that things being wrong with you is like scary.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:40.120
And we, we treat it like, uh, taking your car and like, oh, we have this replacement

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120
part.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120
Do you have insurance and all this stuff?

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.000
And it's like people are, and then people are getting traumatized by the experience

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.320
of being treated like a car.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.320
Right.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.840
You're also very cagey about telling me the price of things.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.000
Like I had to agree and set the schedule of the surgery and then agree that if I changed

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.360
the date of the surgery, I'd pay $400 before they would tell me the price.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.000
And that's gotta be like one of the only places that happens where you don't know like what

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.680
you're paying before you agree to have paid it already.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.040
It was just a very weird experience.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.200
It really set everything up to be pissed off in myself.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.360
Do you have insurance or?

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.800
Yeah, but I don't know how any of that shit works.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.000
That's something they should teach in schools, like how insurance is supposed to fucking

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.280
work because I just, I, you know, people are like, oh, you know, your premiums, your out

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.520
of pocket, your total, your maximum deductible.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.640
It's like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:34.480
Insurance is another thing exactly like rating systems that once it becomes institutionalized,

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.280
it loses all, it's, it just doesn't make any sense anymore.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280
Just play around.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:46.320
If a cop can pull you over and like put you in jail for not having insurance, then it's

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.680
not insurance anymore.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.800
Now it's part of what allows you to drive a car.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:59.120
It's like a driver's license to colon first blood part three, like, like, and I understand

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.480
I'm not like, I'm not so much of a hippie that I'm like, we don't need insurance and

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.320
we shouldn't be encouraged to have it.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.760
I got someone explained that to me that if I hit someone in a car that doesn't have insurance,

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.920
they're fucking me over, I guess.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.100
But I don't know, man, it's like, like people talk about that, like it's like the most common

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.100
sense in the world.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.800
I'm like, you know, we're through the looking glass.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:24.560
It may be common sense through the looking glass, but isn't there a more common form

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.560
of sense where you don't have to go through the looking glass where it's like you're just

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.720
normal people?

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.720
Like, you know, there's got to be a system we can figure out.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.280
Well, I mean, that's the thing is that they take, they take advantage of the fact there

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280
is insurance.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.280
So the people are like, oh, you got to go into insurance and the insurance is like, I don't

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.280
know.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.280
Talk to the doctor.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.280
The doctor's like, I don't know.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.600
The medical company says the bag costs $600 and it's like all of you are lying.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.040
If everybody is, if what everyone is paying for is like some weird bet that you might

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:59.640
not get sick, then why does the end result of it always still that like rich people are

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.600
more allowed to get sick than poor people?

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:08.000
If that's the case, what, can't we just make a system where it's called Medicare for all,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
right?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.640
Like where you just go, oh, you can't have any, like, like, it got a groundswell.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.440
It seems like the answer, it seems like any answer to that question, like, why don't we

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440
do it this way?

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.960
The answer is because that would be horrific immediately, which is a good, you know what

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.960
I mean?

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:30.840
Like even like, I think it is horrific, even conservative, like hardcore capitalist, anti-socialist

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:38.400
healthcare people, I believe would not, they would take one look at a system that was absolute

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:45.760
draconian like cat private healthcare system where like you going, your kid had a cold

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:51.600
and you go into a hospital and it's like a McDonald's menu, like cold $500, like, like

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:59.560
the, and all the permutations of that system, like the rich would also go, oh, no, no, no,

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560
we can't have that.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.560
Right.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.560
Well, I mean, I think that that is something people are doing is just, can I pay out of

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.240
insurance, what's your, what's your day rate as a doctor, and then those, those prices

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.080
are actually, it depends on the thing, obviously, and I don't think really bad things, it's

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.640
good for, but I think that that's something that has worked for people, which obviously

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.960
you shouldn't go a complete capitalist enterprise, but skipping the insurance entirely and just

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.000
paying the doctor what the doctor needs to order the tools and stuff.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.520
I think actually does help because it's not again, like three layers of middlemen all

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.520
fucking you.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.440
It just kind of feels like the, the whole healthcare thing was invented to make the,

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.640
one of the most important things in the world as boring sounding as possible.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.640
I think, yeah.

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:45.040
Where it's like, like, like, it sounds like, why do I feel like I'm 14 and it's, we're

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.720
talking about Nicaraguan freedom fighters, like, I like with Peter Jennings, like, I,

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.480
like why is my brain turning off when what we're really talking about is, if you're poor,

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.960
do you have a right to live as long as a rich person because that's, that's an exciting

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.960
conversation.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.960
Right.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960
That's some Star Wars shit.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960
Yeah.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960
They want to obfuscate it.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960
It's, yeah.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.760
It's like, and, but it almost seems like everyone wants to, you know, like everyone wants to

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.840
make it complicated and, and, but like, yeah, anyways, okay.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.880
So that's that part of the show.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.880
Game of Thrones.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.920
Game of Thrones.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.400
I binged it.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.400
I'm all caught up.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.760
I'm all caught up.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.560
He's all caught up.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:29.040
Uh, that was really funny when they, when he goes, uh, hey, brand the broken, it's got

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:35.400
a best story and then they bothered to cut to Arya Stark and she's like, like, it's crazy

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.960
to include that shot when you're the one that wrote that line of dialogue and shot it.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.520
Like, it's like, like, and then you're in the end of pain, like cut to Arya.

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.520
That's great.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.520
I love that look.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.920
She's, she's, she's playing the curb your enthusiasm theme in her head.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.920
Yeah.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.920
No, I love that look.

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920
I love that look.

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.120
She, she's saying, I have the best story ever.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:01.080
I saved the universe, I literally started as a little girl that wasn't allowed to play

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:06.200
with arrows, saw my dad's head get cut off and ended up killing the devil for the crippled

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.920
brother that you just said has the best story.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:17.520
He looks like John Oliver lost his glasses, uh, and had worse breeding and was, was, was

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.520
hard.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.520
That's tough.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.520
Wow.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.520
Yeah.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.520
Wow.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.560
Yeah, why, who picked that fucking kid?

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.560
That was really punching out.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.280
It's not that kid's fault that he got cat.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.480
That's like, when you cast kids and then you watch them go through puberty on camera, like,

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480
what am I doing?

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.760
I was like, why was it that group of people that got to decide who the nice king is?

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.280
Cause they're lords.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.920
Here are some people that have a better story than brand.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:46.400
No offense to brand, uh, Hodor has a more interesting story.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.440
He's just not there either of the dragon, but let's go, let's go, let's go alphabetical

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.440
order.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.440
Yeah.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:59.200
I would say most of the white walkers, just even the skeleton, CG skeletons, they've

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.840
gone through a lot of shit.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:08.040
But that skeleton horse, you know, that motherfucker is like, he's like, it's a living, it's a

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.520
living.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:15.040
How about, how about, uh, uh, uh, John Snow's hairline that that that there's some interesting

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.040
stories there.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.040
What the fuck?

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.040
That dude needs bangs.

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:24.960
That's a weird take, what I thought his hair was, I don't know why everybody, what I am

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.960
so distracted by that random hairline.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:28.960
What do you mean?

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.160
He's got like a little, he's got like a little half committed count, chocolate, a fucking

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.840
widow's peak that comes.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.080
It's just like a little seismic burp, like in the middle of his hairline, it's like

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:45.480
off center, like it's not, it doesn't even, it's like, uh, are you, are you, are you Eddie

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:50.200
Munster or, uh, because that he has symmetry, right?

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.240
And purpose, like, like, I'm not, and again, it's like, it's genetics.

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.280
I mean, we're talking about just the natural thing going on that there, I'm saying, don't

01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.440
tie your hair back.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.280
You got to, you got to, you got a weird thing in your hairline.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.240
Give that guy some bangs.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.840
He'd look cute with bangs, like, I think they show him at the end and he's like, all right,

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:13.400
time to go, uh, work at the, what was up with him walking off into the woods with a bunch

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.760
of children and is that a spinoff?

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:17.760
That's a spinoff.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.880
It's like a job now.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.360
It's like, uh, you should go work on the wall.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.160
You should go work on the night's watch now and he's like, there's a night's watch.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:31.400
And then, uh, and then there wasn't a night's watch and there, there, there wasn't one.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.660
It's like, there's no wall.

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.080
So what the fuck is going on?

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:41.200
But his red haired friend who, uh, yeah, who said, no, I'm going to go, uh, that's a pirate's

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:46.800
life for me and then he's like working at the DMV and fucking like, Hey, I want to talk

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.800
about pussy.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.800
Oh, great.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.960
That guy, his whole arc is, his whole arc is, I can't get laid.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.520
He's like, he's just kept talking about how he used to get a lot of pussy and now he can't

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.520
fucking, yeah.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.640
I, I, yeah, he talked too much about it.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.880
I'm glad that lesson got learned.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:06.160
I'm glad, I'm glad he wasn't like the guy that got laid the only thing that was good

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160
about it.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.680
Uh, the game of thrones was that berries on after it because that shows fucking a good

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.640
I still haven't watched berry.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.640
Huh?

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.640
I haven't watched berry.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640
Oh, get up on that one, man.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640
It's fucking great.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.640
I still got Atlanta.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.640
I got to get through all through Atlanta.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:22.080
I mean, alphabetical order.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.640
I got nine seasons of Atlanta now and then you got to go to berry and then, uh, cab,

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:38.200
cab, cash, cab, cash, cab, cash, cab, cash, cab, fucking berry.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.360
That's really good.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.000
There's an episode where it's just a fight, or is he fights, have you guys seen it where

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
he, Lily and what's it, uh, god damn it.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.880
That is a fucking good, I don't know how they write a show like that.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.200
It's really, really funny.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.200
All right.

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.360
Well, don't make me mad at it before I watch it.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.960
You can also be a good writer too.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.520
I know, but you're starting to make me, you know, just don't push this button.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.600
I'm saying this show breaks boundaries and pushes borders and you're a bad writer.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.600
Okay.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.640
I don't like how he kills people.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.880
I was watching an episode and he like killed someone.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.920
I'm like, I don't like this.

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.560
Yeah, it's fucking weird.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.320
I don't like that he's learning to act.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:21.040
Yeah, it's just, yeah, it's like, why am I supposed to root for his acting career?

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040
He kills people.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.280
That's not cool, but, but then he goes into the acting class and he's good because he

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:31.000
just killed somebody, but that's, but he shouldn't do that.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.960
All right, let's play D&D.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:43.720
Yeah, where would we even start Spencer saying that we did that like how, how would that

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720
go now?

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.240
I mean, we could, we could talk about it.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.800
I've always been of the opinion that a big part of the problem is you guys don't remember

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:53.080
stuff and part of the reason you don't remember stuff is because we only play for like five

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.240
minutes and we only play like once every three or four months.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:01.160
And I think it's hard to remember five minutes, three months ago, but, but I, I miss a structural

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.160
problem.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.480
I miss, I miss playing it.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.480
So I want to play again.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.480
Yeah.

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.480
No, I miss it too.

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.600
But I just think that I, you know, to the extent that we want to actually get to a place where

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.560
you guys feel confident and comfortable playing it, I think that that's truly a big hurdle

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.160
to, to leap or such.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.560
Yeah, that would be a good start.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.680
I'm willing to, I'm willing to let's do it for sure.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:32.000
I have a prediction that we can play for 20 minutes every episode and still we're going

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.520
to be like, wait, what happened, where did that guy go?

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.720
I think that's fair.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:41.160
And then every, every four weeks, a third of us isn't going to be here.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160
Do you have your gear with you?

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.160
No.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.160
We don't need it.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.160
We don't need it.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.160
You guys look at it.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.160
I guess you do.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.320
I mean, yeah, you, you want your, your character sheet for, you know, yeah, hypothetically,

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:56.680
yeah, but you'd have to do a good walkthrough and like bring us back to where we were.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:57.680
Right.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.680
Let's, you want to try?

01:22:58.680 --> 01:22:59.680
I mean, sure.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:00.680
Shall we?

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:01.680
Oh, good.

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.680
All right.

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:03.680
Bring him up, sir.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:04.680
Who's got dice?

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.680
Do you have our character sheets as well?

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.680
What's your name?

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:07.680
Tommy P.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.680
Tommy P.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.680
Thank you.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.680
Hey, Levy.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:11.680

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.680

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.680
We need Levy.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.680
It's your Memorial Day show.

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:15.680

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.680
There he is.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.680
Levy.

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.680
Yeah.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.680
Yeah.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.680
Yeah.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.680
Yeah.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.680
Yeah.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.680
Yeah.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:24.680
Yeah.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.680
Yeah.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:26.680
Yeah.

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.680
Yeah.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.680
Yeah.

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.680
Yeah.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.680
All right.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.680
Now how should we start, Spencers?

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.680
You want music and you give us a little breakdown?

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.680
Yeah.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:49.680
Last time on Harmon Quest, our heroes.

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:50.680
Harmon Quest?

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.680
Harmon Quest comes to TV, not on the, on the computer.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:01.600
I saw someone like Karmic Quest season 2 I think aired on Comedy Central something like Europe or something

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.320
I don't know, but I saw a screenshot blew my mind

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.940
We're not getting money from that. I know shit. Where's my money?

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:16.160
The guys the people they had they had left they had left the town. What was that town fightsville or some shit?

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.120
They left fightsville because they felt like they did a bad job

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:26.960
And then they met a cult that did exercises and they did exercises and then they left the cult and found another cult

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:33.880
That was summoning a demon and then they helped them summon the demon and then the demon came out and started killing people

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.200
And they were like well this sucks

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:41.480
Let's leave and then the church militant came and slaughtered the demon and then then they were like well

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.920
Yeah, we're a lot worse than this than everyone else is so let's stop doing this

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:51.120
Let's be a farmer and then they went to go be a farmer, but they didn't actually go anywhere

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.840
I think they were deciding to do that and so we rejoin our heroes

01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:03.680
Now or in the future depending on which they choose at a point at which they had been farming or made a decision

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:16.840
To start farming and we're gonna go about doing that now

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.000
You got your dice. I got my dice. All right, so

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:30.920
All right, I any question. I examine my surroundings. All right, you're in a you're in an empty field

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:35.200
You see a bunch of slaughtered cultists. Oh wait. Well, do you want to be farming or do you want to be?

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.120
Deciding to be farming and go to search out a farm to farm it

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:43.360
I say we're kind of half like half heartedly farming right now. All right

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:50.360
You found the town of Potos Donos the farming village. There's about it's not much of a farming village

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.920
There's like six farms and there's only there's only a handful of people you haven't really met them

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.880
You just kind of you rolled up on a farm

01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.600
You killed a fucking ghost that was haunting the farm and then you're like well

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.240
I'm gonna I'm gonna take this farm now you started farming it feels like the earth had been salted or something

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.520
So you're making a really hard time hard time getting crops out

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:15.800
But this is your first harvest in the first in the first half of your farm and your other half of the farm is just ready to

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:20.720
Be planting. Okay. Hmm. I'm Chad the fire liker. We have diarrhea junior and

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.340
Harmon is Carlos Carlos the unimaginative

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.500
Unimaginative Carlos Johnson Carlos

01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:34.340
And give me because it's been so long give me class and and he's a cleric

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:40.820
Diarrhea juniors a fighter and you're a druid. I mean, yeah, I'm a numb druid potato basket

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.500
Coming up

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:48.980
Guys

01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:50.780
not very full does it does it does

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:58.180
Does this seem kind of diminishing like we used to be fighters and like we were on on the on the quest now

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.180
We're just we're just growing potatoes

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.340
Well for me the big relief is

01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:06.380
You know just knowing

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:08.580
What I'm trying to do

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:12.140
You know, even if I'm yeah, okay. I'm not the best potato farmer

01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:15.780
I didn't think I was gonna be but you know, I felt like a bigger failure

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:21.140
You're handling people's lives than these potatoes here. We were bad at the other thing too, like

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:26.420
Come on, let's talk. Well, we prepare dinner. Come on. Guess what guess what's for dinner potatoes?

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:29.820
I'll wash you peel. Okay

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:35.220
This way. We're not we're really we're not hurting anybody but ourselves with these potatoes. Amen

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:38.540
I take out my my dagger and I start peeling potatoes. I'm

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.380
Piling them on a plate ready for peeling

01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:47.460
Scrubbing scrubbing them with a rag and a bucket of warm water that I had heated up from the river

01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:53.420
Are we doing a potato lock goes with a side of mashed potatoes tonight?

01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:57.420
Here, why don't we do this you dunk each potato in the water?

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:03.680
Okay, and then and kind of give it a pre scrub hand it off to me and then all we got like assembly line

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.680
I'll hand it to him for peeling. Okay

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.580
Thank you. Good job

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:16.620
Nothing like a clean potato. Nothing like a nothing like a perfectly peeled potato. Yeah

01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:20.580
Gentlemen I

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:28.060
Appreciate you guys doing this with me. Yeah, I mean but

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.580
Carlos you

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:41.500
You had like ambitions like to like to be a like a cleric that wanted to like purify

01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:48.240
The world yeah, that's right and remove evil and get rid of all demonic stuff and now

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:53.260
What are we doing? We're fine. The more you want something more it hurts to be bad at it, right?

01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:55.820
It's terrible. I

01:28:55.900 --> 01:29:01.420
Mean is there a way to retry like they kind of put our feel like that's what babies do like like that

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:06.540
Well, when they're bad at something we go you can try again and they're like I'm kind of old and I was a priest

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:09.660
And it's like I you keep killing people and not knowing what you're doing

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.260
Like it's some point if you're saying to that guy. Oh

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:19.660
Come on try again. It's like it's enabling. Okay, so you're saying just potato farming is good enough for you

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:21.660
No, like you're you're you're

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:23.460
Which is fine

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:27.220
That's what you're okay with. Well, I'd like to see the day when I really

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:33.220
Is really hungry for adventure. I guess I mean I haven't seen that day like I'm still recoiling from being so bad at

01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:38.180
I mean, do you think that that demons don't exist anymore that that you that the world doesn't have

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:48.260
Come on after all the stories we've been through I know exactly yeah, I know demons exist

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:55.220
Okay, so you and you're you're you're over it. You're you're you're good to go now that you like you're happy

01:29:55.220 --> 01:30:00.660
You're happy. Hey, tell me you're happy. Look me in the eye and say that you're happy right now

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.420
I can't tell you that

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:06.860
That doesn't that's not I wasn't happy before either. I was anxious

01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:11.100
I'm trying to I'm trying to find the thing that makes me happy

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:17.620
But more importantly also that hurts the least people I want to help the world. I feel like I was kind of getting in the way

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.900
Diarrhea, are you gonna say something something on your mind young man? I

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:28.380
I mean look, it's it's not as fulfilling, but this this this potato farming really is scratching an itch for me

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.780
I'm gonna put these in the oven. I'm gonna invent the oven

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:37.100
Damn

01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:43.820
I'm gonna I'm gonna put these in the equivalent of an oven. It's a kiln. It's a potato kiln hell. Yeah

01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:51.940
I I cast a fireball to heat up the oven faster. You do that. I

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.700
Mean, I still have I still have powers. Yeah, me too

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:03.620
I heal the potatoes up. They're raw again. Now you now you got to cook them

01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:05.940
They're unpeeled

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:13.060
Yeah, the farm didn't have ready access to water and Dan's ability to create water was instrumental in growing the potatoes. Oh

01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:16.420
That's just a bit of backstory that's

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:23.980
Spends I think we're wasting our talents right now. I think are there rival farming families

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:27.220
There's one rival farmer. What was her name?

01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.100
Ketamine

01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.460
All right

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:33.460
She's a hard worker and she's really

01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:40.060
Really a competitive about farming which like you don't have to be and like the market's not saturated enough for that to be a thing

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:45.740
But she's like she's always been doing that and she's better than you because she's like she comes from a line of farmers

01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:50.340
And she has a much better farm on a much better. What's her crop of choice tobacco? I

01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:59.980
Think she's delightful. I met her on Tuesday. She's fantastic. She's a fire plug. You guys sit down. You're gonna if these are gonna go cold. I

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:15.060
Gotta say you knocked them out of the park again. They're they're growing all right. Yeah. No, it's the they're good

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:20.900
But you're not you're not jealous of that tobacco money that that Ketamine's Rick. Of course

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:26.180
Oh, she's gonna be better at farming than us. She's been at it forever. We should make friends with her and learn to farm. Okay

01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:34.100
She might be single you hear a knock you hear a knock at your door, huh? We hear knock at the door. Yeah, I

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:42.260
Get up and go and answer the door. It's a it's a it's a it's a man. It's a raccoon man. He's like he's a beast man

01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:44.060
He's a raccoon

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:48.540
That's like yeah, there's all sorts of fantastical races. You've seen him around town

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:53.700
You notice that you notice his name or you know his name's Tom and he's a shopkeeper in the area

01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:59.500
He sells all sorts of supplies. It's like hey, so glad you glad you're settling in looks like first harvest is coming

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.740
You do oh a lot of money for this property

01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:07.980
Well, so I mean that's no big deal, you know, we we we just want people to live here

01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:12.340
But over time you might want to be paying paying that off come up with a payment plan

01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:17.820
Well, we we have a lot of gold from our last quest, don't we sure is that Tom out there?

01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.300
Yeah

01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:28.540
Yeah, it's bring them in you have some potatoes. Come on Tom come in have a potato. Yeah hungry. Yeah. Yeah, sure

01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:31.020
How's it going? Don't go digging in the garbage cans

01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:35.060
He's sorry, that's racist

01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:47.260
This is this is some crops you got going these are this year this year yield, huh? Yeah, yeah, I mean obviously we're not that good yet

01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:52.580
No, that's fine. No one's it is when they just start, you know, I I started selling stuff when I was a kid

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:58.420
I didn't know what to charge. Do do we buy this land from you? No, no, but I do own most the land

01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:01.700
I don't mind it and I'm not gonna be a bad guy about it

01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:07.460
But I mean, you know, it's just that land is like a big thing. You're you don't seem to be lords so like, you know

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:09.460
We didn't charge you for killing the ghost

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:11.300
Yeah

01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:15.460
Well, I could give you a big discount. That's a that's a great point. I'll knock off

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:22.580
He does he pulls out an abacus and he starts doing a thing like yeah, we'll take 10% off of that. That's fine

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.580
Yeah, just keep me at get our abacus

01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:31.220
That's a coincidence because we're all also having a deal on ghost killing and

01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.660
I just make the beads the same

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.700
It looks like even Steven

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:46.540
I don't want to be a grumpy Gus, but there was a buyer on this house even with the ghost

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.740
So I don't feel like it's that much of a value, but I'm someone wanted your haunted ass house

01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:56.620
Yeah, man, the farm from from properties going from this is a nice neighborhood. You think their potatoes taste this good

01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:02.300
I they don't I can't tell I got to make a calculated assessment. That's part of being a

01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:09.620
Entrepreneur, let's give this guy a potato. All right. Look like we need to sell some potatoes. Obviously yeah over time

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.740
Yeah, no you guys are farmers. This is like in your wheelhouse, huh?

01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:16.380
Yeah, I mean we're learning we're getting right. I'm sorry

01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:21.020
You're comparing us to this person that I don't believe exists that wanted to buy a haunted house

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:27.620
Oh, yeah, they did her name is Kagura. She loves busting ghosts. Actually, you know, I think she's busting a ghost right now

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:30.540
You hear outside in your farm area. You hear a fire

01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:34.820
Well, there's a I hear fire. You hear a fire

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.620
I'm getting up putting my napkin down

01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:45.020
Leaving my silverware and going outside. I follow Carlos. I love fire. So I'm excited

01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:48.020
Because I'm Chad the fire liker. Yeah

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:51.860
all right, so you go out back to where your farm is and

01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:56.500
Not not much of your farm, but say about five feet of your farmland

01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:03.540
Has been replaced by a giant tree and that tree is on fire and outside of that flaming tree

01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:07.620
No inside of that flaming tree. You see a ghost. It seems to be trapped. It seems like a wraith

01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:13.860
You guys know about ghosts a little bit. It's a wraith and arguing about that wraith is a is a is a

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.860
woman who looks like a druid and

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:24.100
She has like a mask on the side of her head like like a tribal mask and she's yelling at a small mole a mole man

01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:30.180
They're arguing. They're like the mole man's like I can't I don't care what you want to do with these ghosts

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:36.180
This is not a place for you to be used your magic. This is someone's property and she's like I can't I can't be told

01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:41.140
When or where to bust ghosts. This is just my my calling if you need the but ghosts gone anyway

01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.260
So they're arguing about that

01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:49.940
And she's a druid. Yeah, she's she looks like a druid. So I'm a druid too. Oh, yeah, it's no a secret language

01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:55.220
Oh, yeah, I go. Hey, yeah, what's what's what's the beef? They're like, hey new guys

01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:01.260
I was tracking this wraith tried to catch it in the spirit tree, you know, I conjured up a tree. I'll help you

01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:06.220
God, I got this tied up. You want to take care of this mole game off my back. That'd be cool. I

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:11.580
I sense motive on the on the mole. All

01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:18.740
Right the mole he's just he's like a classic. What do you call it?

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:23.220
Like he loves laws and rule of order and he's just he has a lot of

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:27.860
Festidious laws you saw him when he first moved to the town he wouldn't shut up about laws and stuff

01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.140
He's telling you you're always fucking up

01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:32.340
but he doesn't really do much about it other than show up and yell and so

01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:36.660
He's he's been doing that and he's like this is an unauthorized druidic magic zone

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:42.100
You can't be putting trees up in places and that's kind of his angle is she's infracting the law and she's like, you know

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:49.140
I've got to kill this thing. It's like was this thing here before she put the tree here or is the tree containing the thing?

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:52.020
I'm a little confused. She was chasing the wraith

01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:57.300
So she was chasing it across your farm and she could finally caught up to it and cast this tree to catch all right

01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:59.780
Well, I think I can settle this. This is our property and

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:03.500
It sounds like if we give permission for there to be a wraith tree on it

01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:10.580
Then then there's no law being broken. Well, that's all well and good, but I believe this is Tom's property

01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:16.980
So maybe we should get him is he around Tom's actually he kind of wandered out to see that. He's like hmm. Oh raccoon Tom

01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:21.940
Yeah, yeah, well, he was just eating our potatoes and I mean we're kind of subletting

01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:27.160
Tom's like well ghosts don't help anyone really so I think I'm okay with this. Yeah

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:32.200
Yeah, thanks for the wraith tree. Oh, yeah, it grows wraith berries

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:37.720
So he's this is safe now here. This is well, it's on fire

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.200
So you got to contain that but the fire will burn out along with a wraith should be good pretty soon

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.920
Oh, okay, unless it escapes. Didn't you Carlos? Didn't you create water?

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.800
I yes

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.000
What was that Spencer? That's a spell. It's a cleric spell create water. Okay, sure

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Uh

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.560
Sure, let's see if that works and if I put out the

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.480
Wraith tree fire. That's not what's keeping the wraith in it. Well, that's actually yeah, it is

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.560
So let's wait for the wraith to die and then then we get that we're gonna wait for the wraith to die

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:12.760
Okay, for the yeah, what do you guys want to talk about?

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:18.920
The moles pissed and leaves it kind of burrows in the ground and I'm all

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:23.720
Thanks, we understand that you um what you

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:25.720
We're trying to do

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.080
Tom's like, do you know about the church of Corlax?

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.160
I don't believe we do

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:38.920
Oh, man, Corlax is great. He uh Corlax. Oh, yeah, he exchanges goods and services for money

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.920
Oh

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.360
Check this out

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.040
He has a church

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:50.920
Yeah, I'm a worshiper right he kind of he starts praying and throws some coins on the ground and the coins

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.880
Poof away and then in its place is like a small wooden toy. It's like that's some god, huh?

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.640
Wow, that's

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:02.120
Depending on how much you like wooden toys. Yeah, that's a great god. I love toys

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.760
Well, you can have that just take that on me and I won't add it to your total

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.680
Thank you. Yeah, what kind of toy

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:21.160
Hey, did you get there? It's a wooden toy. What kind of toy is it Steve? It's a it's a it's um

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.720
It's the it's a it's um, you know, uh, what kind of toy is it Jeff?

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.080
It's uh, it's a it's a boat

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.640
There you go. It's a wooden boat

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:36.360
That's super useful. It is

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:41.400
It's fine line between a toy wooden boat and a cup, right?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.640
It looks like it can hold a volume of liquid

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.160
Could come in handy later we could use it as a cup

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.160
Could use it as a cup you can whittle it

01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:01.480
Is is tom still there tom's tom's hanging out. Yeah, it hasn't been too long

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:07.400
Tom tell me tell me about the church of Coralax because we we dabble in the religious arts ourselves

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:11.720
What goes down with the church of Coralax? The symbol is a brass

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:14.280
tri helical knot

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:18.280
congregates engage in rituals that exchange monetary and

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:24.040
Like uh, what do you call it trade goods for services and and other goods?

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:29.800
So it's not all wooden toys. You guys do other things. No, you could get seeds. You could get uh, it's boring

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:35.000
You could get demons who do stuff for you potato scenes. Yeah, like also such a stuff

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:40.200
The god just likes commerce. Our potato seeds just other potatoes. That's true

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.400
Yeah, there's also

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:49.560
We're the fucking worst potato farmers. Well, we're not good yet. What yeah, but we don't even know how potatoes work

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:56.600
We're not fucking good yet, right? Like were you a good adventurer before you were an adventurer?

01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:01.800
You know what? I thought I had potential. Well, we have potato gentle

01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:06.760
Yeah, I plan words. I just came up. I uh, I slap

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:13.960
I'm I'm I'm I'm uh homesteading now. So my dad instincts are kicking in

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:20.920
All right. Oh, do you have a give me a good potato joke like a dad potato joke?

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:26.200
Uh, uh, how does that why why are potatoes so good at democracy?

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.400
Why because the eyes always have it

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.840
Oh, shit

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:40.280
It's pretty good. They have eyes for those for the for our urban listeners. That was better than I expected potatoes before they come to your your

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.160
hormone

01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:45.320
GMO

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:52.200
A kiosk, you know where I come from in Wisconsin potatoes have little warts all over them that you have to pluck off

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.760
Called eyes. I think I believe those are just roots root tendrils

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:04.520
That's the potato saying please let me be a potato. Let me live don't eat me

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:10.520
And then you say peel off the eyes of a potato and then you eat before you eat before you eat them, right?

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.160
Do you ever feel guilt about that?

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.160
Now that I describe it. I do. Yeah

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.680
Yeah

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.560
But I mean, what are we doing if we're not just murdering potatoes all the time? I think well, I look

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.440
Will they or won't they am I right?

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:38.760
Um, well, uh, tom, uh, thanks for coming by. Thanks for the toy. Um, thanks for the uh information about your religion

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:41.720
Yeah, man come by anytime. I'll pray something up

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:43.720
Great

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:45.800
And uh, how do we do it?

01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:49.000
Uh, how do we pray things up? You can't do it super easily

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:53.000
It takes like a couple circles of initiation to learn the rights and stuff

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.920
But we could talk about that. I mean I charge of course for those training courses, but here we go. Okay. Thank you very much

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:05.880
This is my religion. This is my religion. Yeah, we're gonna. We'll come by. We're gonna come by next sunday

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:07.960
Don't join the cult

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.640
But we just moved here. Okay, just will you

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.520
But you think they'll have horses?

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.080
Oh, we got horses

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:20.360
Can you conjure horses? Oh, yeah, I got horses in the back. What's the name of this god?

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:23.800
Corlax, Corlax

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.600
But it's random. You can't just get horses

01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:30.600
Diarrhea. No, you got to pray for them and pay the requisite price

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.200
Okay 25 gp

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:36.200
20

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:41.000
Dp gp gold pieces. Oh

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.000
25 dp. That's a very that's a lot of dp

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:49.320
Chad get your head out of the gutter

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:56.280
Uh, we'll think about it. Tom the landlord. Goodbye. Thank you. See you man. Thanks. We're very friendly tenants. Thank you

01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:01.640
Thanks for living here. This is cool. Look, I'm not for religion, but I love horses and toys

01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:08.200
So well, I look you can do whatever you want, but I don't I just look I'm trying to get rid of him

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.920
and uh, I

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.800
Look

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.480
you guys

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.440
Maybe we should all split up into different potato farms

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:26.040
What I just so much, you know, you're always asking should we be potato farming that can't be the right way to do it

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:35.160
Are you asking me if I'm satisfied being a failed potato farmer? The answer is no, I'd rather be

01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:43.400
I'd rather be uh, I'd rather be trying to kill demons. Yeah, so, you know, maybe this is

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:48.600
Tom

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.000
Is Tom still there? He's with an earshot of yellow Tom

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.600
Yeah, hey, hey, uh

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.040
You got any demon trouble?

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:00.600
Uh

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:04.920
Not now. I mean, okay. Fuck go go away. This guy. Okay. I

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:10.280
You were right Carlos. You I was wrong. You were right. Maybe tomorrow that guy didn't have

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:17.080
Oh, there's a nor'easter coming in. Uh-oh. We're gonna catch our death of cold. Let's get inside tell some stories

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.640
Okay, come on

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:22.520
I I I go in and I use uh, I cast

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.800
Torch fingers

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:27.960
And I light a fire. All right

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:30.520
Oh

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:35.080
Those potatoes got me feeling like uh, I think I'm gonna turn into a potato

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000
It's a lot of starch. It's you know for a guy who's named diarrhea. It's really

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.960
I'm so constipated. Oh, no, really? Yeah

01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:51.160
There's just potatoes all the time. There's a lot of starch. We need roughage. We got to get some uh

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.560
So we should probably talk about

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:55.960
In light of our conversation with Tom

01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:00.600
We got to figure out how to monetize. I mean, we're only growing enough potatoes to eat right now

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:04.040
We're living on property that he claims is not ours

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:07.960
And then we feel like we're just kind of squatting because we call the ghost here

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.280
It's I mean, do you think if we join their cult they won't charge us?

01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:18.760
Well, it seems like he might be more sympathetic, but then again, there's always the danger that you know

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:21.480
We get sucked back into a world. We don't want to be a part of

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:25.880
Or or even, you know, you say back like a world of adventure

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.640
But what if we just end up being shitty potato farmers that are in a pyramid scheme?

01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:37.800
Well, didn't that happen last time? Well, I mean in a manner of speaking. Yeah, I I'm I'm I'm fucking miserable you guys

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:44.040
I hate I hate this life. I want to like I'll do anything other than just fucking grow a potato

01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:47.240
You ever fucking see a potato? Yeah

01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.280
What are you talking about? They're the worst

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:57.160
They're just well, how do you feel about olives? Huh olives? I give olives four potatoes. Damn

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.080
What are we doing?

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.120
You're right. Let's fucking split up. Let's fucking like I

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.560
I mean, it doesn't have to be so dramatic like like oh, we hate each other. We love each other

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.320
But like we were a band of adventurers and then I was like we're doing this badly

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:20.840
What if we were potato farmers? You guys came with me, but like, you know, and now you're like, I'm miserable

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:27.640
I'm miserable. I'm like, you know, I'm not happy, but you're not happy. I'm committed to giving potato farming a chance

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:31.720
You were our leader. You were you were the guy that was the most driven among us. Yeah

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.400
Yeah, and now look at you. Yeah fucking potato, man

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:40.040
Take that back

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:46.120
No, I won't take it back. You're a potato man. You're nothing but a fucking potato, man

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:50.680
Damn, I'm looking at you right now and all I see is a potato. That's savage

01:48:50.680 --> 01:49:00.200
You you are you are a mean what? Oh, that hurts that that doesn't feel good

01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:07.400
Oh, I don't like the way you say it what say what I'm not a potato man

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:13.080
I'm a human being tell me tell me tell me why you're not like prove to me why you're not a potato man

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:19.560
Because I'm I I don't see any evidence to the contrary. I'm a farmer. There's a difference

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:24.840
I I I live off of the earth when you call me a potato man. You make me sound like I'm not a human

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:31.560
Like I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm doing my best. I'm accountable to society

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.120
I'm not a potato man

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:36.760
You're a big baby

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.840
You're a big

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.840
pyromaniac baby

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.360
Whoa

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.360
You're ungrateful too

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:49.960
You know like I like I do most of the hoeing

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.960
I peel all the potatoes

01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:53.800
You want to peel a potato?

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:57.640
No, I mean I would if I had to I could do all of this by myself. Okay

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:03.000
And so if you're not happy, you know, none of us are happy. We're all like we're all right

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.480
But it makes it worse for you to be like, I'm not happy while we're already not happy

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.880
like it's like it's like if we're in a rowboat and

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:15.640
Uh, you're like, this isn't a ship and then like jump it up and down on the rowboat like trying to make it a ship

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:22.200
It's not gonna okay. Let's not fight. I'm sorry. I'm being I'm being aggressive, but like I I just I feel incomplete right now

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.800
Old man kingdom

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.120
Going down the valley

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:38.360
Treasure for a blood throne

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.960
Blood throne for a clan

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:51.880
Dragons reach and I'm the horses on the sleigh

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:01.320
Caves and tombs and ale

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.440
Come your way

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:10.200
Is that maybe sing a little old adventuring song from when we used to be on the road?

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.200
Can I sing the next verse?

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.200
I'll sing it with you. Yeah

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:16.200
Yeah, go ahead

01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:20.680
Wait, you want it. What do you want for me? I'll sing along with you. Oh, okay

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.520
Oh

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:39.880
I don't know all this thing is really

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.440
Making me really hopeful for the future. I was like

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:47.720
I haven't heard you sing like that in a long time

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:51.160
It was so beautiful. I forgot how much that song meant to me

01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:56.680
Yeah, you see this you see the tear. I'm a little embarrassed. I didn't want to wipe it away because I thought I'd try to touch it

01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.680
Because those lyrics are as true today as they

01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:02.600
Why do we become farmers? We should have become musicians

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:06.600
It could have been a rambling band

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:13.240
I'm not gonna be a negative guy. I mean that might be the way maybe we feed ourselves from the land and then we go do music

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.560
During the day. Yeah

01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:21.560
I'm willing to give that a try. It sounds like a do you guys really think I'm a good singer? Yeah

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:25.880
That really touched me. I'll say I'll say this you're a better singer than you are a potato farmer

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:30.120
And that that means a lot because you're a very good potato farmer. Oh, yeah

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:37.400
Well, all right. Well first thing in the morning, we'll go down to the town and we'll we'll see if there's like, I don't know

01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.200
Music jobs. Yeah

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:47.240
Yeah, I'm feeling good about this. I feel fucking I I haven't felt this excited. Oh, see that's great

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:54.360
See, it wasn't about choosing between potato farming and adventuring. It was about finding the adventure in the potato farming life

01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:56.760
Yeah

01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:02.760
Guy comes over I need rent. How are we gonna make that rent? I don't know get frustrated had a little fight made up started singing

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:10.120
