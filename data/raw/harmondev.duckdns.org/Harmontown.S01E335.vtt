I was told that by common sense.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:13.000\nIt's a national holiday.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:16.000\nMen and women have fallen for our freedoms.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.000\nAnd yet we have almost a full house right now.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nI know. Well, I guess it turns out to be a good night to do a show.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nThat's the upshot.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nI mean, yeah, since we're all here, we'll make it worth it.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.000\nBut, you know, I think the fact that we are here is a crime.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nAnd treasonous, really.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nThese aren't times to be fucking around\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nwith the definition of what it means to be a proper American.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:45.000\nYou know, that's a razor thin high wire\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:49.000\nthat we have to walk every day with a lot of nuance.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nWhat kind of American do you think you are?\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\nI don't mean to be glib, but, like, what...\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\ndefine your Americanism?\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nLike, what kind of patriot are you?\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nUh...\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nCan you give me, like, some categories that exist already?\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nI don't know. Are you a, like, cynical patriot?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nAre you... Yeah.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nWell, that was easy. Yeah.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nI mean, it's like, you know, you don't have to...\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nyou don't have to try to think of things for me to talk about.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nI guess the point is that the...\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nlike, being a patriot right now is complicated.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nOh, yeah. No, it's like I was saying.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:33.000\nYou know, it's incredibly nuanced, incredibly subtle, paradoxical.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nI mean, it's just...\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nyou need a surgeon's touch to...\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:43.000\nI didn't want you to connect that, Todd, but...\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nI didn't say anything. I didn't.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nYeah.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nYou're gonna make a hole in a person's toe and fuck it.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nYeah, anyways. So, yeah.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nWell, you know, yeah, I was obviously being sarcastic.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nYou can literally be a semi-literate fucking...\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nfucking crazy.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:03.000\nHe's a... We have a madman on the throne.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nDid you see he had that? He had those speech notes.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nHey, guys.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nWhat's up?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:12.000\nHe had those speech notes that someone took a picture of,\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nand he wrote a chomlishment.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nA chomlishment?\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nLike, instead of accomplishments like ACH and then no P,\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nlike a chomlishment.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nI mean, there's a lot of words to misspell,\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nbut I feel like accomplishment's not high up on the list.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.000\nIf this were an ideal world, he would be allowed to be dyslexic.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nThat's not dyslexia.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nSorry, sorry, continue.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nI think it is dyslexia.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nHe doesn't know how to read or write,\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:45.000\nbecause when he looks at letters and words and things,\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nthey're jumbled, and so unlike a lot of our friends\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nwho had that learning disability diagnosed for them\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:54.000\nin their third grade and put the extra effort in\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nto re-unjumble the shit as it comes to their brain,\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nhe just was dishonest about it.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nHe just was like, oh, I'm not going to go to school,\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nand then here you do my homework.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nWhatever the fuck he did, I don't know.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nWe've got a lot of people in the world\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nin a lot of states of literacy.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nLiteracy is a spectrum.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:13.000\nIt is.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nThere's a ton of people who are illiterate in America.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nWhat I'm saying is...\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nIt's a crazy figure.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nI can't say he's illiterate because he has read a teleprompter before,\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:27.000\nbut we do know that I would be comfortable diagnosing him as dyslexic.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nI believe the frustration that he experiences\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nwhen he tries to read a prompter\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:35.000\nand when he tries to say things and stay on book and stuff,\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nand he's obviously gotten a lot more dopamine spikes\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nfrom going off book,\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nand that's why even though he's kind of dumb,\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nhe has that ilan.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nHe feels like he's flying as long as he's not reading.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:51.000\nSo even though he's saying the dumbest shit,\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nhe's like, this is so much better than reading!\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nYeah, but he...\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nI guess that's like me with math.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nIf I was just like, 8 plus 8 is 99!\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nI'd be excited too because I'm like, don't make me think about it.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nI almost don't know it's 16.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nI'm going to get yelled at.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nAnyways, what I was going to say is in an ideal society,\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nit would be great.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nWe've had presidents that are holding themselves up at the podium\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nbecause they've got polio legs.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nIn the midst of, we need the strongest person in the world right now.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nWe need to be so strong.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nIt's like, my polio legs, they hurt so much and I can't...\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nBut then the photographers are like,\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\ndon't take pictures of those polio legs.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nWhat do you do?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nAn American needs strength right now.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nAnd you know...\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:38.000\nAnd we had presidents who were like,\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:41.000\ntheir wives are really running the country\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\nbecause they're having insulin attacks or something in a caboose.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nI think that's the same guy, I can't remember.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:47.000\nIn a caboose?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nYeah, wasn't there like a train going around\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nand there was like a president's wife who was like,\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:54.000\nhe says he's proud and you guys are doing great\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nand you need more canals.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nAnd he was like...\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nWhose wife is this?\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nOne of the Eisenhower's.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nI think there's only one Eisenhower.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:12.000\nIt was like the third Roosevelt before the second Bush.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nYeah, but there were four Eisenhower's.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nFour Roosevelt's, yeah.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:22.000\nAnyways, it's sad that the culture of dishonesty, Jeff,\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nis what I'm saying.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.000\nThank you.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nLike why does the truth have to be a bad thing?\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:34.000\nWhen we now know how much obvious lying can be tolerated,\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nit's so close to saying it's okay to be honest\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nwhen you're just like, I'm not dumb\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:45.000\nand you have a dumb hat on, you know?\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:50.000\nYou're one lie away from us, no need for the hat\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:53.000\nand you can just say you are dumb\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nand then we can open a book with you\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nand you can look at it and you can go like,\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\nI still don't like this book, it makes me feel dumb.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:03.000\nThat's because you are dumb and keep working at it.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nI can't work, I'm president.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nWell, yeah, we know and we elected you because you're dumb.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nThere's a lot of dumb people in the world.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nWe love dumb people, but let's try to get smarter.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nYou know, it could all be honest.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nBut no, it's all just lying.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nEverything's lying now.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nOh, yeah, I can't believe that person said that.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nOh, did you hear what they said?\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nAnd it doesn't matter if it's true or not,\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nit's just like whether they said it.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nIt opens the door for vampirism.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:33.000\nPeople that lie, they've figured it out.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nThey can say the things that you're supposed to say,\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nwhether anyone believes them or not,\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nthat's a terrible world to create\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nfor your shitty little children.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nAre you ever going to have a child, Zink?\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nNo, well, I don't know.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nWell, I can't declare that.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nI don't know if I do.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nWalk me through that.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nWhen a man loves a woman.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:07.000\nChildren are made by two people.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nThey take a Spencer.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nYeah.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nSo I can't be the arbiter of like,\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\noh, no, I'm definitely not that one.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nWould you like to be a father of a boy or a girl?\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nI'm getting up there in age and I don't...\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nI still, no.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nCody and I are up in the air\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:27.000\nand we're staying there about it.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nAnd I just...\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nIt's getting to be a harder sell every day.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nDo you think that's something that you could enjoy?\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nI think I kind of feel like if you got to ask yourself\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nthat about something, you know,\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nthen maybe you take a pass.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nYou're going to be 46 soon.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nWhen's the last time you ordered in a restaurant\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nand we're like, do you think that's something you could enjoy?\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nYou know, like you don't order that stuff.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nYeah, now like, who are you?\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nCharlie Chaplin?\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nYou don't want to be a 46-year-old dad now, do you?\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nSure.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nAlso, whatever factors are in...\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:08.000\nIf I don't know for sure that I want to be or not,\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nthen why do it until I'm for sure...\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nIf you had to pick, would you want a boy or a girl?\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nI don't...\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:19.000\nI just would want it to be, you know,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:22.000\nable to take care of itself.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:26.000\nWhat a great dad.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nWhich is the gender that feeds itself\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nas soon as it comes out of the womb?\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:35.000\nLike a deer that just like spends some time being adorable\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nand then just like runs off and starts eating leaves?\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nIs that a boy or a girl?\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nThat's a girl.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.000\nBoys are fucking nonsense.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nI mean, you know, there's no...\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nLet's face it, both genders are fucking garbage.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:56.000\nCan we at least rise to that level of awareness?\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nThey're equidishly bullshit.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nI will absolutely cop to it.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nThere's a million things that only guys do that are fucking awful.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nI listened to true crime podcasts.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nThere's not even a debate about that.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nIt's not a philosophy.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nIt's not like, ooh, we're socialized to believe that.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nIt's like crazy, like men are monsters,\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nphysically violent monsters.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nHowever, when it comes to who's garbage,\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:21.000\nlike all humans, 85% of all humans,\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nno matter what category, just dummies.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nBut if you had to pick, you would pick what?\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nI don't know. Honestly, I don't know.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nI can't figure out which would be worse.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nWould you rather be a father of a boy or a father?\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nI understand the question.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:40.000\nI'm saying, who do you think is better, male or female?\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\nWhat do you think is easier for you?\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:48.000\nHonestly, I don't know because it's pros and cons in both.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nI mean, from a crime perspective,\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:55.000\nyou're talking about, do you want to worry about someone\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nor do you want to worry about a million people\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nthat that person leaves and goes and...\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:05.000\nSpencer, would you rather sire a daughter or a son?\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nI don't know. I don't know.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nIf you go by stages...\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nI go by stages.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:17.000\nBoys suck more earlier.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nThat's what she says.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:27.000\nGirls are cooler, like zero through three and a half.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:31.000\nIt's like, why is she so cool?\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nHer brother was a bag of dicks.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:43.000\nBoys start to get a little more whiny and throwin' shit around\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:50.000\nmore earlier, but then everything starts to rolly coaster.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:51.000\nGo on.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:56.000\nI'm saying there's sign waves of ugly adjustment periods\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nand stuff from what I've seen.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nThere's no science to it.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nI would accept if somebody had a report that said,\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:08.000\nlike, I'm speculating from my anecdotal observation.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:13.000\nI think little girls, baby girls, are initially,\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nlike, if you spend two years watching them from birth\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nand then parallel to them, you're watching a little boy.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nFrom my experience, it seems to me,\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:25.000\nand I paste this largely on watching videos\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:29.000\nthat I get texted by ants,\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:32.000\nbut, like, it just seems to me,\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nlike, the girl makes you want to go,\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:37.000\nlike, I hope we have a girl.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nWhat is that reaction?\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nNo one knows what that reaction is.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nIt's just all it is is mugging.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nThere's nothing to that.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nNo one knows what you're doing other than not liking me\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nor what I'm saying.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nYou said you get a video from ants.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nYeah.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nOkay, okay.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:58.000\nHas anyone gotten a video from an ant in their lifetime?\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:03.000\nOkay, yeah, we see some hands there.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nWe're going to be okay.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nAll right.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nDid you think I meant the insect?\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nI just thought it was funny.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nYou're scared because you've always said\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nyou're scared that ants are getting smarter.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nThe insect.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:17.000\nAnd I keep saying, Jeff, it's summertime.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nThey get more active in the summer\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nbecause they're, like, heat-based insects.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nThey like water.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nBut every year, you forget the previous summer\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nand you're like, they're taking over.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nI'm like, no, it's just you left a sandwich out.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nThat's it.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:35.000\nI just never receive videos from the ants.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nI don't get ant videos.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:40.000\nDoes your mom have a sister?\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nDoes she?\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nDoes your mom have a sister?\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nShe used to.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nDamn.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:51.000\nOkay, well, she doesn't anymore.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:55.000\nSomeone's walking out because of that.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nJust walk that guy.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nHe didn't like it.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:00.000\nDoes your dad have a sister?\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nHe used to, too.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nDid they have phones?\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nUh-huh.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nDid they have phones?\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nYes.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:07.000\nDid the phones have video cameras in them?\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nNo.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nSee?\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nThat's why you're confused.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nBut why ants?\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nWhy?\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nBecause moms and dads aren't the only things\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:20.000\nthat come out of grandma's.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:24.000\nWhy ants?\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:28.000\nBecause if I got a video from my mom of a two-year-old boy,\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:32.000\nshe'd be a kidnapper.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:35.000\nOh, God, damn it.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:39.000\nHappy Memorial Day.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:43.000\nWe have, as every year, because we're proud to do the show,\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:47.000\non Memorial Day, we have some of our war trivia.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nI read an article that said that the first Memorial Day\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:55.000\nwas like freed black slaves that were memorializing the fallen,\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:59.000\nand then everyone was like, nah, we're starting Memorial Day,\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.000\nand kind of just crushed that out of history for a while.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nYeah, I've got that right here.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nShit.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nI stole your thunder.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:12.000\nThere was a big battle over it, and there's a cemetery\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nwhere you can go see all the Memorial Day soldiers\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\nbecause it was a big war over who started Memorial Day.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nIt was like a Second Civil War.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nI got it right here.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:29.000\nNantucket, 1897.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nSo this is well into the reconstruction,\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:37.000\nand like Spencer said, black soldiers, or they weren't soldiers.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nThey became soldiers because they were trying to celebrate\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\na new thing they called Memorial Day.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nThank you.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:43.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:47.000\nAnd then a white, the cavalry, it was a cavalry unit,\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:51.000\ncame by and said, stop that, and they got in a big fight.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nAnd it's in Nantucket.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:56.000\nYou can go see the cemetery where all their bodies are buried.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nThey all killed each other.\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:01.000\nIt's the only war that ever happened where everybody on both sides died,\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nand that's how the war ended.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nUsually there's a winner.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:08.000\nThey couldn't call it a reservoir of dogs ending back then\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nbecause they didn't have that movie yet,\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nbut they didn't have any names for it\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nbecause the only people there, they all died.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:19.000\nThey got in a big fight, and they all drew up at the same time.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.000\nAbout whether or not there should be a Memorial Day.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nAbout who started Memorial Day.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nOkay.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nYeah, and they all died.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nAnd eventually someone had to come by and bury them all,\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nand they gave them special graves.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nIt's just outside Nantucket.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:33.000\nYou can go see it.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nJust outside Nantucket.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nYeah.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nWhich means in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:45.000\nWell, I mean a lot of people believe that Nantucket is the mythical Atlantis.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:56.000\nThat they brought math to Phoenix and agriculture.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:01.000\nThat's what the Peruvians are referring to as Quetzalcoatl.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:06.000\nIt's just hillbillies that came by in a boat.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:11.000\nWhy do you think the Peruvians were so involved in Quetzalcoatl,\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nlike Mexican mythology?\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nI don't know.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nThey saw the Mayans doing it, and they're like...\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nI'll take a piece of that, actually.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:19.000\nYeah.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:22.000\nLet me get in on some of this ancient civilization business.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:28.000\nI want to be an equatorial lost people.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nWhat do we got to do?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nWe got to build a pyramid?\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nFine.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nWhat do you think is...\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nWhat's your favorite fun fact about Peru?\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:42.000\nI like that its capital is not what you think.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:49.000\nIf I may ask, what do you think the capital of Peru is?\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:52.000\nWell, a lot of people think it's Colombia.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:55.000\nThey think the capital of Peru is another country.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nYeah.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nBut they'd be wrong.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nYeah.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nBut it's not.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nWho thinks that?\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nA lot of people.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nJust terrible people.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nLike bad.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nIf you went right now...\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nIf I went to Peru right now?\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nYou and I were on a road trip.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nWe're in Peru.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nWhat road did we take?\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nWhat's your first stop?\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nWhat's our first stop in Peru?\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:24.000\nI would like to go see the famous canyons.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\nRight.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:29.000\nThey're not called famous canyons because they're bullshit.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nI kind of...\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nWhen I'm a tourist, I don't try to think lateral.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nI'm not like, take me to the real Peru.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nThat is the real Peru.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nIt's waiting there.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nIt's waiting there for you.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:47.000\nThere's a reason why people go to take pictures of the Peruvian canyons.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nThe famous Peruvian canyons.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nThat's the first place I'd go.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:51.000\nThat's your first stop.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nThat's where the George Washington of Peru...\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nLet's go off the beaten track.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nWhat's your hipster?\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nWe're going to go somewhere groovy.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nLook, I just told you.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nI don't do that.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nBut let's say you're going to be...\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:12.000\nThere's a big hipster scene in Peru right now called Neo-Peruvian fusion, whatever.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:15.000\nI don't need that shit.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:18.000\nI could get that shit on the sunset strip, man.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:22.000\nI'm not going to fucking downtown Peru.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nI'm going to the canyons.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nI'm going to the canyons, baby.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:32.000\nWhere it all started.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:37.000\nThat's why they're called canyons because it starts low.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nYeah.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nAll right.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.000\nWe're going to do horoscopes now.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nWe're going to do more segments in the show.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nThat's cool.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nOh, did I finish with my Memorial Day trivia?\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nNo.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nIt was just supposed to be war trivia.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.000\nAnd then you guys started biting your head off.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:06.000\nIt just started sharing some stuff and then I just handed it and then we saw how that went.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nWhat horoscope?\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nWar trivia.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nWar trivia is the first thing I said.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nI mean, we can skip that.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:16.000\nI got a bunch of war trivia.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nDo you want music for this?\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nSure.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:23.000\nLet me...\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nAll right.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:32.000\nOkay, so 1943.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nRight.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nThe bloodiest battle of World War II.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:39.000\nWhere was that staged?\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:46.000\nIt was an island in the South Pacific called Guadalcanal.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nYour dad died there.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nGrandpa.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:50.000\nMy dad died there.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:51.000\nBut he wished...\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nKilled a lot of people, probably.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nNever talked about it.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nThe silent generation, they called him.\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nDidn't say much.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:03.000\nI mean, he talked a lot, but not about the war.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nAll right.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nWhat did he talk about when he wasn't talking about the war?\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:11.000\nWhat was his topic of choice?\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:17.000\nHe liked to build stuff like decks.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:20.000\nHe was a welder.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:29.000\nHe kind of would make fun of my great-grandma.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nButcher?\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nYeah.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nBut, you know, I wasn't around to...\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nBut didn't grandma Butcher kill a...\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nShe stabbed a person.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nYeah, but these people are all dead now,\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nso I feel like we can't even...\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:44.000\nI'm so sick of sharing my family goodies,\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nand then when I talk to my mom about it,\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nI'm like, I always...\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nShe's like, where'd you hear that?\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:52.000\nAnd I'm like, I don't want to be a part of this disintegration\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:56.000\nof all of the truth of my family, you know?\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:59.000\nThere's so many little details.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nI don't know if this is happening to you guys.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nYou talk to your...\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:05.000\nMaybe you're younger, but it's just like...\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nI don't know if this is a...\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:12.000\nIt's like the inversion of the terrible twos.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:15.000\nYour parents just start learning the word no.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:18.000\nLike, as they become adult children,\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:19.000\nthey're just like,\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nand then remember that one thing we always joke about?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nNo, we don't.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:26.000\nIt's just like, yeah, I'm gonna take as much as I give now.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nI'm 70.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nLike, it's just...\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:33.000\nThey just start to get a little snotty at the end there.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nThey're just like, maybe not.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nMaybe you weren't a good kid.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nYou know, they're just sort of like hacking everything now.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:45.000\nIt's this Trump that's made the baby boomers all fucking nutty.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:46.000\nThey're just like, what's truth?\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.000\nFake news.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:52.000\nAnd so I don't even want to bring the precious stuff over.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nI want to keep that lore.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nBecause now everything's up for debate.\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:01.000\nI asked my mom for...\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:04.000\nYou got any of the home movies?\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nShe's

26:31.000\nIt's like, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:36.000\nAnd then she looked at Cody and she's like, we were a poor family.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:39.000\nWe couldn't really afford cameras and things when we were a thing.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:42.000\nAnd I was like, mom, what?\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:43.000\nI don't know.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:46.000\nYour dad's business

I hear anything is, I didn't say that.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:12.000\nWe didn't have that conversation where I said we never had cameras.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:13.000\nI don't care.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nI love her.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:15.000\nMom, I love you.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:20.000\nI'm like, I promise I won't talk about my family anymore.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nI just want it to be like a fucking crater.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:26.000\nBut there is video evidence of the things you're talking about.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nYeah.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nI mean, yeah.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nLike, it's fucking insane.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.000\nLike, the shit.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:37.000\nAnd then the

then, you know, it's hard with cat.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:16.000\nAnd then she was just like, kind of backtracking through this big long list.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:19.000\nAnd then a lot of them had like questionable kills in there.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:23.000\nLike, it was sort of like, oh, and then Mr. Peanut, you know, he kept going.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:26.000\nHe kept going near the pool and you

as a reward for putting me on a moon.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:40.000\nAnd they were just like, ah, ah, ah, and like, we should have as many babies as our\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:43.000\nparents did, even though the reason they did is because they fought Hitler.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:44.000\nLet's do it.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:45.000\nWe earned it.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:50.000\nWe put a guy on the moon and

warning about you, pantyhose are giving you cancer and I was like, they're just kidding.\n\n31:08.680 --> 31:13.400\nAnd then, and then, and then, and then the key, you know, some, some fucking clever little\n\n31:13.400 --> 31:18.440\nAI figured out, it only took them 25 years ago, like, gee, I guess you could win an election\n\n31:18.440 --> 31:19.440\nthis way.\n\n31:19.440 --> 31:21.880\nI

31:37.240\nThey weren't ready for it.\n\n31:37.240 --> 31:39.760\nThey just weren't ready.\n\n31:39.760 --> 31:41.160\nMy mom, my mom's a similar story.\n\n31:41.160 --> 31:46.680\nLike even when I was like early 20s, like there's stuff where it's like very clear, vivid memories\n\n31:46.680 --> 31:50.720\nof stuff that happened and stuff that was validated by their stories later on.\n\n31:50.720 --> 31:54.840\nLike remember when we did this thing and then it's just like, they just have no recollection\n\n31:54.840 --> 31:55.840\nof it.\n\n31:55.840 --> 31:56.840\nIt's like,

32:44.680\nI like the cushions.\n\n32:44.680 --> 32:45.920\nThere's a slot machine.\n\n32:45.920 --> 32:49.720\nHow many fucking Muslims are there?\n\n32:49.720 --> 32:51.720\nThey were just like, what is with this?\n\n32:51.720 --> 32:52.720\nWhat is happening?\n\n32:52.720 --> 32:56.360\nThere's a SWAT with the Congress and the, what is happening?\n\n32:56.360 --> 32:58.120\nThey were like freaking out.\n\n32:58.120 --> 32:59.960\nAnd then it was like easy to grab them.\n\n32:59.960 --> 33:03.680\nAnd I, I'm 46 and I was, I wasn't ready.\n\n33:03.680 --> 33:07.960\nLike, these fucking,

worst.\n\n33:21.920 --> 33:24.400\nLike, like, don't, don't fuck up my already bad mood.\n\n33:24.400 --> 33:31.960\nGet a bunch of fucking raisinets, raisinets, that's the worst thing you could call somebody.\n\n33:31.960 --> 33:36.680\nI mean, thanks for coming out and everything.\n\n33:36.680 --> 33:41.720\nI hope you have a safe drive home, but please don't be so stupid that I have to get angry\n\n33:41.720 --> 33:43.520\nat you.\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:49.040\nAnd by stupid, I mean, don't have a visceral, autonomic unconscious reactions to things\n\n33:49.040 --> 33:52.800\nthat sound racist.\n\n33:52.800 --> 33:58.760\nBe sophisticated, suck up the toxicity and just process it and just let it go through\n\n33:58.760 --> 34:08.560\nall your veins and take it home with you and like wipe it on your significant other.\n\n34:08.560 --> 34:13.400\nSeize it in the shower, in a, in a, in a nice, in a steam.\n\n34:13.400 --> 34:18.280\nThat's what my generation used to do is take it in, you read something stupid on a billboard.\n\n34:18.280 --> 34:20.840\nYou can't, you can't go, you can't give it a thumbs down.\n\n34:20.840 --> 34:21.840\nWe didn't have that luxury.\n\n34:21.840 --> 34:30.560\nWe were just like, I hate it, I hate everything, I hate the sandwich, I hate, I hate Mickey\n\n34:30.560 --> 34:37.240\nMouse, I hate Coca-Cola, I hate corporations, I'm gonna have a baby.\n\n34:37.240 --> 34:41.880\nHey bud, hey bro, hey bud, hey bro, hey bud, hey, you're my bro, you're my baby, but you're\n\n34:41.880 --> 34:44.600\nmy bro.\n\n34:44.600 --> 34:51.240\nI'm never

gonna be a fucking horrible person.\n\n35:02.800 --> 35:08.880\nThat's cool, cool with me bro, I didn't hit you though, never laid a fucking finger on\n\n35:08.880 --> 35:09.880\nyou.\n\n35:09.880 --> 35:11.880\nSee, you, you should have a kid.\n\n35:11.880 --> 35:12.880\nYeah.\n\n35:12.880 --> 35:13.880\nNah, dog.\n\n35:13.880 --> 35:21.280\nDon't, don't dog me after all that.\n\n35:21.280 --> 35:29.840\nI don't want no kid running around my house, I don't know, sometimes, sometimes I, sometimes\n\n35:29.840 --> 35:36.280\nI think maybe, I like, I like that they like, I like that they like, like bits, you know,\n\n35:36.280 --> 35:39.880\nlike, I like that they like songs, like you can make up a song and they'll, they'll like\n\n35:39.880 --> 35:40.880\nthe song.\n\n35:40.880 --> 35:41.880\nYeah.\n\n35:41.880 --> 35:42.880\nI mean that's cool.\n\n35:42.880 --> 35:46.000\nBut they'll, they'll like, they'll be a fan of the song that you make up, like they'll,\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:51.920\nyou can like, you can go like, my name is poopy butternut silo, to eat the buttercup\n\n35:51.920 --> 35:55.440\nand they'll just be like, they'll start, they'll memorize it, start singing it.\n\n35:55.440 --> 36:00.680\nLike they'll, my dad's saying like, like hilarious improv songs all the time, I think that's\n\n36:00.680 --> 36:03.640\nwhy I like bad improv songs.\n\n36:03.640 --> 36:07.760\nSo that, but, but that seems like a bad reason, that doesn't seem like a good reason to have\n\n36:07.760 --> 36:11.160\na kid, but then you start thinking, well what are you supposed to follow your bliss when\n\n36:11.160 --> 36:13.520\nit comes to having a kid, then don't have a kid, right?\n\n36:13.520 --> 36:15.960\nLike, like, cause that kid's gonna poop there, pants.\n\n36:15.960 --> 36:19.400\nOh, speaking of pooping.\n\n36:19.400 --> 36:24.920\nSo we, we went house hunting this weekend, found a really, we've, we've been very picky\n\n36:24.920 --> 36:26.760\nand they've taken it very slowly.\n\n36:26.760 --> 36:28.980\nThis isn't, this isn't like, we need a house.\n\n36:28.980 --> 36:32.480\nThis is like, where do we want to die or whatever?\n\n36:32.480 --> 36:36.040\nLike, like, like, what, what's too much, you know, too much bliss.\n\n36:36.040 --> 36:37.880\nLike we're already happy.\n\n36:37.880 --> 36:39.520\nWhat would make it a little ridiculous?\n\n36:39.520 --> 36:44.480\nWhat would make me come home from work every day and go, fuck you.\n\n36:44.480 --> 36:48.120\nThat's the standard I'm holding it to when I go, I go to these open houses and I want,\n\n36:48.120 --> 36:51.880\nI want so much house, I want to like, like take a couple turns and be like, where the\n\n36:51.880 --> 36:52.880\nfuck am I?\n\n36:52.880 --> 36:57.360\nHow many fucking, how many fucking ways to get to the pool are there?\n\n36:57.360 --> 36:59.800\nJesus Christ.\n\n36:59.800 --> 37:00.800\nWhat is this a guy?\n\n37:00.800 --> 37:02.200\nAre you, are you, are you, are you, are you a governor to live here?\n\n37:02.200 --> 37:03.200\nI'm gonna punch someone.\n\n37:03.200 --> 37:07.080\nYou showed me a photo of this house, are you, are you gonna be in the pool?\n\n37:07.080 --> 37:09.920\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna, you don't strike me as a pool goer.\n\n37:09.920 --> 37:16.800\nThat pool is all about, dude, that's, that's Cody's gotta have a pool.\n\n37:16.800 --> 37:18.480\nAnd I gotta have a Cody.\n\n37:18.480 --> 37:21.840\nYou gotta have a Cody that I agree with, but like, why do you have, like, you're not gonna\n\n37:21.840 --> 37:22.840\ngo in that pool.\n\n37:22.840 --> 37:26.960\nSo what do you want me to do to, how do, how does this work with your mind?\n\n37:26.960 --> 37:30.280\nI'm saying, Cody, I don't need a pool and you do need a pool.\n\n37:30.280 --> 37:31.280\nLet's compromise.\n\n37:31.280 --> 37:32.280\nNo pool.\n\n37:32.280 --> 37:33.280\nAre you, are you gonna have pool parties?\n\n37:33.280 --> 37:34.280\nAre you gonna be the pool?\n\n37:34.280 --> 37:35.280\nYes, of course I will have pool parties.\n\n37:35.280 --> 37:36.280\nNo, you're not gonna have a fucking pool.\n\n37:36.280 --> 37:39.280\nWhy did you ask the question so that you could fight with me?\n\n37:39.280 --> 37:41.280\nWhat kind of co-host are you?\n\n37:41.280 --> 37:45.280\nI don't think that you're gonna, you're ever gonna go in the pool.\n\n37:45.280 --> 37:46.280\nOkay.\n\n37:46.280 --> 37:49.560\nI mean, what do you, you're like, Oscar the Grouch or something.\n\n37:49.560 --> 37:54.280\nWhat do you, you're looking, you're actively looking for like, things to argue about?\n\n37:54.280 --> 37:59.880\nI'm just saying, is there a world where Dan Harmon is a pool swimmer?\n\n37:59.880 --> 38:06.200\nI'll get in, I'll get in a pool as, as, as little as the next guy.\n\n38:06.200 --> 38:07.200\nI mean, I'm gonna.\n\n38:07.200 --> 38:08.200\nI want you to go in the pool.\n\n38:08.200 --> 38:10.200\nI'm not saying I don't want you to go in the pool.\n\n38:10.200 --> 38:11.200\nI don't know.\n\n38:11.200 --> 38:13.200\nI just wonder whether you're gonna go in the pool.\n\n38:13.200 --> 38:15.200\nI'm going to have a pool.\n\n38:15.200 --> 38:16.200\nRight.\n\n38:16.200 --> 38:17.200\nI'm gonna own the pool.\n\n38:17.200 --> 38:18.200\nRight.\n\n38:18.200 --> 38:20.280\nCody is gonna be very happy.\n\n38:20.280 --> 38:21.280\nBe in the pool.\n\n38:21.280 --> 38:22.280\nTo be in the pool.\n\n38:22.280 --> 38:23.280\nOkay.\n\n38:23.280 --> 38:28.320\nAnd the pool is gonna be right there at my house, making Cody and I a very happy functional\n\n38:28.320 --> 38:30.800\ncouple where I like, I could sit next to it.\n\n38:30.800 --> 38:35.440\nIf I don't want to get in it, I could sit next to it and make music on my iPad.\n\n38:35.440 --> 38:39.080\nDo you think that you might become a pool person after you have a pool?\n\n38:39.080 --> 38:40.080\nNever know.\n\n38:40.080 --> 38:42.720\nNot necessary in order for me to continue to enjoy the pool though.\n\n38:42.720 --> 38:43.720\nRight.\n\n38:43.720 --> 38:45.080\nBecause I'll be like, well, I got that pool.\n\n38:45.080 --> 38:46.920\nIt's not pool based.\n\n38:46.920 --> 38:47.920\nYou having a pool?\n\n38:47.920 --> 38:48.920\nI'm not.\n\n38:48.920 --> 38:49.920\nYeah, exactly.\n\n38:49.920 --> 38:51.320\nI'm not like, I can't wait to be a pool guy.\n\n38:51.320 --> 38:53.600\nThis pool is gonna change me.\n\n38:53.600 --> 38:57.240\nIt's like this, this pool is gonna be a great thing to have.\n\n38:57.240 --> 39:00.240\nI'm picturing you becoming very tan.\n\n39:00.240 --> 39:04.480\nLike you're gonna be Ray Winston and sexy beast and you live in Greece and you have a,\n\n39:04.480 --> 39:08.480\nyou have a pool and that you're just, you're just really tan.\n\n39:08.480 --> 39:09.480\nYeah.\n\n39:09.480 --> 39:11.360\nI'll probably just clip my toenails more.\n\n39:11.360 --> 39:12.360\nI think that'll do.\n\n39:12.360 --> 39:15.280\nWait, why, why is that a pool connected thing?\n\n39:15.280 --> 39:20.600\nWell, because I feel like the pool lifestyle involves more like bare feet and plus like\n\n39:20.600 --> 39:22.880\nmore company.\n\n39:22.880 --> 39:28.080\nAnd right now, Cody's being way too tolerant of some fucking gnarly shit going on.\n\n39:28.080 --> 39:30.320\nLike, I, it's just, I don't.\n\n39:30.320 --> 39:31.320\nBreak it down.\n\n39:31.320 --> 39:32.320\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\n39:32.320 --> 39:36.800\nLike nasty, disgusting toenails right now and I always do, I clip them and then I get\n\n39:36.800 --> 39:39.720\nto spend like two days being proud of myself.\n\n39:39.720 --> 39:44.600\nLike I'll walk around in the sandals or, you know, I'll get the food and the bare feet\n\n39:44.600 --> 39:51.320\nand then I'll, from the, from the door, that's where food comes from, front door.\n\n39:51.320 --> 40:00.640\nAnd I'm just like, hey, thanks, I put a little, little, like, do you ever go get your, your\n\n40:00.640 --> 40:01.640\nnails did?\n\n40:01.640 --> 40:06.960\nNo, I'm never going to do that because I'm, but then the thing is they just shoot out\n\n40:06.960 --> 40:11.880\neverything in my body, the hair and the nails and everything just, everything just shoots\n\n40:11.880 --> 40:18.760\nout like, like I'm just like a fucking like pustule of like hair and oil.\n\n40:18.760 --> 40:21.000\nLet's you and me go get our nails done together.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nOkay.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:26.800\nUh, so anyways, we're doing this, we're doing this, we went to this house, we like this house\n\n40:26.800 --> 40:31.000\nand uh, me and Cody liked the house.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:32.320\nDid you say who did pooping?\n\n40:32.320 --> 40:33.320\nOh, pooping.\n\n40:33.320 --> 40:34.320\nUh, yes.\n\n40:34.320 --> 40:41.640\nUh, uh, I was like, really, we're getting so excited because we've been, we've been so\n\n40:41.640 --> 40:42.640\npicky about that.\n\n40:42.640 --> 40:46.960\nWe've been looking at a lot of houses and it's like starting to wonder, I mean, this\n\n40:46.960 --> 40:47.960\nis kind of crazy.\n\n40:47.960 --> 40:49.800\nIs it possible to please us?\n\n40:49.800 --> 40:53.120\nLike, are we ever going to like, and I guess that's okay.\n\n40:53.120 --> 40:56.600\nI already got, I mean, there's no hurry, but at the same time you start to think like,\n\n40:56.600 --> 41:01.400\nwait, what is, what's like, I guess maybe, maybe houses just suck.\n\n41:01.400 --> 41:03.800\nMaybe just all houses, doesn't matter.\n\n41:03.800 --> 41:07.800\nAnd then, and then finally you just walk into one where you're both are vibing it and then\n\n41:07.800 --> 41:10.960\nwe're walking around like, oh my God, oh my God, this is the best house.\n\n41:10.960 --> 41:11.960\nThis is the best house.\n\n41:11.960 --> 41:20.080\nAnd it was like a, like a new house and they just built it, uh, and uh, uh, and so they\n\n41:20.080 --> 41:25.840\nwere having an open house and there were these old ladies hanging out, they were just hanging\n\n41:25.840 --> 41:26.840\nout.\n\n41:26.840 --> 41:27.840\nIt was like a gang of old ladies.\n\n41:27.840 --> 41:31.600\nI swear they just live in the neighborhood and they just came there, oh, it's an open\n\n41:31.600 --> 41:32.600\nhouse.\n\n41:32.600 --> 41:34.800\nWas it cactus punch?\n\n41:34.800 --> 41:35.800\nCactus punch, yeah.\n\n41:35.800 --> 41:41.640\nThey, they, they, they were sitting, uh, in the, in one of the, in the, in the side room\n\n41:41.640 --> 41:43.720\nand they, one of them had a bag of groceries.\n\n41:43.720 --> 41:46.360\nLike they, it was just like, they, they, they just, hey, it's an open house.\n\n41:46.360 --> 41:48.920\nLet's go look at these houses and we'll just hang out.\n\n41:48.920 --> 41:50.640\nThey were just sitting and hanging out with it.\n\n41:50.640 --> 41:54.480\nWere they looking for houses or they just, my suspicion is no.\n\n41:54.480 --> 41:58.720\nI mean, it just, I, but I don't want to be, you know, I mean, like, I guess maybe one\n\n41:58.720 --> 42:03.400\nof them be like, okay, I, I'm going to buy it because I can, I, I just needed to break\n\n42:03.400 --> 42:08.680\nit in and feel like I could get, be coming home from groceries and hang out with my friends.\n\n42:08.680 --> 42:11.840\nAnd I don't think, I think they were just lucky lose, you know, they were just like,\n\n42:11.840 --> 42:16.120\nuh, they were just hanging out, so, so not, not a crime, but, uh, kind of in the way a\n\n42:16.120 --> 42:17.720\nlot, but, uh, but a big house.\n\n42:17.720 --> 42:18.960\nSo they weren't really in the way.\n\n42:18.960 --> 42:23.280\nAnd then like the lat, it was like, I'm the tail end of, I'm so excited, so excited about\n\n42:23.280 --> 42:24.280\nthis house.\n\n42:24.280 --> 42:25.280\nIt was like getting really excited.\n\n42:25.280 --> 42:27.360\nI think we're going to actually put an offer on this place there.\n\n42:27.360 --> 42:28.360\nYou really say, yeah.\n\n42:28.360 --> 42:29.360\nOh my God.\n\n42:29.360 --> 42:34.480\nOh, oh, and there's another, oh, did you, did you see the other bathroom over here?\n\n42:34.480 --> 42:38.920\nOh, and they're like, went in there and it was like, oh, this is a good bathroom.\n\n42:38.920 --> 42:42.920\nOh, oh, like one of those ladies took a huge shit.\n\n42:42.920 --> 42:43.920\nNo.\n\n42:43.920 --> 42:44.920\nIn the open house.\n\n42:44.920 --> 42:45.920\nWhat?\n\n42:45.920 --> 42:48.080\nIt's like marked for life now.\n\n42:48.080 --> 42:49.080\nIt's crazy.\n\n42:49.080 --> 42:51.480\nI'm kind of stoked about it because it's going to be legendary.\n\n42:51.480 --> 42:54.240\nLike, oh, I just, but, but it was, I just couldn't believe it.\n\n42:54.240 --> 42:55.240\nYeah.\n\n42:55.240 --> 42:58.240\nI took the first poop in your place.\n\n42:58.240 --> 42:59.240\nYeah.\n\n42:59.240 --> 43:00.240\nBut it wasn't an open house.\n\n43:00.240 --> 43:02.440\nI just, you go into an open house and you took a dump.\n\n43:02.440 --> 43:03.440\nIt's pretty amazing.\n\n43:03.440 --> 43:07.800\nThat's what the kids would call baller, I guess, for an old lady that's like, like gangsta\n\n43:07.800 --> 43:08.800\nold lady.\n\n43:08.800 --> 43:12.960\nLike she just took a dump in the open house toilet and then just sat next to it and was\n\n43:12.960 --> 43:13.960\nlike, what is that?\n\n43:13.960 --> 43:14.960\nThat's the game.\n\n43:14.960 --> 43:17.200\nLike they just go around pooping in people's houses.\n\n43:17.200 --> 43:18.200\nSo we liked it.\n\n43:18.200 --> 43:22.160\nThis other place and, and Cody's immediately, she's like, I don't like, I don't like the\n\n43:22.160 --> 43:23.160\nvibe of this place.\n\n43:23.160 --> 43:24.160\nLike, what's the vibe?\n\n43:24.160 --> 43:25.840\nYou got to, it's okay for you.\n\n43:25.840 --> 43:29.000\nI don't like, I just want to make sure you're not talking about the wallpaper because that\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:30.000\ncan change.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:33.160\nYou know, it's like, it's hard to talk about whether you like a place or not.\n\n43:33.160 --> 43:37.000\nAnd like, like, and I don't, I just don't like, I just don't like the feeling of the\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nplace.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:39.000\nI don't like the feeling of it.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:43.760\nAnd like, I guess the layout and it's like, whatever.\n\n43:43.760 --> 43:48.200\nAnd then the realtor guy is like, you know, and it's great.\n\n43:48.200 --> 43:49.200\nIt's a great neighborhood.\n\n43:49.200 --> 43:50.200\nA lot of great places to eat.\n\n43:50.200 --> 43:53.240\nI don't know what's over there is a cafe such and such.\n\n43:53.240 --> 43:59.840\nAnd, and Cody goes, oh yeah, isn't that a, isn't that where Robert Blake shot his wife?\n\n43:59.840 --> 44:01.600\nOh yeah, I think so.\n\n44:01.600 --> 44:03.920\nI think that, I think that might be, I think that might be it.\n\n44:03.920 --> 44:04.920\nYeah.\n\n44:04.920 --> 44:05.920\nAnd then we continue looking at the house.\n\n44:05.920 --> 44:06.920\nI know that place.\n\n44:06.920 --> 44:07.920\nThey changed it now.\n\n44:07.920 --> 44:08.920\nAnd we go home.\n\n44:08.920 --> 44:09.920\nWe get in bed.\n\n44:09.920 --> 44:10.920\nWe're like the thing.\n\n44:10.920 --> 44:12.440\nWe're like, I'm like, sure you don't like that.\n\n44:12.440 --> 44:18.640\nAnd then the email Bing and the real, the, it's our realtor say that realtor just emailed\n\n44:18.640 --> 44:21.320\nhe's saying it was Robert Blake's house.\n\n44:21.320 --> 44:27.240\nI was like, but you were talking about you, you, if it's listed, you might want to move\n\n44:27.240 --> 44:29.200\ninto the, I don't know.\n\n44:29.200 --> 44:30.840\nI never said I might want to move.\n\n44:30.840 --> 44:34.560\nWell, I mean, like, like what you just talking about the, and by the way, I don't know why\n\n44:34.560 --> 44:36.160\nI thought it was listed.\n\n44:36.160 --> 44:41.040\nI don't know how I got that conflated, but it goes up for a sale once in a while because\n\n44:41.040 --> 44:43.320\nnobody wants to live in the house where the murders happened.\n\n44:43.320 --> 44:48.360\nThe George Hodel house, Hodel, the Black Dahlia.\n\n44:48.360 --> 44:49.360\nYeah.\n\n44:49.360 --> 44:51.400\nThe guy who probably maybe killed the Black Dahlia.\n\n44:51.400 --> 44:52.400\nProbably in that house.\n\n44:52.400 --> 44:53.400\nHe killed her.\n\n44:53.400 --> 44:54.400\nYeah.\n\n44:54.400 --> 44:55.400\nIn the basement.\n\n44:55.400 --> 44:57.040\nAnd that it's a house on a, yeah, whatever.\n\n44:57.040 --> 44:58.040\nBut it's like, it's like.\n\n44:58.040 --> 44:59.040\nIt's a Lloyd Wright.\n\n44:59.040 --> 45:00.040\nIt looks like a stone butthole outside.\n\n45:00.040 --> 45:01.040\nYeah.\n\n45:01.040 --> 45:02.040\nIt's got this weird.\n\n45:02.040 --> 45:03.040\nKind of architectural.\n\n45:03.040 --> 45:04.040\nI don't know.\n\n45:04.040 --> 45:05.040\nI would never.\n\n45:05.040 --> 45:06.040\nI would never.\n\n45:06.040 --> 45:07.040\nI don't know.\n\n45:07.040 --> 45:08.040\nYeah.\n\n45:08.040 --> 45:12.160\nUnless my partner was like through the roof about it was like, I want to live in the house\n\n45:12.160 --> 45:14.520\nwhere a famous murder happened.\n\n45:14.520 --> 45:16.760\nI, I, I, it would be like a pool.\n\n45:16.760 --> 45:21.640\nI mean, I'd be like, well, it's, I mean, you being happy is like very important to me.\n\n45:21.640 --> 45:26.920\nI, I, if it's haunted, I guess we can move.\n\n45:26.920 --> 45:32.440\nWhen they relisted it like a couple years ago, the police, like somebody was repraising\n\n45:32.440 --> 45:36.840\nthe house and they brought cadaver dogs and they hit on the fucking room where all the\n\n45:36.840 --> 45:37.840\nmurders happened.\n\n45:37.840 --> 45:40.000\nSo like, like somebody died there.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:41.000\nYeah.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:42.000\nAnd you don't want to live in that house.\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.640\nIt's kind of a closed case that, that, that little nugget.\n\n45:44.640 --> 45:48.240\nWell, cause he's dead and it never was official because it's like all the stuff.\n\n45:48.240 --> 45:51.560\nThere's no, what do you call it, corpus delectus corpus.\n\n45:51.560 --> 45:55.440\nBut you know, ASPyD, who was on the show, who, did you, did you, did you get, you guys\n\n45:55.440 --> 45:56.440\nenjoy it?\n\n45:56.440 --> 45:57.440\nWell, don't let me put you on the spot.\n\n45:57.440 --> 45:59.400\nDo you guys like, you like our friend, Ryan Kraus?\n\n45:59.400 --> 46:00.400\nYou're like fuck.\n\n46:00.400 --> 46:01.400\nYeah.\n\n46:01.400 --> 46:06.000\nBecause we'll, we'll, we'll have him back all the time.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:07.600\nI, I like him as a person.\n\n46:07.600 --> 46:10.680\nI think he's a great guy.\n\n46:10.680 --> 46:17.040\nBut he was telling me that the, that guy who's like the hero of that story is like Hodel's\n\n46:17.040 --> 46:23.360\nson who became a cop and then, and then, and then he became convinced that his dad was\n\n46:23.360 --> 46:28.200\nthe Black Dahlia murder and he basically like spent the rest of his life in retirement,\n\n46:28.200 --> 46:33.040\nlike building the case and solving it like, like, yeah, that was my dad did it.\n\n46:33.040 --> 46:35.240\nAnd then it seemed pretty legit to me.\n\n46:35.240 --> 46:36.680\nAnd then you can listen to that podcast.\n\n46:36.680 --> 46:37.680\nI can't remember what it's called.\n\n46:37.680 --> 46:38.680\nNow God damn it.\n\n46:38.680 --> 46:46.040\nIt's like a serial podcast that's produced by some of the Hodel children.\n\n46:46.040 --> 46:51.360\nBut then ASPD was saying, yeah, but then that guy lost all his credibility when he started\n\n46:51.360 --> 46:52.360\nsaying, oh yeah.\n\n46:52.360 --> 46:55.880\nAnd plus he might have been a Zodiac and I was like, really?\n\n46:55.880 --> 46:56.880\nThat was him?\n\n46:56.880 --> 47:00.640\nAnd I didn't look that like, like, like, like, like, he wasn't the Zodiac.\n\n47:00.640 --> 47:05.680\nI mean, whether he was or not, it was like, I didn't, he made it sound like maybe the\n\n47:05.680 --> 47:10.600\nsame guy that I thought was like a smart, the detective guy that retired and proved that\n\n47:10.600 --> 47:12.920\nhis dad was the Black Dahlia murderer.\n\n47:12.920 --> 47:19.160\nThen later on was like, plus he was the Zodiac killer, which would change things in my head\n\n47:19.160 --> 47:24.240\nabout whether or not this guy actually, I mean, anyways, not interesting, Dan Harmon.\n\n47:24.240 --> 47:30.600\nWe don't care about your dumb conversations with yourself about a fucking crime within\n\n47:30.600 --> 47:32.520\na crime within a true crime podcast.\n\n47:32.520 --> 47:34.840\nThe rest of us are living our lives.\n\n47:34.840 --> 47:36.480\nWe're into self care.\n\n47:36.480 --> 47:48.760\nWe're not in a toxic tailspin where we play match games like Best Fiends or Candy Cookies\n\n47:48.760 --> 47:53.800\nwhile we listen to podcasts about murder because we're obviously like having a real hard time\n\n47:53.800 --> 47:55.120\nand we're not admitting it.\n\n47:55.120 --> 48:04.800\nLike, we're doing yoga and we only listen to shows about yoga.\n\n48:04.800 --> 48:09.320\nAre you going through a rough patch right now?\n\n48:09.320 --> 48:10.320\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n48:10.320 --> 48:12.480\nThey do.\n\n48:12.480 --> 48:13.800\nYou heard them.\n\n48:13.800 --> 48:16.520\nThat was them.\n\n48:16.520 --> 48:17.520\nPay attention.\n\n48:17.520 --> 48:18.520\nWhat was it?\n\n48:18.520 --> 48:19.520\nMe talking.\n\n48:19.520 --> 48:20.520\nI'm fucking happy.\n\n48:20.520 --> 48:22.520\nWhat's Best Fiends?\n\n48:22.520 --> 48:23.520\nIt's like a matchy.\n\n48:23.520 --> 48:27.920\nIt's one of those matchy games where like the matching like shoots the bad guy.\n\n48:27.920 --> 48:33.240\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, where you like it's like you get a bunch of different colored cookie\n\n48:33.240 --> 48:38.280\ncandy things and then you like, you know, you connect them, connect the ones that are\n\n48:38.280 --> 48:39.280\nnext to each other.\n\n48:39.280 --> 48:44.080\nHave you seen My Best Fiend about Klaus Kinski and Werner Herzog?\n\n48:44.080 --> 48:45.080\nYeah.\n\n48:45.080 --> 48:46.080\nIt's really good.\n\n48:46.080 --> 48:47.080\nYeah.\n\n48:47.080 --> 48:48.080\nIs that what it's based on?\n\n48:48.080 --> 48:49.640\nYeah, it's based on that.\n\n48:49.640 --> 48:50.640\nYeah.\n\n48:50.640 --> 48:53.440\nYou're killing, you're attacking Werner Herzog.\n\n48:53.440 --> 48:58.840\nIt was advertised in this true crime podcast called the, I never remember the names.\n\n48:58.840 --> 49:00.560\nThey're also bad at naming their podcasts.\n\n49:00.560 --> 49:06.240\nI think it's called the serial killer podcast.\n\n49:06.240 --> 49:08.400\nIt's this Norwegian guy.\n\n49:08.400 --> 49:12.760\nHis name is like Thomas Born Cyborg or something.\n\n49:12.760 --> 49:13.760\nHello.\n\n49:13.760 --> 49:14.760\nThomas Born Cyborg.\n\n49:14.760 --> 49:15.880\nHello, dear listeners.\n\n49:15.880 --> 49:25.320\nIt's me, Thomas Born Cyborg, Born, here, your Norwegian host, here to talk about the insidious\n\n49:25.320 --> 49:27.640\nJeffrey Dahmer.\n\n49:27.640 --> 49:32.080\nAnd then every time he mentions like, if there's anything that happens in like Louisiana or\n\n49:32.080 --> 49:36.920\nAtlanta or anything like that, he affects this weird accent.\n\n49:36.920 --> 49:40.560\nLike he starts talking like a, like a, like a Southern American.\n\n49:40.560 --> 49:42.200\nCan you do it?\n\n49:42.200 --> 49:43.200\nI try.\n\n49:43.200 --> 49:44.200\nI try.\n\n49:44.200 --> 49:45.360\nI mean, it's hard to do his accent from the beginning.\n\n49:45.360 --> 49:53.920\nSo like, but it's like, the Toy Box Killer was the most prolific serial killer, depending\n\n49:53.920 --> 50:06.080\non who you believe, Texas authorities say that he might have killed as many as 500 people.\n\n50:06.080 --> 50:11.640\nLike he, he just, he just starts talking like his version of Southern Americans just because\n\n50:11.640 --> 50:16.560\nhe's like, I'm going to give it a little cayenne pepper because we're talking Louisiana here.\n\n50:16.560 --> 50:22.120\nAnd it was like, normally it's charming, but then there was one episode where he was,\n\n50:22.120 --> 50:29.680\nthe story was about the Atlanta Ripper, which was like this fucked up, like, I can't remember\n\n50:29.680 --> 50:34.640\nif it was like during Reconstruction or like if it was during the Civil War or before it\n\n50:34.640 --> 50:41.840\nwas like around a time like when, unlike now, when things were not hunky-dory, like in terms\n\n50:41.840 --> 50:44.840\nof between people talking to each other.\n\n50:44.840 --> 50:49.440\nAnd there was like a serial killer who was like killing, it was, it was, it was like\n\n50:49.440 --> 50:54.520\nJack the Ripper, but in Atlanta and, but, and steeped in racism, like in terms of the\n\n50:54.520 --> 50:58.320\nsuspect and the, and the who was getting charged and what the cops were doing with all the\n\n50:58.320 --> 50:59.320\ntime.\n\n50:59.320 --> 51:04.480\nAnd like that, that was like him, he didn't, he didn't, he's purely innocent, but it was\n\n51:04.480 --> 51:11.760\njust amazingly, the effect of it being like a train crashes was like he, him reading quotes\n\n51:11.760 --> 51:19.960\nfrom racist cops at the turn of the century, um, in this silly accent and also he sounds\n\n51:19.960 --> 51:24.120\nlike, you know, the guy from the sugar cubes and like, it's just sort of like the effect\n\n51:24.120 --> 51:29.560\nwas like, blah, and then the, and the next episode he was like, hello, dear listeners,\n\n51:29.560 --> 51:36.240\nit's time for more creepy crawly, a serial killer podcasting, a lot of reviews from the\n\n51:36.240 --> 51:47.200\nlast episode saying, don't do that anymore, and I won't, my hat, my hat's off to people\n\n51:47.200 --> 51:51.880\nthat read, read their reviews of anything, God damn, and then, and then take it right\n\n51:51.880 --> 51:55.880\non the chin and make an adjustment or don't, you know, have you totally stopped doing that?\n\n51:55.880 --> 51:56.880\nI can't.\n\n51:56.880 --> 51:57.880\nI can't anymore.\n\n51:57.880 --> 51:58.880\nI can't.\n\n51:58.880 --> 52:00.440\nIt's hard to get the podcast reviews.\n\n52:00.440 --> 52:03.920\nYou really have to go out of your way to look for your podcast reviews.\n\n52:03.920 --> 52:04.920\nYeah.\n\n52:04.920 --> 52:10.600\nYou go on Reddit, right, like, oh, I go on Reddit.\n\n52:10.600 --> 52:13.400\nSo shut the fuck up.\n\n52:13.400 --> 52:16.160\nJust back the fuck off because I'm there.\n\n52:16.160 --> 52:19.120\nNo, but I'm just, I'm talking about the iTunes reviews.\n\n52:19.120 --> 52:20.120\nIt's funny.\n\n52:20.120 --> 52:24.640\nYou know, ASPD, like one of his earliest episodes, yeah, and I'm sorry if you're listening to\n\n52:24.640 --> 52:25.640\nthis, no offense.\n\n52:25.640 --> 52:30.760\nThis is reporting facts, but, um, he early on, he's like, give me, give me reviews.\n\n52:30.760 --> 52:32.240\nEven a one star review is fine.\n\n52:32.240 --> 52:35.400\nThat helps me understand what I'm doing and like the next time he invokes reviews, he's\n\n52:35.400 --> 52:39.520\nlike, give me a five star review and then like the next time he invokes reviews, he's\n\n52:39.520 --> 52:40.920\nlike, give me a five star review.\n\n52:40.920 --> 52:43.160\nI know some of you won't, but please do.\n\n52:43.160 --> 52:45.280\nSo it's like a real arc he goes on.\n\n52:45.280 --> 52:49.280\nWell, I liked it when he said something to the effect of like, give me a five star review\n\n52:49.280 --> 52:53.880\nbecause cool people would do that and don't tend to give reviews and a bunch of assholes\n\n52:53.880 --> 52:54.880\ngive me one star reviews.\n\n52:54.880 --> 52:59.120\nSo the fact is, if you don't give me five star reviews, if you think I'm doing good,\n\n52:59.120 --> 53:03.560\nlike it, it, it, it, it, it, it fucks me up because everyone else is such a dick.\n\n53:03.560 --> 53:04.560\nThat's the truth.\n\n53:04.560 --> 53:07.960\nBut it might less say that defensively would right, but it might less be because people\n\n53:07.960 --> 53:11.360\nare dicks and more because he encouraged them to do that.\n\n53:11.360 --> 53:13.480\nUh, right.\n\n53:13.480 --> 53:19.040\nWell, what I look, that's why I never, ever, ever have said in my life, even before podcast\n\n53:19.040 --> 53:22.400\nculture, like I, yeah, I, I don't want to even go near that feedback loop.\n\n53:22.400 --> 53:26.840\nI like that idea of having to ask people to rate, subscribe and like it stuff.\n\n53:26.840 --> 53:32.640\nI, I'm, I, I don't fault anybody who has to participate in that currency because, because\n\n53:32.640 --> 53:33.640\nthat's what it is.\n\n53:33.640 --> 53:35.160\nIt's a currency, but I'm, I'm out.\n\n53:35.160 --> 53:39.240\nLike I've, to me, that's like a greenback dollar and I'm like a carpet bag and like,\n\n53:39.240 --> 53:41.600\nlike, I'm, that's, that's before my time.\n\n53:41.600 --> 53:43.600\nI'm not, I'm not, I'm not.\n\n53:43.600 --> 53:47.360\nYou're really all about reconstruction in America.\n\n53:47.360 --> 53:53.080\nUh, the, uh, what, what is your hangup with, with post civil war America?\n\n53:53.080 --> 53:59.000\nI just think they could have done a better job of, you know, I mean, you, you make a\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:00.920\nbed, then you, then you lie in it.\n\n54:00.920 --> 54:03.480\nWhy, why were there, why were there bags made of carpet?\n\n54:03.480 --> 54:05.800\nUh, I don't know, what is a carpet bagger?\n\n54:05.800 --> 54:10.680\nIt's just, it's, isn't that like a northerner that's like coming down south to like, uh,\n\n54:10.680 --> 54:13.520\nexploit, uh, just everybody or what is that?\n\n54:13.520 --> 54:14.520\nYeah.\n\n54:14.520 --> 54:15.520\nIs that what that is?\n\n54:15.520 --> 54:20.480\nTo take over like, like by property because it's cheap because the whole, the whole autonomy\n\n54:20.480 --> 54:21.480\nis gone.\n\n54:21.480 --> 54:23.360\nIt's like a northern elitist interloper.\n\n54:23.360 --> 54:24.360\nYeah.\n\n54:24.360 --> 54:25.360\nRight.\n\n54:25.360 --> 54:26.360\nSo yeah, nailed it.\n\n54:26.360 --> 54:27.360\nYeah.\n\n54:27.360 --> 54:30.520\nThat's the thing is like, like, like podcasting is just like, it is the, it's like this crazy\n\n54:30.520 --> 54:32.040\nWild West like thing.\n\n54:32.040 --> 54:36.320\nAnd like, so anybody who's like, Hey, you gotta, you gotta give me, give me scalps or give\n\n54:36.320 --> 54:38.160\nme bottle caps or give me horse hooves.\n\n54:38.160 --> 54:42.920\nLike I'm not, I don't judge anybody like, Hey, that's terrible, but I'm also not trading\n\n54:42.920 --> 54:43.920\nin it.\n\n54:43.920 --> 54:44.920\nYeah.\n\n54:44.920 --> 54:47.840\nHey, do me a favor, give this podcast a one star review and then stick it up your ass\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:50.280\nand I'm never going to look at it and I don't care.\n\n54:50.280 --> 54:54.160\nLike that's my, that has to be my philosophy or I'd kill myself.\n\n54:54.160 --> 54:58.600\nBut it does suck cause it's like, like then you're like, well, now you just removed the\n\n54:58.600 --> 54:59.600\nmeaning from.\n\n54:59.600 --> 55:00.600\nRight.\n\n55:00.600 --> 55:01.600\nIt's all this, it's like the Uber thing.\n\n55:01.600 --> 55:04.040\nIt's the five star reviews have no, no fucking meaning.\n\n55:04.040 --> 55:07.280\nIt's so stupid because you just want to, you want to rate things.\n\n55:07.280 --> 55:12.960\nWhen you get a, you take a lift and you forget to hit the stars and you just say next.\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:17.460\nSomeone gasped.\n\n55:17.460 --> 55:20.640\nThat doesn't mean that you gave them a zero stars that meant that you just skipped that\n\n55:20.640 --> 55:21.640\nprocess.\n\n55:21.640 --> 55:22.640\nI think so.\n\n55:22.640 --> 55:26.840\nOne time I accidentally slipped and hit like two stars and I was like, Oh no, how can I\n\n55:26.840 --> 55:27.960\nfix this?\n\n55:27.960 --> 55:31.040\nAnd I called like customer support or where I emailed them.\n\n55:31.040 --> 55:33.840\nThey didn't get back to me.\n\n55:33.840 --> 55:34.840\nIt is.\n\n55:34.840 --> 55:35.840\nIt gives me anxiety too.\n\n55:35.840 --> 55:38.680\nI put up with a lot of shit because I don't want to be the reason.\n\n55:38.680 --> 55:44.400\nI don't want to ding someone's five, you know, intend to right.\n\n55:44.400 --> 55:48.520\nIf you accidentally just say skip it and send to lips and you don't give them any stars,\n\n55:48.520 --> 55:51.280\nthat means that you skipped that step, right?\n\n55:51.280 --> 55:55.000\nI think it doesn't mean that you gave them zero stars.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:56.960\nI hope I believe that's the case.\n\n55:56.960 --> 55:58.520\nI do it all the time.\n\n55:58.520 --> 55:59.520\nYeah, I don't.\n\n55:59.520 --> 56:01.720\nI keep picturing you guys with extra years tonight.\n\n56:01.720 --> 56:04.360\nLike Dan's been standing up.\n\n56:04.360 --> 56:06.360\nI keep thinking like, what if Dan had four years?\n\n56:06.360 --> 56:07.360\nWell, what about six?\n\n56:07.360 --> 56:08.360\nAre you on mescaline?\n\n56:08.360 --> 56:09.360\nWhat's going on?\n\n56:09.360 --> 56:13.880\nNo, that's what's so fucked up is like, I'm like, why is this my brain doing?\n\n56:13.880 --> 56:14.880\nOkay, so.\n\n56:14.880 --> 56:18.040\nWhy is this my brain doing?\n\n56:18.040 --> 56:19.880\nHow many years do I have right now?\n\n56:19.880 --> 56:20.880\nFour is I can't.\n\n56:20.880 --> 56:21.880\nI can't picture you as six.\n\n56:21.880 --> 56:26.160\nI think because you're straight on like your face and you're facing me.\n\n56:26.160 --> 56:27.160\nWe'll see now.\n\n56:27.160 --> 56:28.160\nI can see sick.\n\n56:28.160 --> 56:29.160\nThat could be that could be a thing.\n\n56:29.160 --> 56:31.280\nYou don't have a trick to make glasses tighter.\n\n56:31.280 --> 56:32.280\nDo you that?\n\n56:32.280 --> 56:33.960\nI got to I got to go to the thing, right?\n\n56:33.960 --> 56:36.840\nWell, where do you want them tighter on your ears area?\n\n56:36.840 --> 56:37.840\nYeah, like that.\n\n56:37.840 --> 56:38.840\nI mean, they just fall off my head.\n\n56:38.840 --> 56:40.120\nThey're like there are two.\n\n56:40.120 --> 56:43.840\nThere's spreads to why I don't know what the terminal best podcast in the world.\n\n56:43.840 --> 56:44.840\nIt's good.\n\n56:44.840 --> 56:47.760\nI think their hinges are to our hyper extended.\n\n56:47.760 --> 56:49.440\nYou got like the plastic frame.\n\n56:49.440 --> 56:51.240\nSo I think you need like a hairdryer or something.\n\n56:51.240 --> 56:53.640\nYou can't just bend it.\n\n56:53.640 --> 56:58.600\nYou can take it to a to a glass place and then they'll they'll bend them in definitely\n\n56:58.600 --> 57:01.400\nthe place that sold me the glasses.\n\n57:01.400 --> 57:02.400\nNot a glass place.\n\n57:02.400 --> 57:09.680\nNot like like like a glass glasses player like a like a like like like Warby Parker.\n\n57:09.680 --> 57:10.680\nSure.\n\n57:10.680 --> 57:15.920\nThey're kiosks at their home try on kid.\n\n57:15.920 --> 57:18.520\nSo OK, well, now tell us we don't have a guest.\n\n57:18.520 --> 57:24.120\nSo oh, I only come here for the surprise guests.\n\n57:24.120 --> 57:31.560\nLet's let's bring a surprise guest out of the army of super special kind of a Harmon\n\n57:31.560 --> 57:34.120\ntown live podcast fan.\n\n57:34.120 --> 57:38.280\nThe person that's like I only come to this fucking thing because every once in a while\n\n57:38.280 --> 57:42.560\nJudd Apatow comes out, I was going to say Judd Apatow and they're like they're like\n\n57:42.560 --> 57:44.240\nthey're like damn it.\n\n57:44.240 --> 57:46.040\nThat's 90 in a row.\n\n57:46.040 --> 57:48.200\nYeah, I'm fucking god damn it.\n\n57:48.200 --> 57:56.080\nThese fuckers I was going to say to bring somebody up.\n\n57:56.080 --> 58:00.480\nShould we should we try to know what first I want to talk to Spencer about his surgery.\n\n58:00.480 --> 58:02.840\nOh yeah.\n\n58:02.840 --> 58:05.000\nYour hip is OK or what's happening?\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:06.000\nSo I don't know.\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:08.600\nI got surgery, it was it was OK.\n\n58:08.600 --> 58:14.160\nOh man, surgery talk.\n\n58:14.160 --> 58:17.080\nCan we can we you can we get that drop of that?\n\n58:17.080 --> 58:20.360\nCan you take this seriously for a moment?\n\n58:20.360 --> 58:28.400\nMy man got his hip cut open.\n\n58:28.400 --> 58:29.560\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n58:29.560 --> 58:31.800\nIt was it was it was a it was a mess.\n\n58:31.800 --> 58:33.360\nHope you get what I said.\n\n58:33.360 --> 58:35.000\nI wanted to do the low one.\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:42.360\nHave you got what what's the low low one that you want to be more male I won't know you.\n\n58:42.360 --> 58:46.000\nOkay, all right, that's a hat and a hat.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:47.000\nNope.\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:48.000\nThat's sorry.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:49.000\nThat's a hat and a hat.\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:50.000\nSorry.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:51.000\nThat's a hat and a hat.\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:52.000\nI had on a hat.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:53.000\nThat's a called a hat.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:54.000\nA hat.\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:55.000\nNot a hat.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nYo, I'm a hat on a hat.\n\n58:57.000 --> 59:02.000\nYo, what you think about that comedic spin on top of spin?\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:07.000\nNothing ironic here, ask him, yo, someone starts to do something weird.\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:10.000\nThen something else is weirdness is beard.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nSo you got weird with a beard.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:13.000\nThat's double weird.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:14.000\nAnd that's just confusing.\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:20.000\nYo, sometimes they call it a sock barrel in some different kinds of writer rooms.\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:25.000\nIt's an unnecessary connection that confuses people.\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:33.000\nLike if your character's name is I think if your character has cancer and then he's\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:39.000\ntalking about the zodiac and then he's like I'm a cancer and then people are like is that\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:43.000\nsupposed to be a joke or what they're like.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:52.000\nYou got to change it to cap record because otherwise that's what they call a sock barrel.\n\n59:52.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nBut comedically we call it spin on top of spin usually like if you're doing a hilarious\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nStar Wars spoof.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nWhat are you hitting?\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nCome on.\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nJust let Spencer talk about a surgery.\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nThat's the point.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nThat's been on top of spin.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nI'm being the asshole.\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nI'm interrupting his surgery talk with like being a goof guy on the thing.\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nAnd then you're like the gas pedal.\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nThat's not a gas.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nWell, that's two gas pedals done.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nThat could be really funny.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nI don't know or or maybe maybe or maybe you're maybe if someone's already got their foot\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000\non the gas then the pedal that you're hitting is is the break is another way of looking\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nat it spin on top of spin hat on a hat sock barrel sock barrel.\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nWhat do you call it when Jeff's doing that and then someone makes the lights all funky\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nand crazy.\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nThat is.\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nWhat is that?\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nHe hates it.\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nHe hates it.\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nIt's pretty funny.\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nIt's so mad.\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nI'm mad.\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nI must have resting mad face because I am fucking bored.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nAll right.\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nI fantasizing about an iPad game.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nWhy is our show two hours?\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nI keep looking at the clock.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nWe have 300 hours to go.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nI mean, you know, show us so long.\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nI mean, who else has a two hour podcast?\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nAnybody?\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nWell, what's his name?\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nP. Holmes has like a five hour podcast, but he's crazy.\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nThat's fair.\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nSo your surgery.\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nSo I don't know.\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.240\nSo yeah, I was I was gonna like my mom wanted to be involved and you need someone who you\n\n01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240\ncare about.\n\n01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240\nNo, that's not a prerequisite.\n\n01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:14.800\nYou need someone that you trust to get you home from the thing because you can't and\n\n01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.880\nthen they're supposed to watch you for 24 hours apparently, but you can't just like\n\n01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.560\ncall an Uber or taxi apparently because like if you die, like if you start dying in a taxi,\n\n01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.360\nI guess they'll dump you out or something.\n\n01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.000\nI don't know where the thinking is there, but so it's like a cat starts puking on the\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000\ncarpet.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nThey're like, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nYou just lifted.\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.440\nWhen my cat starts puking on the carpet, I try and stuff like a shirt under there so\n\n01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.560\nyou and she starts freaking out and run away and I'm like, no, you stay here and barf\n\n01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.440\nlike a good boy.\n\n01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.720\nSo you went under general anesthesia and you have to have somebody take you home.\n\n01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.720\nYeah.\n\n01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.400\nI mean, I wasn't going to drive myself home, but lift is like a thing now.\n\n01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.240\nIt seems very easy to get someone and whatever.\n\n01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.360\nI did have a mug you when I when I went under there was a whole rigmarole there that I didn't\n\n01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.800\nexpect to be so because I was like I just want to take a car and they're like well.\n\n01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.120\nWe have a car service that we can provide, but blah, blah, blah and all this stuff.\n\n01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.640\nIt started to get so insulting that I was just like, yeah, fine, because I always perceive\n\n01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:16.720\nthat as like people trying to act like I'm like they're like, you know, that's going\n\n01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.880\nto cost you money and I always have the opposite reaction I should have, which is like I get\n\n01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.040\nmad and want to throw money at them to prove that I'm like, you thought I was a clamp it,\n\n01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.520\nbut I'm a Beverly Hillbilly.\n\n01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.280\nIt's got to be like a liability thing, right, which is always the worst reason for things\n\n01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280\nto happen.\n\n01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280\nYou did take a lift home from the.\n\n01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.280\nNo, no.\n\n01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.920\nSo I got my mom, she was going to she was going to come over and take me there.\n\n01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.480\nAnd so I was like, okay, so be in my house at noon and then we could get over, we could\n\n01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.880\ndrive over and be there at one or whatever.\n\n01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.800\nAnd then so like I was taking a nap because I was getting nervous and I was like, I don't\n\n01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.880\nwant to be conscious anymore.\n\n01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.920\nThis is thinking about stuff is a bad idea.\n\n01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:01.680\nAnd so I took a nap and then I woke up and my mom like sent me a text at like 1155 saying\n\n01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.400\nlike, all right, I'm on my way and she lives like an hour away.\n\n01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.600\nAnd I'm like, wait, what the fuck?\n\n01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.600\nAnd then so I call her up.\n\n01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.240\nI'm like, well, how far are you?\n\n01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.840\nAnd she's like, I'll be there by one.\n\n01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840\nRight.\n\n01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.400\nAnd I was like, no, we got to be there at one.\n\n01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.760\nAnd then I start freaking out and then she's like, okay, I'm sorry.\n\n01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.360\nAnd then I had to get a lift over there and then she met me there.\n\n01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.040\nAnd then we were kind of late, but it ended up being fine.\n\n01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.120\nAnd I thought like the surgery was going to start like shortly after one, but then we\n\n01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.240\nhad to wait for two hours for it to start.\n\n01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.620\nAnd I was like, well, Jesus Christ.\n\n01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.960\nAnd then I started getting like less ready.\n\n01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.440\nLike I was like, it's two hours.\n\n01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.520\nI'm not, I'm not, I'm not stand for this.\n\n01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.920\nLike this sucks.\n\n01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.680\nAnd I was just getting really nervous and stuff.\n\n01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.800\nAnd then finally they, they took me in and what they did normal stuff.\n\n01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800\nThey, oh yeah.\n\n01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.760\nThe anesthesia guy came by and he was like, are you ready?\n\n01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.280\nAnd I was like, I guess, and he was like, you guess.\n\n01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.760\nAnd I was like, yeah, I mean, I guess I've been waiting for like two hours and I started\n\n01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.200\nto like psych myself out and he's like, well, you know, usually people are always mad at\n\n01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.640\nthe anesthesia guy, save an earful for your doctor.\n\n01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.720\nAnd I'm like, I'm thinking like, what the fuck are you talking about, man?\n\n01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.600\nAnd then, and then my mom like senses this tension or whatever.\n\n01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.280\nAnd then she's like, are you ready?\n\n01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.680\nAnd the guy's like, I guess, and I'm like, what the fuck?\n\n01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.040\nLike this is totally unearned.\n\n01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.360\nHe has this chip in his shoulder because like apparently he, he feels like he takes a lot\n\n01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.320\nof lip from nervous patients who are about to get cut the fuck open and killed and brought\n\n01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320\nback to life.\n\n01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:31.240\nIt's like the anesthetics, like the highest paying job in the hospital, right?\n\n01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.000\nLike he could fucking take a knee for this.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.600\nLike Jesus Christ, count your money.\n\n01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.920\nBut it really pissed me off.\n\n01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.280\nLike it put me in a terrible mood.\n\n01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:44.120\nAnd and then like the doctor came by and I was like, well, this guy is doing just fine.\n\n01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.920\nLike I don't want to yell at this guy.\n\n01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.920\nNot that I was yelling.\n\n01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.840\nLike I was really just being nervous and explaining that I was nervous and the guy took it as\n\n01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.840\nan insult.\n\n01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.760\nLike they, they, uh, they roll me into the operation room and then the fucking anesthetic\n\n01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:01.120\nguy, he, I started, I see him start to just, uh, just to drip like my IV drip and stuff.\n\n01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.200\nAnd then he puts the thing over your face and he's like, this is just oxygen.\n\n01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200\nJust breathe normal.\n\n01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.200\nAnd then I'm like fucking out.\n\n01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.200\nAnd like the, the whole time before I'm out, I'm like, I don't think this is just oxygen.\n\n01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.920\nI think he's applied an anesthetic without telling me.\n\n01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.360\nAnd I think I'm just going to lose consciousness or handling.\n\n01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.760\nThat's exactly what happened.\n\n01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.760\nAnd it was, it sucked.\n\n01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.720\nAnd then I came back up and I was like, wait, what the fuck?\n\n01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.920\nThat wasn't just oxygen.\n\n01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.920\nThat fucking asshole.\n\n01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.520\nI don't know if he was like beat, he was like punishing me.\n\n01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.440\nLike he was being a dick because like he thought I was mad.\n\n01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.360\nAnyway, I, I come to and it's fine and I'm in pain and it's fine.\n\n01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.680\nIt's like not that bad.\n\n01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.640\nIt's always surprising at how like not bad.\n\n01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.000\nAnyway, um, I was, I was pretty woozy and I threw up and then I was like, I think I'm\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000\ngoing to throw up again.\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.580\nAnd they rolled me in a wheelchair over to the thing.\n\n01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:48.040\nAnd I had to like, I had to like, like, you know, get myself over to the toilet, like\n\n01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.840\nto throw up properly and they were like, Hey, you just project all about it from your wheelchair\n\n01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.840\nall the way into that toilet.\n\n01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.840\nThat's impressive.\n\n01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.840\nI was like, hell yeah.\n\n01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.440\nAnd I explained to the, I explained to the nurse that I'm actually really good at throwing\n\n01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.920\nup because, uh, when I used to smoke pot all the time, it would sometimes make you throw\n\n01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.440\nup and I smoke pot in my car.\n\n01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.400\nSo I'd have to learn how to throw up while I was driving.\n\n01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.400\nOh boy.\n\n01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.080\nI became really good at throwing up is, is the long and short of it.\n\n01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:17.600\nI could throw up into my mouth and then fling it out of the car like a catapult, um, to\n\n01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.880\nkind of get it to clear the side of my car, so it's not splattering all over the side\n\n01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880\nof my car.\n\n01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:27.040\nAnd I was telling you, this is a, this is a, I'm not supposed to do this, but I'm just\n\n01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:34.640\nletting you know I'm not married right panties were dropping and, uh, yeah.\n\n01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.960\nSo we went home and I, I wasn't feeling great and I was just shaking our whole family because\n\n01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.480\nhas issues with anesthetic.\n\n01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.840\nSo it wasn't great.\n\n01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:47.580\nThey gave me Percocet because I had bad reaction to Vicodin and the Percocet, I wasn't feeling\n\n01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:52.200\nit at all other than it just made me feel like I was like, uh, dizzy and losing my\n\n01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.360\nfucking mind.\n\n01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:57.280\nAnd so I kind of weaned myself off of that and just was taking Motrin and that like,\n\n01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.960\nI, the pain was a lot better than I expected to, and I had to be on crutches for a while\n\n01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960\nuntil Friday.\n\n01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.800\nAnd then they said, I didn't have to be on crutches, but like, it kept being like I would wake\n\n01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.440\nup in the middle of the night or my cat started vomiting and I would just react to the situation\n\n01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.440\nand not use my crutches.\n\n01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.040\nAnd I would be like, Oh shit, I'm walking.\n\n01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.040\nThis is nuts.\n\n01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.120\nUm, and then I would like realize I probably shouldn't be walking and stop, but like it\n\n01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.120\ndidn't feel bad or anything.\n\n01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.320\nSo now I'm walking around.\n\n01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.320\nIt's great.\n\n01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:22.720\nUm, it's the worst thing is just you have to ice yourself and then you have to like\n\n01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.120\nlay in bed all this time and I was like, lose my fucking mind.\n\n01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.320\nI've been going through some dark times, having like absolutely nothing to do with like the\n\n01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.120\npain I was in, just like, I like, and nobody likes me.\n\n01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.120\nI want to shoot myself in the dick.\n\n01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:39.360\nUm, speaking of my dick, um, one of the things that the doctor told me way too late in the\n\n01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.440\nprocess is like your, your, your, your penis might be numb for a few weeks and I was like,\n\n01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.400\nwait, this is not part of the deal.\n\n01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.120\nI, I, I'd be like, I'll, I'll, uh, I'll see you on the ice.\n\n01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.120\nYeah.\n\n01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.120\nYeah.\n\n01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.120\nYeah.\n\n01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120\nYeah.\n\n01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120\nYeah.\n\n01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.120\nYeah.\n\n01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120\nSure, buddy.\n\n01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120\nYou try and stop me.\n\n01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120\nYeah.\n\n01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.440\nWhy, why, why was your penis a casualty of that surgery?\n\n01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.120\nI think just the anesthetic guy.\n\n01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120\nOkay.\n\n01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:12.320\nNo, um, he just, I guess, I guess Tony put in a request for the limp.\n\n01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.320\nWas he right?\n\n01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.320\nDid you, did you have a numb penis?\n\n01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.320\nYeah.\n\n01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:20.760\nUm, I, I, I think I have a back, but it's not, I'm not, I'm not, that was very unnerving\n\n01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.760\nout of everything.\n\n01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.960\nUm, but the idea is they, they, they get into your hip joint, right?\n\n01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.600\nSo they, they put a post between your legs and then they get you up on the thing and\n\n01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.200\nthen they put like an, uh, like, uh, a handcuffs around your ankle and then they just like\n\n01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.000\npull your leg really, really hard for the entire duration of the surgery.\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.640\nSo it's mashing into your groin and then it's like the handcuffs are on your ankle.\n\n01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:46.800\nSo you have like, I had pretty sharp pains in both of those areas from the surgery because\n\n01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:50.360\nit's just like you're being stretched as if on a rack for like two hours while they're\n\n01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.560\ndoing the surgery.\n\n01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:57.160\nAnd so that wasn't great, but, uh, yeah, Percocet, uh, was suck like velvet on those\n\n01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.160\ncuffs.\n\n01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.560\nI mean, yeah, or like, they can't like move my dick out of the way.\n\n01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.560\nLike what the fuck?\n\n01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.000\nIt seems like there's plenty of groin to go around.\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.160\nLike I don't, there's ways they could design, put a hole in it or something.\n\n01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.160\nI don't know.\n\n01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160\nThere's ways around this stuff.\n\n01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.160\nI'm sure.\n\n01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.240\nThey're doctors, but, uh, that's been my experience.\n\n01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.400\nI'm, I'm finally every day, like after the surgery, I felt like very noticeably better\n\n01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.040\nand more mobile and more capable of moving around.\n\n01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.640\nLike to the point, like I was a bit shaky, um, even yesterday when I have weight on my\n\n01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.320\nleft leg and now it's, uh, it's, I can walk pretty, it kind of hurts to walk without looking\n\n01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.720\nstupid, but if I want, I can kind of walk mostly normal, um, without, without looking\n\n01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.880\nlike, you know, a person with a limp or anything.\n\n01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.240\nI, yeah.\n\n01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.760\nSo it just, it was just weird.\n\n01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.120\nI just felt like they were, uh, they were very business-y about it.\n\n01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.520\nAnd it's like, well, come on, man, I'm just, I'm freaking out over here.\n\n01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.520\nYeah.\n\n01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.120\nWe don't, uh, we don't, we don't, uh, heal people.\n\n01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.720\nWe just, uh, wait, how's that, how's that saying go?\n\n01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.480\nWe cut the bad stuff out.\n\n01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480\nWe're not healer.\n\n01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480\nWe don't have healers.\n\n01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.480\nWait, what is it?\n\n01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480\nSomething, I don't know.\n\n01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.480\nThere's no, that's clerics.\n\n01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.680\nThe, the, the medical business isn't about, it's, it's like an engineering thing.\n\n01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.720\nIt's like science, you know, it's not a, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,\n\n01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:14.760\nthere's, there's no healing, uh, to it, which, you know, if you, if you, it's, thank God,\n\n01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.400\nthere's science involved for sure.\n\n01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:26.760\nBut, uh, but, uh, but it's also like, like a sick person is obviously like, they have\n\n01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.280\ntwo things wrong with them minimum, the thing that's wrong with them.\n\n01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.840\nAnd then the fact that things being wrong with you is like scary.\n\n01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:40.120\nAnd we, we treat it like, uh, taking your car and like, oh, we have this replacement\n\n01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120\npart.\n\n01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120\nDo you have insurance and all this stuff?\n\n01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.000\nAnd it's like people are, and then people are getting traumatized by the experience\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.320\nof being treated like a car.\n\n01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.320\nRight.\n\n01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.840\nYou're also very cagey about telling me the price of things.\n\n01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.000\nLike I had to agree and set the schedule of the surgery and then agree that if I changed\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.360\nthe date of the surgery, I'd pay $400 before they would tell me the price.\n\n01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.000\nAnd that's gotta be like one of the only places that happens where you don't know like what\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.680\nyou're paying before you agree to have paid it already.\n\n01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.040\nIt was just a very weird experience.\n\n01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.200\nIt really set everything up to be pissed off in myself.\n\n01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.360\nDo you have insurance or?\n\n01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.800\nYeah, but I don't know how any of that shit works.\n\n01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.000\nThat's something they should teach in schools, like how insurance is supposed to fucking\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.280\nwork because I just, I, you know, people are like, oh, you know, your premiums, your out\n\n01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.520\nof pocket, your total, your maximum deductible.\n\n01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.640\nIt's like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.\n\n01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:34.480\nInsurance is another thing exactly like rating systems that once it becomes institutionalized,\n\n01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.280\nit loses all, it's, it just doesn't make any sense anymore.\n\n01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280\nJust play around.\n\n01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:46.320\nIf a cop can pull you over and like put you in jail for not having insurance, then it's\n\n01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.680\nnot insurance anymore.\n\n01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.800\nNow it's part of what allows you to drive a car.\n\n01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:59.120\nIt's like a driver's license to colon first blood part three, like, like, and I understand\n\n01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.480\nI'm not like, I'm not so much of a hippie that I'm like, we don't need insurance and\n\n01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.320\nwe shouldn't be encouraged to have it.\n\n01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.760\nI got someone explained that to me that if I hit someone in a car that doesn't have insurance,\n\n01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.920\nthey're fucking me over, I guess.\n\n01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.100\nBut I don't know, man, it's like, like people talk about that, like it's like the most common\n\n01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.100\nsense in the world.\n\n01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.800\nI'm like, you know, we're through the looking glass.\n\n01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:24.560\nIt may be common sense through the looking glass, but isn't there a more common form\n\n01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.560\nof sense where you don't have to go through the looking glass where it's like you're just\n\n01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.720\nnormal people?\n\n01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.720\nLike, you know, there's got to be a system we can figure out.\n\n01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.280\nWell, I mean, that's the thing is that they take, they take advantage of the fact there\n\n01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280\nis insurance.\n\n01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.280\nSo the people are like, oh, you got to go into insurance and the insurance is like, I don't\n\n01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.280\nknow.\n\n01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.280\nTalk to the doctor.\n\n01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.280\nThe doctor's like, I don't know.\n\n01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.600\nThe medical company says the bag costs $600 and it's like all of you are lying.\n\n01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.040\nIf everybody is, if what everyone is paying for is like some weird bet that you might\n\n01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:59.640\nnot get sick, then why does the end result of it always still that like rich people are\n\n01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.600\nmore allowed to get sick than poor people?\n\n01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:08.000\nIf that's the case, what, can't we just make a system where it's called Medicare for all,\n\n01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nright?\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.640\nLike where you just go, oh, you can't have any, like, like, it got a groundswell.\n\n01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.440\nIt seems like the answer, it seems like any answer to that question, like, why don't we\n\n01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440\ndo it this way?\n\n01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.960\nThe answer is because that would be horrific immediately, which is a good, you know what\n\n01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.960\nI mean?\n\n01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:30.840\nLike even like, I think it is horrific, even conservative, like hardcore capitalist, anti-socialist\n\n01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:38.400\nhealthcare people, I believe would not, they would take one look at a system that was absolute\n\n01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:45.760\ndraconian like cat private healthcare system where like you going, your kid had a cold\n\n01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:51.600\nand you go into a hospital and it's like a McDonald's menu, like cold $500, like, like\n\n01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:59.560\nthe, and all the permutations of that system, like the rich would also go, oh, no, no, no,\n\n01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560\nwe can't have that.\n\n01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.560\nRight.\n\n01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.560\nWell, I mean, I think that that is something people are doing is just, can I pay out of\n\n01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.240\ninsurance, what's your, what's your day rate as a doctor, and then those, those prices\n\n01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.080\nare actually, it depends on the thing, obviously, and I don't think really bad things, it's\n\n01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.640\ngood for, but I think that that's something that has worked for people, which obviously\n\n01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.960\nyou shouldn't go a complete capitalist enterprise, but skipping the insurance entirely and just\n\n01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.000\npaying the doctor what the doctor needs to order the tools and stuff.\n\n01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.520\nI think actually does help because it's not again, like three layers of middlemen all\n\n01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.520\nfucking you.\n\n01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.440\nIt just kind of feels like the, the whole healthcare thing was invented to make the,\n\n01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.640\none of the most important things in the world as boring sounding as possible.\n\n01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.640\nI think, yeah.\n\n01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:45.040\nWhere it's like, like, like, it sounds like, why do I feel like I'm 14 and it's, we're\n\n01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.720\ntalking about Nicaraguan freedom fighters, like, I like with Peter Jennings, like, I,\n\n01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.480\nlike why is my brain turning off when what we're really talking about is, if you're poor,\n\n01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.960\ndo you have a right to live as long as a rich person because that's, that's an exciting\n\n01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.960\nconversation.\n\n01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.960\nRight.\n\n01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960\nThat's some Star Wars shit.\n\n01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960\nYeah.\n\n01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960\nThey want to obfuscate it.\n\n01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960\nIt's, yeah.\n\n01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.760\nIt's like, and, but it almost seems like everyone wants to, you know, like everyone wants to\n\n01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.840\nmake it complicated and, and, but like, yeah, anyways, okay.\n\n01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.880\nSo that's that part of the show.\n\n01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.880\nGame of Thrones.\n\n01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.920\nGame of Thrones.\n\n01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.400\nI binged it.\n\n01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.400\nI'm all caught up.\n\n01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.760\nI'm all caught up.\n\n01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.560\nHe's all caught up.\n\n01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:29.040\nUh, that was really funny when they, when he goes, uh, hey, brand the broken, it's got\n\n01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:35.400\na best story and then they bothered to cut to Arya Stark and she's like, like, it's crazy\n\n01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.960\nto include that shot when you're the one that wrote that line of dialogue and shot it.\n\n01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.520\nLike, it's like, like, and then you're in the end of pain, like cut to Arya.\n\n01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.520\nThat's great.\n\n01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.520\nI love that look.\n\n01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.920\nShe's, she's, she's playing the curb your enthusiasm theme in her head.\n\n01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.920\nYeah.\n\n01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.920\nNo, I love that look.\n\n01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920\nI love that look.\n\n01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.120\nShe, she's saying, I have the best story ever.\n\n01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:01.080\nI saved the universe, I literally started as a little girl that wasn't allowed to play\n\n01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:06.200\nwith arrows, saw my dad's head get cut off and ended up killing the devil for the crippled\n\n01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.920\nbrother that you just said has the best story.\n\n01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:17.520\nHe looks like John Oliver lost his glasses, uh, and had worse breeding and was, was, was\n\n01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.520\nhard.\n\n01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.520\nThat's tough.\n\n01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.520\nWow.\n\n01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.520\nYeah.\n\n01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.520\nWow.\n\n01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.560\nYeah, why, who picked that fucking kid?\n\n01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.560\nThat was really punching out.\n\n01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.280\nIt's not that kid's fault that he got cat.\n\n01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.480\nThat's like, when you cast kids and then you watch them go through puberty on camera, like,\n\n01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480\nwhat am I doing?\n\n01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.760\nI was like, why was it that group of people that got to decide who the nice king is?\n\n01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.280\nCause they're lords.\n\n01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.920\nHere are some people that have a better story than brand.\n\n01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:46.400\nNo offense to brand, uh, Hodor has a more interesting story.\n\n01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.440\nHe's just not there either of the dragon, but let's go, let's go, let's go alphabetical\n\n01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.440\norder.\n\n01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.440\nYeah.\n\n01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:59.200\nI would say most of the white walkers, just even the skeleton, CG skeletons, they've\n\n01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.840\ngone through a lot of shit.\n\n01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:08.040\nBut that skeleton horse, you know, that motherfucker is like, he's like, it's a living, it's a\n\n01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.520\nliving.\n\n01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:15.040\nHow about, how about, uh, uh, uh, John Snow's hairline that that that there's some interesting\n\n01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.040\nstories there.\n\n01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.040\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.040\nThat dude needs bangs.\n\n01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:24.960\nThat's a weird take, what I thought his hair was, I don't know why everybody, what I am\n\n01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.960\nso distracted by that random hairline.\n\n01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:28.960\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.160\nHe's got like a little, he's got like a little half committed count, chocolate, a fucking\n\n01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.840\nwidow's peak that comes.\n\n01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.080\nIt's just like a little seismic burp, like in the middle of his hairline, it's like\n\n01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:45.480\noff center, like it's not, it doesn't even, it's like, uh, are you, are you, are you Eddie\n\n01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:50.200\nMunster or, uh, because that he has symmetry, right?\n\n01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.240\nAnd purpose, like, like, I'm not, and again, it's like, it's genetics.\n\n01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.280\nI mean, we're talking about just the natural thing going on that there, I'm saying, don't\n\n01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.440\ntie your hair back.\n\n01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.280\nYou got to, you got to, you got a weird thing in your hairline.\n\n01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.240\nGive that guy some bangs.\n\n01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.840\nHe'd look cute with bangs, like, I think they show him at the end and he's like, all right,\n\n01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:13.400\ntime to go, uh, work at the, what was up with him walking off into the woods with a bunch\n\n01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.760\nof children and is that a spinoff?\n\n01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:17.760\nThat's a spinoff.\n\n01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.880\nIt's like a job now.\n\n01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.360\nIt's like, uh, you should go work on the wall.\n\n01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.160\nYou should go work on the night's watch now and he's like, there's a night's watch.\n\n01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:31.400\nAnd then, uh, and then there wasn't a night's watch and there, there, there wasn't one.\n\n01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.660\nIt's like, there's no wall.\n\n01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.080\nSo what the fuck is going on?\n\n01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:41.200\nBut his red haired friend who, uh, yeah, who said, no, I'm going to go, uh, that's a pirate's\n\n01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:46.800\nlife for me and then he's like working at the DMV and fucking like, Hey, I want to talk\n\n01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.800\nabout pussy.\n\n01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.800\nOh, great.\n\n01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.960\nThat guy, his whole arc is, his whole arc is, I can't get laid.\n\n01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.520\nHe's like, he's just kept talking about how he used to get a lot of pussy and now he can't\n\n01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.520\nfucking, yeah.\n\n01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.640\nI, I, yeah, he talked too much about it.\n\n01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.880\nI'm glad that lesson got learned.\n\n01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:06.160\nI'm glad, I'm glad he wasn't like the guy that got laid the only thing that was good\n\n01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160\nabout it.\n\n01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.680\nUh, the game of thrones was that berries on after it because that shows fucking a good\n\n01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.640\nI still haven't watched berry.\n\n01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.640\nHuh?\n\n01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.640\nI haven't watched berry.\n\n01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640\nOh, get up on that one, man.\n\n01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640\nIt's fucking great.\n\n01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.640\nI still got Atlanta.\n\n01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.640\nI got to get through all through Atlanta.\n\n01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:22.080\nI mean, alphabetical order.\n\n01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.640\nI got nine seasons of Atlanta now and then you got to go to berry and then, uh, cab,\n\n01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:38.200\ncab, cash, cab, cash, cab, cash, cab, cash, cab, fucking berry.\n\n01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.360\nThat's really good.\n\n01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.000\nThere's an episode where it's just a fight, or is he fights, have you guys seen it where\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nhe, Lily and what's it, uh, god damn it.\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.880\nThat is a fucking good, I don't know how they write a show like that.\n\n01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.200\nIt's really, really funny.\n\n01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.200\nAll right.\n\n01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.360\nWell, don't make me mad at it before I watch it.\n\n01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.960\nYou can also be a good writer too.\n\n01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.520\nI know, but you're starting to make me, you know, just don't push this button.\n\n01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.600\nI'm saying this show breaks boundaries and pushes borders and you're a bad writer.\n\n01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.600\nOkay.\n\n01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.640\nI don't like how he kills people.\n\n01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.880\nI was watching an episode and he like killed someone.\n\n01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.920\nI'm like, I don't like this.\n\n01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.560\nYeah, it's fucking weird.\n\n01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.320\nI don't like that he's learning to act.\n\n01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:21.040\nYeah, it's just, yeah, it's like, why am I supposed to root for his acting career?\n\n01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040\nHe kills people.\n\n01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.280\nThat's not cool, but, but then he goes into the acting class and he's good because he\n\n01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:31.000\njust killed somebody, but that's, but he shouldn't do that.\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.960\nAll right, let's play D&D.\n\n01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:43.720\nYeah, where would we even start Spencer saying that we did that like how, how would that\n\n01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720\ngo now?\n\n01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.240\nI mean, we could, we could talk about it.\n\n01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.800\nI've always been of the opinion that a big part of the problem is you guys don't remember\n\n01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:53.080\nstuff and part of the reason you don't remember stuff is because we only play for like five\n\n01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.240\nminutes and we only play like once every three or four months.\n\n01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:01.160\nAnd I think it's hard to remember five minutes, three months ago, but, but I, I miss a structural\n\n01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.160\nproblem.\n\n01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.480\nI miss, I miss playing it.\n\n01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.480\nSo I want to play again.\n\n01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.480\nYeah.\n\n01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.480\nNo, I miss it too.\n\n01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.600\nBut I just think that I, you know, to the extent that we want to actually get to a place where\n\n01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.560\nyou guys feel confident and comfortable playing it, I think that that's truly a big hurdle\n\n01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.160\nto, to leap or such.\n\n01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.560\nYeah, that would be a good start.\n\n01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.680\nI'm willing to, I'm willing to let's do it for sure.\n\n01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:32.000\nI have a prediction that we can play for 20 minutes every episode and still we're going\n\n01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.520\nto be like, wait, what happened, where did that guy go?\n\n01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.720\nI think that's fair.\n\n01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:41.160\nAnd then every, every four weeks, a third of us isn't going to be here.\n\n01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160\nDo you have your gear with you?\n\n01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.160\nNo.\n\n01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.160\nWe don't need it.\n\n01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.160\nWe don't need it.\n\n01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.160\nYou guys look at it.\n\n01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.160\nI guess you do.\n\n01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.320\nI mean, yeah, you, you want your, your character sheet for, you know, yeah, hypothetically,\n\n01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:56.680\nyeah, but you'd have to do a good walkthrough and like bring us back to where we were.\n\n01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:57.680\nRight.\n\n01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.680\nLet's, you want to try?\n\n01:22:58.680 --> 01:22:59.680\nI mean, sure.\n\n01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:00.680\nShall we?\n\n01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:01.680\nOh, good.\n\n01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.680\nAll right.\n\n01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:03.680\nBring him up, sir.\n\n01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:04.680\nWho's got dice?\n\n01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.680\nDo you have our character sheets as well?\n\n01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.680\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:07.680\nTommy P.\n\n01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.680\nTommy P.\n\n01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.680\nThank you.\n\n01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.680\nHey, Levy.\n\n01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:11.680\nGet down here.\n\n01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.680\nOh yeah.\n\n01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.680\nWe need Levy.\n\n01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.680\nIt's your Memorial Day show.\n\n01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:15.680\nSteve Levy.\n\n01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.680\nThere he is.\n\n01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.680\nLevy.\n\n01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:24.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:26.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.680\nAll right.\n\n01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.680\nNow how should we start, Spencers?\n\n01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.680\nYou want music and you give us a little breakdown?\n\n01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:49.680\nLast time on Harmon Quest, our heroes.\n\n01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:50.680\nHarmon Quest?\n\n01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.680\nHarmon Quest comes to TV, not on the, on the computer.\n\n01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:01.600\nI saw someone like Karmic Quest season 2 I think aired on Comedy Central something like Europe or something\n\n01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.320\nI don't know, but I saw a screenshot blew my mind\n\n01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.940\nWe're not getting money from that. I know shit. Where's my money?\n\n01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:16.160\nThe guys the people they had they had left they had left the town. What was that town fightsville or some shit?\n\n01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.120\nThey left fightsville because they felt like they did a bad job\n\n01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:26.960\nAnd then they met a cult that did exercises and they did exercises and then they left the cult and found another cult\n\n01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:33.880\nThat was summoning a demon and then they helped them summon the demon and then the demon came out and started killing people\n\n01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.200\nAnd they were like well this sucks\n\n01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:41.480\nLet's leave and then the church militant came and slaughtered the demon and then then they were like well\n\n01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.920\nYeah, we're a lot worse than this than everyone else is so let's stop doing this\n\n01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:51.120\nLet's be a farmer and then they went to go be a farmer, but they didn't actually go anywhere\n\n01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.840\nI think they were deciding to do that and so we rejoin our heroes\n\n01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:03.680\nNow or in the future depending on which they choose at a point at which they had been farming or made a decision\n\n01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:16.840\nTo start farming and we're gonna go about doing that now\n\n01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.000\nYou got your dice. I got my dice. All right, so\n\n01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:30.920\nAll right, I any question. I examine my surroundings. All right, you're in a you're in an empty field\n\n01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:35.200\nYou see a bunch of slaughtered cultists. Oh wait. Well, do you want to be farming or do you want to be?\n\n01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.120\nDeciding to be farming and go to search out a farm to farm it\n\n01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:43.360\nI say we're kind of half like half heartedly farming right now. All right\n\n01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:50.360\nYou found the town of Potos Donos the farming village. There's about it's not much of a farming village\n\n01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.920\nThere's like six farms and there's only there's only a handful of people you haven't really met them\n\n01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.880\nYou just kind of you rolled up on a farm\n\n01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.600\nYou killed a fucking ghost that was haunting the farm and then you're like well\n\n01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.240\nI'm gonna I'm gonna take this farm now you started farming it feels like the earth had been salted or something\n\n01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.520\nSo you're making a really hard time hard time getting crops out\n\n01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:15.800\nBut this is your first harvest in the first in the first half of your farm and your other half of the farm is just ready to\n\n01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:20.720\nBe planting.

We're fine. The more you want something more it hurts to be bad at it, right?\n\n01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:55.820\nIt's terrible. I\n\n01:28:55.900 --> 01:29:01.420\nMean is there a way to retry like they kind of put our feel like that's what babies do like like that\n\n01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:06.540\nWell, when they're bad at something we go you can try again and they're like I'm kind of old and I was a priest\n\n01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:09.660\nAnd it's like I you keep killing people and not knowing what you're doing\n\n01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.260\nLike it's some point if you're saying to that guy. Oh\n\n01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:19.660\nCome on try again. It's like it's enabling. Okay, so you're saying just potato farming is good enough for you\n\n01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:21.660\nNo, like you're you're you're\n\n01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:23.460\nWhich is fine\n\n01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:27.220\nThat's what you're okay with. Well, I'd like to see the day when I really\n\n01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:33.220\nIs really hungry for adventure. I guess I mean I haven't seen that day like I'm still recoiling from being so bad at\n\n01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:38.180\nI mean, do you think that that demons don't exist anymore that that you that the world doesn't have\n\n01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:48.260\nCome on after all the stories we've been through I know exactly yeah, I know demons exist\n\n01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:55.220\nOkay, so you and you're you're you're over it. You're you're you're good to go now that you like you're happy\n\n01:29:55.220 --> 01:30:00.660\nYou're happy. Hey, tell me you're happy. Look me in the eye and say that you're happy right now\n\n01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.420\nI can't tell you that\n\n01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:06.860\nThat doesn't that's not I wasn't happy before either. I was anxious\n\n01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:11.100\nI'm trying to I'm trying to find the thing that makes me happy\n\n01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:17.620\nBut more importantly also that hurts the least people I want to help the world. I feel like I was kind of getting in the way\n\n01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.900\nDiarrhea, are you gonna say something something on your mind young man? I\n\n01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:28.380\nI mean look, it's it's not as fulfilling, but this this this potato farming really is scratching an itch for me\n\n01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.780\nI'm gonna put these in the oven. I'm gonna invent the oven\n\n01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:37.100\nDamn\n\n01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:43.820\nI'm gonna I'm gonna put these in the equivalent of an oven. It's a kiln. It's a potato kiln hell. Yeah\n\n01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:51.940\nI I cast a fireball to heat up the oven faster. You do that. I\n\n01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.700\nMean, I still have I still have powers. Yeah, me too\n\n01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:03.620\nI heal the potatoes up. They're raw again. Now you now you got to cook them\n\n01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:05.940\nThey're unpeeled\n\n01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:13.060\nYeah, the farm didn't have ready access to water and Dan's ability to create water was instrumental in growing the potatoes. Oh\n\n01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:16.420\nThat's just a bit of backstory that's\n\n01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:23.980\nSpends I think we're wasting our talents right now. I think are there rival farming families\n\n01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:27.220\nThere's one rival farmer. What was her name?\n\n01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.100\nKetamine\n\n01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.460\nAll right\n\n01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:33.460\nShe's a hard worker and she's really\n\n01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:40.060\nReally a competitive about farming which like you don't have to be and like the market's not saturated enough for that to be a thing\n\n01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:45.740\nBut she's like she's always been doing that and she's better than you because she's like she comes from a line of farmers\n\n01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:50.340\nAnd she has a much better farm on a much better. What's her crop of choice tobacco? I\n\n01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:59.980\nThink she's delightful. I met her on Tuesday. She's fantastic. She's a fire plug. You guys sit down. You're gonna if these are gonna go cold. I\n\n01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:15.060\nGotta say you knocked them out of the park again. They're they're growing all right. Yeah. No, it's the they're good\n\n01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:20.900\nBut you're not you're not jealous of that tobacco money that that Ketamine's Rick. Of course\n\n01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:26.180\nOh, she's gonna be better at farming than us. She's been at it forever. We should make friends with her and learn to farm. Okay\n\n01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:34.100\nShe might be single you hear a knock you hear a knock at your door, huh? We hear knock at the door. Yeah, I\n\n01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:42.260\nGet up and go and answer the door. It's a it's a it's a it's a man. It's a raccoon man. He's like he's a beast man\n\n01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:44.060\nHe's a raccoon\n\n01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:48.540\nThat's like yeah, there's all sorts of fantastical races. You've seen him around town\n\n01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:53.700\nYou notice that you notice his name or you know his name's Tom and he's a shopkeeper in the area\n\n01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:59.500\nHe sells all sorts of supplies. It's like hey, so glad you glad you're settling in looks like first harvest is coming\n\n01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.740\nYou do oh a lot of money for this property\n\n01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:07.980\nWell, so I mean that's no big deal, you know, we we we just want people to live here\n\n01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:12.340\nBut over time you might want to be paying paying that off come up with a payment plan\n\n01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:17.820\nWell, we we have a lot of gold from our last quest, don't we sure is that Tom out there?\n\n01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.300\nYeah\n\n01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:28.540\nYeah, it's bring them in you have some potatoes. Come on Tom come in have a potato. Yeah hungry. Yeah. Yeah, sure\n\n01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:31.020\nHow's it going? Don't go digging in the garbage cans\n\n01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:35.060\nHe's sorry, that's racist\n\n01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:47.260\nThis is this is some crops you got going these are this year this year yield, huh? Yeah, yeah, I mean obviously we're not that good yet\n\n01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:52.580\nNo, that's fine. No one's it is when they just start, you know, I I started selling stuff when I was a kid\n\n01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:58.420\nI didn't know what to charge. Do do we buy this land from you? No, no, but I do own most the land\n\n01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:01.700\nI don't mind it and I'm not gonna be a bad guy about it\n\n01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:07.460\nBut I mean, you know, it's just that land is like a big thing. You're you don't seem to be lords so like, you know\n\n01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:09.460\nWe didn't charge you for killing the ghost\n\n01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:11.300\nYeah\n\n01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:15.460\nWell, I could give you a big discount. That's a that's a great point. I'll knock off\n\n01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:22.580\nHe does he pulls out an abacus and he starts doing a thing like yeah, we'll take 10% off of that. That's fine\n\n01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.580\nYeah, just keep me at get our abacus\n\n01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:31.220\nThat's a coincidence because we're all also having a deal on ghost killing and\n\n01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.660\nI just make the beads the same\n\n01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.700\nIt looks like even Steven\n\n01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:46.540\nI don't want to be a grumpy Gus, but there was a buyer on this house even with the ghost\n\n01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.740\nSo I don't feel like it's that much of a value, but I'm someone wanted your haunted ass house\n\n01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:56.620\nYeah, man, the farm from from properties going from this is a nice neighborhood. You think their potatoes taste this good\n\n01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:02.300\nI they don't I can't tell I got to make a calculated assessment. That's part of being a\n\n01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:09.620\nEntrepreneur, let's give this guy a potato. All right. Look like we need to sell some potatoes. Obviously yeah over time\n\n01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.740\nYeah, no you guys are farmers. This is like in your wheelhouse, huh?\n\n01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:16.380\nYeah, I mean we're learning we're getting right. I'm sorry\n\n01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:21.020\nYou're comparing us to this person that I don't believe exists that wanted to buy a haunted house\n\n01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:27.620\nOh, yeah, they did her name is Kagura. She loves busting ghosts. Actually, you know, I think she's busting a ghost right now\n\n01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:30.540\nYou hear outside in your farm area. You hear a fire\n\n01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:34.820\nWell, there's a I hear fire. You hear a fire\n\n01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.620\nI'm getting up putting my napkin down\n\n01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:45.020\nLeaving my silverware and going outside. I follow Carlos. I love fire. So I'm excited\n\n01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:48.020\nBecause I'm Chad the fire liker. Yeah\n\n01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:51.860\nall right, so you go out back to where your farm is and\n\n01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:56.500\nNot not much of your farm, but say about five feet of your farmland\n\n01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:03.540\nHas been replaced by a giant tree and that tree is on fire and outside of that flaming tree\n\n01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:07.620\nNo inside of that flaming tree. You see a ghost. It seems to be trapped. It seems like a wraith\n\n01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:13.860\nYou guys know about ghosts a little bit. It's a wraith and arguing about that wraith is a is a is a\n\n01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.860\nwoman who looks like a druid and\n\n01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:24.100\nShe has like a mask on the side of her head like like a tribal mask and she's yelling at a small mole a mole man\n\n01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:30.180\nThey're arguing. They're like the mole man's like I can't I don't care what you want to do with these ghosts\n\n01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:36.180\nThis is not a place for you to be used your magic. This is someone's property and she's like I can't I can't be told\n\n01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:41.140\nWhen or where to bust ghosts. This is just my my calling if you need the but ghosts gone anyway\n\n01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.260\nSo they're arguing about that\n\n01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:49.940\nAnd she's a druid. Yeah, she's she looks like a druid. So I'm a druid too. Oh, yeah, it's no a secret language\n\n01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:55.220\nOh, yeah, I go. Hey, yeah, what's what's what's the beef? They're like, hey new guys\n\n01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:01.260\nI was tracking this wraith tried to catch it in the spirit tree, you know, I conjured up a tree. I'll help you\n\n01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:06.220\nGod, I got this tied up. You want to take care of this mole game off my back. That'd be cool. I\n\n01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:11.580\nI sense motive on the on the mole. All\n\n01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:18.740\nRight the mole he's just he's like a classic. What do you call it?\n\n01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:23.220\nLike he loves laws and rule of order and he's just he has a lot of\n\n01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:27.860\nFestidious laws you saw him when he first moved to the town he wouldn't shut up about laws and stuff\n\n01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.140\nHe's telling you you're always fucking up\n\n01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:32.340\nbut he doesn't really do much about it other than show up and yell and so\n\n01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:36.660\nHe's he's been doing that and he's like this is an unauthorized druidic magic zone\n\n01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:42.100\nYou can't be putting trees up in places and that's kind of his angle is she's infracting the law and she's like, you know\n\n01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:49.140\nI've got to kill this thing. It's like was this thing here before she put the tree here or is the tree containing the thing?\n\n01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:52.020\nI'm a little confused. She was chasing the wraith\n\n01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:57.300\nSo she was chasing it across your farm and she could finally caught up to it and cast this tree to catch all right\n\n01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:59.780\nWell, I think I can settle this. This is our property and\n\n01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:03.500\nIt sounds like if we give permission for there to be a wraith tree on it\n\n01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:10.580\nThen then there's no law being broken. Well, that's all well and good, but I believe this is Tom's property\n\n01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:16.980\nSo maybe we should get him is he around Tom's actually he kind of wandered out to see that. He's like hmm. Oh raccoon Tom\n\n01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:21.940\nYeah, yeah, well, he was just eating our potatoes and I mean we're kind of subletting\n\n01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:27.160\nTom's like well ghosts don't help anyone really so I think I'm okay with this. Yeah\n\n01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:32.200\nYeah, thanks for the wraith tree. Oh, yeah, it grows wraith berries\n\n01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:37.720\nSo he's this is safe now here. This is well, it's on fire\n\n01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.200\nSo you got to contain that but the fire will burn out along with a wraith should be good pretty soon\n\n01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.920\nOh, okay, unless it escapes. Didn't you Carlos? Didn't you create water?\n\n01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.800\nI yes\n\n01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.000\nWhat was that Spencer? That's a spell. It's a cleric spell create water.

I think I believe those are just roots root tendrils\n\n01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:04.520\nThat's the potato saying please let me be a potato. Let me live don't eat me\n\n01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:10.520\nAnd then you say peel off the eyes of a potato and then you eat before you eat before you eat them, right?\n\n01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.160\nDo you ever feel guilt about that?\n\n01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.160\nNow that I describe it.

You can't do it super easily\n\n01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:53.000\nIt takes like a couple circles of initiation to learn the rights and stuff\n\n01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.920\nBut we could talk about that.

The answer is no, I'd rather be\n\n01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:43.400\nI'd rather be uh, I'd rather be trying to kill demons.

It's you know for a guy who's named diarrhea. It's really\n\n01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.960\nI'm so constipated. Oh, no, really? Yeah\n\n01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:51.160\nThere's just potatoes all the time. There's a lot of starch. We need roughage. We got to get some uh\n\n01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.560\nSo we should probably talk about\n\n01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:55.960\nIn light of our conversation with Tom\n\n01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:00.600\nWe got to figure out how to monetize. I mean, we're only growing enough potatoes to eat right now\n\n01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:04.040\nWe're living on property that he claims is not ours\n\n01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:07.960\nAnd then we feel like we're just kind of squatting because we call the ghost here\n\n01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.280\nIt's I mean, do you think if we join their cult they won't charge us?\n\n01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:18.760\nWell, it seems like he might be more sympathetic, but then again, there's always the danger that you know\n\n01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:21.480\nWe get sucked back into a world. We don't want to be a part of\n\n01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:25.880\nOr or even, you know, you say back like a world of adventure\n\n01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.640\nBut what if we just end up being shitty potato farmers that are in a pyramid scheme?\n\n01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:37.800\nWell, didn't that happen last time? Well, I mean in a manner of speaking. Yeah, I I'm I'm I'm fucking miserable you guys\n\n01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:44.040\nI hate I hate this life. I want to like I'll do anything other than just fucking grow a potato\n\n01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:47.240\nYou ever fucking see a potato? Yeah\n\n01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.280\nWhat are you talking about? They're the worst\n\n01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:57.160\nThey're just well, how do you feel about olives? Huh olives?

Let's fucking like I\n\n01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.560\nI mean, it doesn't have to be so dramatic like like oh, we hate each other. We love each other\n\n01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.320\nBut like we were a band of adventurers and then I was like we're doing this badly\n\n01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:20.840\nWhat if we were potato farmers? You guys came with me, but like, you know, and now you're like, I'm miserable\n\n01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:27.640\nI'm miserable. I'm like, you know, I'm not happy, but you're not happy. I'm committed to giving potato farming a chance\n\n01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:31.720\nYou were our leader. You were you were the guy that was the most driven among us.

I forgot how much that song meant to me\n\n01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:56.680\nYeah, you see this you see the tear. I'm a little embarrassed. I didn't want to wipe it away because I thought I'd try to touch it\n\n01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.680\nBecause those lyrics are as true today as they\n\n01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:02.600\nWhy do we become farmers? We should have become musicians\n\n01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:06.600\nIt could have been a rambling band\n\n01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:13.240\nI'm not gonna be a negative guy. I mean that might be the way maybe we feed ourselves from the land and then we go do music\n\n01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.560\nDuring the day.
