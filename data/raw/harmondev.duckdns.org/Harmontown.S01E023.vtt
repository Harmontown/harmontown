WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.880
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is once again in session.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.880
We got a good evening tonight everybody.

00:28.880 --> 00:33.880
Won't you please welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:33.880 --> 00:47.880
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, grandmaster, grandmaster, master of rap, grandmaster,

00:47.880 --> 00:55.280
not gonna rap about dicks or aster, gonna rap about real things, sophisticated rap, real

00:55.280 --> 01:02.760
things, nothing elings, rap, rap, rap, rap, not gonna rap about dicks or balls, not gonna

01:02.760 --> 01:09.760
rhyme it with Niagara Falls, not gonna rap about bucks and nuts, not gonna do it, but

01:09.760 --> 01:10.760
it's hard.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.760
Just give me a second.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.680
Alright, Dan, Dan, that really wasn't fair to you.

01:16.680 --> 01:17.680
Give me a second.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.680
First of all, welcome everybody to NerdMilks.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.680
Welcome one and all.

01:19.680 --> 01:27.320
Thank you for coming, thank you for listening.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.720
Again, that wasn't really fair because that was, I was just trying out our new theme song

01:30.720 --> 01:31.720
for the tour.

01:31.720 --> 01:32.720
Alright.

01:32.720 --> 01:37.000
That's our new, we're doing all unlicensed music, it's all our own music.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.240
Yeah, so do you want to start off with a proper rap beat?

01:40.240 --> 01:48.080
Because I have a selection of three unlicensed, totally our own rap beats, and I feel that

01:48.080 --> 01:53.800
it's only fair for the audience to know that this is the first Harmontown where you are

01:53.800 --> 01:54.800
not drinking.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
That's true too.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.800
You can probably already tell.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
Yeah.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.800
Listen, if it goes poorly, I will clear this theater.

02:00.800 --> 02:07.080
If it goes poorly, I'll bail, but I'm this cleansed with Erin.

02:07.080 --> 02:11.520
She's my girlfriend, I love her, I do things out of support for her, and also if she's

02:11.520 --> 02:17.360
not eating, I won't be fed anyway, so she's doing this four-day cleanse where we drink

02:17.360 --> 02:23.680
these green, gooey things and you don't drink liquor on them.

02:23.680 --> 02:28.240
If the show starts going poorly, I promise I'll just collapse into the bottle, but I

02:28.240 --> 02:31.080
wanted to see for the sake of science.

02:31.080 --> 02:35.200
More importantly, speaking of science, I just want to, let's give me one of these beats.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.520
I want to be a good rapper, a sophisticated rapper.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.320
Dan, you've probably not heard these.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.000
I have three selections from our new musical director, Ryan Elder, who I believe is in

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
the house tonight.

02:45.000 --> 02:55.240
We're making a documentary here, and we can't use Xanadu in some of our favorites because

02:55.240 --> 02:57.000
we can't afford it, right?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.520
You people are easy to disappoint tonight.

03:02.520 --> 03:08.920
My physical health and our lack of copyright infringement really has you on a tear.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.720
You poor fucking babies.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.560
Dan, Dan, have a drink.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.360
Sorry.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.360
You have three choices, Dan.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.440
All right, two more outbursts like that and I'll have a drink.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.640
Dan, these are your three rap beat choices.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.640
You have sexy, slow.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.440
You have freestyle and you have aggressive.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.560
Well, I'm ready.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.760
Are you LL Cool J, I Need Love?

03:32.760 --> 03:34.720
Are you freestyle?

03:34.720 --> 03:38.400
Are you Emineminent right now or are you Beastie Poison?

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
Let's do aggressive.

03:39.400 --> 03:44.680
You're gonna go for aggressive, all right?

03:44.680 --> 03:45.680
The audience is spoken.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.680
Let's see what we got.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.360
All right, clear your head, clear your head.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.360
No dicks.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.360
No balls.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.360
Yo.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.360
Yo.

03:52.360 --> 03:53.360
Yo.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.360
Yo.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.360
Yo.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.360
Yo.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.360
I rock the microphone.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.360
My name is Dan Harmon.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.360
Some people might try to tell you others.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.360
Roger PutzHarmon.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.360
God damn it.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.360
I fucking suck.

04:02.360 --> 04:10.360
I want to get your mom to fuck me.

04:10.360 --> 04:13.360
I want to suck her titties and fuck her pussy so hot.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.360
I want to fuck your mama outside the front yard.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.360
I want to put my dick inside her.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.360
God damn it.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.360
All right, now stop it.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.360
We're not going to reward me for...

04:24.360 --> 04:26.360
I can't take it anymore.

04:26.360 --> 04:29.360
We're going on this tour, Jeff.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.360
We're representing Los Angeles out there.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.360
There's 20 cities waiting for us.

04:33.360 --> 04:38.360
I'm not going to roll into Austin talking about dicks and balls and butts.

04:38.360 --> 04:42.360
I want to write good music.

04:42.360 --> 04:46.360
I want to be a good singer and songwriter.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.360
I don't think people come to Harmontown because you're a craftsman.

04:49.360 --> 04:55.360
When it comes to rapping, I think they like the free-for-all that it is.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.360
It becomes very adolescent and purio.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.360
Well, let's do it this way.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.360
We got a big crowd tonight.

05:00.360 --> 05:07.360
Are there any professional singer-songwriters?

05:07.360 --> 05:10.360
Possibly Cambridge educated.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.360
We'll take Oxford, but is there anyone...

05:12.360 --> 05:14.360
Cambridge educated singer-songwriters?

05:14.360 --> 05:16.360
Is there anybody that can teach a tutorial for Dan?

05:16.360 --> 05:18.360
Oh, I was just kidding.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.360
Oh.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.360
Eric Eidl.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.360
Eric Eidl.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.360
Thank you for coming.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.360
Thank God.

05:39.360 --> 05:44.360
I am so sorry for what I've done, but this is very fortuitous, Eric.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.360
Thank you for showing up.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.360
Eric Eidl, comedic and gay icon.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.360
Eric Eidl is here.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.360
Eric Eidl.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.360
Is that Dave Davis?

05:57.360 --> 05:59.360
Yes, it's Jeff Davis, our Comptroller.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.360
Eric, I'm so glad you're here.

06:01.360 --> 06:06.360
Obviously, your world renowned for your craftsmanship in comedy songwriting.

06:06.360 --> 06:11.360
There's people in this audience that probably have every single one of your songs memorized.

06:11.360 --> 06:20.360
I have a problem where I like to write songs, I like to improvise them,

06:20.360 --> 06:26.360
but I lose control and I go to a shitty, non-sophisticated place.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.360
You're a hero of mine, a mentor of mine.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
Can you please help me?

06:29.360 --> 06:31.360
Can you please tell me how to...

06:31.360 --> 06:34.360
What would you do if you were going to write a perfect song?

06:34.360 --> 06:37.360
Well, it's a very interesting question.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.360
You want to write the perfect song?

06:41.360 --> 06:42.360
Yeah.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.360
Then ask yourself what's true.

06:45.360 --> 06:51.360
Then open your heart and the truth will start to write the song for you.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.360
Jesus, this is what I'm talking about.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.360
When our first fuck dance mother...

06:59.360 --> 07:00.360
What?

07:01.360 --> 07:05.360
She asked me for another but he was too wide.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.360
I fucked his father and nuzzled both his nuts.

07:08.360 --> 07:12.360
I dug all his chins and took two chins and put it in their butts.

07:12.360 --> 07:16.360
Harmony Town, Harmony Town, Harmony's mum is on the ground

07:16.360 --> 07:24.360
taking bonus by the fountain, Harmony's on the ground, Harmony's on the ground, Harmony's on the ground,

07:24.360 --> 07:38.840
Now Eric, I have a question. Yes, sir. What would you rather do?

07:38.840 --> 07:45.760
Fuck dance mother in the butt or make her eat your poop? I've asked myself this many times.

07:45.760 --> 07:51.900
And here is my reply. I feed her my poo and fuck her butt too and bitter a foam goodbye.

07:51.900 --> 07:57.900
Humming town, humming town, Hummer Tommy's on the ground taking bonus by the pound.

07:57.900 --> 08:05.400
Down it Hummer Town, Hummer Town, Hummer Town, Hummer Tommy's on the ground taking bonus by the pound.

08:05.400 --> 08:10.400
Down it Hummer Town. You guys are only doing what I've been doing all along.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.400
I fucked a million mamas already. I wanted a perfect song.

08:14.400 --> 08:25.400
So open up your heart my friends and tell me what you see. Both your mothers sucking dicks and drinking all my pee.

08:25.400 --> 08:31.400
Oh! Humming town, Hummer Town, Hummer's mum is on the ground taking bonus by the pound.

08:31.400 --> 08:39.400
Down it Hummer Town, Hummer Town, Hummer's mum is on the ground taking bonus by the pound.

08:39.400 --> 08:45.400
Down it Hummer Town.

09:09.400 --> 09:22.400
Well, you see Dan, you just have to open your mind and let it all come out.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.400
Alright, I think I understand.

09:24.400 --> 09:31.400
Sometimes in all of our lives there comes a crisis when all you really need to set yourself right is for Eric Idle to come out.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.400
And remind you that.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.400
The thing about nuzzling your father's nuts.

09:36.400 --> 09:43.400
Alright, alright, fine. Well, why don't we keep the, since I'm sober and I'm no entertainment myself and since we are going on the road,

09:43.400 --> 09:49.400
why don't we keep the mentorship going, you know, see if we can keep getting advice and guidance from people.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.400
Well, I want to ask you a question before you do that.

09:52.400 --> 09:58.400
Just while we have the opportunity, we're going out, you just turned 40. Your 40th birthday was a few days ago.

09:58.400 --> 10:11.400
And we're going out on this big tour, which is very ambitious. It was a very long, grueling schedule.

10:11.400 --> 10:17.400
What do you hope to accomplish by this? Is there a goal for you in terms of what you want to come home with?

10:17.400 --> 10:22.400
What do you want to return with? What's the golden fleece that you expect to get from this?

10:22.400 --> 10:27.400
Well, I mean, I have a couple of different goals because I'm not a big planner.

10:27.400 --> 10:31.400
And obviously the show is not, like, you know, written.

10:31.400 --> 10:38.400
And that's controlling.

10:38.400 --> 10:43.400
Striking the music stand.

10:43.400 --> 10:48.400
Don't fight me.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.400
Alright.

10:50.400 --> 10:55.400
On the tour bus, I get real rapy.

10:55.400 --> 10:59.400
I'll have to bring some of that cassette head cleaner that the people use.

10:59.400 --> 11:04.400
Did you know that that's an underground amyl nitrate kind of stuff?

11:04.400 --> 11:12.400
Well, no, it's like cassette head cleaner. The fluid, if you huff it, it dilates your anus.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.400
Go on.

11:14.400 --> 11:18.400
End of story.

11:18.400 --> 11:23.400
Sorry, Tron. This copy is going to have to keep the...

11:23.400 --> 11:27.400
Not being playable. Daddy's going out tonight.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.400
I want to drink so bad.

11:30.400 --> 11:39.400
This is what sobriety feels like. It feels like everyone else is drunk.

11:39.400 --> 11:46.400
I think one thing that I would like to accomplish is I would like to learn how to love people

11:46.400 --> 11:54.400
My girlfriend wrote this book. She didn't write it.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.400
But this is a whole track of conversation that I wanted to talk to everybody about tonight.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.400
But I don't want to delay our next guest. He's got it out.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.400
I think we should bring him up and talk to him about touring.

12:05.400 --> 12:28.400
Please welcome to the stage, Patton Oswald.

12:28.400 --> 12:35.400
Oh, my goodness. Yeah, this is exactly the way that I did it on convenience of comedy.

12:35.400 --> 12:41.400
Had a massive comedy legend walk out, do a song for free.

12:41.400 --> 12:47.400
I think we had Steve Martin and Birmingham one night.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.400
Nichols and May came out one evening.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.400
Wow.

12:53.400 --> 12:58.400
Yeah, I mean, I just Facebooked them and they were like, yeah, yeah, we'll come down. No problem.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.400
I found Eric on Craigslist.

13:00.400 --> 13:06.400
Oh, really? You can do it. Because when I do Python searches, I find way different stuff.

13:06.400 --> 13:12.400
I'm the thing. It's like in Python.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.400
Describe to me the tour. What are you doing?

13:15.400 --> 13:16.400
Do new.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.400
Help me help you.

13:18.400 --> 13:23.400
We're leaving on the 10th at 10 a.m. as far as I know.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.400
8 a.m.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.400
Okay.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.400
Okay, just let me start right there.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.400
Try to coordinate the day and time. Have them be the same number.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.400
Already? This is already working.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.400
I'm already glad we got this guy down here.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.400
Okay, good.

13:37.400 --> 13:42.400
Heading from Los Angeles to Phoenix, where we're going to do a show for God knows how many people are actually going to show up.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
You're going to, I'm sorry, you're starting the tour.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.400
Your first show is going to be in Phoenix.

13:47.400 --> 13:58.400
So you're, so basically you are, this is the, that's the equivalent of, alright, I know that there is, there's some chocolate mousse down the road,

13:58.400 --> 14:05.400
but we're going to have cold green beans right now to really make that a treat when it shows up.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.400
Pat, what do you know about Phoenix that we don't know?

14:08.400 --> 14:12.400
Performing in Phoenix is basically, have you ever been to Phoenix?

14:12.400 --> 14:15.400
Yeah, I was there when I was signing some comic books once.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.400
Oh, okay. Yours?

14:18.400 --> 14:24.400
No, I wrote some for, I didn't sign like just some Iron Man shit that I had.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.400
The way you said it was like, I went to Phoenix and I signed some comic books.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.400
Just like graffiti.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
That's when you were really hammered.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.400
Yeah, I was at a low point.

14:32.400 --> 14:37.400
One night I started at Cat and Fiddle, and the next thing I knew I was in Phoenix signing comic books.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.400
I was right up there, Sarah Silverman fired me out.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.400
I was just like, I wrote this, I wrote that, I wrote this, I wrote that.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.400
I was just signing everything.

14:44.400 --> 14:49.400
I was signing, you don't care what the answer is.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.400
I was signing Rob Schrab comic books that I wrote.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.400
That's good, Rob Schrab's in the house tonight, everybody.

14:55.400 --> 14:59.400
There he is.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.400
He's got the disposable assassin.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.400
Highly recommended.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.400
I believe the hardback collection is here in the store if you want to...

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
Yes.

15:08.400 --> 15:16.400
Phoenix is an abandoned moon colony if all of the astronauts were Mexican and on crank.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.400
That is how to think of it.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.400
That is basically the setting.

15:21.400 --> 15:35.400
And if you see any white people, they are either cryptically racist or so gleefully openly racist that it's kind of charming.

15:35.400 --> 15:43.400
We're kind of hoping because of our podcast that we're going to draw a similar essential crowd that we get here.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.400
Is that possible?

15:45.400 --> 15:47.400
But here's the thing you have to keep in mind.

15:47.400 --> 15:51.400
Every city in America has this.

15:51.400 --> 15:56.400
These kind of the smart people, the dreamers, the artists.

15:56.400 --> 16:01.400
I'm just saying, and may I also point out the pasty and frightened.

16:01.400 --> 16:05.400
Before you start going, hey, hey.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.400
Don't run into the street and start fame dancing.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.400
You'll throw something.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.400
We can do it, punch.

16:14.400 --> 16:19.400
But some cities are a much more soap sponge than others.

16:19.400 --> 16:27.400
So Phoenix, you're really going to be ringing that sponge to get as much of this as you possibly can.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.400
If you don't have any advice on how I can do that, do you?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.400
Don't say Morning Zoo teams.

16:31.400 --> 16:37.400
Well, Morning Zoo teams, unfortunately, they're A, you have to be funny on their terms.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.400
And I've done those.

16:39.400 --> 16:46.400
Satellite tours where you do three hour black and you just hold there and they go, okay, Dan, are you ready?

16:46.400 --> 16:49.400
This is Harold and Kazoo in the mornings.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.400
You ready?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.400
Yeah, okay.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.400
And then you just cut into the middle of this thing and they're like, oh, okay.

16:54.400 --> 16:58.400
Up next is some asshole we've never heard of.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.400
Dan Harmon, apparently doing something called Exarptable Tarver.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.400
How did you pronounce those wrong?

17:04.400 --> 17:13.400
I love the Morning Zoo's where the guy, the DJ himself is on the phone using his actual human voice before he brings her on the air going,

17:13.400 --> 17:15.400
hey, Pat, thanks so much for calling in.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.400
I'm going to do this stupid show.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.400
It's the dumbest thing ever.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
Look, I like what you do, man.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
But this is the market I'm in.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.400
So you're cool, right?

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
I'm like, yeah, I guess so.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.400
Okay, so we're going to be on in like three, two.

17:27.400 --> 17:31.400
Hey, it's Flappy and the Bee, we're going to have a little fantastic house.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.400
And I won't even keep it clean.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.400
Say Lea Remedy, boobs.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.400
So hey, they're two simply, and just all these awful.

17:39.400 --> 17:43.400
And they make you do, they make you, they go all their inside jokes.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.400
You have to like join their Smurf patch.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.400
Oh, exactly, yeah.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.400
Hey, give us an AIDS bomb.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.400
What do you want?

17:49.400 --> 17:50.400
Why do you want an AIDS bomb?

17:50.400 --> 17:53.400
I did one because I do improv.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.400
I'm like, Jeff, yeah, you do improv, yeah, you're not chilly, you do the improv.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
How about doing a little rap for us about the pinch of the pump?

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
The pinch of the pump.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.400
The pinch of the pump.

18:03.400 --> 18:08.400
And then yeah, it's all these weird in-jokes that they have not filled you in on the beginnings of.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.400
So hey, it's 9.17 on Thursday morning.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
You know what I mean?

18:11.400 --> 18:12.400
That's bad.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.400
Beef stew.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.400
What?

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
All right.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.400
And then, and then they, I also love the weird.

18:18.400 --> 18:22.400
If you don't immediately pitch it to their kind of whack-a-noodle,

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
party at 6.18 a.m.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.400
If you don't hit that level, they immediately get angry with you

18:27.400 --> 18:29.400
and try to get rid of you like,

18:29.400 --> 18:32.400
whoa, let's get this party pooper out of here and have some fun.

18:32.400 --> 18:39.400
Well, it looks like we just wandered into the fossil yard with a fog horn.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
Fossil yard with a fog horn.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.400
Right.

18:42.400 --> 18:47.400
Well, while Spence puts us all to sleep, we want to tell you about our Flapjack snack attack with Foghead down at the,

18:47.400 --> 18:49.400
I hop on Route 29.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.400
That's right, it's the Foghead Flapjack Snack Attack.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.400
Come on down, bring a plate, stack them high.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.400
Coming up next, I got the I Hate My Boss donut toss over here.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.400
It's gonna be tossing donuts off the roof, bring them bucket if you catch one.

19:01.400 --> 19:05.400
You get a pair of KTRT, the turtle panties that you can wear.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.400
Turtle panties.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
It's just...

19:07.400 --> 19:09.400
Turtle panties.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.400
Turtle panties.

19:10.400 --> 19:15.400
There actually are now, there are things you're gonna have to avoid doing

19:15.400 --> 19:17.400
or you'll bring the wrong people to your show.

19:17.400 --> 19:23.400
So, that said, sometimes bringing the wrong people to your show can make the show kind of amazing.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
They don't quite know what's going on.

19:25.400 --> 19:31.400
But what I don't want to happen is I don't want the 11 people in Phoenix that actually, like, love me.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.400
Yeah.

19:32.400 --> 19:38.400
I don't want them subjected to the 20 people that wandered into chuckled, chuckled nuts.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.400
Going like, let's just see comedy tonight.

19:41.400 --> 19:45.400
And by that I assume someone as funny as Patton Oswalt will be coming out here and then I come out and go,

19:45.400 --> 19:51.400
I have asthma and my girlfriend loves me too much.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.400
Sometimes it makes me feel like a bad person.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.400
What the fuck's going on here?

19:56.400 --> 20:03.400
And then they're ticking my fans' chairs and I'm like, hey, leave them alone.

20:03.400 --> 20:09.400
Well, one thing that I does kind of help if you're on Twitter is interact with people that have been at the show.

20:09.400 --> 20:14.400
And if you keep that conversation going, other people from other cities will see that you're kind of...

20:14.400 --> 20:16.400
They'll start tracking you as you move across.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.400
And I only did that with a website in Myspace.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.400
I didn't have Twitter when I was doing that.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.400
Well, you know, we're going to podcast every single night.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.400
Like, we're doing like a show a day.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
No, sure.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.400
And we're going to get on the bus and then podcast out of the performance.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.400
Okay, but let me stop.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.400
All right.

20:32.400 --> 20:37.400
So that, I know that you're right now in your head.

20:37.400 --> 20:43.400
You're like, yes, we're going to document everything and it's going to be fucking Hunter S. Thompson and the lawyer and the Cadillac.

20:43.400 --> 20:47.400
And I'm going to have the typewriter on my lap and I'm going to chronicle every minute of it.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
Yeah, yeah, that's all right.

20:48.400 --> 20:57.400
Yeah, you will hit a wall way sooner than you think you're going to hit it where you are going to not want your life documented.

20:57.400 --> 21:01.400
You're like, you will start, you will fall into this weird sullen.

21:01.400 --> 21:07.400
I guarantee you one of your podcasts would just be a, hey, Stan, and we're in Vegas.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.400
And I don't know.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.400
We drove all day and now we're here.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.400
And I don't know.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
I don't know.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.400
I don't fucking know.

21:13.400 --> 21:17.400
So, I don't know.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.400
Fuck.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.400
I mean, I don't know.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.400
I don't know.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.400
What do you want?

21:21.400 --> 21:22.400
What do you want me to stay?

21:22.400 --> 21:31.400
Like, and, but it'll be a really, there'll be a weird insightful moment where you will start to realize, oh, people that are on reality shows that want to be filmed all the time.

21:31.400 --> 21:39.400
Those, they are sociopaths because they don't hit the wall that I've just hit where they are never tired of a camera and microphone show.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.400
Yeah, they're just constantly, they're like solar calculators.

21:41.400 --> 21:47.400
The, the, but, but there's a, there's a, there's a little misunderstanding here.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.400
We're not, the show is going to be the podcast.

21:51.400 --> 22:00.400
Like, like, right, because I don't, unlike you, like you, you, you, you have like probably by now you have a solid three hours of, of really refined material.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.400
Yeah, you're right.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
But, right.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.400
Yeah, go ahead.

22:03.400 --> 22:10.400
I'm not going to, but, but, but, but I can't, when I go out in front of people, I don't.

22:10.400 --> 22:14.400
So I'm kind of forcing myself because what's for sale is not what's for sale with you.

22:14.400 --> 22:22.400
So I'm going the other direction and refusing to allow myself to have any, I'm not going to, they're going to be able to hear the show in Phoenix in Austin.

22:22.400 --> 22:26.400
And then I'm going to show up in Austin and go, how about that show in Phoenix?

22:26.400 --> 22:28.400
Remember when I got my ass kicked?

22:28.400 --> 22:29.400
Wasn't that crazy?

22:29.400 --> 22:35.400
But we're going to be doing shows in various venues where a lot of their audience will be local, like they promote their own audience.

22:35.400 --> 22:40.400
These comedy clubs promote their own, like kind of loyal fan base, right, Patton?

22:40.400 --> 22:53.400
Yeah, we ran into some trouble on one of these because they have some clubs kind of have their own corporate culture where their fans have a certain behavior that they try to encourage because they speak more.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.400
Oh no.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.400
Sales of them.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.400
Here's your pickle flappers.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.400
Yeah, there was a, Portland.

22:58.400 --> 23:04.400
There was a club in Champaign, Champaign, Illinois that told, that set out a thing to its, and they had on the website.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.400
These comedians love loud hecklers.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.400
What?

23:08.400 --> 23:14.400
So come out and, and we, I swear to God, we, and we didn't realize what had happened until after the show, we went to their website.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.400
No, after the show, people were coming up.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.400
I've never been in front of a drunker crowd.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.400
And they were like heckling as you would walk.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.400
Like the minute they would go, I'm going to show them a Maria Bamford.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.400
God damn it!

23:24.400 --> 23:25.400
What the fuck?

23:25.400 --> 23:33.400
Like as you were walking up there yelling at you, like you're mounting the guillotine and they're just screaming, you, I'm looking at you.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.400
No.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.400
I haven't said anything yet.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.400
You ever watched up with their own folded clothes in their hands?

23:38.400 --> 23:40.400
There's toilet paper flaming coming out of them.

23:40.400 --> 23:45.400
Pat, I don't know if you know this, but we're traveling with our Dungeon Master because we played D&D in our shows.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.400
So Spencer.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
We definitely go to Phoenix then.

23:48.400 --> 23:53.400
Yeah, that's your, you guys are like, that's your like freedom riders in the south in the sixties.

23:53.400 --> 24:00.400
That's going to bull, bulldozers are going to be exhuming your torpses.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.400
Spencer, you're in deep shit, man.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.400
Yeah, yeah.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.400
We did, okay, we did the club.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.400
Are you doing anything in Washington, D.C.?

24:08.400 --> 24:10.400
Uh, no.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.400
Are we in Maryland or somewhere?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.400
We're in Maryland.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.400
We're in Arlington, Virginia.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
At the Cinema Draft House?

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
Yes.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.400
No, uh, Birchmere.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.400
No, we're at the Taj Mahaa.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.400
In Virginia.

24:24.400 --> 24:29.400
The Taj Mahaa.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.400
Again, I did a club called Sir Lafsalat.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.400
No.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.400
I'm not kidding.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.400
In Milwaukee.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.400
Yeah, that's Milwaukee.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.400
That's my hometown.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.400
Sir Lafsalat, the funny business in the Comedy Cafe.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.400
Sir Lafsalat is, yeah, yeah.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
Yeah.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.400
It's men only.

24:44.400 --> 24:49.400
All I'm saying is we did, we did the Black Cat in D.C. and it was, the show was so packed.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.400
It was, I felt very gratified.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.400
We have sold out the Black Cat.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.400
It was a club I would go to when I was young.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.400
But, well, hang on.

24:57.400 --> 25:01.400
So, I was, so afterwards I'm talking to the club owner and he's really nice.

25:01.400 --> 25:05.400
And I said, hey, so, um, really sold the place out, huh?

25:05.400 --> 25:11.400
He goes, uh, yeah, I mean, you know, we, uh, yeah, you had about 730 tickets sold.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.400
I'm like, well, I mean, it was like literally wall to wall.

25:14.400 --> 25:20.400
Yeah, I mean, we do a lot of, uh, uh, place holds about 900.

25:20.400 --> 25:24.400
Uh, we normally do like thrash shows here and punk shows.

25:24.400 --> 25:32.400
Um, your fans tend to be little, like, like, literally our fans are all these chubby nerds

25:32.400 --> 25:37.400
and they can only put, like, a bunch of little messed out thrash fans.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.400
Yeah, they can easily get 900 of them there.

25:39.400 --> 25:45.400
But our fans are, I'm very excited to come see Zach Galifianakis and Brian Posade.

25:45.400 --> 25:50.400
And so I got the DVRs, catch it all, Dr. Who tonight, so I can watch that at the morning.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.400
But, uh, for the night.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.400
Well, that's outlifting.

25:52.400 --> 25:56.400
There's, there's sections of the country where, where, where this can work in our favor.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.400
Oh, exactly.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.400
You have way more mad.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.400
It's a full house.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.400
Uh, there's seven people.

26:00.400 --> 26:06.400
Well, Norm, your audience is so fat when they have a full house.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.400
They really, yeah.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.400
This place holds, they're not even full.

26:10.400 --> 26:14.400
Yeah, this place holds 900 punk fans or 11 rascal scooters.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.400
So you guys did really well tonight.

26:17.400 --> 26:22.400
We had, well, uh, well, this has been edifying.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.400
Yeah.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.400
So then Patton real quick, I mean, well, I'll just list off from memory where we're going.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.400
Right.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.400
If, if, if one of these cities, uh, uh, brings back horror stories or fun.

26:30.400 --> 26:34.400
I'm, I cannot, I'll just tell you right now, I can't wait to hear the Phoenix podcast.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.400
That's all I'm saying.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.400
All right.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.400
That's going to be interesting.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.400
We go, after that we go to Austin Tech, which is good.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.400
Yeah, that's, that's a, that's a gimme.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.400
That's great.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.400
Then we're going to Atlanta.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.400
Woo!

26:42.400 --> 26:47.400
Atlanta, Atlanta is, is weirdly either fun or awful.

26:47.400 --> 26:51.400
Um, the one thing I love about Atlanta is the freak scene there.

26:51.400 --> 26:56.400
Uh, that's the one place because the, the, it's so hot and so humid.

26:56.400 --> 27:03.400
There's this, we drove by this golf club called the vault and it was like early even like

27:03.400 --> 27:04.400
five o'clock.

27:04.400 --> 27:05.400
I had to be 111 degrees out.

27:05.400 --> 27:11.400
So watching all the guys with just their makeup, like they're all in black and they're

27:11.400 --> 27:16.400
trying to get into the vault and they're so committed, but it's all like a, a goth, a

27:16.400 --> 27:19.400
goth in Atlanta is a fucking hero.

27:19.400 --> 27:25.400
Like that is a super hero when it's like, man, that black lipstick is just running out and

27:25.400 --> 27:27.400
look like I was, I was eating dead syrup.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.400
I thought it looked black.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.400
We're sold out in Atlanta.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.400
Of course you are.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.400
Yeah.

27:32.400 --> 27:37.400
And then it's a Nashville and Charlotte and then some, for some reason also, I don't know

27:37.400 --> 27:42.400
how many gigs you guys did on your tour and, and what the pace was, but it's almost every

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
night we're doing a show.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.400
And so that's how it was for us.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.400
We're in Brooklyn the next night from Charlotte.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.400
Holy shit.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
And it's going to be January.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.400
It's going to be.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.400
Yeah.

27:52.400 --> 27:56.600
And then we go up into the North, Northeast and then across the top of the country during

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
late January.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.600
What the really?

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
Yeah.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.400
It's, it's, it's, it's my first tour.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.400
Yeah.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.400
It's going to be your last tour.

28:05.400 --> 28:10.400
I didn't want, again, that was sitting right there, but, um, well, you know, you, there's

28:10.400 --> 28:14.400
a good chance that you're going to get to be one of those, um, oh, what, what, what else

28:14.400 --> 28:15.400
would he have done?

28:15.400 --> 28:16.400
Yeah.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.400
What an amazing legend he was.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.400
Yeah.

28:18.400 --> 28:23.400
That's, that's semi hadn't jackknifed on, uh, who knows who would have fired him.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
Yeah.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.400
Maybe.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.400
Wow.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.400
Dan.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.400
Uh, I don't.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.400
Wow.

28:30.400 --> 28:35.400
The Northeast in January.

28:35.400 --> 28:40.400
Then there's one night we go from Kansas City, Kansas to Denver, Colorado.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.400
That, that's a long, that's a long pull.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.400
Right.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.400
That's same.

28:44.400 --> 28:49.400
And also Denver at this time of year is really dicey to get to with the ice in the, in the

28:49.400 --> 28:50.400
Rocky Mountains.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.400
Yeah.

28:51.400 --> 28:54.400
You're getting into like, you know, Scatman Crothers in the shining, like get a, go get

28:54.400 --> 28:57.400
a fucking hobie cat or something to get through that snow.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.400
It's going to be bad.

28:59.400 --> 29:05.400
I would, I, I would take a, you know, take some, take some sturdy pioneer women to eat

29:05.400 --> 29:10.400
in case you get stuck in a snowstorm or something.

29:10.400 --> 29:17.400
What's your, what's your Pemekin budget on this, uh, tour?

29:17.400 --> 29:19.400
Holy shit, Dan.

29:19.400 --> 29:23.400
Um, everyone get a clipping of his clothes as a relic cause this could be it.

29:23.400 --> 29:27.400
I mean, this is like Jamesy, like fuck off, I'm getting in my convertible.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.400
See you later.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.400
It's almost certain that we're going to miss a gig or two on this thing cause it's so

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
breakneck and it's going to be bad weather.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.400
Yeah.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.400
And, uh, you know, it's also, you know, the weather's getting worse and worse, you know,

29:38.400 --> 29:41.400
like that's more storms, more traffic.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.400
We're fucked.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.400
What the?

29:43.400 --> 29:44.400
All right.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.400
Fine.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.400
We're fucked.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.400
Goodbye, dude.

29:47.400 --> 29:53.400
Um, I mean, if you say you're fucked enough, you, you, you garner the favor of a very gullible

29:53.400 --> 29:54.400
God, right?

29:54.400 --> 29:55.400
Yeah.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.400
No, that's true.

29:56.400 --> 30:00.400
If you say it won't happen, uh, that, that, uh, that antler, uh, the moose thing on the

30:00.400 --> 30:02.400
wall, that looks kind of rickety.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.400
Oh, you said it, it's not going to fall.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.400
That's not going to fall.

30:06.400 --> 30:12.400
Just as many weird rituals as you can think of do them every morning.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.400
Spinning witter shins, rabbit feet.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.400
I don't know what.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.400
Pat, were you guys on the bus the whole time?

30:19.400 --> 30:20.400
Were you always in the bus?

30:20.400 --> 30:21.400
How many breaks were there?

30:21.400 --> 30:22.400
Hotels?

30:22.400 --> 30:23.400
I know we were always in the bus.

30:23.400 --> 30:27.400
Uh, sometimes we would just get a day room or you could use the day room and shower and

30:27.400 --> 30:29.400
change because we couldn't afford four hotel rooms.

30:29.400 --> 30:36.400
Um, so we've stayed, we stayed in some hotels that were so super, like the, the, the, the

30:36.400 --> 30:39.400
ghost of so many ex suicidal truckers.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.400
We're just crying out for the mattresses.

30:42.400 --> 30:46.400
I don't know what kind of hotel accommodations you've, uh, where do you think you're staying?

30:46.400 --> 30:48.400
Are you sleeping on the bus or?

30:48.400 --> 30:51.400
There's, there's some things where like we have to get in the bus right after the show

30:51.400 --> 30:54.400
and there's a giant like long, long hall to somewhere else.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.400
There, there will be gigs where we land.

30:56.400 --> 31:00.400
We have like a couple hotel rooms to, you know, shower and shave and that kind of stuff.

31:00.400 --> 31:05.400
Right now Bob Seeger is feeling a huge disturbance in the forest where he, wherever he's sitting,

31:05.400 --> 31:08.400
it's like, Jesus, someone, oh, someone's going to die.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.400
I feel it.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.400
I got to do something.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.400
But I'll warm up my Grammy fingers.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.400
Yeah, exactly.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.400
At least the bus will be relaxing because there's going to be cameras everywhere and

31:17.400 --> 31:19.400
we're making a movie the whole time.

31:19.400 --> 31:20.400
Oh yeah, that's good.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
We're like casting our thing from the bus every day.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
It's going to be awesome.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.400
I don't know.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.400
Wow.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.400
All we had were cameras.

31:26.400 --> 31:31.400
Like if, again, this is, and again, in 10 years, what you're doing is going to seem quaint.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.400
Like, yeah, they didn't, they didn't have, they didn't have any of the anal mics.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.400
It was weird.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.400
It was, it was only 2013.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.400
It was a simple time.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.400
It's going on.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.400
This guy's butt.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.400
Yeah.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.400
Well, is there anything before I know your time is precious?

31:43.400 --> 31:44.400
Very precious.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.400
Yes.

31:45.400 --> 31:49.400
And is there anything uplifting you'd like to say?

31:49.400 --> 31:50.400
Before you go?

31:50.400 --> 31:54.400
The one, here's the one, and this is a truly uplifting thing I will try to leave you with.

31:54.400 --> 31:59.400
If you do a successful tour as much of a, as soul grinding as it is, and as physically

31:59.400 --> 32:03.400
exhausting as it is, when you do a long tour and you come back to whatever your home city,

32:03.400 --> 32:10.400
especially LA, your home city seems so manageable and tamable after being out there in this

32:10.400 --> 32:12.400
gigantic, crazy country.

32:12.400 --> 32:15.400
You come back to LA and you're like, I can get anything done here.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.400
And successful is just defined by finishing it, right?

32:17.400 --> 32:20.400
Not by, not everything being, you know, successful.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.400
Oh, no, no.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.400
I mean, the, the, I, I almost wish is like when I was a wedding DJ, we had this thing

32:25.400 --> 32:28.400
where, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.400
All right.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.400
You're a wedding DJ?

32:30.400 --> 32:31.400
I spoke, no, I, when I was.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.400
Oh yeah.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.400
You were.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.400
Not now.

32:34.400 --> 32:38.400
Although there's some cards on me feeling the crap.

32:38.400 --> 32:43.400
But we had a thing where at a wedding, a successful, it was a sign of a successful marriage if

32:43.400 --> 32:45.400
one thing went wrong at the wedding.

32:45.400 --> 32:49.400
So a successful tour has got to have one night.

32:49.400 --> 32:54.400
It's like a, like a, you know, like the Judas basically one night where everything fucking

32:54.400 --> 32:56.400
goes wrong and you can then set everything else against.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.400
Yeah.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.400
That's what I figure.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.400
But it could also be eight nights.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.400
There's no reason for that.

33:02.400 --> 33:06.400
If our bad night happens two nights in, that's, that's bad.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.400
Yeah, exactly.

33:07.400 --> 33:10.400
But you look if you're, you're guaranteed one good night with Austin.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.400
I'm telling you that right now.

33:11.400 --> 33:16.400
Yeah, I've been to Austin, yeah, they seem like their hipsters are good kids because

33:16.400 --> 33:21.400
they're, they're hipsters in a state that, that, that doesn't even respect America.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.400
No, they're, I know they're, they're hipsters.

33:24.400 --> 33:29.400
The hipsters in Austin are like that compound in the road warrior of the hippies.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.400
You're like Mad Max pulling in with the gasoline.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.400
Yeah.

33:33.400 --> 33:36.400
You know, you want, you want letter Kona references?

33:36.400 --> 33:37.400
You talk to me.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.400
Like it's that kind of.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.400
All right, well, let's thank Pat and Oswald for coming by.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.400
Thank you.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.400
Thank you.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.400
Thank you.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.400
Thank you.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.400
Thank you.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.400
Thank you.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.400
Thank you.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.400
Thank you.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.400
Thank you.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.400
Thank you.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.400
Thank you.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.400
Thank you.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.400
Thank you.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.400
Thank you.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.400
Thank you.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.400
Thank you.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.400
Yeah.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.400
Oh.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.400
Oh, I want a drink so bad.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.400
Is it, is the booze calling in?

34:02.400 --> 34:03.400
Well, yeah.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.400
Bally high.

34:04.400 --> 34:14.960
That was what I wanted, I guess. He gave us real information. He didn't just say,

34:14.960 --> 34:20.520
don't take a shit in the bus. I can't remind you that enough by now.

34:20.520 --> 34:27.080
That's good advice. I'm just saying, I expected more of that. Whenever you see a gas station,

34:27.080 --> 34:32.000
make sure you buy some pants. Why? Because this is something you can't know until you're

34:32.000 --> 34:36.360
on the road. You always need pants to make your antenna worker. It's just some weird

34:36.360 --> 34:45.320
shit. But he really put the scare on me. Are you nervous now? Yeah. But you know who

34:45.320 --> 34:58.640
else was nervous? Jesus Christ. That sounds like a rap. This is rap number two called

34:58.640 --> 35:06.720
freestyle. Freestyle? Yeah, we got to work out these rap. Yo, freestyle. Yo, rapping for

35:06.720 --> 35:14.520
a while. Got a sober rap coming at your ass. I got Howard Hessmann at the head of the class.

35:14.520 --> 35:23.280
Stock rhymes coming out all the time. Freestyle. Got a sober style. Got a freestyle. Got a sober

35:23.280 --> 35:30.920
rap. It's going badly. Your mom's named Hadley. It's a name. You can look it up. I saw your

35:30.920 --> 35:39.040
mama, I got a drink. I got to have a drink. I never told you not to drink. I never told

35:39.040 --> 35:45.280
you not to drink. Are you going to do it? Be strong, dad. Be strong. It's like the price

35:45.280 --> 35:56.480
is right. And it's not fair if the people saying drink are louder because you're drunk.

35:56.480 --> 36:01.680
How many, by cheering, how many of you out there wish you wouldn't drink to continue

36:01.680 --> 36:17.120
the experiment? Okay, now how many people want to see Dan drink? That's a minority. Less

36:17.120 --> 36:23.680
people but drunker and louder. You know what else is a minority? Black people. Rap about

36:23.680 --> 36:34.720
race. Slow rap. Sexy slow. It's the first time you're hearing this. I feel the groove

36:34.720 --> 36:46.320
of her, man. Rap about race. Rap about race. Rap about the complications with the color

36:46.320 --> 36:55.120
of your face. Some people got dark skin. Some people got light. Some people purple. Some

36:55.120 --> 37:04.800
people white. But we got to come together in a big spaceship. We got to come together

37:04.800 --> 37:14.400
in a big spaceship. Rap about race. I met an Indian man in China. He said my race couldn't

37:14.400 --> 37:21.760
look finer. He took my hand and accepted me. We went up to the top of a coconut tree. He

37:21.760 --> 37:30.560
said, why don't you hold my body? I said, I'll hold your body. He said, I want you to

37:30.560 --> 37:45.880
hold me. I said, hold me. Rap about race. Rap about race. It's a rap about race. It's

37:45.880 --> 37:53.520
a rap about race. I got a black friend. He's my shield. Got a black friend. I can feel

37:53.520 --> 38:01.160
however I want when I'm standing next to my black friend. I'm not racist, but blah, blah,

38:01.160 --> 38:08.720
blah. I can say that shit because I got my black friend chilling it on the sideline.

38:08.720 --> 38:14.960
We go to get food. My black friend says, I think I'm in the mood for fried chicken and

38:14.960 --> 38:28.240
it's not racist because he's black. What? Sorry. There's a downside. I'm always terrified

38:28.240 --> 38:37.560
when he speaks up. The chicken's always right. Thank you, Enchi. That was a nice slow rap

38:37.560 --> 38:48.720
about race. Also, if by rap you mean you sang the entire thing. That was nice. I think

38:48.720 --> 38:55.560
Eric Idle's advice, now you're singing. That was like a cool Keith Sweat R&B kind of thing

38:55.560 --> 39:03.200
going on. Let's keep the fever pitch rolling. There's only one thing I knew I wanted to

39:03.200 --> 39:09.520
talk about. It starts with the fact that my beautiful, perfect girlfriend, Erin McGathy,

39:09.520 --> 39:16.800
for those of you who don't know, we always hate surprise parties. We've done them in

39:16.800 --> 39:21.160
the past. Surprise parties seem like a very strange thing to have to do to people because

39:21.160 --> 39:27.160
the fact that the party exists is the surprise. Then you spend the entire day tricking people

39:27.160 --> 39:33.360
into thinking that no one's doing anything for them. Then their surprise is, oh, you

39:33.360 --> 39:39.400
did. It just seems like it causes a lot of misery. We both agree. She's like, I'll never

39:39.400 --> 39:42.800
throw you a surprise party, but could I do this thing for you that would be a surprise

39:42.800 --> 39:49.520
at your party? Can the nature of your party be a surprise for you? Yes, of course, darling.

39:49.520 --> 39:54.240
She published a fucking book of all of my bullshit from the Internet, most of which

39:54.240 --> 40:01.560
is filled with me either talking about jerking off to other women or dating them and breaking

40:01.560 --> 40:05.680
up with them and having my heart broken. She's scouring all that stuff and picking the good

40:05.680 --> 40:15.520
stuff from the bad stuff. All of it is just me, a big narcissistic rant. There are girlfriends

40:15.520 --> 40:21.360
that would justifiably go, I don't want to reward this. He needs to come down a couple

40:21.360 --> 40:30.600
of little notches. It's like that arm wrestling thing. You just go with the force. She's celebrating

40:30.600 --> 40:36.040
my ego. For my birthday, I walked into my living room and she had gathered 60 of my

40:36.040 --> 40:41.240
finest friends and they all did selected readings of this book that I didn't know I had written

40:41.240 --> 40:46.200
until that moment. Then they all had me sign it. It was like this narcissist's dream. It

40:46.200 --> 40:47.720
was a perfect birthday party.

40:47.720 --> 40:52.160
I read through it and it's like when I saw it, I've read most of it because I've known

40:52.160 --> 40:56.680
you a long time and I've read emails or blog entries or things like that. It's really

40:56.680 --> 41:04.360
cool to go back and there's a chronology of your mania and your life.

41:04.360 --> 41:09.240
Right. Here's the weird side effect of it. People are excited about it. There's Dan

41:09.240 --> 41:15.720
Harmon fans online. There's 900 copies of this thing. She's going to sell them during

41:15.720 --> 41:22.480
a limited time. I have to try to find this. Can someone in the audience that has a phone

41:22.480 --> 41:27.760
that I'll be able to read so that I'm not trying to multitask, bring up the, if you

41:27.760 --> 41:37.040
can find it, the Onion AV Club article that is about the book. Is that enough information

41:37.040 --> 41:42.920
to find it? Whoever's got it first that can hand me their phone, bring it up and look

41:42.920 --> 41:49.160
at it. So Aaron texted me, the Onion AV Club, they posted an article about the book. It's

41:49.160 --> 41:52.400
like getting, oh, wow, that's great. That's really great news. I went to look at it just

41:52.400 --> 41:57.120
to verify that that's the case. And then why do I always do this? Scroll down to the comment

41:57.120 --> 42:08.800
section. No. No. I thought that I was impervious, but this is, it is brutal for me. But I also

42:08.800 --> 42:14.400
think like my definition of stuff that hurts is so different from other people. What ratio

42:14.400 --> 42:19.280
of like 100, I felt like it was like to being praised. That was the other thing. It felt

42:19.280 --> 42:23.120
like it was just like this unilateral fucking like who'd fuck this guy? What is he? Why does

42:23.120 --> 42:31.200
he want me to buy his book and Sean, Sean has a phone for you, Dan. Oh, all right. I mean,

42:31.200 --> 42:36.040
you could give yours to Jeff and he could maybe pick a couple tasty ones here. So, so they

42:36.040 --> 42:41.680
do, I just want to like, all right, so I'm just going down to the comment section. Yeah,

42:41.680 --> 42:51.920
I just want to stop at the ones that really, really hurt me. Can I start with one? Okay,

42:51.920 --> 42:58.200
go ahead. All proceeds will go toward getting Mr. Harmon a shower and a clean shirt. That's

42:58.200 --> 43:06.680
not, that's, that's a fan. That's, that's, that's, yeah, no, the one underneath it and

43:06.680 --> 43:11.400
an autographed self taken photo of Dan Harmon crying lamenting why you couldn't just let

43:11.400 --> 43:20.240
him be great. That hurts. Okay, I've gone through seven ones that were not so bad. Let's

43:20.240 --> 43:27.560
see. Well, you know, then there's ones that are just like, I don't give a shit about the

43:27.560 --> 43:31.680
collected online writing to Dan Harmon. That's fine. But why type that? What do you do? Do

43:31.680 --> 43:38.960
you understand how the internet works? Like, what do you, why are you on this page? But

43:38.960 --> 43:42.360
that, so that person says that and then that serves as a route for a bunch of people to

43:42.360 --> 43:45.560
chime in replying to that person, this person who doesn't give a shit about my collected

43:45.560 --> 43:50.920
online writings. This person says, don't worry, Dan Harmon cares enough about the collective

43:50.920 --> 43:56.400
works of Dan Harmon enough for all of us. By all of us, I mean, everyone who existed

43:56.400 --> 44:00.440
in the past, everyone currently alive and everyone who will ever enter this mortal coil.

44:00.440 --> 44:05.960
Oh, by the way, that, that one hurts less after he says mortal coil. It's a nice try

44:05.960 --> 44:11.000
self styled Dan Harmon. Gee, I wonder where this is coming from.

44:11.000 --> 44:16.800
Well, here's one that's all caps and it just, this one is pretty succinct. The collective

44:16.800 --> 44:25.680
online writings of Dan Harmon sucks. Yeah, that doesn't. So Dan Harmon's next project

44:25.680 --> 44:29.640
will be a delightfully quirky sitcom about a delightfully quirky group of six to eight

44:29.640 --> 44:33.480
delightfully quirky friends who hang out in acting delightfully quirky send ups of various

44:33.480 --> 44:37.720
movies and TV shows while yelling at everyone with an earshot that their vision is too beautiful

44:37.720 --> 44:44.280
and unique for this dark and savage world. So, so now our crime is wanting people to

44:44.280 --> 44:52.520
be happy. And by ours, I mean mine, but it's like, I just, let's see.

44:52.520 --> 44:59.160
While you look, Dan, I got this note. This is good stuff. There is an orange scion blocking

44:59.160 --> 45:04.640
someone that needs to move right now behind the store. The end. An orange scion. This

45:04.640 --> 45:09.680
is a cry that looks like a roller skate. I'll probably stop with this one because this one

45:09.680 --> 45:17.800
is Dan, may I share one? Jesus Christ. The ghost of Christmas presents.

45:17.800 --> 45:22.720
Adam Goldberg. I'm Jewish. I don't get Christmas presents.

45:22.720 --> 45:30.280
Did you just like materialize there? I was here for at least 50, 53 seconds.

45:30.280 --> 45:38.520
My angst floated off of me and the cloud formed into, all right, what were you going to?

45:38.520 --> 45:43.880
This is a bunch of stuff. Sue's chef shares that maybe he's morphing into Skud and Jim

45:43.880 --> 45:50.480
Traficant responds seriously. Dot, dot, dot. Those Orson Wells level bags in that drawing.

45:50.480 --> 45:54.360
Maybe he had Harmon sit for the drawing after a week long bender of shame as comedy writers

45:54.360 --> 45:57.800
are prone to. Well, it doesn't mean that they know their stuff.

45:57.800 --> 46:00.520
That's just calling me a comedy writer and saying that I'm dedicated to my work.

46:00.520 --> 46:04.440
But then someone says, that's why my best friend drew, drew baggy eyes on me. He knew

46:04.440 --> 46:09.320
that I'd be flattered by it. I like, I like, I like being a fucking slob and a maniac.

46:09.320 --> 46:15.440
What I don't like is people implying that I think that they should like me. That that's

46:15.440 --> 46:19.080
what gets me. That's the weird thing I wanted to talk about that I discovered rereading

46:19.080 --> 46:24.120
through this is like, my soft spot is, is pretense. Like, like, if you want to know

46:24.120 --> 46:29.600
how to really hurt me, it's like the idea that I think that I'm special because I don't,

46:29.600 --> 46:33.320
and I think it's because of my brother. I think it's growing up under my brother, who

46:33.320 --> 46:38.360
was, who no longer listens to the podcast, hopefully, and if he does fuck him, because

46:38.360 --> 46:41.360
he got really mad about me telling stories about him that were pretty, pretty bad.

46:41.360 --> 46:42.360
Glad to help with that, by the way. He was a dick.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.360
Oh, Jesus Christ.

46:43.360 --> 46:55.720
People were mean to you on the internet because you're not me. If you go to Harmontown.com,

46:55.720 --> 47:00.360
which you should all do at this show, it's unanimous that I am the hero. Everyone's like,

47:00.360 --> 47:08.800
I love Goldberg. He's scrappy, and Dan is mean. What the fuck is going on?

47:08.800 --> 47:12.880
He's rounded the bend in the hamburger territory. It's like, he's, he's embracing his role

47:12.880 --> 47:20.560
as a, as a, as our product spokes villain. I want Harmontown. Rubble, rubble. No, get

47:20.560 --> 47:24.720
away from there, Goldberg. No, I love it.

47:24.720 --> 47:30.800
Harmontown is for humans, silly Goldberg. It's like at a ski show, like, like, look

47:30.800 --> 47:34.240
out, Cindy. Goldberg's behind you.

47:34.240 --> 47:40.240
Well, I thought it's more like I dress up every week like Barney Rubble and try and

47:40.240 --> 47:43.720
steal the fruity pebbles of your self-respect.

47:43.720 --> 47:44.720
Yes.

47:44.720 --> 47:45.720
Precisely.

47:45.720 --> 47:48.720
That's another, yes, that's another example.

47:48.720 --> 47:49.720
All right. Adam.

47:49.720 --> 47:50.720
Adam.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.720
Adam.

47:51.720 --> 47:52.720
Adam.

47:52.720 --> 47:53.720
I'm going to wrap it up. I'm going to wrap it up.

47:53.720 --> 47:54.720
Sorry.

47:54.720 --> 47:55.720
Adam.

47:55.720 --> 47:56.720
Adam.

47:56.720 --> 47:57.720
I'm going to wrap it up.

47:57.720 --> 48:00.720
Shut the fuck up, Adam. I don't care what you're holding. I don't care what's in your

48:00.720 --> 48:05.360
hands. I fucking, I'm going to control you right now. You're either rapping or you're

48:05.360 --> 48:06.360
getting off the stage.

48:06.360 --> 48:07.360
Give me beat number one.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.360
All right.

48:08.360 --> 48:09.360
Beat number one.

48:09.360 --> 48:22.120
I'm going to wrap it up. Goldberg style. You're going to take a while. Dan, thanks

48:22.120 --> 48:26.720
for the podcast. I've had a lot of fun with the people that I just chant, rap about and

48:26.720 --> 48:27.720
I'll say this.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.800
Adam Goldberg everybody let's hear it for him. Wasn't it great?

48:29.800 --> 48:30.800
I brought you a board game.

48:30.800 --> 48:31.800
Where's the name for it?

48:31.800 --> 48:32.800
No.

48:32.800 --> 48:33.800
That's here at the bar.

48:33.800 --> 48:34.800
Guest Department Town, stay at the studio.

48:34.800 --> 48:35.800
Yeah.

48:35.800 --> 48:36.800
And I brought Eric at my party.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.800
Studio City, Marriott.

48:37.800 --> 48:38.800
Oh.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.800
I got a card for Eric. I don't think that's going to be a good fit.

48:40.800 --> 48:41.800
All right.

48:41.800 --> 48:47.280
Adam Goldberg's clothing by Bill Chang. one more time for Adam Goldberg everybody.

48:47.280 --> 48:50.280
All right.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.780
I just wanted to read.

48:51.780 --> 48:54.340
I kind of got derailed.

48:54.340 --> 48:55.180
You don't say.

48:55.180 --> 48:57.340
You don't fucking say.

48:57.340 --> 49:01.460
It's just me and Adam becoming more and more terrifying.

49:01.460 --> 49:04.340
Now I'm worried for my own safety.

49:04.340 --> 49:07.820
Yeah, it's he.

49:07.820 --> 49:09.700
The last thing I see before I die is going to be,

49:09.700 --> 49:10.420
I'm going to wake up.

49:10.420 --> 49:12.340
It's going to be him with a butcher knife.

49:12.340 --> 49:14.300
Well, you just saw how easy it was.

49:14.300 --> 49:15.300
There was a.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.980
He just was like, poof, he's there.

49:16.980 --> 49:18.420
There was an ending of a law and order

49:18.420 --> 49:21.060
where they went toe to toe with this really vicious prison

49:21.060 --> 49:24.060
gang and they put the, you know, everyone was really

49:24.060 --> 49:26.580
intimidated by them jurors and stuff like that.

49:26.580 --> 49:28.700
But they pursued the case and they won for justice.

49:28.700 --> 49:30.620
And then the epilogue of the law and order episode is

49:30.620 --> 49:33.300
they're on the streets in New York and the ADA is walking

49:33.300 --> 49:34.100
and getting a hot dog.

49:34.100 --> 49:36.500
And some guy in tattoos comes up next to her and goes,

49:36.500 --> 49:38.020
excuse me, are you so-and-so?

49:38.020 --> 49:38.660
And she goes, yeah.

49:38.660 --> 49:42.100
And he goes, you can tell your boss we were this close.

49:42.100 --> 49:43.220
And he walks away.

49:43.220 --> 49:46.380
And then he just leaves on her going, poof, poof, poof.

49:46.380 --> 49:49.100
And that's kind of, Goldberg was that close.

49:49.100 --> 49:50.940
And I didn't know.

49:50.940 --> 49:54.300
Like, like, like, there will be no warning.

49:54.300 --> 49:55.340
He'll be in your back seat.

49:55.340 --> 49:57.180
Does he have the thing like the little, little taxi

49:57.180 --> 49:59.620
driver gun thing, little, like, poof, poof, poof, poof?

49:59.620 --> 49:59.940
I don't know.

49:59.940 --> 50:02.620
I feel like he'll be more like an ex-files, like a

50:02.620 --> 50:06.700
biological weapon, like, like, turn out that he's, one of

50:06.700 --> 50:08.700
his hands is a lizard hand or something.

50:08.700 --> 50:13.700
Do you think it's time to bring up Spencer?

50:13.700 --> 50:15.700
Yes, I just wanted to read this one last thing.

50:15.700 --> 50:17.100
But now that I got all interrupted, it feels like,

50:17.100 --> 50:19.820
oh, then Dan, Dan spent this episode dwelling on

50:19.820 --> 50:20.740
comment sections.

50:20.740 --> 50:22.620
I just wanted it to be one of your things, but I wanted to

50:22.620 --> 50:25.060
close with this one.

50:25.060 --> 50:27.460
I don't know whether this one hurts or not, but it

50:27.460 --> 50:29.260
definitely affects me.

50:33.580 --> 50:35.540
Collected works, Herman Sachs, blah, blah, blah, that

50:35.540 --> 50:36.300
people are responding.

50:36.300 --> 50:39.180
And then a guy says, yeah, I've gone from loving him and

50:39.180 --> 50:42.060
community to hating him and loving community.

50:42.060 --> 50:43.060
That's really sad.

50:43.060 --> 50:44.540
All right.

50:44.540 --> 50:44.980
I don't know why.

50:44.980 --> 50:45.860
Now I read that out loud.

50:45.860 --> 50:47.620
It seems like that's what I wanted.

50:47.620 --> 50:49.580
And, well, you got it.

50:49.580 --> 50:51.460
Yeah.

50:51.460 --> 50:52.500
It's not really what I wanted.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.780
I wanted to explore it because you guys are my therapist.

50:54.780 --> 50:55.180
That's all.

50:55.180 --> 50:56.900
I just wanted to say it out loud.

50:56.900 --> 50:59.260
And it kind of hit me in the solar plexus, like reading

50:59.260 --> 51:01.380
those comments, and I was texting Aaron about it.

51:01.380 --> 51:03.100
And I was like, what the fuck is going on?

51:03.100 --> 51:05.180
Why am I so affected by this?

51:05.180 --> 51:09.540
I'm so shielded in places where everybody usually kicks.

51:09.540 --> 51:12.420
And then this weird shit gets me.

51:12.420 --> 51:14.740
And it has something to do with, I think I had an

51:14.740 --> 51:16.420
epiphany in my car sorting through it.

51:16.420 --> 51:18.860
It has something to do with needing other people's

51:18.860 --> 51:20.660
approval, which is a didoi.

51:20.660 --> 51:24.300
But I'm 40 years old.

51:24.300 --> 51:31.340
I am allowed to now become a dispenser of happiness.

51:31.340 --> 51:36.220
I can't expect to get it fed to me like a baby bird anymore.

51:36.220 --> 51:39.300
Emotionally, you have to grow up a little bit.

51:39.300 --> 51:41.500
I can still be insecure and express my anxieties and

51:41.500 --> 51:41.700
stuff.

51:41.700 --> 51:44.660
But there is, you know, the people that write that shit,

51:44.660 --> 51:47.420
they don't expect my dumb fat ass to be like scrolling

51:47.420 --> 51:50.660
through it, and they go, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.

51:50.660 --> 51:52.940
They wouldn't really want to have an impact on a human being.

51:52.940 --> 51:56.420
They're just screaming at the sky, notice me.

51:56.420 --> 51:59.380
No one in particular.

51:59.380 --> 52:00.300
They're talking to themselves.

52:00.300 --> 52:00.860
I disagree.

52:00.860 --> 52:02.220
I think they actually do think.

52:02.220 --> 52:03.140
I think not all of us.

52:03.140 --> 52:04.180
Adam always does this shit.

52:04.180 --> 52:05.100
He hands you shit.

52:05.100 --> 52:07.660
And then he's a plate of cookies last night.

52:07.660 --> 52:08.380
It's a gift, too.

52:08.380 --> 52:09.260
Give me a board game.

52:09.260 --> 52:10.540
I put a hazmat suit on.

52:10.540 --> 52:12.540
That's anthrax all the way.

52:12.540 --> 52:14.140
Who's was this?

52:14.140 --> 52:14.700
Over here.

52:14.700 --> 52:15.820
This is Sean's, right?

52:15.820 --> 52:16.820
Thank you, Sean.

52:16.820 --> 52:20.740
Oh, Sean, his own built-in reminder.

52:20.740 --> 52:22.420
I had written it down, but I might have forgotten.

52:22.420 --> 52:24.940
Sean, thank you for your wonderful birthday gift.

52:24.940 --> 52:26.540
I'm assuming it was our New Year's gift.

52:26.540 --> 52:29.180
Maybe a Christmas gift.

52:29.180 --> 52:31.340
The podcast got pretty boring.

52:31.340 --> 52:34.540
When Dan started counting the number of ways something

52:34.540 --> 52:37.780
could be a gift, that's when I checked out,

52:37.780 --> 52:40.580
said the 380th person crammed in the back corner.

52:40.580 --> 52:45.180
I'd say it's time to kick the show into overdrive.

52:45.180 --> 52:46.980
You have other thoughts, apparently.

52:46.980 --> 52:47.460
No, no, no.

52:47.460 --> 52:48.460
You mean Spencer Drive?

52:48.460 --> 52:48.980
Yeah, Spencer Drive.

52:48.980 --> 52:50.180
Yeah, let's do it.

52:50.180 --> 52:51.580
Anybody know a guy named Spencer?

52:51.580 --> 52:52.620
He's our Dungeon Master.

53:00.620 --> 53:03.660
Spencer, you have a new musical theme.

53:03.660 --> 53:05.660
Is that what this is?

53:05.660 --> 53:09.260
This is the new Spencer theme.

53:09.260 --> 53:12.100
We have our own legally clearable Spencer theme.

53:12.100 --> 53:15.660
This is called Spencer Intro.

53:15.660 --> 53:17.420
All right, Spencer is our Dungeon Master.

53:17.420 --> 53:19.380
Those of you just tuning in, we love and adore him.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.060
We found him out of our own audience.

53:21.060 --> 53:24.780
And Spencer is going to take off.

53:24.780 --> 53:26.220
Actually, it occurs to me, Spencer.

53:26.220 --> 53:27.140
I know nothing about you.

53:27.140 --> 53:28.740
Are you going to leave a job behind

53:28.740 --> 53:30.300
while you come on tour with us?

53:30.300 --> 53:33.180
Yeah, I work at an Apple store near my house.

53:33.180 --> 53:34.500
And I work in the back.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.580
I count boxes.

53:36.580 --> 53:39.460
It's fun.

53:39.460 --> 53:41.460
So you got a furlough.

53:41.460 --> 53:43.580
You get to come on leave with Harmontown.

53:43.580 --> 53:45.660
And he's going to be on the tour bus with us,

53:45.660 --> 53:49.820
Dungeon Mastering, every dungeon that we try to enter.

53:54.700 --> 53:57.820
Did any of that Pat Northwalt horror stories in Phoenix?

53:57.820 --> 53:58.820
Were you at all, Spencer?

53:58.820 --> 54:00.180
Do you feel like?

54:00.180 --> 54:03.740
I don't want to die in a jackknife.

54:03.740 --> 54:04.900
Yeah, that's always my thing.

54:09.900 --> 54:10.980
Big tour bus accident.

54:10.980 --> 54:12.300
That's pretty ignominious.

54:12.300 --> 54:13.660
It's no good.

54:13.660 --> 54:15.620
All right.

54:15.620 --> 54:16.700
I leveled up, you guys.

54:16.700 --> 54:18.020
I got new gadgets and stuff.

54:18.020 --> 54:18.820
Bear with me.

54:18.820 --> 54:19.540
Oh, you go.

54:19.540 --> 54:20.820
All right, Dungeon Master leveled up.

54:20.820 --> 54:21.940
So you got a new iPad.

54:21.940 --> 54:26.260
Did you find that in the back room of the store, especially?

54:26.260 --> 54:29.580
Yeah, I mean, we just sometimes we count less.

54:35.780 --> 54:37.940
Did you guys write that?

54:37.940 --> 54:40.180
Oh, yeah, Spencer and I hang out all the time.

54:40.180 --> 54:42.380
We were riding bikes the other day.

54:42.380 --> 54:45.300
So Spencer, I hear something funny

54:45.300 --> 54:47.820
happening to Trader Joe's yesterday.

54:47.820 --> 54:48.580
Oh, yeah.

54:48.580 --> 54:52.340
You know me and traders.

54:52.340 --> 54:53.140
That wouldn't work.

54:53.140 --> 54:54.620
We've got to work on that one.

54:54.620 --> 54:56.140
The workshop on that one.

54:56.140 --> 54:59.300
Speaking of workshops, we should bring up an improviser

54:59.300 --> 55:00.980
to help us play Dungeon Dragons.

55:00.980 --> 55:03.660
We decided that the cavalcade of stars

55:03.660 --> 55:04.780
wasn't quite complete yet.

55:04.780 --> 55:06.980
We're going to bring up somebody who's never played D&D before.

55:06.980 --> 55:08.060
He's going to fill in.

55:08.060 --> 55:11.340
And maybe in some guest star role that Spencer has created,

55:11.340 --> 55:14.460
this person knows nothing of D&D, has never, ever played it.

55:14.460 --> 55:39.260
But maybe you know him, television's Ryan Stiles.

55:39.260 --> 55:41.220
I have to sit down because I've had so much

55:41.220 --> 55:44.500
of this sweet, sweet liquor tea.

55:44.500 --> 55:45.300
I think it's very nice.

55:45.300 --> 55:47.140
You quit drinking because of your girlfriend?

55:47.140 --> 55:48.860
Well, no, I've quit, yeah.

55:48.860 --> 55:50.460
So sweet.

55:50.460 --> 55:53.860
I give it a month.

55:53.860 --> 55:56.180
It's very odd that you stopped drinking because of her,

55:56.180 --> 55:58.020
and yet I'm backstage doing lines off her tits.

55:58.020 --> 56:00.020
Oh, my God.

56:00.020 --> 56:02.660
That's so weird.

56:02.660 --> 56:03.780
It's better you don't know.

56:03.780 --> 56:06.220
I think they were her tits.

56:06.220 --> 56:06.940
Hi, how are you?

56:06.940 --> 56:08.060
You think they were her tits?

56:08.060 --> 56:17.820
Are you, uh, are you, uh, I hope so.

56:17.820 --> 56:18.380
Go on, Ryan.

56:18.380 --> 56:21.060
Otherwise, they're two perfectly four moles together.

56:21.060 --> 56:21.540
I'm good.

56:21.540 --> 56:23.740
Are you going on tour with Jeff?

56:23.740 --> 56:25.060
Have you toured with Jeff before?

56:25.060 --> 56:25.540
No.

56:25.540 --> 56:27.420
See, I've toured with Jeff for a number of years.

56:27.420 --> 56:28.580
Oh, do you have any?

56:28.580 --> 56:29.940
Are you on a bus?

56:29.940 --> 56:30.420
Yes.

56:30.420 --> 56:34.060
You're in for two or three hours a day of retarded Elvis.

56:34.060 --> 56:36.260
Jeff, do a little retarded Elvis.

56:36.260 --> 56:37.980
I have a couple of stock characters.

56:37.980 --> 56:39.980
Do a little retarded Elvis for us today too.

56:39.980 --> 56:41.980
I don't know, so.

56:41.980 --> 56:46.140
It's just a retarded.

56:46.140 --> 56:46.620
No more.

56:46.620 --> 56:47.460
Do more, though.

56:47.460 --> 56:48.700
Do more of it.

56:48.700 --> 56:53.460
I don't want to be a retarded man.

56:53.460 --> 56:54.660
Three hours.

56:54.660 --> 56:55.160
It's off.

56:55.160 --> 56:57.420
Three hours.

56:57.420 --> 56:58.980
Dan, the thing is, if it's.

56:58.980 --> 57:00.700
And I mean, I'm in a bunk in the bed.

57:00.700 --> 57:02.940
He'll open the curtains and start doing that.

57:02.940 --> 57:04.180
I don't know, so.

57:04.180 --> 57:05.580
Yes, Jeff, I'm lonesome tonight.

57:05.580 --> 57:06.580
Yes.

57:06.580 --> 57:07.080
Thank you.

57:07.080 --> 57:12.080
Retired Elvis isn't funny for the first hour. No. No, you have to keep a second hour great

57:12.080 --> 57:16.480
Yeah, yeah third hour that goes into a bit of a trough. Yeah, but it's gonna be fun for you

57:17.400 --> 57:19.400
Your girlfriend staying here. She's going with you

57:20.280 --> 57:26.040
She's coming with she is so you're not drinking the entire tour then. Oh, I thought you were asking cuz you want to do more co-coffer

57:26.040 --> 57:28.040
No, no, no

57:28.200 --> 57:33.620
No, no, she's not she's not sober. We're just cleansing for four days. We're gonna we're gonna what was the green stuff

57:33.620 --> 57:39.280
You're drinking back state. It was kale cellary spinach cast this is a vodka and cranberry

57:42.400 --> 57:44.400
Is there a cup back there anybody

57:44.760 --> 57:50.360
More kale for Dan, please. No, no, no kale. No, you just flung a craving on me. I'm gonna have some vodka, too

57:50.360 --> 58:04.140
Okay, ask for vodka as retarded Elvis, please, which is four hours

58:04.140 --> 58:10.180
Think about think about tour. I should ask Patton this the thing about tour bus comedy is that after a while

58:10.180 --> 58:16.140
But the level of comedy goes just lower and lower and lower and then it becomes almost a challenge

58:16.140 --> 58:22.140
Who can do the bassist comedy? Who can be the most adolescent like it's it's like a game of chicken with

58:22.620 --> 58:26.380
I'm doing two and a half men with Patton this week. Oh, yeah, not very funny

58:27.940 --> 58:30.820
Surprising is he he stole the she's gone. That's why I said that yeah

58:31.340 --> 58:34.820
What's this character? I was gonna I was gonna if he didn't leave I have it on my iPhone

58:34.820 --> 58:40.060
I have the script. I was gonna get us get us. Oh, yeah, they're doing two and a half men together and yeah

58:40.060 --> 58:47.580
We're not together. I'm never aware anybody else is there really. Oh, really? We were gonna do a run since Charlie

58:47.580 --> 58:49.580
You know, it's not

58:50.100 --> 58:52.100
Is it funny now with Aston?

58:52.100 --> 59:11.060
I have this much to drink you're having so much fun. There goes my medical

59:11.740 --> 59:16.940
So I have to leave at some point right in the middle of our tour like the like the letters

59:16.940 --> 59:21.980
That's like two-thirds of the tour. I leave Harmontown to go do shows with you and Greg

59:22.180 --> 59:23.820
Yeah, it's a little scary to have Jeff on the road

59:23.820 --> 59:28.820
We're in some small town in Canada and I think it was a bikini Bronco riding that night

59:28.820 --> 59:33.540
It was bikini. Yeah bikini bull riding and he walked in in a suit in it was Kamloops

59:33.940 --> 59:38.660
Yeah, Columbia, and it was it was a there's a marquee out in front of a place called cactus jacks

59:38.660 --> 59:44.300
And it boasted of Jeff always thinks he's an LA bikini bull riding and I walked in I said

59:44.300 --> 59:47.940
I'm gonna go in there and some of that was that lived there was like no you don't want to go to cactus jacks

59:47.940 --> 59:50.140
It's pretty it's pretty you're wearing the only suit in town

59:50.140 --> 59:53.980
So I came in and I walked in in a suit and there was it was a bar that had a metal detector

59:53.980 --> 59:59.420
And there was a bin like you like the little trays that you get at the airport and they in in the tray were shives

59:59.420 --> 01:00:04.300
There were screwdrivers and homemade knives like some people have a weekend leave

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:10.660
But the beauty was like well, we'll take your sharpened screwdriver and we'll give it with you know duct tape for the handle

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:15.180
And we'll leave it here. You get it when you get out when you when you leave you can get your your your shift back

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.780
How long have you been dating this girl?

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:23.940
A year really it's new right on the nugget. It's still exciting. Our first kiss was Christmas Day. Oh

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.460
Jesus's birthday you had you that's great

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.460
So it's still exciting and everything how old is she and how old are you? I'm just curious

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:41.100
She's she just turned 28, and I just turned 40. Wow, that's interesting

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.580
You're 40 now really you 40 to look yeah, you still look at your penis in the mirror

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:55.100
I don't I stopped doing that at some point. It's like my high school yearbook. I know I have one

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.100
I just never ever look at it

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:03.860
I look at my body naked all the time you really yeah, but my penis is like it's just like another nipple down there

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:09.540
It's it's a it's a it's a some people are girls and some people are showers. I'm a retractor

He's right don't boo him. Yeah

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.420
He knows what I'm talking about Ryan you might you might be beloved outside of Nerdmell

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.940
But in here Spencer is kind of a kind of a golden God

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.940
I don't care

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.300
All right Spencer if you would

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.180
How does this work? I have no idea

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.100
Spencer right now will give you a little intro and to bring us

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:01.540
Dan and I it's important. I know about this game. Am I gonna fuck this up or do I need to know?

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:07.060
Specific have you ever done bad improv before? Yeah, it's just like that. It's just like that. It's all I do

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.060
All right, I work a few carry

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:16.580
No way to avoid it. Is he here fuck off. He's not here

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:22.640
Hey, Ryan remember when I went drew used to be two and a half men. Yes, I do

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:34.520
When we last met our heroes had just defeated Lord Buttsalot who attacked the adventurers in a fit of rage

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:39.240
After Lord mango had fallen his barbarian tribesmen came out of hiding

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:45.080
They thanked Sharpie for quelling Lord Buttsalot's wrath then woke up the barbaric pattern familius

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.120
Mango came to in a confused days first ornery and eager to fight mango's his dad

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.560
But then more understanding and apologetic of his prior behavior

01:02:54.200 --> 01:03:01.280
Revealing his true intentions the war chief explained the powerful effects of the magical fragments of power in their role in the formation of the multiverse

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:10.600
In a fit of madness the great Lord snatched up his redstone and swallowed it in one single confusing goal

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:19.320
This odd gesture can't help but remind you of Admiral Darkstar that black garb dockward fellow from the ziggurat that evil

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.840
Malevolence who swore to steal and destroy your planet with the power of the fragments

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:30.720
Just then the party heard the unmistakable sound of an approaching horse-drawn cavern

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.840
All right, I need my character sheet. Yeah, yeah dispense the character sheets if you will shit. I'm sorry. I thought we were starting

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.080
I wasted that horse

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.600
Tonight the role of the horse will be played by Ryan Styles

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.260
I was a three-legged horse by the way, I don't know if you

01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.760
Dan did you get mine? Yes. Yeah, just sorting them out. I don't mix them up

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.720
Is it right? My name is quark, and he's Sharpie

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:10.080
All right, he's a human magic user. I'm an I'm a gnome barbarian. Notice you guys get papers

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.080
You have this one here

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:27.080
Oh fuck this is an improv I've had this thing for four months. I have no idea what's a fantasy football here or something. I

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:34.040
Always kind of stare at it that I never like the information never makes it all the way into my brain

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.080
There's other things going on. All right, so Spencer. What are our surroundings right now?

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:44.120
You're in the wreckage of that Noel camp that where you fought Lord Barber or Lord Buttsalot

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.040
And is he still?

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.040
Lord Buttsalot's still with you. He's still with the barbarians. You guys were just having a nice chat

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.280
He he ate one of those things and you guys are like what all right, so so he's got one

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.360
He ate one of the fragments. Yeah

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.360
And what was the advice what what what the other the we had some people from the audience help us out

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:09.160
That there was advice about that one fragment that he'd eaten right somebody said cast a tech magic and then

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:14.720
We we we do this every week. Yeah, and it carries on it's like a yeah. Yeah. Oh

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:22.280
We are we kill the giant piggy bank a cube of jello a cube of jello. Yeah, I should get cable

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:31.160
We detected some shards in his stomach and then that was a big so we have some of the shards right you have two shards

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:37.520
Yes, and my dad ate one and walked away. Uh-huh, and now you're hearing an unapproaching wagon. All right

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.520
So I look at what the wagon is

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.200
You look to the although I have my guesses I think it's a wagon

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.560
You're not sure why a caravan would come here of all places the ruins of a newly destroyed Noel encampment

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.260
You hear the gruff gravelly voice from inside a cart call out

01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:04.380
Welcome to all who off's wonder wagon the cart screeches to a halt about 15 feet away from you

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:12.580
And it's wooden panels collapse outwards revealing an equally questionable decorated storefront

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:22.420
You see food crafts supplies materials leather goods cure tools clothing weapons jewels in all manner of assorted knickknacks and curios

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.300
And before you stands

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:30.420
Presumably Olaf a halfling with a large turban and an orange mustache

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.740
That's you. Oh

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:37.260
All right, so you're playing a shopkeeper. Here's your thing

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:41.260
I wrote a list of things you sell on the back, but you can also sell other things. Oh

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:50.660
Oh good day to you, sir good day

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.020
Tell me what you seek I have a long list

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.740
Well, we are adventurers and we are

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:11.500
Our satchels are filled with treasures and gold. Oh, then you need nothing for me. You're such as a fool

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.980
Do you have any cigarettes cigarettes? Let me check

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.620
No, but I do have a healing pendant and a portable hole

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:30.420
Yes, yes, the portable hole is $40 same as downtown

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.900
I'm kind of at a loss. I don't really I'm not really in a shopping mood, but

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:52.340
Especially is there anything in our inventory that we lack that this that this shopkeeper might give us well

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:54.340
That depends on what you want, you know

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.700
If you have anything weird you could ask them about it you could ask questions

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.660
What do you give the gnome barbarian that has everything?

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.620
Might I say that bowl strength is on sale this week?

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:12.220
How much is the ball strength three for 49

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:20.140
I can get two for 50 downtown. Oh, that's bull. I'm selling bull strength

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:30.060
What does that oh, I do have smoked sticks did you come seeking cigarettes? I love cigarettes. I have smoked sticks

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.060
I think they're similar

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:34.860
Do you have menthol?

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:38.660
I don't but I could give you some ice

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.540
It's suck on some ice and then have a

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:50.860
Special what are smoke sticks do smoke sticks release an acrid smoke that creates a smoke screen for a short period of time obscuring vision

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.420
cigarettes

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.860
Yet you may not take them to the land of Calabasas

01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:08.660
I'll take a carton of smoke stick a carton of smoke sticks for you and with that I throw in a free allusion a

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:13.060
Free allusion a free allusion. What does that mean? I won't know until it happens

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:20.420
Tell me what you see. It's not like dub from lit candle. Is it one of those kind of crappy things you've been here before

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.900
Wait that was your portable home

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.900
I

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:41.780
Want to show Olaf the the shards if you know what I mean

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:48.500
And see if he's he's heard any tell of their origins or any rumors about them

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.820
Take a look at these magic shards Olaf

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.820
Oh the magic shards

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:59.980
You bring this to me. Yes. Well, I'm not giving him to you. I'm showing him to you. What are they shards of?

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:07.500
Something some force of power. I don't really know what are the shards of Spencer the shards

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:12.740
Olaf doesn't know much about the shards, but he knows their value is beyond compare

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:18.700
He would offer to buy them although he knows there's no price that you'd willingly take for such a valuable artifact

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:22.140
I will buy those for me

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.940
Name your price I

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.900
Don't think I don't think there's any price for which we'd part with them

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.500
But there has to be a reason that this this man has come across our path

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:36.860
I believe that everything is fated to be sharpie Jesus. All right, I mean

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:45.020
All right, well, I mean I I mean come up with a price you're gonna get caught with a shitload of shards that you can't get rid of

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.020
I

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:53.820
Spencer how many shards do we need to have a full set? You don't know there's no way of knowing we have two and Sharpie's dad

01:10:54.100 --> 01:11:00.140
Mango as one in his stomach right now. Yeah, and a few I think can we can we follow a mango around until he poops and go through

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.540
It and find one of them. You could potentially do that. He's standing in the foreground. Oh

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.620
Hi, you're going to need a portable hole for that

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:19.980
What's the portable hole portable holes are these these fabric circles so like if you took this and cut it into a circle like a

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.860
Circle of fabric you throw it on the ground and it becomes a real hole like a 10-foot pit or something

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.220
So you could hide in yeah, and then you could pick it up

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.740
So you could you know drop your friend down there and pick it up and take him and put him in a wall

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:34.540
I'm like fall and how tall is Olaf Olaf would be about four four feet tall

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:39.900
I thought Olaf was big Olaf is a halfling halflings are very small. Oh, so two halflings is worth

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:45.220
Depends on where you're an exchange rate two minutes two men and a halfling

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:54.380
How much for the portable hole it says it really it's 50 the 50 go what gold pieces what is it the $40 same as downtown

01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:59.700
Yet I will take one shard of glass for your whole portable hole. I don't I want to give I don't know

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:04.140
Yeah, we got with the shards we got to hang on to the shards man. What are so important about these shards?

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.660
We don't know

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:12.740
And yet you want to hang on to them. Yes. Yeah, I mean why do you want them so bad? I haven't any in my wagon

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:19.220
What if someone else would ask me for a shard and I had no shards and yet I have an overstock of portable holes

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:28.420
Should we take this guy Olaf he has this great inventory of such we take him along with us down the road in case we need something or

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:33.220
Is there something Spencer that we need to get off of Olaf here? Well, I mean I can't tell you

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:36.420
I'm just like a disembodied voice that describes things around you

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.260
However, I like a wife

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:50.420
I wish I wish I will say that you hear an off off kilter sound it seems like it's coming from the west

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:55.700
It sounds like vicious clacking or maybe slithering. You don't even know what I summon a squirrel

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.100
You summon a squirrel

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:05.340
Squirrel run off and investigate that sound all right. I get to have someone small animals once a day

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.460
There's only one way to summon a squirrel and you know the song Jeff

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.300
The squirrel song squirrel squirrel squirrel

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:22.940
Climbing trees spreading disease squirrel squirrel squirrel

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:27.820
hide nuts fuzzy butts

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.060
Right and I've been in the road a long time

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:36.060
You're gonna get that

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.420
Do I smell gravy over there?

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:43.060
Olaf do I smell gravy? Of course you do. That's from the gravy pillow

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:55.220
It's an invention of mine. Isn't there a song about that? It's soft. I don't believe so

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.220
Gravy

01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.220
No, I forget it

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.220
I

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:04.180
Well, we heard this sound from the west so let's wait. Oh, yeah

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:10.180
I sent the squirrel off to go investigate the other sound you send the squirrel off you wait for what seems like enough time

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.180
But the squirrel

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:17.980
But the squirrel doesn't return the squirrel does not return it does not return. Where's my dad? Is he still visible?

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.980
He's yeah, he said hey guys

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:27.060
I'm gonna go talk to my dad. Hey, hey son. It's that does that guy have good deals dad

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.740
Each shards much. Yeah

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:39.980
I don't understand like talk to me about that listen alarming you need to internalize the power before you can have mastery

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.340
Overhead that's just you know gravity

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:49.540
Sharpie barbarians aren't well-knowledged. Should we each eat a shark?

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.620
Sounds like we eat half a one now and if we if we're feeling it

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:02.500
You're supposed to wait like 45 minutes. Well, yeah, I have some orange juice. Yeah, there's all I've ever just I

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:08.940
I can't I was I was in a blackout drunk when we played and it was a month ago

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:15.300
But but did I did I did I think that eating a shard was a good idea? No, I don't think you did okay?

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:20.660
All right. Yeah, cuz my cuz my cuz my dad just doesn't understand magic. No, he's yeah

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:25.180
He's like look barbarians don't know stuff like like father like son. I would say maybe you eat it

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:31.500
Are you saying it's a bad idea? It's something a dumb person does with a shard. It's a it's a it's it's bush leak

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.860
So I gotta say I feel like I really wasted that squirrel you did

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.860
The squirrel will come back Jeff

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:50.820
Well, okay, I'm gonna summon my right. I'm at summoning him. He's on my arm Avenger my hawk who I forgot for several months

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:55.940
Avenger gives out a weak cry as if it hasn't been fed in several months

01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.140
Avenger go get the squirrel

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.740
Avenger flies off your arm and circles the sky far away

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.580
It returns

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:14.540
Avenger what see you it gives you a look that says I didn't see a squirrel, but there's something coming

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.420
Go on

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:25.420
I'd be able to under describe it better if I weren't just a level three familiar. Hmm. I'm not smart

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.220
Don't sell yourself sure let me tell you something

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:38.700
It seemed to shift and change position as it approached as if I couldn't quite make out where it was well see that's important information

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:40.980
You're you're a good hawk, you know

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:47.900
I got a feeling that you already bought the portable hole, right? I know cuz he's only selling it for a shard

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:51.380
It's a I want I won't give up one shard for the whole he's teeth

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.220
He said it was 40 bucks, and then he said it was a shard

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:59.100
It's not giving up a shard for a hole. I'll get I'll give you three gold pieces for a portable hole

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.380
All right

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:06.700
Alright, so I got smoke sticks in a portable hole now in my inventory. Let's buy two of them and put one in the other

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.700
I'm not selling to

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:11.480
You don't be all Dan Harmon about it

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.260
The portable hole about six quirky character Olaf

Asked my dad what what's what's happening to the West he motions a figure towards you and then puts his ear to the ground

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:12.580
Then was soon he raises his head from the ground and growls something you haven't heard in quite a while

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.140
Displacer beasts

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.220

Displacer beasts those fearsome creatures you see you can't determine where they truly are only where you think they may be

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:37.100
For their shifting appearance can move them around almost randomly as if by some powerful illusion

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:48.980
Let's get the fuck out of here. Yeah, let's hold off. How would you like the head east in your wagon?

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.920
Put on the chain shirt and the Elf boots and take out my emerald dagger. You do those things

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:16.920
As it was written so it shall be in the middle of a fight. It's like a Katy Perry concert. Oh

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.280

First time I've used it

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:54.600
Waving your hands in a magical manner you lose several bolts of scorching rays

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.160
You oh shit you guys I'm terrible

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.160
You strike the displacer beast right in the face with a scorching ray

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
It deals

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:11.920
12 fire damage

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.920
He's on the ropes

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.920
Mysterious emerald dagger

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.720
Plunging the mysterious emerald dagger into the hearts of the displacer beast it glows with a green bright light

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:33.960
You see it shatter into pieces and next to it the real displacer beast emerges. Oh, it can no longer use its ability

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.480
Yeah, this child

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000

You mean my plus nine attack bonus is that what that means? That's yeah, that's your attack roll

So I have eight more shots. No, okay, you just have infinite. Yeah, what you have ammo

My shoot gun my mistake. Okay. Yeah, do you want to shoot it against multiple enemies?

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:17.440
I'm so confused sometimes. I just want to get the fuck out of my wagon. This is not my problem. These guys came up to me

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.880
I got my shard, that's all I wanted

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:29.800
I don't know what the fuck I want to do. I'm so confused. There's so many numbers and you can't count

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:39.480
You should shoot gun I guess multiple enemies, okay, I'm using my shoot gun shoot gun shoot gun

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:52.280
The the shotgun blast fires through one of the displacer beast, but it was really somewhere else

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.560
It strikes into the deactivated displacer beast dealing

01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:01.200
Seven damage the displacer beast falls slain

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.920
Are we done

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.760

Portable hole and then trap it in the hole can we yet you could try that who's got the portable hole

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:25.560
But it's only four feet deep isn't it? That's no it's like ten. No you you said no

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.880
I said you're it's ten feet. How tall are the beast?

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:31.600
They're probably about three foot at the shoulder that comes in handy doesn't it?

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:37.040
So I'm taller than this beast by about a foot. You're not as long as it though. It's a three-foot beast

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.720
Lion take your head off man

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:54.840
The panther would speak with animals work with a what the displacer beast you could try I speak to the displacer beast

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:57.640
What do you think it's gonna say?

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Watch this

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:05.980
Hey, you're kind of being a dick

You killed my parents just now

01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:17.220
It flails at you with a tentacle, but misses

You summon a swarm of bees a swarm of bees now exists

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:46.500
Swarm all right you swarm the final displacer beast

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:51.900
It seems to be annoyed and stung, but it doesn't seem to be taking very much damage

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:57.020
It is rather distracted and bothered it seems to no longer a guard you over the pain of its stings. I

01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:02.540
Loose in the mail lid somebody pop it open

01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:13.380
I throw knives you throw knives how many oh just one you throw just one knife right

01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.140
You strike the displacer beast

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:21.340
It teleports away

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.540
You don't

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:31.940
You can still speak with animals though. Oh, look, I'm sorry about that you're being a dick thing and I'm sorry about your parents

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.500
What are we

01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:38.500
Well, why don't we smoke some of these?

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:45.860
Smoke smoke sticks and I throw some smoke sticks around it. It regards the smoke sticks

01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:54.100
They emit a plume of smoke around the displacer beast you can no longer see it

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:01.460
Way to go Jeff

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:11.580
It's like going up to Osama bin Laden just putting body armor on them

01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:18.660
Can we get the fellowship of the nerds back up here to help without I have invisibility and visibility yes

01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:21.380
Okay, how does that help?

01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:23.620
You could not get attacked

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:26.220
See ya

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:38.220
What is weapon focus sword? It means you're slightly better than the average person with a sword

01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:42.980
But I've already used my sword haven't I well you can use it more. Oh, it doesn't get used up. Is it my turn?

Sorry you guys I can't do math. I'm terrible at everything. You're just true. Thank you

He doesn't appear slain, but now he is

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:31.300
You broke the tension too early just to make sure I throw my climbing kit

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:35.580
Into the air like a graduate

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.740
Titans and ropes spill everywhere

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.540
We freeze-frame

01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:45.900
Credit roll on this segment

Is a circle of fabric about three to four? I already explained what a portable?

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.820
Can't just be thrown on people and taking shit out of

01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:07.660
Dad you got to trust me these shards need to be

01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:14.260
Delt with with with with care under magical supervision. You are a man of barbarism. I am a man of magic

01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:18.940
I know you never approved of it, but but maybe it was fate that I would come back into your life now

01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:20.940
And you've encountered these things like you you know

01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:23.940
Just give me your shard when you poop it out

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.260
Summon squirrels

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:30.680
Olaf summons a horde of squirrels. I

01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:34.820
Just saw that

01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:43.660
As a gnome, you're very jealous of his ability to summon multiple squirrels once so now we're surrounded by squirrels. Yeah

01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.540
Squirrel

01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:50.900
You'll be a woman

01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:55.940
We have to come up with a way to conclude this chapter here

01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:59.060
I feel like we have to get the shard out of your father's stomach, right?

01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:05.020
Just then you hear an intense humming sound. It sounds like it's coming from above above

01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:09.820
It gets louder and louder and then be it's pierced by a deafening cracking crescendo

01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:17.780
You look up and see a huge rift opening in the morning sky a red scar and the otherwise blue expanse and black shapes

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:19.660
Begin flooding out of it

01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:26.140
These dark metallic sleek ships float on air as easily as if it were see and sail forward without need for sales

01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:31.620
The humming subsides, but you can hear a distinct popping sound black cylinders rain down from the ships

01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:35.740
Plumbing to earth with heavy crashes and thuds the fleet of ships sail swiftly away

01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:39.940
Mango's face grows serious. You can hear a far-off voice saying

01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:47.820
That's Admiral Darkstar

01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:51.540
Admiral Darkstar voice anyway. Yeah, wait, I

01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:58.100
I I hit rewind so I can hear that voice again say that pick something else for me to say that wasn't very clever

01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:00.980
I yeah, I summon better catchphrase

01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:06.740
Soon the Darkstar will dawn and all will be led to ruination

01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:11.300
All right. All right. That's a good that's a good cliffhanger

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:19.900
Wow, wait, all right, let's hear for Spencer everybody our Dungeon Master

Yeah, we've used a lot of stuff off your cart. You used your shoot gun

01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:53.460
I didn't even see half that stuff told you know halfway through. I've I've had this these character sheets for months

01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:58.620
I've never really looked at him. I have no idea or ask me anything about any part of the game ever

01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:04.620
So

01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:06.620

Ryan do you have any advice for us before we embark on this journey?

01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:02.740
