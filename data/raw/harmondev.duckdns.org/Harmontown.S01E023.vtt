01:13.760\nJust give me a second.\n\n01:13.760 --> 01:16.680\nAlright, Dan, Dan, that really wasn't fair to you.\n\n01:16.680 --> 01:17.680\nGive me a second.\n\n01:17.680 --> 01:18.680\nFirst of all,

wasn't really fair because that was, I was just trying out our new theme song\n\n01:30.720 --> 01:31.720\nfor the tour.\n\n01:31.720 --> 01:32.720\nAlright.\n\n01:32.720 --> 01:37.000\nThat's our new, we're doing all unlicensed music, it's all our own music.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:38.000\nYeah.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.240\nYeah, so do you want to start off with a proper rap beat?\n\n01:40.240 --> 01:48.080\nBecause I have a selection of three unlicensed, totally our own rap beats, and I feel that\n\n01:48.080 --> 01:53.800\nit's only fair for the audience to know that this is the first Harmontown where you are\n\n01:53.800 --> 01:54.800\nnot drinking.\n\n01:54.800 --> 01:55.800\nThat's true too.\n\n01:55.800 --> 01:56.800\nYou can probably already tell.\n\n01:56.800 --> 01:57.800\nYeah.\n\n01:57.800 --> 02:00.800\nListen, if it goes poorly, I will clear this theater.\n\n02:00.800 --> 02:07.080\nIf it goes poorly, I'll bail, but I'm this cleansed with Erin.\n\n02:07.080 --> 02:11.520\nShe's my girlfriend, I love her, I do things out of support for her, and also if she's\n\n02:11.520 --> 02:17.360\nnot eating, I won't be fed anyway, so she's doing this four-day cleanse where we drink\n\n02:17.360 --> 02:23.680\nthese green, gooey things and you don't drink liquor on them.\n\n02:23.680 --> 02:28.240\nIf the show starts going poorly, I promise I'll just collapse into the bottle, but I\n\n02:28.240 --> 02:31.080\nwanted to see for the sake of science.\n\n02:31.080 --> 02:35.200\nMore importantly, speaking of science, I just want to, let's give me one of these beats.\n\n02:35.200 --> 02:38.520\nI want to be a good rapper, a sophisticated rapper.\n\n02:38.520 --> 02:40.320\nDan, you've probably not heard these.\n\n02:40.320 --> 02:44.000\nI have three selections from our new musical director, Ryan Elder, who I believe is in\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:45.000\nthe house tonight.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:55.240\nWe're making a documentary here, and we can't use Xanadu in some of our favorites because\n\n02:55.240 --> 02:57.000\nwe can't afford it, right?\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:58.000\nYeah.\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nYeah.\n\n02:59.000

03:10.720\nYou poor fucking babies.\n\n03:10.720 --> 03:13.560\nDan, Dan, have a drink.\n\n03:13.560 --> 03:15.360\nSorry.\n\n03:15.360 --> 03:16.360\nYou have three choices, Dan.\n\n03:16.360 --> 03:19.440\nAll right, two more outbursts like that and I'll have a drink.\n\n03:19.440 --> 03:22.640\nDan, these are your three rap beat choices.\n\n03:22.640 --> 03:24.640\nYou have sexy,

03:34.720\nAre you freestyle?\n\n03:34.720 --> 03:38.400\nAre you Emineminent right now or are you Beastie Poison?\n\n03:38.400 --> 03:39.400\nLet's do aggressive.\n\n03:39.400 --> 03:44.680\nYou're gonna go for aggressive, all right?\n\n03:44.680 --> 03:45.680\nThe audience is spoken.\n\n03:45.680 --> 03:46.680\nLet's see what we got.\n\n03:46.680 --> 03:48.360\nAll right, clear your head, clear your head.\n\n03:48.360 --> 03:49.360\nNo dicks.\n\n03:49.360 --> 03:50.360\nNo balls.\n\n03:50.360 --> 03:51.360\nYo.\n\n03:51.360 --> 03:52.360\nYo.\n\n03:52.360 --> 03:53.360\nYo.\n\n03:53.360 -->

03:59.360\nSome people might try to tell you others.\n\n03:59.360 --> 04:00.360\nRoger PutzHarmon.\n\n04:00.360 --> 04:01.360\nGod damn it.\n\n04:01.360 --> 04:02.360\nI fucking suck.\n\n04:02.360 --> 04:10.360\nI want to get your mom to fuck me.\n\n04:10.360 --> 04:13.360\nI want to suck her titties and fuck her pussy so hot.\n\n04:13.360 --> 04:16.360\nI want to fuck your mama outside the front yard.\n\n04:16.360 --> 04:18.360\nI want to put my dick inside her.\n\n04:18.360 --> 04:20.360\nGod damn it.\n\n04:20.360 --> 04:22.360\nAll right, now stop it.\n\n04:22.360 --> 04:24.360\nWe're not

04:42.360\nI want to write good music.\n\n04:42.360 --> 04:46.360\nI want to be a good singer and songwriter.\n\n04:46.360 --> 04:49.360\nI don't think people come to Harmontown because you're a craftsman.\n\n04:49.360 --> 04:55.360\nWhen it comes to rapping, I think they like the free-for-all that it is.\n\n04:55.360 --> 04:57.360\nIt becomes very adolescent and purio.\n\n04:57.360 --> 04:58.360\nWell, let's do it this way.\n\n04:58.360 --> 05:00.360\nWe got a big crowd tonight.\n\n05:00.360 --> 05:07.360\nAre there any professional singer-songwriters?\n\n05:07.360 --> 05:10.360\nPossibly Cambridge educated.\n\n05:10.360 --> 05:12.360\nWe'll take Oxford, but is there anyone...\n\n05:12.360 --> 05:14.360\nCambridge educated singer-songwriters?\n\n05:14.360 --> 05:16.360\nIs there anybody that can teach a tutorial for Dan?\n\n05:16.360 --> 05:18.360\nOh, I was just kidding.\n\n05:18.360 --> 05:20.360\nOh.\n\n05:22.360 --> 05:24.360\nEric Eidl.\n\n05:24.360

fortuitous, Eric.\n\n05:44.360 --> 05:45.360\nThank you for showing up.\n\n05:45.360 --> 05:48.360\nEric Eidl, comedic and gay icon.\n\n05:48.360 --> 05:50.360\nEric Eidl is here.\n\n05:50.360 --> 05:52.360\nEric Eidl.\n\n05:55.360 --> 05:57.360\nIs that Dave Davis?\n\n05:57.360 --> 05:59.360\nYes, it's Jeff Davis, our Comptroller.\n\n05:59.360 --> 06:01.360\nEric, I'm so glad you're

single one of your songs memorized.\n\n06:11.360 --> 06:20.360\nI have a problem where I like to write songs, I like to improvise them,\n\n06:20.360 --> 06:26.360\nbut I lose control and I go to a shitty, non-sophisticated place.\n\n06:26.360 --> 06:28.360\nYou're a hero of mine, a mentor of mine.\n\n06:28.360 --> 06:29.360\nCan you please help me?\n\n06:29.360 --> 06:31.360\nCan you please tell me how to...\n\n06:31.360 --> 06:34.360\nWhat would you do if you were going to write a perfect song?\n\n06:34.360 --> 06:37.360\nWell, it's a very interesting question.\n\n06:37.360 --> 06:41.360\nYou want to write the perfect song?\n\n06:41.360 --> 06:42.360\nYeah.\n\n06:42.360 --> 06:45.360\nThen ask yourself what's true.\n\n06:45.360 --> 06:51.360\nThen open your heart and the truth will start to write the song for you.\n\n06:51.360 --> 06:53.360\nJesus, this is what I'm talking about.\n\n06:57.360 --> 06:59.360\nWhen our first fuck dance mother...\n\n06:59.360 --> 07:00.360\nWhat?\n\n07:01.360 --> 07:05.360\nShe asked me for another but he was too wide.\n\n07:05.360 --> 07:08.360\nI fucked his father and nuzzled both his nuts.\n\n07:08.360 --> 07:12.360\nI dug all his chins and took two chins and put it in their butts.\n\n07:12.360 --> 07:16.360\nHarmony Town, Harmony Town, Harmony's mum is on the ground\n\n07:16.360 --> 07:24.360\ntaking bonus by the fountain, Harmony's on the ground, Harmony's on the ground, Harmony's on the ground,\n\n07:24.360 --> 07:38.840\nNow Eric, I have a question. Yes, sir. What would you rather do?\n\n07:38.840 --> 07:45.760\nFuck dance mother in the butt or make her eat your poop? I've asked myself this many times.\n\n07:45.760 --> 07:51.900\nAnd here is my reply. I feed her my poo and fuck her butt too and bitter a foam goodbye.\n\n07:51.900 --> 07:57.900\nHumming town, humming town, Hummer Tommy's on the ground taking bonus by the pound.\n\n07:57.900 --> 08:05.400\nDown it Hummer Town, Hummer Town, Hummer Town, Hummer Tommy's on the ground taking bonus by the pound.\n\n08:05.400 --> 08:10.400\nDown it Hummer Town. You guys are only doing what I've been doing all along.\n\n08:10.400 --> 08:14.400\nI fucked a million mamas already. I wanted a perfect song.\n\n08:14.400 --> 08:25.400\nSo open up your heart my friends and tell me what you see. Both your mothers sucking dicks and drinking all my pee.\n\n08:25.400 --> 08:31.400\nOh! Humming town, Hummer Town, Hummer's mum is on the ground taking bonus by the pound.\n\n08:31.400 --> 08:39.400\nDown it Hummer Town, Hummer Town, Hummer's mum is on the ground taking bonus by the pound.\n\n08:39.400 --> 08:45.400\nDown it Hummer Town.\n\n09:09.400 --> 09:22.400\nWell, you see Dan, you just have to open your mind and let it all come out.\n\n09:22.400 --> 09:24.400\nAlright, I think I understand.\n\n09:24.400 --> 09:31.400\nSometimes in all of our lives there comes a crisis when all you really need to set yourself right is for Eric Idle to come out.\n\n09:31.400 --> 09:33.400\nAnd remind you that.\n\n09:33.400 --> 09:36.400\nThe thing about nuzzling your father's nuts.\n\n09:36.400 --> 09:43.400\nAlright, alright, fine. Well, why don't we keep the, since I'm sober and I'm no entertainment myself and since we are going on the road,\n\n09:43.400 --> 09:49.400\nwhy don't we keep the mentorship going, you know, see if we can keep getting advice and guidance from people.\n\n09:49.400 --> 09:52.400\nWell, I want to ask you a question before you do that.\n\n09:52.400 --> 09:58.400\nJust while we have the opportunity, we're going out, you just turned 40. Your 40th birthday was a few days ago.\n\n09:58.400 --> 10:11.400\nAnd we're going out on this big tour, which is very ambitious. It was a very long, grueling schedule.\n\n10:11.400 --> 10:17.400\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by this? Is there a goal for you in terms of what you want to come home with?\n\n10:17.400 --> 10:22.400\nWhat do you want to return with? What's the golden fleece that you expect to get from this?\n\n10:22.400 --> 10:27.400\nWell, I mean, I have a couple of different goals because I'm not a big planner.\n\n10:27.400 --> 10:31.400\nAnd obviously the show is not, like, you know, written.\n\n10:31.400 --> 10:38.400\nAnd that's controlling.\n\n10:38.400 --> 10:43.400\nStriking the music stand.\n\n10:43.400 --> 10:48.400\nDon't fight me.\n\n10:48.400 --> 10:50.400\nAlright.\n\n10:50.400 --> 10:55.400\nOn the tour bus, I get real rapy.\n\n10:55.400 --> 10:59.400\nI'll have to bring some of that cassette head cleaner that the people use.\n\n10:59.400 --> 11:04.400\nDid you know that that's an underground amyl nitrate kind of stuff?\n\n11:04.400 --> 11:12.400\nWell, no, it's like cassette head cleaner. The fluid, if you huff it, it dilates your anus.\n\n11:12.400 --> 11:14.400\nGo on.\n\n11:14.400 --> 11:18.400\nEnd of story.\n\n11:18.400 --> 11:23.400\nSorry, Tron. This copy is going to have to keep the...\n\n11:23.400 --> 11:27.400\nNot being playable. Daddy's going out tonight.\n\n11:27.400 --> 11:30.400\nI want to drink so bad.\n\n11:30.400 --> 11:39.400\nThis is what sobriety feels like. It feels like everyone else is drunk.\n\n11:39.400 --> 11:46.400\nI think one thing that I would like to accomplish is I would like to learn how to love people\n\n11:46.400 --> 11:54.400\nMy girlfriend wrote this book. She didn't write it.\n\n11:54.400 --> 11:58.400\nBut this is a whole track of conversation that I wanted to talk to everybody about tonight.\n\n11:58.400 --> 12:02.400\nBut I don't want to delay our next guest. He's got it out.\n\n12:02.400 --> 12:05.400\nI think we should bring him up and talk to him about touring.\n\n12:05.400 --> 12:28.400\nPlease welcome to the stage, Patton Oswald.\n\n12:28.400 --> 12:35.400\nOh, my goodness. Yeah, this is exactly the way that I did it on convenience of comedy.\n\n12:35.400 --> 12:41.400\nHad a massive comedy legend walk out, do a song for free.\n\n12:41.400 --> 12:47.400\nI think we had Steve Martin and Birmingham one night.\n\n12:47.400 --> 12:51.400\nNichols and May came out one evening.\n\n12:51.400 --> 12:53.400\nWow.\n\n12:53.400 --> 12:58.400\nYeah, I mean, I just Facebooked them and they were like, yeah, yeah, we'll come down. No problem.\n\n12:58.400 --> 13:00.400\nI found Eric on Craigslist.\n\n13:00.400 --> 13:06.400\nOh, really? You can do it. Because when I do Python searches, I find way different stuff.\n\n13:06.400 --> 13:12.400\nI'm the thing. It's like in Python.\n\n13:12.400 --> 13:15.400\nDescribe to me the tour. What are you doing?\n\n13:15.400 --> 13:16.400\nDo new.\n\n13:16.400 --> 13:18.400\nHelp me help you.\n\n13:18.400 --> 13:23.400\nWe're leaving on the 10th at 10 a.m. as far as I know.\n\n13:23.400 --> 13:24.400\n8 a.m.\n\n13:24.400 --> 13:26.400\nOkay.\n\n13:26.400 --> 13:28.400\nOkay, just let me start right there.\n\n13:28.400 --> 13:32.400\nTry to coordinate the day and time. Have them be the same number.\n\n13:32.400 --> 13:34.400\nAlready? This is already working.\n\n13:34.400 --> 13:36.400\nI'm already glad we got this guy down here.\n\n13:36.400 --> 13:37.400\nOkay, good.\n\n13:37.400 --> 13:42.400\nHeading from Los Angeles to Phoenix, where we're going to do a show for God knows how many people are actually going to show up.\n\n13:42.400 --> 13:44.400\nYou're going to, I'm sorry, you're starting the tour.\n\n13:44.400 --> 13:47.400\nYour first show is going to be in Phoenix.\n\n13:47.400 --> 13:58.400\nSo you're, so basically you are, this is the, that's the equivalent of, alright, I know that there is, there's some chocolate mousse down the road,\n\n13:58.400 --> 14:05.400\nbut we're going to have cold green beans right now to really make that a treat when it shows up.\n\n14:05.400 --> 14:08.400\nPat, what do you know about Phoenix that we don't know?\n\n14:08.400 --> 14:12.400\nPerforming in Phoenix is basically, have you ever been to Phoenix?\n\n14:12.400 --> 14:15.400\nYeah, I was there when I was signing some comic books once.\n\n14:15.400 --> 14:18.400\nOh, okay. Yours?\n\n14:18.400 --> 14:24.400\nNo, I wrote some for, I didn't sign like just some Iron Man shit that I had.\n\n14:24.400 --> 14:27.400\nThe way you said it was like, I went to Phoenix and I signed some comic books.\n\n14:27.400 --> 14:28.400\nJust like graffiti.\n\n14:28.400 --> 14:30.400\nThat's when you were really hammered.\n\n14:30.400 --> 14:32.400\nYeah, I was at a low point.\n\n14:32.400 --> 14:37.400\nOne night I started at Cat and Fiddle, and the next thing I knew I was in Phoenix signing comic books.\n\n14:37.400 --> 14:39.400\nI was right up there, Sarah Silverman fired me out.\n\n14:39.400 --> 14:42.400\nI was just like, I wrote this, I wrote that, I wrote this, I wrote that.\n\n14:42.400 --> 14:44.400\nI was just signing everything.\n\n14:44.400 --> 14:49.400\nI was signing, you don't care what the answer is.\n\n14:49.400 --> 14:52.400\nI was signing Rob Schrab comic books that I wrote.\n\n14:52.400 --> 14:55.400\nThat's good, Rob Schrab's in the house tonight, everybody.\n\n14:55.400 --> 14:59.400\nThere he is.\n\n14:59.400 --> 15:01.400\nHe's got the disposable assassin.\n\n15:01.400 --> 15:03.400\nHighly recommended.\n\n15:03.400 --> 15:06.400\nI believe the hardback collection is here in the store if you want to...\n\n15:06.400 --> 15:08.400\nYes.\n\n15:08.400 --> 15:16.400\nPhoenix is an abandoned moon colony if all of the astronauts were Mexican and on crank.\n\n15:16.400 --> 15:18.400\nThat is how to think of it.\n\n15:18.400 --> 15:21.400\nThat is basically the setting.\n\n15:21.400 --> 15:35.400\nAnd if you see any white people, they are either cryptically racist or so gleefully openly racist that it's kind of charming.\n\n15:35.400 --> 15:43.400\nWe're kind of hoping because of our podcast that we're going to draw a similar essential crowd that we get here.\n\n15:43.400 --> 15:45.400\nIs that possible?\n\n15:45.400 --> 15:47.400\nBut here's the thing you have to keep in mind.\n\n15:47.400 --> 15:51.400\nEvery city in America has this.\n\n15:51.400 --> 15:56.400\nThese kind of the smart people, the dreamers, the artists.\n\n15:56.400 --> 16:01.400\nI'm just saying, and may I also point out the pasty and frightened.\n\n16:01.400 --> 16:05.400\nBefore you start going, hey, hey.\n\n16:05.400 --> 16:09.400\nDon't run into the street and start fame dancing.\n\n16:09.400 --> 16:11.400\nYou'll throw something.\n\n16:11.400 --> 16:14.400\nWe can do it, punch.\n\n16:14.400 --> 16:19.400\nBut some cities are a much more soap sponge than others.\n\n16:19.400 --> 16:27.400\nSo Phoenix, you're really going to be ringing that sponge to get as much of this as you possibly can.\n\n16:27.400 --> 16:29.400\nIf you don't have any advice on how I can do that, do you?\n\n16:29.400 --> 16:31.400\nDon't say Morning Zoo teams.\n\n16:31.400 --> 16:37.400\nWell, Morning Zoo teams, unfortunately, they're A, you have to be funny on their terms.\n\n16:37.400 --> 16:39.400\nAnd I've done those.\n\n16:39.400 --> 16:46.400\nSatellite tours where you do three hour black and you just hold there and they go, okay, Dan, are you ready?\n\n16:46.400 --> 16:49.400\nThis is Harold and Kazoo in the mornings.\n\n16:49.400 --> 16:50.400\nYou ready?\n\n16:50.400 --> 16:51.400\nYeah, okay.\n\n16:51.400 --> 16:54.400\nAnd then you just cut into the middle of this thing and they're like, oh, okay.\n\n16:54.400 --> 16:58.400\nUp next is some asshole we've never heard of.\n\n16:58.400 --> 17:02.400\nDan Harmon, apparently doing something called Exarptable Tarver.\n\n17:02.400 --> 17:04.400\nHow did you pronounce those wrong?\n\n17:04.400 --> 17:13.400\nI love the Morning Zoo's where the guy, the DJ himself is on the phone using his actual human voice before he brings her on the air going,\n\n17:13.400 --> 17:15.400\nhey, Pat, thanks so much for calling in.\n\n17:15.400 --> 17:17.400\nI'm going to do this stupid show.\n\n17:17.400 --> 17:19.400\nIt's the dumbest thing ever.\n\n17:19.400 --> 17:21.400\nLook, I like what you do, man.\n\n17:21.400 --> 17:23.400\nBut this is the market I'm in.\n\n17:23.400 --> 17:24.400\nSo you're cool, right?\n\n17:24.400 --> 17:25.400\nI'm like, yeah, I guess so.\n\n17:25.400 --> 17:27.400\nOkay, so we're going to be on in like three, two.\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:31.400\nHey, it's Flappy and the Bee, we're going to have a little fantastic house.\n\n17:31.400 --> 17:33.400\nAnd I won't even keep it clean.\n\n17:33.400 --> 17:35.400\nSay Lea Remedy, boobs.\n\n17:35.400 --> 17:39.400\nSo hey, they're two simply, and just all these awful.\n\n17:39.400 --> 17:43.400\nAnd they make you do, they make you, they go all their inside jokes.\n\n17:43.400 --> 17:45.400\nYou have to like join their Smurf patch.\n\n17:45.400 --> 17:46.400\nOh, exactly, yeah.\n\n17:46.400 --> 17:48.400\nHey, give us an AIDS bomb.\n\n17:48.400 --> 17:49.400\nWhat do you want?\n\n17:49.400 --> 17:50.400\nWhy do you want an AIDS bomb?\n\n17:50.400 --> 17:53.400\nI did one because I do improv.\n\n17:53.400 --> 17:57.400\nI'm like, Jeff, yeah, you do improv, yeah, you're not chilly, you do the improv.\n\n17:57.400 --> 18:00.400\nHow about doing a little rap for us about the pinch of the pump?\n\n18:00.400 --> 18:02.400\nThe pinch of the pump.\n\n18:02.400 --> 18:03.400\nThe pinch of the pump.\n\n18:03.400 --> 18:08.400\nAnd then yeah, it's all these weird in-jokes that they have not filled you in on the beginnings of.\n\n18:08.400 --> 18:10.400\nSo hey, it's 9.17 on Thursday morning.\n\n18:10.400 --> 18:11.400\nYou know what I mean?\n\n18:11.400 --> 18:12.400\nThat's bad.\n\n18:12.400 --> 18:13.400\nBeef stew.\n\n18:13.400 --> 18:14.400\nWhat?\n\n18:14.400 --> 18:15.400\nAll right.\n\n18:15.400 --> 18:18.400\nAnd then, and then they, I also love the weird.\n\n18:18.400 --> 18:22.400\nIf you don't immediately pitch it to their kind of whack-a-noodle,\n\n18:22.400 --> 18:24.400\nparty at 6.18 a.m.\n\n18:24.400 --> 18:27.400\nIf you don't hit that level, they immediately get angry with you\n\n18:27.400 --> 18:29.400\nand try to get rid of you like,\n\n18:29.400 --> 18:32.400\nwhoa, let's get this party pooper out of here and have some fun.\n\n18:32.400 --> 18:39.400\nWell, it looks like we just wandered into the fossil yard with a fog horn.\n\n18:39.400 --> 18:41.400\nFossil yard with a fog horn.\n\n18:41.400 --> 18:42.400\nRight.\n\n18:42.400 --> 18:47.400\nWell, while Spence puts us all to sleep, we want to tell you about our Flapjack snack attack with Foghead down at the,\n\n18:47.400 --> 18:49.400\nI hop on Route 29.\n\n18:49.400 --> 18:51.400\nThat's right, it's the Foghead Flapjack Snack Attack.\n\n18:51.400 --> 18:54.400\nCome on down, bring a plate, stack them high.\n\n18:54.400 --> 18:58.400\nComing up next, I got the I Hate My Boss donut toss over here.\n\n18:58.400 --> 19:01.400\nIt's gonna be tossing donuts off the roof, bring them bucket if you catch one.\n\n19:01.400 --> 19:05.400\nYou get a pair of KTRT, the turtle panties that you can wear.\n\n19:05.400 --> 19:06.400\nTurtle panties.\n\n19:06.400 --> 19:07.400\nIt's just...\n\n19:07.400 --> 19:09.400\nTurtle panties.\n\n19:09.400 --> 19:10.400\nTurtle panties.\n\n19:10.400 --> 19:15.400\nThere actually are now, there are things you're gonna have to avoid doing\n\n19:15.400 --> 19:17.400\nor you'll bring the wrong people to your show.\n\n19:17.400 --> 19:23.400\nSo, that said, sometimes bringing the wrong people to your show can make the show kind of amazing.\n\n19:23.400 --> 19:25.400\nThey don't quite know what's going on.\n\n19:25.400 --> 19:31.400\nBut what I don't want to happen is I don't want the 11 people in Phoenix that actually, like, love me.\n\n19:31.400 --> 19:32.400\nYeah.\n\n19:32.400 --> 19:38.400\nI don't want them subjected to the 20 people that wandered into chuckled, chuckled nuts.\n\n19:38.400 --> 19:41.400\nGoing like, let's just see comedy tonight.\n\n19:41.400 --> 19:45.400\nAnd by that I assume someone as funny as Patton Oswalt will be coming out here and then I come out and go,\n\n19:45.400 --> 19:51.400\nI have asthma and my girlfriend loves me too much.\n\n19:51.400 --> 19:54.400\nSometimes it makes me feel like a bad person.\n\n19:54.400 --> 19:56.400\nWhat the fuck's going on here?\n\n19:56.400 --> 20:03.400\nAnd then they're ticking my fans' chairs and I'm like, hey, leave them alone.\n\n20:03.400 --> 20:09.400\nWell, one thing that I does kind of help if you're on Twitter is interact with people that have been at the show.\n\n20:09.400 --> 20:14.400\nAnd if you keep that conversation going, other people from other cities will see that you're kind of...\n\n20:14.400 --> 20:16.400\nThey'll start tracking you as you move across.\n\n20:16.400 --> 20:19.400\nAnd I only did that with a website in Myspace.\n\n20:19.400 --> 20:21.400\nI didn't have Twitter when I was doing that.\n\n20:21.400 --> 20:24.400\nWell, you know, we're going to podcast every single night.\n\n20:24.400 --> 20:26.400\nLike, we're doing like a show a day.\n\n20:26.400 --> 20:27.400\nNo, sure.\n\n20:27.400 --> 20:30.400\nAnd we're going to get on the bus and then podcast out of the performance.\n\n20:30.400 --> 20:31.400\nOkay, but let me stop.\n\n20:31.400 --> 20:32.400\nAll right.\n\n20:32.400 --> 20:37.400\nSo that, I know that you're right now in your head.\n\n20:37.400 --> 20:43.400\nYou're like, yes, we're going to document everything and it's going to be fucking Hunter S. Thompson and the lawyer and the Cadillac.\n\n20:43.400 --> 20:47.400\nAnd I'm going to have the typewriter on my lap and I'm going to chronicle every minute of it.\n\n20:47.400 --> 20:48.400\nYeah, yeah, that's all right.\n\n20:48.400 --> 20:57.400\nYeah, you will hit a wall way sooner than you think you're going to hit it where you are going to not want your life documented.\n\n20:57.400 --> 21:01.400\nYou're like, you will start, you will fall into this weird sullen.\n\n21:01.400 --> 21:07.400\nI guarantee you one of your podcasts would just be a, hey, Stan, and we're in Vegas.\n\n21:07.400 --> 21:08.400\nAnd I don't know.\n\n21:08.400 --> 21:10.400\nWe drove all day and now we're here.\n\n21:10.400 --> 21:11.400\nAnd I don't know.\n\n21:11.400 --> 21:12.400\nI don't know.\n\n21:12.400 --> 21:13.400\nI don't fucking know.\n\n21:13.400 --> 21:17.400\nSo, I don't know.\n\n21:17.400 --> 21:18.400\nFuck.\n\n21:18.400 --> 21:19.400\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n21:19.400 --> 21:20.400\nI don't know.\n\n21:20.400 --> 21:21.400\nWhat do you want?\n\n21:21.400 --> 21:22.400\nWhat do you want me to stay?\n\n21:22.400 --> 21:31.400\nLike, and, but it'll be a really, there'll be a weird insightful moment where you will start to realize, oh, people that are on reality shows that want to be filmed all the time.\n\n21:31.400 --> 21:39.400\nThose, they are sociopaths because they don't hit the wall that I've just hit where they are never tired of a camera and microphone show.\n\n21:39.400 --> 21:41.400\nYeah, they're just constantly, they're like solar calculators.\n\n21:41.400 --> 21:47.400\nThe, the, but, but there's a, there's a, there's a little misunderstanding here.\n\n21:47.400 --> 21:51.400\nWe're not, the show is going to be the podcast.\n\n21:51.400 --> 22:00.400\nLike, like, right, because I don't, unlike you, like you, you, you, you have like probably by now you have a solid three hours of, of really refined material.\n\n22:00.400 --> 22:01.400\nYeah, you're right.\n\n22:01.400 --> 22:02.400\nBut, right.\n\n22:02.400 --> 22:03.400\nYeah, go ahead.\n\n22:03.400 --> 22:10.400\nI'm not going to, but, but, but, but I can't, when I go out in front of people, I don't.\n\n22:10.400 --> 22:14.400\nSo I'm kind of forcing myself because what's for sale is not what's for sale with you.\n\n22:14.400 --> 22:22.400\nSo I'm going the other direction and refusing to allow myself to have any, I'm not going to, they're going to be able to hear the show in Phoenix in Austin.\n\n22:22.400 --> 22:26.400\nAnd then I'm going to show up in Austin and go, how about that show in Phoenix?\n\n22:26.400 --> 22:28.400\nRemember when I got my ass kicked?\n\n22:28.400 --> 22:29.400\nWasn't that crazy?\n\n22:29.400 --> 22:35.400\nBut we're going to be doing shows in various venues where a lot of their audience will be local, like they promote their own audience.\n\n22:35.400 --> 22:40.400\nThese comedy clubs promote their own, like kind of loyal fan base, right, Patton?\n\n22:40.400 --> 22:53.400\nYeah, we ran into some trouble on one of these because they have some clubs kind of have their own corporate culture where their fans have a certain behavior that they try to encourage because they speak more.\n\n22:53.400 --> 22:54.400\nOh no.\n\n22:54.400 --> 22:55.400\nSales of them.\n\n22:55.400 --> 22:56.400\nHere's your pickle flappers.\n\n22:56.400 --> 22:58.400\nYeah, there was a, Portland.\n\n22:58.400 --> 23:04.400\nThere was a club in Champaign, Champaign, Illinois that told, that set out a thing to its, and they had on the website.\n\n23:04.400 --> 23:07.400\nThese comedians love loud hecklers.\n\n23:07.400 --> 23:08.400\nWhat?\n\n23:08.400 --> 23:14.400\nSo come out and, and we, I swear to God, we, and we didn't realize what had happened until after the show, we went to their website.\n\n23:14.400 --> 23:16.400\nNo, after the show, people were coming up.\n\n23:16.400 --> 23:18.400\nI've never been in front of a drunker crowd.\n\n23:18.400 --> 23:21.400\nAnd they were like heckling as you would walk.\n\n23:21.400 --> 23:23.400\nLike the minute they would go, I'm going to show them a Maria Bamford.\n\n23:23.400 --> 23:24.400\nGod damn it!\n\n23:24.400 --> 23:25.400\nWhat the fuck?\n\n23:25.400 --> 23:33.400\nLike as you were walking up there yelling at you, like you're mounting the guillotine and they're just screaming, you, I'm looking at you.\n\n23:33.400 --> 23:34.400\nNo.\n\n23:34.400 --> 23:35.400\nI haven't said anything yet.\n\n23:35.400 --> 23:38.400\nYou ever watched up with their own folded clothes in their hands?\n\n23:38.400 --> 23:40.400\nThere's toilet paper flaming coming out of them.\n\n23:40.400 --> 23:45.400\nPat, I don't know if you know this, but we're traveling with our Dungeon Master because we played D&D in our shows.\n\n23:45.400 --> 23:46.400\nSo Spencer.\n\n23:46.400 --> 23:48.400\nWe definitely go to Phoenix then.\n\n23:48.400 --> 23:53.400\nYeah, that's your, you guys are like, that's your like freedom riders in the south in the sixties.\n\n23:53.400 --> 24:00.400\nThat's going to bull, bulldozers are going to be exhuming your torpses.\n\n24:00.400 --> 24:02.400\nSpencer, you're in deep shit, man.\n\n24:02.400 --> 24:04.400\nYeah, yeah.\n\n24:04.400 --> 24:06.400\nWe did, okay, we did the club.\n\n24:06.400 --> 24:08.400\nAre you doing anything in Washington, D.C.?\n\n24:08.400 --> 24:10.400\nUh, no.\n\n24:10.400 --> 24:12.400\nAre we in Maryland or somewhere?\n\n24:12.400 --> 24:14.400\nWe're in Maryland.\n\n24:14.400 --> 24:16.400\nWe're in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n24:16.400 --> 24:17.400\nAt the Cinema Draft House?\n\n24:17.400 --> 24:18.400\nYes.\n\n24:18.400 --> 24:19.400\nNo, uh, Birchmere.\n\n24:19.400 --> 24:21.400\nNo, we're at the Taj Mahaa.\n\n24:21.400 --> 24:24.400\nIn Virginia.\n\n24:24.400 --> 24:29.400\nThe Taj Mahaa.\n\n24:29.400 --> 24:32.400\nAgain, I did a club called Sir Lafsalat.\n\n24:32.400 --> 24:33.400\nNo.\n\n24:33.400 --> 24:34.400\nI'm not kidding.\n\n24:34.400 --> 24:35.400\nIn Milwaukee.\n\n24:35.400 --> 24:36.400\nYeah, that's Milwaukee.\n\n24:36.400 --> 24:37.400\nThat's my hometown.\n\n24:37.400 --> 24:39.400\nSir Lafsalat, the funny business in the Comedy Cafe.\n\n24:39.400 --> 24:41.400\nSir Lafsalat is, yeah, yeah.\n\n24:41.400 --> 24:42.400\nYeah.\n\n24:42.400 --> 24:44.400\nIt's men only.\n\n24:44.400 --> 24:49.400\nAll I'm saying is we did, we did the Black Cat in D.C. and it was, the show was so packed.\n\n24:49.400 --> 24:52.400\nIt was, I felt very gratified.\n\n24:52.400 --> 24:54.400\nWe have sold out the Black Cat.\n\n24:54.400 --> 24:56.400\nIt was a club I would go to when I was young.\n\n24:56.400 --> 24:57.400\nBut, well, hang on.\n\n24:57.400 --> 25:01.400\nSo, I was, so afterwards I'm talking to the club owner and he's really nice.\n\n25:01.400 --> 25:05.400\nAnd I said, hey, so, um, really sold the place out, huh?\n\n25:05.400 --> 25:11.400\nHe goes, uh, yeah, I mean, you know, we, uh, yeah, you had about 730 tickets sold.\n\n25:11.400 --> 25:14.400\nI'm like, well, I mean, it was like literally wall to wall.\n\n25:14.400 --> 25:20.400\nYeah, I mean, we do a lot of, uh, uh, place holds about 900.\n\n25:20.400 --> 25:24.400\nUh, we normally do like thrash shows here and punk shows.\n\n25:24.400 --> 25:32.400\nUm, your fans tend to be little, like, like, literally our fans are all these chubby nerds\n\n25:32.400 --> 25:37.400\nand they can only put, like, a bunch of little messed out thrash fans.\n\n25:37.400 --> 25:39.400\nYeah, they can easily get 900 of them there.\n\n25:39.400 --> 25:45.400\nBut our fans are, I'm very excited to come see Zach Galifianakis and Brian Posade.\n\n25:45.400 --> 25:50.400\nAnd so I got the DVRs, catch it all, Dr. Who tonight, so I can watch that at the morning.\n\n25:50.400 --> 25:51.400\nBut, uh, for the night.\n\n25:51.400 --> 25:52.400\nWell, that's outlifting.\n\n25:52.400 --> 25:56.400\nThere's, there's sections of the country where, where, where this can work in our favor.\n\n25:56.400 --> 25:57.400\nOh, exactly.\n\n25:57.400 --> 25:58.400\nYou have way more mad.\n\n25:58.400 --> 25:59.400\nIt's a full house.\n\n25:59.400 --> 26:00.400\nUh, there's seven people.\n\n26:00.400 --> 26:06.400\nWell, Norm, your audience is so fat when they have a full house.\n\n26:06.400 --> 26:08.400\nThey really, yeah.\n\n26:08.400 --> 26:10.400\nThis place holds, they're not even full.\n\n26:10.400 --> 26:14.400\nYeah, this place holds 900 punk fans or 11 rascal scooters.\n\n26:14.400 --> 26:17.400\nSo you guys did really well tonight.\n\n26:17.400 --> 26:22.400\nWe had, well, uh, well, this has been edifying.\n\n26:22.400 --> 26:23.400\nYeah.\n\n26:23.400 --> 26:26.400\nSo then Patton real quick, I mean, well, I'll just list off from memory where we're going.\n\n26:26.400 --> 26:27.400\nRight.\n\n26:27.400 --> 26:30.400\nIf, if, if one of these cities, uh, uh, brings back horror stories or fun.\n\n26:30.400 --> 26:34.400\nI'm, I cannot, I'll just tell you right now, I can't wait to hear the Phoenix podcast.\n\n26:34.400 --> 26:35.400\nThat's all I'm saying.\n\n26:35.400 --> 26:36.400\nAll right.\n\n26:36.400 --> 26:37.400\nThat's going to be interesting.\n\n26:37.400 --> 26:38.400\nWe go, after that we go to Austin Tech, which is good.\n\n26:38.400 --> 26:39.400\nYeah, that's, that's a, that's a gimme.\n\n26:39.400 --> 26:40.400\nThat's great.\n\n26:40.400 --> 26:41.400\nThen we're going to Atlanta.\n\n26:41.400 --> 26:42.400\nWoo!\n\n26:42.400 --> 26:47.400\nAtlanta, Atlanta is, is weirdly either fun or awful.\n\n26:47.400 --> 26:51.400\nUm, the one thing I love about Atlanta is the freak scene there.\n\n26:51.400 --> 26:56.400\nUh, that's the one place because the, the, it's so hot and so humid.\n\n26:56.400 --> 27:03.400\nThere's this, we drove by this golf club called the vault and it was like early even like\n\n27:03.400 --> 27:04.400\nfive o'clock.\n\n27:04.400 --> 27:05.400\nI had to be 111 degrees out.\n\n27:05.400 --> 27:11.400\nSo watching all the guys with just their makeup, like they're all in black and they're\n\n27:11.400 --> 27:16.400\ntrying to get into the vault and they're so committed, but it's all like a, a goth, a\n\n27:16.400 --> 27:19.400\ngoth in Atlanta is a fucking hero.\n\n27:19.400 --> 27:25.400\nLike that is a super hero when it's like, man, that black lipstick is just running out and\n\n27:25.400 --> 27:27.400\nlook like I was, I was eating dead syrup.\n\n27:27.400 --> 27:29.400\nI thought it looked black.\n\n27:29.400 --> 27:30.400\nWe're sold out in Atlanta.\n\n27:30.400 --> 27:31.400\nOf course you are.\n\n27:31.400 --> 27:32.400\nYeah.\n\n27:32.400 --> 27:37.400\nAnd then it's a Nashville and Charlotte and then some, for some reason also, I don't know\n\n27:37.400 --> 27:42.400\nhow many gigs you guys did on your tour and, and what the pace was, but it's almost every\n\n27:42.400 --> 27:43.400\nnight we're doing a show.\n\n27:43.400 --> 27:45.400\nAnd so that's how it was for us.\n\n27:45.400 --> 27:47.400\nWe're in Brooklyn the next night from Charlotte.\n\n27:47.400 --> 27:48.400\nHoly shit.\n\n27:48.400 --> 27:50.400\nAnd it's going to be January.\n\n27:50.400 --> 27:51.400\nIt's going to be.\n\n27:51.400 --> 27:52.400\nYeah.\n\n27:52.400 --> 27:56.600\nAnd then we go up into the North, Northeast and then across the top of the country during\n\n27:56.600 --> 27:57.600\nlate January.\n\n27:57.600 --> 27:58.600\nWhat the really?\n\n27:58.600 --> 27:59.600\nYeah.\n\n27:59.600 --> 28:02.400\nIt's, it's, it's, it's my first tour.\n\n28:02.400 --> 28:03.400\nYeah.\n\n28:03.400 --> 28:05.400\nIt's going to be your last tour.\n\n28:05.400 --> 28:10.400\nI didn't want, again, that was sitting right there, but, um, well, you know, you, there's\n\n28:10.400 --> 28:14.400\na good chance that you're going to get to be one of those, um, oh, what, what, what else\n\n28:14.400 --> 28:15.400\nwould he have done?\n\n28:15.400 --> 28:16.400\nYeah.\n\n28:16.400 --> 28:17.400\nWhat an amazing legend he was.\n\n28:17.400 --> 28:18.400\nYeah.\n\n28:18.400 --> 28:23.400\nThat's, that's semi hadn't jackknifed on, uh, who knows who would have fired him.\n\n28:23.400 --> 28:24.400\nYeah.\n\n28:24.400 --> 28:25.400\nMaybe.\n\n28:25.400 --> 28:26.400\nWow.\n\n28:26.400 --> 28:27.400\nDan.\n\n28:27.400 --> 28:29.400\nUh, I don't.\n\n28:29.400 --> 28:30.400\nWow.\n\n28:30.400 --> 28:35.400\nThe Northeast in January.\n\n28:35.400 --> 28:40.400\nThen there's one night we go from Kansas City, Kansas to Denver, Colorado.\n\n28:40.400 --> 28:42.400\nThat, that's a long, that's a long pull.\n\n28:42.400 --> 28:43.400\nRight.\n\n28:43.400 --> 28:44.400\nThat's same.\n\n28:44.400 --> 28:49.400\nAnd also Denver at this time of year is really dicey to get to with the ice in the, in the\n\n28:49.400 --> 28:50.400\nRocky Mountains.\n\n28:50.400 --> 28:51.400\nYeah.\n\n28:51.400 --> 28:54.400\nYou're getting into like, you know, Scatman Crothers in the shining, like get a, go get\n\n28:54.400 --> 28:57.400\na fucking hobie cat or something to get through that snow.\n\n28:57.400 --> 28:59.400\nIt's going to be bad.\n\n28:59.400 --> 29:05.400\nI would, I, I would take a, you know, take some, take some sturdy pioneer women to eat\n\n29:05.400 --> 29:10.400\nin case you get stuck in a snowstorm or something.\n\n29:10.400 --> 29:17.400\nWhat's your, what's your Pemekin budget on this, uh, tour?\n\n29:17.400 --> 29:19.400\nHoly shit, Dan.\n\n29:19.400 --> 29:23.400\nUm, everyone get a clipping of his clothes as a relic cause this could be it.\n\n29:23.400 --> 29:27.400\nI mean, this is like Jamesy, like fuck off, I'm getting in my convertible.\n\n29:27.400 --> 29:29.400\nSee you later.\n\n29:29.400 --> 29:32.400\nIt's almost certain that we're going to miss a gig or two on this thing cause it's so\n\n29:32.400 --> 29:34.400\nbreakneck and it's going to be bad weather.\n\n29:34.400 --> 29:35.400\nYeah.\n\n29:35.400 --> 29:38.400\nAnd, uh, you know, it's also, you know, the weather's getting worse and worse, you know,\n\n29:38.400 --> 29:41.400\nlike that's more storms, more traffic.\n\n29:41.400 --> 29:42.400\nWe're fucked.\n\n29:42.400 --> 29:43.400\nWhat the?\n\n29:43.400 --> 29:44.400\nAll right.\n\n29:44.400 --> 29:45.400\nFine.\n\n29:45.400 --> 29:46.400\nWe're fucked.\n\n29:46.400 --> 29:47.400\nGoodbye, dude.\n\n29:47.400 --> 29:53.400\nUm, I mean, if you say you're fucked enough, you, you, you garner the favor of a very gullible\n\n29:53.400 --> 29:54.400\nGod, right?\n\n29:54.400 --> 29:55.400\nYeah.\n\n29:55.400 --> 29:56.400\nNo, that's true.\n\n29:56.400 --> 30:00.400\nIf you say it won't happen, uh, that, that, uh, that antler, uh, the moose thing on the\n\n30:00.400 --> 30:02.400\nwall, that looks kind of rickety.\n\n30:02.400 --> 30:04.400\nOh, you said it, it's not going to fall.\n\n30:04.400 --> 30:06.400\nThat's not going to fall.\n\n30:06.400 --> 30:12.400\nJust as many weird rituals as you can think of do them every morning.\n\n30:12.400 --> 30:14.400\nSpinning witter shins, rabbit feet.\n\n30:14.400 --> 30:16.400\nI don't know what.\n\n30:16.400 --> 30:19.400\nPat, were you guys on the bus the whole time?\n\n30:19.400 --> 30:20.400\nWere you always in the bus?\n\n30:20.400 --> 30:21.400\nHow many breaks were there?\n\n30:21.400 --> 30:22.400\nHotels?\n\n30:22.400 --> 30:23.400\nI know we were always in the bus.\n\n30:23.400 --> 30:27.400\nUh, sometimes we would just get a day room or you could use the day room and shower and\n\n30:27.400 --> 30:29.400\nchange because we couldn't afford four hotel rooms.\n\n30:29.400 --> 30:36.400\nUm, so we've stayed, we stayed in some hotels that were so super, like the, the, the, the\n\n30:36.400 --> 30:39.400\nghost of so many ex suicidal truckers.\n\n30:39.400 --> 30:42.400\nWe're just crying out for the mattresses.\n\n30:42.400 --> 30:46.400\nI don't know what kind of hotel accommodations you've, uh, where do you think you're staying?\n\n30:46.400 --> 30:48.400\nAre you sleeping on the bus or?\n\n30:48.400 --> 30:51.400\nThere's, there's some things where like we have to get in the bus right after the show\n\n30:51.400 --> 30:54.400\nand there's a giant like long, long hall to somewhere else.\n\n30:54.400 --> 30:56.400\nThere, there will be gigs where we land.\n\n30:56.400 --> 31:00.400\nWe have like a couple hotel rooms to, you know, shower and shave and that kind of stuff.\n\n31:00.400 --> 31:05.400\nRight now Bob Seeger is feeling a huge disturbance in the forest where he, wherever he's sitting,\n\n31:05.400 --> 31:08.400\nit's like, Jesus, someone, oh, someone's going to die.\n\n31:08.400 --> 31:09.400\nI feel it.\n\n31:09.400 --> 31:11.400\nI got to do something.\n\n31:11.400 --> 31:13.400\nBut I'll warm up my Grammy fingers.\n\n31:13.400 --> 31:14.400\nYeah, exactly.\n\n31:14.400 --> 31:17.400\nAt least the bus will be relaxing because there's going to be cameras everywhere and\n\n31:17.400 --> 31:19.400\nwe're making a movie the whole time.\n\n31:19.400 --> 31:20.400\nOh yeah, that's good.\n\n31:20.400 --> 31:22.400\nWe're like casting our thing from the bus every day.\n\n31:22.400 --> 31:23.400\nIt's going to be awesome.\n\n31:23.400 --> 31:24.400\nI don't know.\n\n31:24.400 --> 31:25.400\nWow.\n\n31:25.400 --> 31:26.400\nAll we had were cameras.\n\n31:26.400 --> 31:31.400\nLike if, again, this is, and again, in 10 years, what you're doing is going to seem quaint.\n\n31:31.400 --> 31:34.400\nLike, yeah, they didn't, they didn't have, they didn't have any of the anal mics.\n\n31:34.400 --> 31:35.400\nIt was weird.\n\n31:35.400 --> 31:37.400\nIt was, it was only 2013.\n\n31:37.400 --> 31:38.400\nIt was a simple time.\n\n31:38.400 --> 31:39.400\nIt's going on.\n\n31:39.400 --> 31:40.400\nThis guy's butt.\n\n31:40.400 --> 31:41.400\nYeah.\n\n31:41.400 --> 31:43.400\nWell, is there anything before I know your time is precious?\n\n31:43.400 --> 31:44.400\nVery precious.\n\n31:44.400 --> 31:45.400\nYes.\n\n31:45.400 --> 31:49.400\nAnd is there anything uplifting you'd like to say?\n\n31:49.400 --> 31:50.400\nBefore you go?\n\n31:50.400 --> 31:54.400\nThe one, here's the one, and this is a truly uplifting thing I will try to leave you with.\n\n31:54.400 --> 31:59.400\nIf you do a successful tour as much of a, as soul grinding as it is, and as physically\n\n31:59.400 --> 32:03.400\nexhausting as it is, when you do a long tour and you come back to whatever your home city,\n\n32:03.400 --> 32:10.400\nespecially LA, your home city seems so manageable and tamable after being out there in this\n\n32:10.400 --> 32:12.400\ngigantic, crazy country.\n\n32:12.400 --> 32:15.400\nYou come back to LA and you're like, I can get anything done here.\n\n32:15.400 --> 32:17.400\nAnd successful is just defined by finishing it, right?\n\n32:17.400 --> 32:20.400\nNot by, not everything being, you know, successful.\n\n32:20.400 --> 32:21.400\nOh, no, no.\n\n32:21.400 --> 32:25.400\nI mean, the, the, I, I almost wish is like when I was a wedding DJ, we had this thing\n\n32:25.400 --> 32:28.400\nwhere, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n32:28.400 --> 32:29.400\nAll right.\n\n32:29.400 --> 32:30.400\nYou're a wedding DJ?\n\n32:30.400 --> 32:31.400\nI spoke, no, I, when I was.\n\n32:31.400 --> 32:32.400\nOh yeah.\n\n32:32.400 --> 32:33.400\nYou were.\n\n32:33.400 --> 32:34.400\nNot now.\n\n32:34.400 --> 32:38.400\nAlthough there's some cards on me feeling the crap.\n\n32:38.400 --> 32:43.400\nBut we had a thing where at a wedding, a successful, it was a sign of a successful marriage if\n\n32:43.400 --> 32:45.400\none thing went wrong at the wedding.\n\n32:45.400 --> 32:49.400\nSo a successful tour has got to have one night.\n\n32:49.400 --> 32:54.400\nIt's like a, like a, you know, like the Judas basically one night where everything fucking\n\n32:54.400 --> 32:56.400\ngoes wrong and you can then set everything else against.\n\n32:56.400 --> 32:57.400\nYeah.\n\n32:57.400 --> 32:58.400\nThat's what I figure.\n\n32:58.400 --> 33:00.400\nBut it could also be eight nights.\n\n33:00.400 --> 33:02.400\nThere's no reason for that.\n\n33:02.400 --> 33:06.400\nIf our bad night happens two nights in, that's, that's bad.\n\n33:06.400 --> 33:07.400\nYeah, exactly.\n\n33:07.400 --> 33:10.400\nBut you look if you're, you're guaranteed one good night with Austin.\n\n33:10.400 --> 33:11.400\nI'm telling you that right now.\n\n33:11.400 --> 33:16.400\nYeah, I've been to Austin, yeah, they seem like their hipsters are good kids because\n\n33:16.400 --> 33:21.400\nthey're, they're hipsters in a state that, that, that doesn't even respect America.\n\n33:21.400 --> 33:24.400\nNo, they're, I know they're, they're hipsters.\n\n33:24.400 --> 33:29.400\nThe hipsters in Austin are like that compound in the road warrior of the hippies.\n\n33:29.400 --> 33:32.400\nYou're like Mad Max pulling in with the gasoline.\n\n33:32.400 --> 33:33.400\nYeah.\n\n33:33.400 --> 33:36.400\nYou know, you want, you want letter Kona references?\n\n33:36.400 --> 33:37.400\nYou talk to me.\n\n33:37.400 --> 33:38.400\nLike it's that kind of.\n\n33:38.400 --> 33:41.400\nAll right, well, let's thank Pat and Oswald for coming by.\n\n33:41.400 --> 33:42.400\nThank you.\n\n33:42.400 --> 33:43.400\nThank you.\n\n33:43.400 --> 33:44.400\nThank you.\n\n33:44.400 --> 33:45.400\nThank you.\n\n33:45.400 --> 33:46.400\nThank you.\n\n33:46.400 --> 33:47.400\nThank you.\n\n33:47.400 --> 33:48.400\nThank you.\n\n33:48.400 --> 33:49.400\nThank you.\n\n33:49.400 --> 33:50.400\nThank you.\n\n33:50.400 --> 33:51.400\nThank you.\n\n33:51.400 --> 33:52.400\nThank you.\n\n33:52.400 --> 33:53.400\nThank you.\n\n33:53.400 --> 33:54.400\nThank you.\n\n33:54.400 --> 33:55.400\nThank you.\n\n33:55.400 --> 33:56.400\nThank you.\n\n33:56.400 --> 33:57.400\nThank you.\n\n33:57.400 --> 33:58.400\nYeah.\n\n33:58.400 --> 33:59.400\nOh.\n\n33:59.400 --> 34:00.400\nOh, I want a drink so bad.\n\n34:00.400 --> 34:02.400\nIs it, is the booze calling in?\n\n34:02.400 --> 34:03.400\nWell, yeah.\n\n34:03.400 --> 34:04.400\nBally high.\n\n34:04.400 --> 34:14.960\nThat was what I wanted, I guess. He gave us real information. He didn't just say,\n\n34:14.960 --> 34:20.520\ndon't take a shit in the bus. I can't remind you that enough by now.\n\n34:20.520 --> 34:27.080\nThat's good advice. I'm just saying, I expected more of that. Whenever you see a gas station,\n\n34:27.080 --> 34:32.000\nmake sure you buy some pants. Why? Because this is something you can't know until you're\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:36.360\non the road. You always need pants to make your antenna worker. It's just some weird\n\n34:36.360 --> 34:45.320\nshit. But he really put the scare on me. Are you nervous now? Yeah. But you know who\n\n34:45.320 --> 34:58.640\nelse was nervous? Jesus Christ. That sounds like a rap. This is rap number two called\n\n34:58.640 --> 35:06.720\nfreestyle. Freestyle? Yeah, we got to work out these rap. Yo, freestyle. Yo, rapping for\n\n35:06.720 --> 35:14.520\na while. Got a sober rap coming at your ass. I got Howard Hessmann at the head of the class.\n\n35:14.520 --> 35:23.280\nStock rhymes coming out all the time. Freestyle. Got a sober style. Got a freestyle. Got a sober\n\n35:23.280 --> 35:30.920\nrap. It's going badly. Your mom's named Hadley. It's a name. You can look it up. I saw your\n\n35:30.920 --> 35:39.040\nmama, I got a drink. I got to have a drink. I never told you not to drink. I never told\n\n35:39.040 --> 35:45.280\nyou not to drink. Are you going to do it? Be strong, dad. Be strong. It's like the price\n\n35:45.280 --> 35:56.480\nis right. And it's not fair if the people saying drink are louder because you're drunk.\n\n35:56.480 --> 36:01.680\nHow many, by cheering, how many of you out there wish you wouldn't drink to continue\n\n36:01.680 --> 36:17.120\nthe experiment? Okay, now how many people want to see Dan drink? That's a minority. Less\n\n36:17.120 --> 36:23.680\npeople but drunker and louder. You know what else is a minority? Black people. Rap about\n\n36:23.680 --> 36:34.720\nrace. Slow rap. Sexy slow. It's the first time you're hearing this. I feel the groove\n\n36:34.720 --> 36:46.320\nof her, man. Rap about race. Rap about race. Rap about the complications with the color\n\n36:46.320 --> 36:55.120\nof your face. Some people got dark skin. Some people got light. Some people purple. Some\n\n36:55.120 --> 37:04.800\npeople white. But we got to come together in a big spaceship. We got to come together\n\n37:04.800 --> 37:14.400\nin a big spaceship. Rap about race. I met an Indian man in China. He said my race couldn't\n\n37:14.400 --> 37:21.760\nlook finer. He took my hand and accepted me. We went up to the top of a coconut tree. He\n\n37:21.760 --> 37:30.560\nsaid, why don't you hold my body? I said, I'll hold your body. He said, I want you to\n\n37:30.560 --> 37:45.880\nhold me. I said, hold me. Rap about race. Rap about race. It's a rap about race. It's\n\n37:45.880 --> 37:53.520\na rap about race. I got a black friend. He's my shield. Got a black friend. I can feel\n\n37:53.520 --> 38:01.160\nhowever I want when I'm standing next to my black friend. I'm not racist, but blah, blah,\n\n38:01.160 --> 38:08.720\nblah. I can say that shit because I got my black friend chilling it on the sideline.\n\n38:08.720 --> 38:14.960\nWe go to get food. My black friend says, I think I'm in the mood for fried chicken and\n\n38:14.960 --> 38:28.240\nit's not racist because he's black. What? Sorry. There's a downside. I'm always terrified\n\n38:28.240 --> 38:37.560\nwhen he speaks up. The chicken's always right. Thank you, Enchi. That was a nice slow rap\n\n38:37.560 --> 38:48.720\nabout race. Also, if by rap you mean you sang the entire thing. That was nice. I think\n\n38:48.720 --> 38:55.560\nEric Idle's advice, now you're singing. That was like a cool Keith Sweat R&B kind of thing\n\n38:55.560 --> 39:03.200\ngoing on. Let's keep the fever pitch rolling. There's only one thing I knew I wanted to\n\n39:03.200 --> 39:09.520\ntalk about. It starts with the fact that my beautiful, perfect girlfriend, Erin McGathy,\n\n39:09.520 --> 39:16.800\nfor those of you who don't know, we always hate surprise parties. We've done them in\n\n39:16.800 --> 39:21.160\nthe past. Surprise parties seem like a very strange thing to have to do to people because\n\n39:21.160 --> 39:27.160\nthe fact that the party exists is the surprise. Then you spend the entire day tricking people\n\n39:27.160 --> 39:33.360\ninto thinking that no one's doing anything for them. Then their surprise is, oh, you\n\n39:33.360 --> 39:39.400\ndid. It just seems like it causes a lot of misery. We both agree. She's like, I'll never\n\n39:39.400 --> 39:42.800\nthrow you a surprise party, but could I do this thing for you that would be a surprise\n\n39:42.800 --> 39:49.520\nat your party? Can the nature of your party be a surprise for you? Yes, of course, darling.\n\n39:49.520 --> 39:54.240\nShe published a fucking book of all of my bullshit from the Internet, most of which\n\n39:54.240 --> 40:01.560\nis filled with me either talking about jerking off to other women or dating them and breaking\n\n40:01.560 --> 40:05.680\nup with them and having my heart broken. She's scouring all that stuff and picking the good\n\n40:05.680 --> 40:15.520\nstuff from the bad stuff. All of it is just me, a big narcissistic rant. There are girlfriends\n\n40:15.520 --> 40:21.360\nthat would justifiably go, I don't want to reward this. He needs to come down a couple\n\n40:21.360 --> 40:30.600\nof little notches. It's like that arm wrestling thing. You just go with the force. She's celebrating\n\n40:30.600 --> 40:36.040\nmy ego. For my birthday, I walked into my living room and she had gathered 60 of my\n\n40:36.040 --> 40:41.240\nfinest friends and they all did selected readings of this book that I didn't know I had written\n\n40:41.240 --> 40:46.200\nuntil that moment. Then they all had me sign it. It was like this narcissist's dream. It\n\n40:46.200 --> 40:47.720\nwas a perfect birthday party.\n\n40:47.720 --> 40:52.160\nI read through it and it's like when I saw it, I've read most of it because I've known\n\n40:52.160 --> 40:56.680\nyou a long time and I've read emails or blog entries or things like that. It's really\n\n40:56.680 --> 41:04.360\ncool to go back and there's a chronology of your mania and your life.\n\n41:04.360 --> 41:09.240\nRight. Here's the weird side effect of it. People are excited about it. There's Dan\n\n41:09.240 --> 41:15.720\nHarmon fans online. There's 900 copies of this thing. She's going to sell them during\n\n41:15.720 --> 41:22.480\na limited time. I have to try to find this. Can someone in the audience that has a phone\n\n41:22.480 --> 41:27.760\nthat I'll be able to read so that I'm not trying to multitask, bring up the, if you\n\n41:27.760 --> 41:37.040\ncan find it, the Onion AV Club article that is about the book. Is that enough information\n\n41:37.040 --> 41:42.920\nto find it? Whoever's got it first that can hand me their phone, bring it up and look\n\n41:42.920 --> 41:49.160\nat it. So Aaron texted me, the Onion AV Club, they posted an article about the book. It's\n\n41:49.160 --> 41:52.400\nlike getting, oh, wow, that's great. That's really great news. I went to look at it just\n\n41:52.400 --> 41:57.120\nto verify that that's the case. And then why do I always do this? Scroll down to the comment\n\n41:57.120 --> 42:08.800\nsection. No. No. I thought that I was impervious, but this is, it is brutal for me. But I also\n\n42:08.800 --> 42:14.400\nthink like my definition of stuff that hurts is so different from other people. What ratio\n\n42:14.400 --> 42:19.280\nof like 100, I felt like it was like to being praised. That was the other thing. It felt\n\n42:19.280 --> 42:23.120\nlike it was just like this unilateral fucking like who'd fuck this guy? What is he? Why does\n\n42:23.120 --> 42:31.200\nhe want me to buy his book and Sean, Sean has a phone for you, Dan. Oh, all right. I mean,\n\n42:31.200 --> 42:36.040\nyou could give yours to Jeff and he could maybe pick a couple tasty ones here. So, so they\n\n42:36.040 --> 42:41.680\ndo, I just want to like, all right, so I'm just going down to the comment section. Yeah,\n\n42:41.680 --> 42:51.920\nI just want to stop at the ones that really, really hurt me. Can I start with one? Okay,\n\n42:51.920 --> 42:58.200\ngo ahead. All proceeds will go toward getting Mr. Harmon a shower and a clean shirt. That's\n\n42:58.200 --> 43:06.680\nnot, that's, that's a fan. That's, that's, that's, yeah, no, the one underneath it and\n\n43:06.680 --> 43:11.400\nan autographed self taken photo of Dan Harmon crying lamenting why you couldn't just let\n\n43:11.400 --> 43:20.240\nhim be great. That hurts. Okay, I've gone through seven ones that were not so bad. Let's\n\n43:20.240 --> 43:27.560\nsee. Well, you know, then there's ones that are just like, I don't give a shit about the\n\n43:27.560 --> 43:31.680\ncollected online writing to Dan Harmon. That's fine. But why type that? What do you do? Do\n\n43:31.680 --> 43:38.960\nyou understand how the internet works? Like, what do you, why are you on this page? But\n\n43:38.960 --> 43:42.360\nthat, so that person says that and then that serves as a route for a bunch of people to\n\n43:42.360 --> 43:45.560\nchime in replying to that person, this person who doesn't give a shit about my collected\n\n43:45.560 --> 43:50.920\nonline writings. This person says, don't worry, Dan Harmon cares enough about the collective\n\n43:50.920 --> 43:56.400\nworks of Dan Harmon enough for all of us. By all of us, I mean, everyone who existed\n\n43:56.400 --> 44:00.440\nin the past, everyone currently alive and everyone who will ever enter this mortal coil.\n\n44:00.440 --> 44:05.960\nOh, by the way, that, that one hurts less after he says mortal coil. It's a nice try\n\n44:05.960 --> 44:11.000\nself styled Dan Harmon. Gee, I wonder where this is coming from.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:16.800\nWell, here's one that's all caps and it just, this one is pretty succinct. The collective\n\n44:16.800 --> 44:25.680\nonline writings of Dan Harmon sucks. Yeah, that doesn't. So Dan Harmon's next project\n\n44:25.680 --> 44:29.640\nwill be a delightfully quirky sitcom about a delightfully quirky group of six to eight\n\n44:29.640 --> 44:33.480\ndelightfully quirky friends who hang out in acting delightfully quirky send ups of various\n\n44:33.480 --> 44:37.720\nmovies and TV shows while yelling at everyone with an earshot that their vision is too beautiful\n\n44:37.720 --> 44:44.280\nand unique for this dark and savage world. So, so now our crime is wanting people to\n\n44:44.280 --> 44:52.520\nbe happy. And by ours, I mean mine, but it's like, I just, let's see.\n\n44:52.520 --> 44:59.160\nWhile you look, Dan, I got this note. This is good stuff. There is an orange scion blocking\n\n44:59.160 --> 45:04.640\nsomeone that needs to move right now behind the store. The end. An orange scion. This\n\n45:04.640 --> 45:09.680\nis a cry that looks like a roller skate. I'll probably stop with this one because this one\n\n45:09.680 --> 45:17.800\nis Dan, may I share one? Jesus Christ. The ghost of Christmas presents.\n\n45:17.800 --> 45:22.720\nAdam Goldberg. I'm Jewish. I don't get Christmas presents.\n\n45:22.720 --> 45:30.280\nDid you just like materialize there? I was here for at least 50, 53 seconds.\n\n45:30.280 --> 45:38.520\nMy angst floated off of me and the cloud formed into, all right, what were you going to?\n\n45:38.520 --> 45:43.880\nThis is a bunch of stuff. Sue's chef shares that maybe he's morphing into Skud and Jim\n\n45:43.880 --> 45:50.480\nTraficant responds seriously. Dot, dot, dot. Those Orson Wells level bags in that drawing.\n\n45:50.480 --> 45:54.360\nMaybe he had Harmon sit for the drawing after a week long bender of shame as comedy writers\n\n45:54.360 --> 45:57.800\nare prone to. Well, it doesn't mean that they know their stuff.\n\n45:57.800 --> 46:00.520\nThat's just calling me a comedy writer and saying that I'm dedicated to my work.\n\n46:00.520 --> 46:04.440\nBut then someone says, that's why my best friend drew, drew baggy eyes on me. He knew\n\n46:04.440 --> 46:09.320\nthat I'd be flattered by it. I like, I like, I like being a fucking slob and a maniac.\n\n46:09.320 --> 46:15.440\nWhat I don't like is people implying that I think that they should like me. That that's\n\n46:15.440 --> 46:19.080\nwhat gets me. That's the weird thing I wanted to talk about that I discovered rereading\n\n46:19.080 --> 46:24.120\nthrough this is like, my soft spot is, is pretense. Like, like, if you want to know\n\n46:24.120 --> 46:29.600\nhow to really hurt me, it's like the idea that I think that I'm special because I don't,\n\n46:29.600 --> 46:33.320\nand I think it's because of my brother. I think it's growing up under my brother, who\n\n46:33.320 --> 46:38.360\nwas, who no longer listens to the podcast, hopefully, and if he does fuck him, because\n\n46:38.360 --> 46:41.360\nhe got really mad about me telling stories about him that were pretty, pretty bad.\n\n46:41.360 --> 46:42.360\nGlad to help with that, by the way. He was a dick.\n\n46:42.360 --> 46:43.360\nOh, Jesus Christ.\n\n46:43.360 --> 46:55.720\nPeople were mean to you on the internet because you're not me. If you go to Harmontown.com,\n\n46:55.720 --> 47:00.360\nwhich you should all do at this show, it's unanimous that I am the hero. Everyone's like,\n\n47:00.360 --> 47:08.800\nI love Goldberg. He's scrappy, and Dan is mean. What the fuck is going on?\n\n47:08.800 --> 47:12.880\nHe's rounded the bend in the hamburger territory. It's like, he's, he's embracing his role\n\n47:12.880 --> 47:20.560\nas a, as a, as our product spokes villain. I want Harmontown. Rubble, rubble. No, get\n\n47:20.560 --> 47:24.720\naway from there, Goldberg. No, I love it.\n\n47:24.720 --> 47:30.800\nHarmontown is for humans, silly Goldberg. It's like at a ski show, like, like, look\n\n47:30.800 --> 47:34.240\nout, Cindy. Goldberg's behind you.\n\n47:34.240 --> 47:40.240\nWell, I thought it's more like I dress up every week like Barney Rubble and try and\n\n47:40.240 --> 47:43.720\nsteal the fruity pebbles of your self-respect.\n\n47:43.720 --> 47:44.720\nYes.\n\n47:44.720 --> 47:45.720\nPrecisely.\n\n47:45.720 --> 47:48.720\nThat's another, yes, that's another example.\n\n47:48.720 --> 47:49.720\nAll right. Adam.\n\n47:49.720 --> 47:50.720\nAdam.\n\n47:50.720 --> 47:51.720\nAdam.\n\n47:51.720 --> 47:52.720\nAdam.\n\n47:52.720 --> 47:53.720\nI'm going to wrap it up. I'm going to wrap it up.\n\n47:53.720 --> 47:54.720\nSorry.\n\n47:54.720 --> 47:55.720\nAdam.\n\n47:55.720 --> 47:56.720\nAdam.\n\n47:56.720 --> 47:57.720\nI'm going to wrap it up.\n\n47:57.720 --> 48:00.720\nShut the fuck up, Adam. I don't care what you're holding. I don't care what's in your\n\n48:00.720 --> 48:05.360\nhands. I fucking, I'm going to control you right now. You're either rapping or you're\n\n48:05.360 --> 48:06.360\ngetting off the stage.\n\n48:06.360 --> 48:07.360\nGive me beat number one.\n\n48:07.360 --> 48:08.360\nAll right.\n\n48:08.360 --> 48:09.360\nBeat number one.\n\n48:09.360 --> 48:22.120\nI'm going to wrap it up. Goldberg style. You're going to take a while. Dan, thanks\n\n48:22.120 --> 48:26.720\nfor the podcast. I've had a lot of fun with the people that I just chant, rap about and\n\n48:26.720 --> 48:27.720\nI'll say this.\n\n48:27.720 --> 48:29.800\nAdam Goldberg everybody let's hear it for him. Wasn't it great?\n\n48:29.800 --> 48:30.800\nI brought you a board game.\n\n48:30.800 --> 48:31.800\nWhere's the name for it?\n\n48:31.800 --> 48:32.800\nNo.\n\n48:32.800 --> 48:33.800\nThat's here at the bar.\n\n48:33.800 --> 48:34.800\nGuest Department Town, stay at the studio.\n\n48:34.800 --> 48:35.800\nYeah.\n\n48:35.800 --> 48:36.800\nAnd I brought Eric at my party.\n\n48:36.800 --> 48:37.800\nStudio City, Marriott.\n\n48:37.800 --> 48:38.800\nOh.\n\n48:38.800 --> 48:40.800\nI got a card for Eric. I don't think that's going to be a good fit.\n\n48:40.800 --> 48:41.800\nAll right.\n\n48:41.800 --> 48:47.280\nAdam Goldberg's clothing by Bill Chang. one more time for Adam Goldberg everybody.\n\n48:47.280 --> 48:50.280\nAll right.\n\n48:50.280 --> 48:51.780\nI just wanted to read.\n\n48:51.780 --> 48:54.340\nI kind of got derailed.\n\n48:54.340 --> 48:55.180\nYou don't say.\n\n48:55.180 --> 48:57.340\nYou don't fucking say.\n\n48:57.340 --> 49:01.460\nIt's just me and Adam becoming more and more terrifying.\n\n49:01.460 --> 49:04.340\nNow I'm worried for my own safety.\n\n49:04.340 --> 49:07.820\nYeah, it's he.\n\n49:07.820 --> 49:09.700\nThe last thing I see before I die is going to be,\n\n49:09.700 --> 49:10.420\nI'm going to wake up.\n\n49:10.420 --> 49:12.340\nIt's going to be him with a butcher knife.\n\n49:12.340 --> 49:14.300\nWell, you just saw how easy it was.\n\n49:14.300 --> 49:15.300\nThere was a.\n\n49:15.300 --> 49:16.980\nHe just was like, poof, he's there.\n\n49:16.980 --> 49:18.420\nThere was an ending of a law and order\n\n49:18.420 --> 49:21.060\nwhere they went toe to toe with this really vicious prison\n\n49:21.060 --> 49:24.060\ngang and they put the, you know, everyone was really\n\n49:24.060 --> 49:26.580\nintimidated by them jurors and stuff like that.\n\n49:26.580 --> 49:28.700\nBut they pursued the case and they won for justice.\n\n49:28.700 --> 49:30.620\nAnd then the epilogue of the law and order episode is\n\n49:30.620 --> 49:33.300\nthey're on the streets in New York and the ADA is walking\n\n49:33.300 --> 49:34.100\nand getting a hot dog.\n\n49:34.100 --> 49:36.500\nAnd some guy in tattoos comes up next to her and goes,\n\n49:36.500 --> 49:38.020\nexcuse me, are you so-and-so?\n\n49:38.020 --> 49:38.660\nAnd she goes, yeah.\n\n49:38.660 --> 49:42.100\nAnd he goes, you can tell your boss we were this close.\n\n49:42.100 --> 49:43.220\nAnd he walks away.\n\n49:43.220 --> 49:46.380\nAnd then he just leaves on her going, poof, poof, poof.\n\n49:46.380 --> 49:49.100\nAnd that's kind of, Goldberg was that close.\n\n49:49.100 --> 49:50.940\nAnd I didn't know.\n\n49:50.940 --> 49:54.300\nLike, like, like, there will be no warning.\n\n49:54.300 --> 49:55.340\nHe'll be in your back seat.\n\n49:55.340 --> 49:57.180\nDoes he have the thing like the little, little taxi\n\n49:57.180 --> 49:59.620\ndriver gun thing, little, like, poof, poof, poof, poof?\n\n49:59.620 --> 49:59.940\nI don't know.\n\n49:59.940 --> 50:02.620\nI feel like he'll be more like an ex-files, like a\n\n50:02.620 --> 50:06.700\nbiological weapon, like, like, turn out that he's, one of\n\n50:06.700 --> 50:08.700\nhis hands is a lizard hand or something.\n\n50:08.700 --> 50:13.700\nDo you think it's time to bring up Spencer?\n\n50:13.700 --> 50:15.700\nYes, I just wanted to read this one last thing.\n\n50:15.700 --> 50:17.100\nBut now that I got all interrupted, it feels like,\n\n50:17.100 --> 50:19.820\noh, then Dan, Dan spent this episode dwelling on\n\n50:19.820 --> 50:20.740\ncomment sections.\n\n50:20.740 --> 50:22.620\nI just wanted it to be one of your things, but I wanted to\n\n50:22.620 --> 50:25.060\nclose with this one.\n\n50:25.060 --> 50:27.460\nI don't know whether this one hurts or not, but it\n\n50:27.460 --> 50:29.260\ndefinitely affects me.\n\n50:33.580 --> 50:35.540\nCollected works, Herman Sachs, blah, blah, blah, that\n\n50:35.540 --> 50:36.300\npeople are responding.\n\n50:36.300 --> 50:39.180\nAnd then a guy says, yeah, I've gone from loving him and\n\n50:39.180 --> 50:42.060\ncommunity to hating him and loving community.\n\n50:42.060 --> 50:43.060\nThat's really sad.\n\n50:43.060 --> 50:44.540\nAll right.\n\n50:44.540 --> 50:44.980\nI don't know why.\n\n50:44.980 --> 50:45.860\nNow I read that out loud.\n\n50:45.860 --> 50:47.620\nIt seems like that's what I wanted.\n\n50:47.620 --> 50:49.580\nAnd, well, you got it.\n\n50:49.580 --> 50:51.460\nYeah.\n\n50:51.460 --> 50:52.500\nIt's not really what I wanted.\n\n50:52.500 --> 50:54.780\nI wanted to explore it because you guys are my therapist.\n\n50:54.780 --> 50:55.180\nThat's all.\n\n50:55.180 --> 50:56.900\nI just wanted to say it out loud.\n\n50:56.900 --> 50:59.260\nAnd it kind of hit me in the solar plexus, like reading\n\n50:59.260 --> 51:01.380\nthose comments, and I was texting Aaron about it.\n\n51:01.380 --> 51:03.100\nAnd I was like, what the fuck is going on?\n\n51:03.100 --> 51:05.180\nWhy am I so affected by this?\n\n51:05.180 --> 51:09.540\nI'm so shielded in places where everybody usually kicks.\n\n51:09.540 --> 51:12.420\nAnd then this weird shit gets me.\n\n51:12.420 --> 51:14.740\nAnd it has something to do with, I think I had an\n\n51:14.740 --> 51:16.420\nepiphany in my car sorting through it.\n\n51:16.420 --> 51:18.860\nIt has something to do with needing other people's\n\n51:18.860 --> 51:20.660\napproval, which is a didoi.\n\n51:20.660 --> 51:24.300\nBut I'm 40 years old.\n\n51:24.300 --> 51:31.340\nI am allowed to now become a dispenser of happiness.\n\n51:31.340 --> 51:36.220\nI can't expect to get it fed to me like a baby bird anymore.\n\n51:36.220 --> 51:39.300\nEmotionally, you have to grow up a little bit.\n\n51:39.300 --> 51:41.500\nI can still be insecure and express my anxieties and\n\n51:41.500 --> 51:41.700\nstuff.\n\n51:41.700 --> 51:44.660\nBut there is, you know, the people that write that shit,\n\n51:44.660 --> 51:47.420\nthey don't expect my dumb fat ass to be like scrolling\n\n51:47.420 --> 51:50.660\nthrough it, and they go, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.\n\n51:50.660 --> 51:52.940\nThey wouldn't really want to have an impact on a human being.\n\n51:52.940 --> 51:56.420\nThey're just screaming at the sky, notice me.\n\n51:56.420 --> 51:59.380\nNo one in particular.\n\n51:59.380 --> 52:00.300\nThey're talking to themselves.\n\n52:00.300 --> 52:00.860\nI disagree.\n\n52:00.860 --> 52:02.220\nI think they actually do think.\n\n52:02.220 --> 52:03.140\nI think not all of us.\n\n52:03.140 --> 52:04.180\nAdam always does this shit.\n\n52:04.180 --> 52:05.100\nHe hands you shit.\n\n52:05.100 --> 52:07.660\nAnd then he's a plate of cookies last night.\n\n52:07.660 --> 52:08.380\nIt's a gift, too.\n\n52:08.380 --> 52:09.260\nGive me a board game.\n\n52:09.260 --> 52:10.540\nI put a hazmat suit on.\n\n52:10.540 --> 52:12.540\nThat's anthrax all the way.\n\n52:12.540 --> 52:14.140\nWho's was this?\n\n52:14.140 --> 52:14.700\nOver here.\n\n52:14.700 --> 52:15.820\nThis is Sean's, right?\n\n52:15.820 --> 52:16.820\nThank you, Sean.\n\n52:16.820 --> 52:20.740\nOh, Sean, his own built-in reminder.\n\n52:20.740 --> 52:22.420\nI had written it down, but I might have forgotten.\n\n52:22.420 --> 52:24.940\nSean, thank you for your wonderful birthday gift.\n\n52:24.940 --> 52:26.540\nI'm assuming it was our New Year's gift.\n\n52:26.540 --> 52:29.180\nMaybe a Christmas gift.\n\n52:29.180 --> 52:31.340\nThe podcast got pretty boring.\n\n52:31.340 --> 52:34.540\nWhen Dan started counting the number of ways something\n\n52:34.540 --> 52:37.780\ncould be a gift, that's when I checked out,\n\n52:37.780 --> 52:40.580\nsaid the 380th person crammed in the back corner.\n\n52:40.580 --> 52:45.180\nI'd say it's time to kick the show into overdrive.\n\n52:45.180 --> 52:46.980\nYou have other thoughts, apparently.\n\n52:46.980 --> 52:47.460\nNo, no, no.\n\n52:47.460 --> 52:48.460\nYou mean Spencer Drive?\n\n52:48.460 --> 52:48.980\nYeah, Spencer Drive.\n\n52:48.980 --> 52:50.180\nYeah, let's do it.\n\n52:50.180 --> 52:51.580\nAnybody know a guy named Spencer?\n\n52:51.580 --> 52:52.620\nHe's our Dungeon Master.\n\n53:00.620 --> 53:03.660\nSpencer, you have a new musical theme.\n\n53:03.660 --> 53:05.660\nIs that what this is?\n\n53:05.660 --> 53:09.260\nThis is the new Spencer theme.\n\n53:09.260 --> 53:12.100\nWe have our own legally clearable Spencer theme.\n\n53:12.100 --> 53:15.660\nThis is called Spencer Intro.\n\n53:15.660 --> 53:17.420\nAll right, Spencer is our Dungeon Master.\n\n53:17.420 --> 53:19.380\nThose of you just tuning in, we love and adore him.\n\n53:19.380 --> 53:21.060\nWe found him out of our own audience.\n\n53:21.060 --> 53:24.780\nAnd Spencer is going to take off.\n\n53:24.780 --> 53:26.220\nActually, it occurs to me, Spencer.\n\n53:26.220 --> 53:27.140\nI know nothing about you.\n\n53:27.140 --> 53:28.740\nAre you going to leave a job behind\n\n53:28.740 --> 53:30.300\nwhile you come on tour with us?\n\n53:30.300 --> 53:33.180\nYeah, I work at an Apple store near my house.\n\n53:33.180 --> 53:34.500\nAnd I work in the back.\n\n53:34.500 --> 53:36.580\nI count boxes.\n\n53:36.580 --> 53:39.460\nIt's fun.\n\n53:39.460 --> 53:41.460\nSo you got a furlough.\n\n53:41.460 --> 53:43.580\nYou get to come on leave with Harmontown.\n\n53:43.580 --> 53:45.660\nAnd he's going to be on the tour bus with us,\n\n53:45.660 --> 53:49.820\nDungeon Mastering, every dungeon that we try to enter.\n\n53:54.700 --> 53:57.820\nDid any of that Pat Northwalt horror stories in Phoenix?\n\n53:57.820 --> 53:58.820\nWere you at all, Spencer?\n\n53:58.820 --> 54:00.180\nDo you feel like?\n\n54:00.180 --> 54:03.740\nI don't want to die in a jackknife.\n\n54:03.740 --> 54:04.900\nYeah, that's always my thing.\n\n54:09.900 --> 54:10.980\nBig tour bus accident.\n\n54:10.980 --> 54:12.300\nThat's pretty ignominious.\n\n54:12.300 --> 54:13.660\nIt's no good.\n\n54:13.660 --> 54:15.620\nAll right.\n\n54:15.620 --> 54:16.700\nI leveled up, you guys.\n\n54:16.700 --> 54:18.020\nI got new gadgets and stuff.\n\n54:18.020 --> 54:18.820\nBear with me.\n\n54:18.820 --> 54:19.540\nOh, you go.\n\n54:19.540 --> 54:20.820\nAll right, Dungeon Master leveled up.\n\n54:20.820 --> 54:21.940\nSo you got a new iPad.\n\n54:21.940 --> 54:26.260\nDid you find that in the back room of the store, especially?\n\n54:26.260 --> 54:29.580\nYeah, I mean, we just sometimes we count less.\n\n54:35.780 --> 54:37.940\nDid you guys write that?\n\n54:37.940 --> 54:40.180\nOh, yeah, Spencer and I hang out all the time.\n\n54:40.180 --> 54:42.380\nWe were riding bikes the other day.\n\n54:42.380 --> 54:45.300\nSo Spencer, I hear something funny\n\n54:45.300 --> 54:47.820\nhappening to Trader Joe's yesterday.\n\n54:47.820 --> 54:48.580\nOh, yeah.\n\n54:48.580 --> 54:52.340\nYou know me and traders.\n\n54:52.340 --> 54:53.140\nThat wouldn't work.\n\n54:53.140 --> 54:54.620\nWe've got to work on that one.\n\n54:54.620 --> 54:56.140\nThe workshop on that one.\n\n54:56.140 --> 54:59.300\nSpeaking of workshops, we should bring up an improviser\n\n54:59.300 --> 55:00.980\nto help us play Dungeon Dragons.\n\n55:00.980 --> 55:03.660\nWe decided that the cavalcade of stars\n\n55:03.660 --> 55:04.780\nwasn't quite complete yet.\n\n55:04.780 --> 55:06.980\nWe're going to bring up somebody who's never played D&D before.\n\n55:06.980 --> 55:08.060\nHe's going to fill in.\n\n55:08.060 --> 55:11.340\nAnd maybe in some guest star role that Spencer has created,\n\n55:11.340 --> 55:14.460\nthis person knows nothing of D&D, has never, ever played it.\n\n55:14.460 --> 55:39.260\nBut maybe you know him, television's Ryan Stiles.\n\n55:39.260 --> 55:41.220\nI have to sit down because I've had so much\n\n55:41.220 --> 55:44.500\nof this sweet, sweet liquor tea.\n\n55:44.500 --> 55:45.300\nI think it's very nice.\n\n55:45.300 --> 55:47.140\nYou quit drinking because of your girlfriend?\n\n55:47.140 --> 55:48.860\nWell, no, I've quit, yeah.\n\n55:48.860 --> 55:50.460\nSo sweet.\n\n55:50.460 --> 55:53.860\nI give it a month.\n\n55:53.860 --> 55:56.180\nIt's very odd that you stopped drinking because of her,\n\n55:56.180 --> 55:58.020\nand yet I'm backstage doing lines off her tits.\n\n55:58.020 --> 56:00.020\nOh, my God.\n\n56:00.020 --> 56:02.660\nThat's so weird.\n\n56:02.660 --> 56:03.780\nIt's better you don't know.\n\n56:03.780 --> 56:06.220\nI think they were her tits.\n\n56:06.220 --> 56:06.940\nHi, how are you?\n\n56:06.940 --> 56:08.060\nYou think they were her tits?\n\n56:08.060 --> 56:17.820\nAre you, uh, are you, uh, I hope so.\n\n56:17.820 --> 56:18.380\nGo on, Ryan.\n\n56:18.380 --> 56:21.060\nOtherwise, they're two perfectly four moles together.\n\n56:21.060 --> 56:21.540\nI'm good.\n\n56:21.540 --> 56:23.740\nAre you going on tour with Jeff?\n\n56:23.740 --> 56:25.060\nHave you toured with Jeff before?\n\n56:25.060 --> 56:25.540\nNo.\n\n56:25.540 --> 56:27.420\nSee, I've toured with Jeff for a number of years.\n\n56:27.420 --> 56:28.580\nOh, do you have any?\n\n56:28.580 --> 56:29.940\nAre you on a bus?\n\n56:29.940 --> 56:30.420\nYes.\n\n56:30.420 --> 56:34.060\nYou're in for two or three hours a day of retarded Elvis.\n\n56:34.060 --> 56:36.260\nJeff, do a little retarded Elvis.\n\n56:36.260 --> 56:37.980\nI have a couple of stock

56:46.620\nNo more.\n\n56:46.620 --> 56:47.460\nDo more, though.\n\n56:47.460 --> 56:48.700\nDo more of it.\n\n56:48.700 --> 56:53.460\nI don't want to be a retarded man.\n\n56:53.460 --> 56:54.660\nThree hours.\n\n56:54.660 --> 56:55.160\nIt's off.\n\n56:55.160 --> 56:57.420\nThree hours.\n\n56:57.420 --> 56:58.980\nDan, the thing is, if it's.\n\n56:58.980 --> 57:00.700\nAnd I mean,

tonight.\n\n57:05.580 --> 57:06.580\nYes.\n\n57:06.580 --> 57:07.080\nThank you.\n\n57:07.080 --> 57:12.080\nRetired Elvis isn't funny for the first hour. No. No, you have to keep a second hour great\n\n57:12.080 --> 57:16.480\nYeah, yeah third hour that goes into a bit of a trough. Yeah, but it's gonna be fun for you\n\n57:17.400 --> 57:19.400\nYour girlfriend staying here. She's going with you\n\n57:20.280 --> 57:26.040\nShe's coming with she is so you're not drinking the entire tour then. Oh, I thought you were asking cuz you want to do more co-coffer\n\n57:26.040 --> 57:28.040\nNo, no, no\n\n57:28.200 --> 57:33.620\nNo, no, she's not she's not sober.

Notice you guys get papers\n\n01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.080\nYou have this one here\n\n01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:27.080\nOh fuck this is an improv I've had this thing for four months. I have no idea what's a fantasy football here or something. I\n\n01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:34.040\nAlways kind of stare at it that I never like the information never makes it all the way into my brain\n\n01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.080\nThere's other things going on. All right, so Spencer.

Uh-huh, and now you're hearing an unapproaching wagon. All right\n\n01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.520\nSo I look at what the wagon is\n\n01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.200\nYou look to the although I have my guesses I think it's a wagon\n\n01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.560\nYou're not sure why a caravan would come here of all places the ruins of a newly destroyed Noel encampment\n\n01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.260\nYou hear the gruff gravelly voice from inside a cart call out\n\n01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:04.380\nWelcome to all who off's wonder wagon the cart screeches to a halt about 15 feet away from you\n\n01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:12.580\nAnd it's wooden panels collapse outwards revealing an equally questionable decorated storefront\n\n01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:22.420\nYou see food crafts supplies materials leather goods cure tools clothing weapons jewels in all manner of assorted knickknacks and curios\n\n01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.300\nAnd before you stands\n\n01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:30.420\nPresumably Olaf a halfling with a large turban and an orange mustache\n\n01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.740\nThat's you.

Yes. Well, I'm not giving him to you. I'm showing him to you. What are they shards of?\n\n01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:07.500\nSomething some force of power. I don't really know what are the shards of Spencer the shards\n\n01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:12.740\nOlaf doesn't know much about the shards, but he knows their value is beyond compare\n\n01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:18.700\nHe would offer to buy them although he knows there's no price that you'd willingly take for such a valuable artifact\n\n01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:22.140\nI will buy those for me\n\n01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.940\nName your price I\n\n01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.900\nDon't think I don't think there's any price for which we'd part with them\n\n01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.500\nBut there has to be a reason that this this man has come across our path\n\n01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:36.860\nI believe that everything is fated to be sharpie Jesus. All right, I mean\n\n01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:45.020\nAll right, well, I mean I I mean come up with a price you're gonna get caught with a shitload of shards that you can't get rid of\n\n01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.020\nI\n\n01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:53.820\nSpencer how many shards do we need to have a full set? You don't know there's no way of knowing we have two and Sharpie's dad\n\n01:10:54.100 --> 01:11:00.140\nMango as one in his stomach right now. Yeah, and a few I think can we can we follow a mango around until he poops and go through\n\n01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.540\nIt and find one of them. You could potentially do that. He's standing in the foreground. Oh\n\n01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.620\nHi, you're going to need a portable hole for that\n\n01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:19.980\nWhat's the portable hole portable holes are these these fabric circles so like if you took this and cut it into a circle like a\n\n01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.860\nCircle of fabric you throw it on the ground and it becomes a real hole like a 10-foot pit or something\n\n01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.220\nSo you could hide in yeah, and then you could pick it up\n\n01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.740\nSo you could you know drop your friend down there and pick it up and take him and put him in a wall\n\n01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:34.540\nI'm like fall and how tall is Olaf Olaf would be about four four feet tall\n\n01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:39.900\nI thought Olaf was big Olaf is a halfling halflings are very small. Oh, so two halflings is worth\n\n01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:45.220\nDepends on where you're an exchange rate two minutes two men and a halfling\n\n01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:54.380\nHow much for the portable hole it says it really it's 50 the 50 go what gold pieces what is it the $40 same as downtown\n\n01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:59.700\nYet I will take one shard of glass for your whole portable hole. I don't I want to give I don't know\n\n01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:04.140\nYeah, we got with the shards we got to hang on to the shards man. What are so important about these shards?\n\n01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.660\nWe don't know\n\n01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:12.740\nAnd yet you want to hang on to them. Yes. Yeah, I mean why do you want them so bad? I haven't any in my wagon\n\n01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:19.220\nWhat if someone else would ask me for a shard and I had no shards and yet I have an overstock of portable holes\n\n01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:28.420\nShould we take this guy Olaf he has this great inventory of such we take him along with us down the road in case we need something or\n\n01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:33.220\nIs there something Spencer that we need to get off of Olaf here?
