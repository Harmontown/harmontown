{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.560\nAlright, that was chosen at random. Ladies and gentlemen, buckle your holy shit belts.\n\n00:15.560 --> 00:22.600\nFrom the Nerdmelt Theater in Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session!\n\n00:22.600 --> 00:37.040\nFrom the deepest darkest mists of my imagination, and all the concentration I can conjure, is\n\n00:37.040 --> 00:53.200\nthere a Spencer Crittenden among us? Spencer Crittenden to the stage!\n\n00:53.200 --> 00:58.000\nYou got your shorts back on. Oh yeah. I heard about your pants last week and I was alarmed.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:07.000\nOh, everyone was. Everyone was. How you doing, Spencer? I'm so good. That means he's high!\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:12.000\nLadies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:33.000\nBeat, beat to the street, street, everyone two feet, two feet, walk two feet, walk on the street, to the beat.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:48.000\nWhoa, hey, beat to the street, two feet, what the fuck, what the fuck, two feet, beat to the street.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nStreet meat, the king of the street, you see him walking two feet from across the street.\n\n01:53.000 --> 02:07.000\nStreet feet is a lesson too, because you can't let the two feet beat you.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:16.000\nOkay, sorry about that. I didn't know that. I didn't know we had beef.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:23.000\nDan, our fucking street beef has gone on for two lives. Street beef, the beef.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:28.000\nYou see him rocking that? Black on the street to the beef. I mean, don't let the beef street you.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:35.000\nDan, as the mayor, you walked out and you said, keep that beat going, keep that beat going.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:42.000\nThere was only 30 seconds left of that beat. So your solution was to hit the pedal to the middle.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:49.000\nDo you want to go back to that beat? No, no, give me a different beat.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:54.000\nYou sure? Yeah. Give me a good one. A slow one.\n\n02:54.000 --> 03:04.000\nYeah, same beat. Yeah, same beat. Same beat. Yeah, same beat.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:10.000\nCulture, Christmas, street rhythm.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:16.000\nThat's not part of the rap. You have one minute 40 left.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nYou want to start from the top? Ignoring that. No, ignoring that.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nTwo minutes. Yeah.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:30.000\nStreet beef, street. Street beef, street beef, street beef.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nEvery street has a beat to it's street. Every street has one or two feet.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:41.000\nEvery street walks along its own street. It seems like a contradiction.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:45.000\nHow can you walk on yourself? The answer is, oh shit. Street beef, yeah.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:51.000\nYou got to ask yourself, how can you walk on yourself, on yourself? Street beef, street beef.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\nI'm the street beef. My name is street beef. I'm a street beef.\n\n03:55.000 --> 04:00.000\nProfessor street beats go into the beats. I got one, two left, right, right.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:05.000\nI went down to the street today and I saw your mama and I said, hey,\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:10.000\nand she said, do you want a newspaper? And I said, no, because of the internet.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nOkay. All right. That's good.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:16.000\nYou have a minute and five left. You have a minute and five left.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nOkay, okay, okay. What else is going on? Dick Cheney?\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.000\nI heard Dick Cheney. One minute. Yo.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:25.000\nDick Cheney. Iraq War or Dick Cheney? Dick Cheney.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:30.000\nAnd Plummer and Reggae. Okay. 54 seconds.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:36.000\nI saw Dick Cheney just the other day. He was fighting in an Iraq war in his usual way.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:41.000\nHe was trying to flim the toilet and ISIS came and whoa.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\n40 seconds. All right. 4chan. Did you say 4chan?\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:49.000\n40 seconds. I thought he said 4chan.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:55.000\nAll right. Yo, yo, yo, yo. Okay. Two minutes. You have two minutes.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nTwo minutes. He's like an aerobics instructor.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:03.000\nYou and the lady in the front row with the yellow hat on.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nThat's Heather. That's our friend. Hello, Heather.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nHeather. Good to see you.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:15.000\nHeather, name or say a word that starts with the first letter of Dan's name.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:22.000\nDuck. Okay. Yo, yo, okay. Two minutes. Two minutes.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:27.000\nYo, yo, duck. Make it all about ducks. No tangents. Just ducks.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:32.000\nYo, yo, one, two, rap, go.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nWeb feet on the pond swimming around.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nA woman, a fond of, is over on the other shore.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:44.000\nI'm going to go over to her and say, hey, you want more of my duck penis?\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:51.000\nShe's like, no. And then we're into a whole thing.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:59.000\nBut migraton, migraton. Duck leader flies through the sky.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:04.000\nIt's time to fly south and we don't know why, because our brains are the size of peas,\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:09.000\nbut they're developed over six million years and we've got magnets in our ears.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:18.000\nAnd that's like a mix of fly and like a truly intricate like patterns that even humans marvel at.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:21.000\nYo.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nYeah, I think rhyming is overrated.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:35.000\nYeah. All right. Thank you everybody. Jeff Davis.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:40.000\nI was here to help the fucking set you up to fucking blow people's mind.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nYou see, Dan, people only pay $5 to watch you make that face.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:47.000\nMost people listen for free and they don't know that you're making a face.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:51.000\nNo, you did a great job. You're a really good friend.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:57.000\nFor your listening, he's giving two thumbs up.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nWait, he just gave three thumbs up?\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:05.000\nOne's his dick.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nObviously, tonight's one of those nights when we're all a little, probably a little drunk.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nI'm fucking sober as a judge.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:17.000\nAll right. I'll be the noble one and admit that I got a little drunk today.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nYeah. Thank you, kid. Thank you.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:26.000\nYou really think it's so glamorous and then I'll see you in fucking hell.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:31.000\nHere's what I got. Everything's about fucking porn and stuff on my notes.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:35.000\nWhen you say it's about fucking porn, is it just porn on your notes?\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nI don't know. It's just all about dicks and balls and stuff.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nOr those things relating to it.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:45.000\nLike last week, we had the young lady come up and she tried to explain Tinder to me and Rob.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nAnd I was talking about it because I was like, still, oh, she didn't...\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:55.000\nShe tried to explain Tinder and she did say, I think the most interesting thing that she said\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nwas because I'll never understand Tinder.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nI haven't installed it and used it, but I thought...\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:08.000\nI was thinking and I wrote it down and the most important thing was that Tinder was an offshoot of Grindr,\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:15.000\nwhich Grindr was like gay dudes going like, who wants to fuck a butt or suck a nut?\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nOr it doesn't have to rhyme when you're gay.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nOkay. We're going to play it.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:26.000\nYo. Yo. Yo. Grindr. MC Grindr.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:30.000\nI'm equal to everyone and you've chased me to the shadows.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:34.000\nYou get what you deserve. Yo. Yo.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:38.000\nMy IQ is 200. I have a bowel disposable income.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nI'm a good person. I deserve to have the right to be married.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nAnd you underestimate me? Fuck you.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:50.000\nMC Grindr. Fucking butts. MC Grindr. Licking nuts.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:54.000\nMC Grindr. What is butts? MC Grindr.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nOh!\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nOkay. All right.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nThat's a... I'm a big fan of the gay people.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:07.000\nI'll tell you, meltdown audience, we haven't heard the last of MC Grindr tonight.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:12.000\nHe will certainly be repriezed at some point.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:18.000\nThere will be gay MCs emailing in going like, that's not fair.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:22.000\nYou're making me seem like being gay makes you a bad rapper.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:26.000\nI say to all... I say to all of our gay MC listeners out there,\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nI challenge you to come down to Meltdown Comics.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nThat would be amazing.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nJust have a gay MC Grindr rep off.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:38.000\nIf you're a gay MC, well, obviously you should just come down no matter what.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nI don't want to pit them against each other.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nNo, no. Them against you.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nIt's you.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nIs there a way I could just be a bad guy?\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nCould I just be like cis rapper?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:53.000\nLike straight heteronormative rapper?\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nMC heteronormative.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nYo, everyone should fit in a dichotomy.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nYo, yo, your pleasure needs a lobotomy.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:05.000\nYo, I'm the mainstream Jim Belushi.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nI'm fat, 45-year-old, piece of shit.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nAnother guy comes up, whoa, yo, state the name.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nMy name's MC Grindr and I'm here to say it.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nHe's like, he rocks the world.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:19.000\nOr she.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nIs Grindr only men?\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nIs Grindr only gay males or is it gay women too?\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nOf course it's gay women too.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nI don't fucking know.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nWhat kind of genie lamp are you trying to rub?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nOf course it's gay women too.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nI don't...\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nIt's what?\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\nYou're all racist.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:43.000\nNo, I meant the gay rap battles for women too.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nI don't know what Grindr's for.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:49.000\nIs there a woman homosexual Grindr?\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nIs there a scissor?\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nScissor?\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nAre you joking?\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nIt's scissor without an O, it's a scissor.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nScissor.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nScissor and the slogan is, it doesn't exist.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nIt's not real.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nIt's a myth.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:06.000\nThere are several gay women apps?\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nDatch.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:08.000\nDatch?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nWhat does datch mean?\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nIt's a lesbian dating app, but it wasn't successful for me.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nIt wasn't successful for you.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nDatch didn't work for you?\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nWhy, you met the wrong kind of people?\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nIt just didn't meet anybody.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nYou didn't meet anybody?\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:21.000\nNo.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nThere's no one on it, it's not like...\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:27.000\nIt's easier to swipe on Tinder and figure out who's queer.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.000\nAlright.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:33.000\nYou guys, go away.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nI have a conversation with Heather who...\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nRemember, she's like...\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nIt's easier to use Tinder and try to figure out who's gay.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nHeather, was it you that made the awesome comic strip?\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nNo.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nWho's that?\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nWho was the person that made the awesome comic?\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nRob Schrupp.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:54.000\nOkay, alright, okay.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:58.000\nRob Schrupp to the stage.\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nBring him out, bring him out.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nNo, get him out here.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.000\nRob.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:08.000\nThe phantom of the opera is here.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nBring him out.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Rob Schrupp.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:35.000\nWhat's up, Rob?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:45.000\nI'm just making a drink.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:51.000\nStop, stop.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nThis guy likes ice.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:57.000\nA lot of ice.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:02.000\nAlright, I'm sorry.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:09.000\nWhat was your comic book called?\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:16.000\nAlright, so who in the crowd...\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nWell, sit there for the cameras.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nRight there?\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\nIs that good, Chris?\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nAlright.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nWe went a nice two shot of you guys.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nGive me a good two shot.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:37.000\nYou guys are familiar with a male porn performer named Nick Manning.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:42.000\nHis catchphrase is dropping loads.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:46.000\nIt's a man who, when he comes, he says dropping loads.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:47.000\nHe says it out loud.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:51.000\nHe goes dropping loads, dropping loads.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nI'm not the first person to this party.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nHe's been on Stern and stuff like that.\n\n13:55.000 --> 14:01.000\nHe was in a Batman parody where he said dropping bat load.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nSo it's obviously like, because I was tired.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nI was like, well, who's the dropping loads guy?\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:10.000\nAnd I said, yeah.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nI was looking for his videos.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:15.000\nHe's in a million videos, but his most...\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nYou were looking for his videos in particular?\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nYeah, I typed his name in to...\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nBecause you like watching the guys say dropping loads while they're coming?\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:26.000\nI wanted to check up on him and see if he was...\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nI don't see a problem.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:33.000\nHis most recent videos, he maintains this caveman persona.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:38.000\nHe goes like, he no longer says dropping loads.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nThis is the fascinating thing.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nNo, you gotta pay him.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nThat's why I think he signed a contract.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:46.000\nI haven't dug deep, but I clicked on the first three videos.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:52.000\nIt's just him going like, he grabs a woman and goes like, sex.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:57.000\nAnd then she starts thinking, he goes, dick in mouth.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:01.000\nHe's basically Cookie Monster.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nBut you're into this guy?\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nAm I into this guy?\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nYou're searching his videos in particular.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nIs America into FDR?\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:18.000\nHe dropped the loads of socialism on a country that needed it when it needed it.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nYou enjoy that porn?\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:25.000\nThe Golden Gate Bridge exists because of loads dropped at the right time.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nI don't know, am I into it?\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nI don't know.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nAre you into Jellinger?\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nAre you into Ben Franklin?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nAre you into Kitty Hawk?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nAre you into fucking Skittles?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nAre you into Apple Pie?\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:41.000\nThis is the weirdest parade I've ever seen.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:47.000\nAre you clicking on this guy's porn because it's sexy to you or because you like him as a personality?\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nI want to check in on him and I want to know.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nI want to watch him say drop in loads.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nI bet you somebody's got a super cut.\n\n15:55.000 --> 16:00.000\nOf course, on YouTube it's all audio, but the thing is, I want to see dick.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nWhy did he drop him?\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:08.000\nI want to just see the audio, I want to see him say dropping loads and his dick.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nInstead of going to YouTube?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:16.000\nBut trivia, Rick and Morty fans, season two, there's a... season two?\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:22.000\nThe Zardaz thing that's floating in the planet, it's going drop in loads.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nThat's a Nick Manning reference.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:29.000\nAnd the Zardaz face is Nick Manning.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:33.000\nBut he doesn't say it anywhere, but he says these crazy things and goes,\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nOh, your pussy juice is on my balls.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nAre you jerking off to this shit?\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nYou're watching him and he's going like, are you...\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nHe's like Lenny Bruce.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nIt's like you don't like porn.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nHe doesn't like it.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nHe's like, porn is bullshit.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nI feel like he's screaming at us and going,\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nYeah, pussy juice is great.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nAnd you're kind of like...\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:59.000\nOh, so you are jerking off to this guy's porn?\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nWhoa, why wouldn't I?\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nI'm there.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nIt's porn.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nBut you're clicking in.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nGrow up.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:14.000\nYou're typing in the name of a guy that says dropping loads and I'm going to eat that pussy juice.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nYou're already making him sound dumber than he is.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nYeah, but you're not going to take this seriously.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nYou can just stand down for a second.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nDropping loads.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:25.000\nAnd you're jerking off.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nOkay, you went too far on that one.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nYou don't like it.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nI don't feel like you're receptive to this.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nI'm listening.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nI'm receptive to finding out what the fuck is going on.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nMy whole list is about just fucking...\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nLoads and rapping.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nTonight's a blue show.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nWe're working blue.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:44.000\nBecause we were talking to Dino tonight.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nDino was telling the story.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nHere, get ready to go.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nOur truth.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nDino has this...\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nThis classic story.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nThat's green.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:54.000\nHe's told a million times.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nI know.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:56.000\nIt's beyond blue.\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:03.000\nI'm pretty sure Dino's told the story on the podcast where Dino was in a hotel somewhere out of town.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:07.000\nAnd he ran into a trans...\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:13.000\nHe knew he or she and put a pin in your offence.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:16.000\nBecause that's the point of the story.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:24.000\nHe saw a prostitute kind of figure hanging outside a hotel.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:28.000\nUpon first sight of him said, like, hi.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nRoom 315.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nAnd he was like, okay.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nAnd then later on that night he went up to the room.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:40.000\nAnd then this person who was presenting as a very attractive woman.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nBut who had a wiener.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nAnd that Dino knew had a wiener when he saw her.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nBut was like, I'm into this.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nI'm going to go to this room.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nAnd he went to the room.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:54.000\nAnd then he has this sexual encounter with this person.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nAnd he was retelling the story tonight.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nAnd I just thought it was so funny.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:04.000\nBecause while he was saying it, I don't know if it was a man or a woman.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nAnd that triggered my millennial...\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nI was like, well, come on.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nWhat were they presenting as?\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:14.000\nBut it's so funny because Dino is the new Archie Bunker.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nBecause all he...\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:21.000\nWe were like riffing on if all in the family was made today.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:25.000\nMeathead would be the one going, Archie, come on.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nAre you telling me you spent the night with this person?\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nYou don't know what they were presenting as?\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:30.000\nWhat pronoun they preferred?\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nAnd Archie Bunker would be the one going,\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nGeez, meathead, look, I sucked on the dick.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nI fucked the butt.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nI'm out of town.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nWhat does it matter?\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:42.000\nIt was just Christ.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nIt was just like the Gen X mentality.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nBecause I was like, I don't know.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nIt's a fucking dude.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nIt's a girl.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nIt's like he was in the bus.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\nOh, I'm cheese.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nI fucking got the poop in the dick.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nAnd I'm licking the balls.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:57.000\nAnd I don't care what that's a glittery pussy.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nWhat is this person?\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:01.000\nYeah, geez, meathead.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:05.000\nIt's pretty funny to me that truly...\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nBecause I was like, we were riffing on that.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:10.000\nAnd that actually is the case, the today's meathead.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:13.000\nWatch this show all in the family.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nI'm going to have this guy on the show, Norman Lear,\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nwho's like 903.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nYou're going to be Norman Lear on the show?\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nWell, I got an in.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nWe could have him.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nOh, fucking, we could have him tomorrow.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:27.000\nI could have him on a paper plate.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:31.000\nNorman Lear, we've got a new pitch for you.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:35.000\nAll in the family, but all in the right now.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nAll right. All right.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nKnock it off.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nOkay.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:40.000\nKnocking it off.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.000\nAll right.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nOne more thing, and then I'm done with my...\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nAnd then we're freewheeling.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nThe fly pass.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nThat wasn't freewheeling.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nThat was not freewheeling.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nI'm trying to move forward post-device into a new era\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nwhere I'm going to dress...\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\nI want to wear all the same outfit all the time.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:01.000\nI learned this from a character called Seth Brundle\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:05.000\nin the Kronenberg's remake of the fly.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nYou tried this a long time ago.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nYou, for a while...\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:11.000\nAnd I did it, and I fucking, I ruled.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:14.000\nYou wrote Monster House in that outfit, I think.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:15.000\nNo.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:18.000\nThe first 25 pages.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:22.000\nThe character of Seth Brundle in Kronenberg's remake of the fly,\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:25.000\nGina Davis opens up a closet, and she says...\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:28.000\nAnd she goes, when are you going to change your clothes?\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nAnd he goes, I change them over your day.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:32.000\nAnd then she opens the closet, and there's like five of the same outfit.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nAnd she's like, what the hell?\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nAnd he goes, I learned it from Einstein.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:40.000\nYou don't have to waste your time thinking about outfits or whatever.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nAnd that's the moment when she like jumps on him\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nand starts making out with him.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:46.000\nSo I was like 13, and I was like, okay, so here we go.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:49.000\nSo what's your outfit going to be?\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nWhat are you going to wear for us?\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nI'm glad you asked.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nSo I, like, always, I went through these phases.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nI should do that.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nSo here's the thing.\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:00.000\nIn the meantime, I've learned Einstein, he didn't learn that from Einstein.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:01.000\nThat's a myth.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nEinstein wore whatever the fuck he wanted.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nEinstein wore pajamas on Monday.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:10.000\nHe always wore, like, black or white or, like, grayish stuff.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nI mean, like, check it out.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nLook online.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nLike, it's either...\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:17.000\nBut, yeah, I agree with you.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.000\nI agree with you.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nLike, he, uh, I totally agree with you.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:24.000\nLike, he wore different types of shirts and jackets,\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nbut they were either, like, black or white or gray.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:29.000\nThey were certainly shades of a gray scale.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.000\nYeah.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nI think it was a thing, because everybody around them was,\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:35.000\nat the time, they were wearing that color and stuff,\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nand that, not a lot of things.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nSo Einstein didn't do it.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:43.000\nSo the originator of that concept is Seth Brundle in the fly.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:47.000\nSo in keeping with his principle, which he states in the movie,\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:50.000\nhe credits Einstein with it, but Einstein never did it.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nHe's saying, in the movie, he says,\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:56.000\nthat way you don't have to expend any mental energy on what you're going to wear.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nSo what are you going to wear?\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nWhat's the outfit going to be?\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nGuess what?\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nSeth Brundle's outfit.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nWhich is?\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nWell...\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nThose telepods.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nLeather jacket and jeans?\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:12.000\nIt's a gray black and white herringbone suit jacket with a white colored shirt,\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:16.000\na dark red tie, and pants.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:19.000\nMy assistant's in charge of tracking the stuff down.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nThat's a good look, though.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:26.000\nBut he said pants, because the thing is, when you google Seth Brundle,\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:29.000\nyou don't get a clear look at any of his pants.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:34.000\nA lot of the imagery is of a fly man climbing on walls.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nRight.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\nAnd he's wearing a tweed kind of jacket?\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nYeah, it's a herringbone.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nYeah, a tweed.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nNo, he nailed everything from the waist up.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nYou can see that.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:47.000\nSo you're going to freestyle on the waist down?\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:51.000\nNo, freestyle is necessary. We're going to watch the movie together,\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nand we're going to get this right.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nBecause you fucked up a little bit.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:59.000\nDo you remember, like, as they're like...\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nGo ahead, I'm sorry.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nWell, no, he's saying he disagreed.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nThe thing is, if you go on the google,\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\ndespite Seth Brundle's protests,\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:11.000\nhe seems to be wearing three separate pairs of pants throughout the movie.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nWhoa, wild card.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:17.000\nIt's the antithesis of his claims, that he wears the same outfit.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:22.000\nSo the solution to that problem is to make me try on and off the same pair of pants\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nthat are the wrong color over its three...\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:27.000\nYeah, that was completely related to this problem.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nNo, yeah, we got to figure out the right...\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:36.000\nSee, we can't get his sizes, so I had to eyeball the pants,\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nand then take him to the tailor, and then they go,\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:42.000\nI can't hem this, you have to have him come in, and I'd say, fuck you.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:46.000\nAnd then they'd hem the pants, and I'd bring him back, and they'd be hemmed wrong,\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:49.000\nand so I had to go back and get him to fix it again.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nSo when you guys figured this out,\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:54.000\nyou were actually going to commit to wearing that outfit across the board.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:58.000\nDan, we've been burned before with the eye harm,\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nand that was a flash in the pan.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:04.000\nAre you going to commit to this one, or are you going to bail on it?\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nI feel like it.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:09.000\nThat's not it. I don't do it for you.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:13.000\nNo, I'm saying, you wanted me to have the eye harm in around your neck.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nI know what you're saying.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:19.000\nLook, I want you to commit to this. I'm all for this.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nI want you to be consistent.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nWant to make it interesting?\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nI wear a suit all the fucking time.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nSometimes you're my friend, and then sometimes you're attacking me.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.000\nHey, hey, I got a solution.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nWhat?\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:32.000\nLet's make it interesting.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nAll right.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:37.000\nA little side money harm again.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:41.000\nOkay, one year.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:44.000\nToo much? Too much? We'll go down.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nHow about this?\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:49.000\nDan, once you find the outfit, and I'm all for this,\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:52.000\nI'm not antagonistic to this idea at all,\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nwhen you find the comfort zone, you go,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nokay, this is the color of the trouser.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nThis is the jacket. This is the thing.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:03.000\nWe're going to get, how many do you think Spencer and Dan will need?\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nFive.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.000\nFive?\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nYeah, maybe less than that jacket.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:10.000\nWe'll put a calendar right here, right here, right here,\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:11.000\nand it will check it out.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nI'm going to make one exception at the outset.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nI don't want to wear his shoes.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI don't like the fucking dress shoes.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nOkay, what do you want to do?\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nI'm really like my normal shoes.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nOkay, you can wear some colors.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:24.000\nThose are going to stay the same for a couple of years anyway, so...\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:31.000\nYou strike me as somebody who doesn't wear a lot of different shoes.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:35.000\nI don't.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:39.000\nSee, Rob, Dan is hearing...\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:44.000\nYou strike me as somebody who don't change them shoes a lot.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:47.000\nDan, you're hearing attack where there isn't a lot.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:51.000\nYou may change those shoes, bro.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:56.000\nWe're in the same old, nasty ass shoes all the time.\n\n26:56.000 --> 27:01.000\nYou need to change them shoes.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:02.000\nDan, we're on your side.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nI'm totally...\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nI'm not attacking this at all.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nAre you guys perceiving me as being in a grumpy mood, like a defensive mood?\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:13.000\nWell, I think right now, there are times when you hear attack when there is none.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nYou hear combat when there is no combat.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nReally?\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nI'm saying absolutely do that.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nI would love that.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:22.000\nBecause like Steve Jobs, he wore the turtleneck, right?\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nAnd Zuckerberg...\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nLook where he is now.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:27.000\nThe Zuckerberg wears the gray t-shirt.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nTwo biopics.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:32.000\nBeat that.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:33.000\nFollow that.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nLook where Steve Brundle is.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nOr Brundle fly.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:37.000\nSteve Brundle.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nLook where Steve Brundle is.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:43.000\nThe famous Steve Brundle that you've been talking about for a while.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:44.000\nAll right.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:45.000\nWell, we're off-roading now.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:48.000\nSo I hope you guys brought your show.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nBecause those are the...\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nDo you remember the fly?\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.000\nWhy are you upset?\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nWe're saying yes and no to this idea.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:56.000\nNo, I'm not.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:57.000\nDon't tell me I'm upset.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nYou piece of shit.\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nYou seem...\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:02.000\nI want you to start wearing an outfit.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:03.000\nI'm going to.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nYeah, but you're so...\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:05.000\nI want the pants to be right.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:06.000\nOkay.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nI want to help you get the right pants.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nI'm trying to get them right.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nWe're going to get the right pants.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nAll right.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nOf that, we can be sure.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:17.000\nBut my prediction is that you're going to go...\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nStop miming eating.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:24.000\nI didn't know what else to do.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\nTrying to...\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nI think this is going to go the way of the eye Harmon.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:35.000\nOr the last time you wore Einstein outfit where you wore your powder blue short sleeve tucked in buttoned down shirt.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:39.000\nWell, I want every kid out there listening right now to listen to what Jeff's trying to do.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:45.000\nWhat he's doing is called identity bullying.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:51.000\nLike if you decide one week that you want to be like Captain EO.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:56.000\nI'm trying to modernize the reference.\n\n28:56.000 --> 29:01.000\nYou want to shoot lasers and make people dance?\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:05.000\nIf you go through a phase there and you're like, oh, I'm going to do this every day.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nI'm all for it.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nAnd then on Thursday, you're like, this is boring.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nGo ahead.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nIt's better to do it and get bored.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nI support it all the way.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:17.000\nGuys like this are always going to be like, no, you got to make up your mind.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nYou're manufacturing a confrontation.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nDon't listen to him right now.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:26.000\nHe's going to tell you that you're manufacturing conflict.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:32.000\nBut what he's trying to do by saying that is kill you and murder you.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:41.000\nWhat Dan is doing right now is apologizing for him wearing the Brundle fly outfit for two Harmontowns and then giving it up.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nOh, no.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nWe went through the same thing.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:48.000\nRemember when Dan wore the outfit?\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nOh, no.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nThe enemy.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nHe's the enemy.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nJust follow your bliss.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nFollow your heart, kids.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nIf you fall in love, fall in love.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:03.000\nLove that person for two days.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nTwo days?\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:09.000\nIf you don't love them for three days, that's not on you or them.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:12.000\nThat's on God.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:17.000\nI think he brought me out too early.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:20.000\nLet's send Rob off for a bit.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nThat was Rob Schafer, buddy.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nThank you.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:24.000\nThat was Rob Schafer.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nWe'll bring him out later on.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:31.000\nWe'll bring him out later on.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nIt was too early.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:36.000\nIt was too early.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:40.000\nToo early to bring out Rob Schafer.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.000\nAll right.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:46.000\nI'm glad this happened because obviously tonight's about retooling the format of the show.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nI'd like to bring Rob Schrab back out.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:49.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:52.000\nLet's bring Rob Schrab back out too.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nBecause now it feels right.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nNow the time is right.\n\n30:56.000 --> 31:05.000\nI want him to understand who's in charge.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:08.000\nI think it feels right.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:11.000\nRob, can you do a dance on this?\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:15.000\nCan you get up on top of the podium here and do a little podium dance?\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:18.000\nI'm not going to get up on that.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:24.000\nAll right. Rob Schrab, everybody.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nThank you so much, Rob.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nYou are welcome.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nYou got any LEGO spoilers for us?\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nNope.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nAll right.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:37.000\nRob Schrab, everybody.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:38.000\nThere he goes.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nHe's gone.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nOh, he's leaving?\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nNo, he's staying.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nAll right.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nSee, I'm out of control then.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:44.000\nYep.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:45.000\nThere's something that goes wrong.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:48.000\nWhat was the first moment you guys remember meeting each other?\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:52.000\nDo you guys both have the same memory of the first time you guys locked eyes?\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:57.000\nIt was like in the back of Colts and Milwaukee.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nComedy sports, probably.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nOr was it LA Freeway stand-up?\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nYeah, it was Colts.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nColts?\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nYeah.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nHe's probably there.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nI've been there.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nOh, yeah, you have been there.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nI was there before.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:15.000\nAfter it was not Comedy Sports anymore, but I went there one time with you guys.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nSo what was the first time you guys met?\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.000\nWhat was the circumstance?\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nJust we were at an improv workshop.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:22.000\nI don't know.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:25.000\nDan, you were like probably 18?\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:26.000\n17.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\n17.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\n17.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:29.000\nI was 39.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:37.000\nBut I remember, yeah, I remember Rob being funny.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:40.000\nI remember when he was funny.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nThe good old days.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nYeah, he was funny back then.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:50.000\nWell, I remember, we did some improv exercises, and then I remember you were off.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:55.000\nWe were done with the workshop, and you were sitting, and then you had a bag of chips,\n\n32:55.000 --> 33:02.000\nand then you had a soda, and you were talking about how you had read that the chips had\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:07.000\nriboflavin in them, and that the riboflavin was a tenderizer, and that it was designed.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:14.000\nThe same companies created the soft drinks and the chips, because the riboflavin tenderizes\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:15.000\nyou.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:18.000\nI don't think that's right.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nI don't think that's right.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nI don't think riboflavin does that.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nDoes anybody know what riboflavin does?\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:25.000\nRiboflavin?\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nRiboflavin?\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nDoes anybody?\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nAll right.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nWell, that's not why I brought it up.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nThat's my memory of you.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nI didn't think you were right.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nThat's my memory of you.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:40.000\nWhat was the first moment when you guys connected and thought you guys could be, like, maybe\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nfriends?\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nI remember the first time I was about to do...\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nThat was a chair.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:45.000\nWhat?\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:46.000\nSorry, that was a...\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:47.000\nWhat?\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nThat was a chair.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:53.000\nDan farted in this part from out there.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:54.000\nIt was a chair.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:55.000\nDan's blaming us for it on a chair.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nSorry, it's a terrible show tonight.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:58.000\nIt doesn't need to be a good one.\n\n33:58.000 --> 33:59.000\nIt's pretty bad.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nIt's $10.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nI'll give you all your money back.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:05.000\nIt doesn't matter, and life doesn't matter.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:08.000\nJust find someone you're happy with.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nJust find someone you're happy with.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:17.000\nJust find someone.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:20.000\nJust feel around in the dark and...\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nThat's what I do to...\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:25.000\nI don't do the Seth Brundle thing.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nI get dressed...\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:30.000\nI get up before Kate does, so I get dressed in the dark.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:33.000\nSo that removes everything.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:36.000\nSo I just like, oh, okay, this and that, and then I walk out looking...\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nLooking a little...\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nLooking a little weird sometimes.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:43.000\nDo you ever wear the different color socks and shoes?\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nOh, God, yes.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:45.000\nFor real?\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:46.000\nOh, my gosh, and it's crazy.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nEverybody goes, wow, who's this guy?\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:49.000\nDifferent...\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:55.000\nDifferent colored socks, because you know how everybody looks at other people's socks?\n\n34:55.000 --> 35:00.000\nThis is the shit that I would go through every fucking Sunday morning with my mother,\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nyou know, and I would put on white socks.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nYou can't wear white socks with dress shoes.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:08.000\nI'm like, who's looking at my socks in church?\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nWe're all sitting down.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nI'm behind a pew.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:19.000\nIf they're looking at my socks, maybe what we're listening to is fucking boring.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:22.000\nHey, that's a new commandment.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nOf the 11th commandment.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nTry to be more interesting than socks.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nYeah.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:31.000\nRight.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nFix the air conditioning.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:42.000\nAt the premiere for Monster House, because it's a Halloween movie, the invitation said,\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:50.000\nwear your favorite Halloween costume, and the only people that paid attention to that\n\n35:50.000 --> 36:00.000\npart of the invitation were Rob and his wife, and some kid who dressed up as Jack Sparrow.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:05.000\nIn order to get people to watch his Nickelodeon show.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\nRight.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:09.000\nLike some kid that was like, ooh, I'm Jack Sparrow.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nYeah, so Kate and I get up.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:17.000\nEverybody is fucking Monster House world premiere, and everyone's like, ooh, the house is a\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:18.000\nmonster.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.000\nHello, Mr. Zemeckis.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:20.000\nYes, we did it.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nOh, we did it.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:25.000\nNext step, Oscars, and then Rob gets out of a limo.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nBecause it's Tron?\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nTron.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nIt was a good Tron.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nSkin tight fucking.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nHard on.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nCircuitry.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nPuffy paint circuitry.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nFucking Tron.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nRob, full on Tron.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:44.000\nWas it Ram or Tron?\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:45.000\nIt was Ram, wasn't it?\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nIt was Tron.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nNo, I dressed up as Ram.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nYou guys don't know who I am?\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nNo, it's...\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nDidn't you do Ram one time with the red something?\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:57.000\nI think you're thinking of a different Rob.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nThat was back when you were triple gym in it.\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:03.000\nYou used to go to the gym three times a day, and this motherfucker was in shape.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:04.000\nI was crazy.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nYeah, he wore tights for a living.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:10.000\nAll you wore was a body suit at all times.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nNot at all times, but I could pull it off.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:13.000\nYou did.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:14.000\nYeah.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.000\nYour ass was like a space helmet.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:16.000\nIt was fucking...\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nIt was a good ass.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nYeah.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:23.000\nIt's a great ass.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:26.000\nNot that you noticed.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:29.000\nNo, I did.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:32.000\nI went like, we're in the limo.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\nWe're in the limo.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nI'm dressed as Tron.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nKate's dressed as the Tooth Fairy.\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:40.000\nAnd just before we get out, I go, you know something?\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:44.000\nI bet you we're going to be the only ones dressed in costume.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nHello, I'm right.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:49.000\nAnd we're getting our picture taken, and everybody's going...\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:50.000\nExcuse me.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nExcuse me.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nThis is the camera.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nWhy are you dressed up?\n\n37:56.000 --> 38:02.000\nIt says in the invitation.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:07.000\nAnd they would all go, yeah, we know.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:11.000\nI didn't realize it's Hollywood, so you don't do stuff that...\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:12.000\nNo, you don't.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.000\nNo, it's a test.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:14.000\nYeah.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:17.000\nWhen someone says, have fun, that's a test.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:20.000\nIf you have fun, you're a fucking nerd.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:24.000\nSo we walk the red carpet, and we get our picture taken,\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:27.000\nand then the next day we go, oh, gosh, that's our first premiere.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:28.000\nLet's go see it.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:31.000\nWe look online and go, oh, oh, shit, shit.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nOh, Dan Harmon, writer.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nOh, Gil Kennan, director.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nOh, I guess it's Robertson mechanism.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:45.000\nAnd then Kate and I, background.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nLike, background.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.000\nYou know, when you go to a premiere and you have, like, hired people dressed up\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nas, like, idiots in the back...\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nYou're saying the image...\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:57.000\nThe image of us is a picture of us as a background.\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:58.000\nOh, no.\n\n38:58.000 --> 38:59.000\nIt didn't say...\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:02.000\nUnder yours it said, writer, me, background.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:07.000\nIt's not even Tron, not even Tooth Fairy, just background.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:10.000\nDon't know why they're on the red carpet.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:14.000\nDon't know why they're Tron and the Tooth Fairy.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:20.000\nThey sure are smiling like, I'm supposed to know why they did that.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nBackground.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:25.000\nFor lack of a better word, background.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:30.000\nSpencer, what have you been doing?\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:35.000\nHow about, have you heard about these Chinese murder vans?\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nNo, okay.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:38.000\nI have not.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:39.000\nFilm me in a Chinese murder vans.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:40.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:41.000\nI've filled everybody in.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:42.000\nThey murder people in vans.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:45.000\nWhat is their angle?\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:48.000\nThe murder is their angle.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:49.000\nIs it vengeance?\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:52.000\nOr are they just going out and randomly killing strangers?\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:53.000\nYeah, it's vengeance.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.000\nOkay.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:58.000\nThe people who killed their van parents.\n\n39:58.000 --> 39:59.000\nAll right.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nClearly you read one article.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nThey stalked the streets.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:08.000\nI'm picturing a Ford, a Conor Lyon bubble window van from the 70s.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:11.000\nWhat kind of van are they in?\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:14.000\nLike one of those except with a lot more screaming.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:19.000\nDo they kill you inside the van or do they jump out of the van and then kill you back\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:20.000\nin the van?\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nNo, they kill you in the van.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nNo, okay.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:24.000\nSorry.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:25.000\nThis is a joke.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:26.000\nI've talked about this before.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:32.000\nNo, the real thing that's been happening in my life is Lord of the Rings.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:33.000\nWhat?\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:37.000\nThat's the real thing that's been happening.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:38.000\nNo, no.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:39.000\nOkay.\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:40.000\nSo I was on the computer.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:41.000\nI built a computer.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:42.000\nNo.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:43.000\nYeah, no.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nI know it's hard to believe, Rob.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:46.000\nThat was on the computer.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.000\nThat was bullying.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nI recognize that.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:49.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:50.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:51.000\nI know where this is going and I'm leaving.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nAnd I get a phone call from Rob Schrab.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:54.000\nYeah.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:55.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nHow do I work my computer?\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:58.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nNo, I'm driving in because I worked at Leggo this morning.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:01.000\nOh, you were driving.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nI'm driving, driving, driving, and I'm going, huh.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:10.000\nLike, yo, yo, Spence, what's up?\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:15.000\nSo I'm masturbating and I'm like, I'm just, you know, I'm just on, I'm just on that Internet.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nI'm on that Kotaku.com.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:18.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nGo that we don't, we don't have the VR this.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nJust go ahead and explain.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nI'm just telling the people what happened.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:25.000\nNo, you explain.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nYou call me up and start a sale.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nWhat's Kotaku.com?\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:32.000\nIt's just a website that's not porn.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:33.000\nBut you jerk off to it.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:34.000\nYeah, no.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nOkay.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nThat's what I tell Rob when he calls me when I'm jerking off.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:38.000\nI got you.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:39.000\nWhat site were you on?\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nOh, no, I was playing Minecraft.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:42.000\nThat's a joke.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nAll right, come on.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:47.000\nLet's get serious.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:51.000\nSo I go, I'm driving and I have a question.\n\n41:51.000 --> 42:01.000\nSo I called our dungeon master and I went, hey, why is it called Lord of the Rings when there's only one ring?\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:13.000\nI don't understand that because as far as what I'm seeing and I've read in the books and stuff like that,\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nthere seems to be only one ring.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:16.000\nOne ring.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nAnd it's the ring of invisibility and Bilbo got it.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nAnd then did they...\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nWhat do the other rings do?\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:25.000\nWell, first of all, where are they?\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:29.000\nThey're in the first 15 seconds of the movie.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:33.000\nWell, then name the fucking whole thing after it.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:34.000\nOh my God.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:35.000\nOh, oh my God.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:36.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:37.000\nI must be mistaken.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:41.000\nThe first 15 seconds of the whole thing.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:42.000\nNo, okay, but...\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:46.000\nName the whole thing after it then.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nIf that's what the story's about.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:51.000\nIf that's what the story's about.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:52.000\nOh, it isn't.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:55.000\nIt's not what the story's about, right?\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:56.000\nOh, okay.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nHey.\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nLet's call it...\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:03.000\nLet's call it King Kong's.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nBut there's only one King Kong.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:13.000\nYes, but he had a mother and a father.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:17.000\nDoesn't make sense.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:22.000\nSo King Kong would be called the Kong family?\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:32.000\nThink about the pitch he walks into whatever bar with C.S. Lewis and there's fucking H.P.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nLovecraft hanging out in the corner and going,\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:37.000\nwhoa, just got done with my whole books.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nOh man, what's it about?\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:40.000\nIt's called Lord of the Rings.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:41.000\nWow.\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:42.000\nOh wow.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:47.000\nIs it about a guy, a lord who finds all these rings and then there's...\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nIt's fighting over all these rings?\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:50.000\nNo.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:55.000\nIt's nothing to do with rings, it's just one ring.\n\n43:55.000 --> 44:03.000\nWell, off to my series of 17 books that are all about lions, witches, and wardrobes.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nYeah.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:08.000\nHey, it's more accurate than...\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nThere's not even a lord of the rings.\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:15.000\nI mean, presumably whoever made all those rings was a lord of the rings.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nDo the story about him.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:20.000\nThere's no, but that person has not even been like...\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nWell, no, he's the lord of one ring.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:23.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:24.000\nHe made all the rings.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nI don't think so.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:27.000\nI don't think he...\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nWhat movies were you guys watching?\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nI think he made all the rings.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:34.000\nI'm pretty sure elves made all the rings, gave three of them to dwarves.\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:35.000\nWhat?\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:36.000\nNo.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.000\nThree of them to humans.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nNo, Sauron had a guy make all the rings.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:40.000\nWhat did the other rings do?\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nThey gave them, they gifted them to the...\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:47.000\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, Levy, what does it say you're looking up on Wikipedia, right?\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:48.000\nSteve Levy, get out of here.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:49.000\nSteve Levy, everybody.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:50.000\nSteve, get out of here.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nI'm sure someone knows.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:53.000\nThis isn't...\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:54.000\nThis isn't a debate.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:55.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:56.000\nIt is.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\nIt is.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:58.000\nIt is.\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nIt is a debate.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nI'm taking it down and I'm going to win.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:01.000\nIt's not a debate.\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:02.000\nNo, it is.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.000\nWhat did the other rings do?\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:04.000\nThey turned...\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:07.000\nWhoa, here's the thing that pisses me off.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:08.000\nOkay.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nMy name is Sauron.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:10.000\nI have this ring.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nNow I'm really powerful.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:15.000\nI'm going to do this thing with the sword and everybody's going to fly all over the place\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:19.000\nbecause I did this thing with the sword and I'm so powerful because I'm wearing this ring\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:22.000\nand then somebody cuts off my finger and it falls down and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:23.000\nblah, blah.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:27.000\nAnd then, okay, Bilbo gets it, he puts it on and turns invisible.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:28.000\nWhy?\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:29.000\nWhy?\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:30.000\nWhy?\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:31.000\nCome on.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:32.000\nWell, that's always been fucked up.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:33.000\nI never got that.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:34.000\nBecause Sauron isn't invisible.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nHe isn't invisible.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nHe's wearing this ring and he doesn't turn invisible.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.000\nIf I were to...\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:39.000\nA little clunky.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:46.000\nIf I were to defend the mythology, I would say that the cowardice of mortal beings means\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:55.000\nthat the biggest power that you would have if a ring of that power imbued itself in you,\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:59.000\nthat the very first and foremost thing you would do before you could fly or do anything,\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:02.000\nthat you would just be a creepy, invisible person.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:06.000\nBut that's me apologizing for a mythology that I agree is flawed.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:09.000\nDo you mean he had a bunch of rings made?\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nThe whole point was that he had all his rings made.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:15.000\nThe ring of power is the ring that controls all the rings.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:18.000\nHe had a bunch of rings before the story started.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:19.000\nOkay, good.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:24.000\nLet's do three books about not that.\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nWhat did Steve have to say?\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:27.000\nSpencer's right.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nIt was an elf, right, or something?\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:30.000\nHere's what they did.\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:34.000\nThey killed Sauron and they went, well, fuck, that guy had that one ring.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:38.000\nWe need to have rings to battle evil if that ever comes back.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:42.000\nYeah, but let's never talk about them or use them ever.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nHere's the first thing that comes up when you're right.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nWho made the rings in Lord of the Rings?\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nWell, I know because I played the video game.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:49.000\nRight, yeah.\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:50.000\nI met that guy.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:51.000\nI worked for him.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:52.000\nSpoilers.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:53.000\nMet him.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nI had lunch with him.\n\n46:55.000 --> 47:03.000\nHe gave me superpowers that were curiously compatible with Warner Brothers Interactive's total game engine.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:04.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:09.000\nHobbit is the only good book.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:10.000\nYou hear that?\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:13.000\nThat's the sound of just failure.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nYeah.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:15.000\nI don't care.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nNo one cares what Bob book says.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nNo one says that you're right.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nPeople hate books.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:26.000\nWe're in the back of a comic book store, not in the comic book store itself.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:30.000\nThe idea that the thing that threw you is that that's all explained in the beginning.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:34.000\nThey made a bunch of rings, and there was one ring to rule them all and the darkness behind them.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:39.000\nTHat thing that should throw you is after three movies that span nine years,\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:43.000\nit turns out all you gotta do to set things right is talk to green ghosts.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nWell, that's not true.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:46.000\nThat didn't say what was the story at all.\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nGreen ghosts kill everything.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:51.000\nThe green ghosts go, brrrrrrrr.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:55.000\nThey call it Lord of the Green Ghost.\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:59.000\nYeah, king of the that I would that I would agree. That's a better title. Lord of the rings\n\n47:59.760 --> 48:05.760\nThere's there's only one green ghosts. All right. Call it the ring move. Can we talk about vaccinations talk about AIDS?\n\n48:06.080 --> 48:14.120\nHey, do you guys? Oh shit AIDS? I don't like a prevention. Oh omaze omaze.com slash Rick and Morty go there\n\n48:14.120 --> 48:18.560\nYeah, fight AIDS fight it's enough with that. That was a good plug. Oh wait. We got one more plug\n\n48:18.560 --> 48:25.760\nIt's a so beta. Yeah, go to Harmon. Okay, go to see so beta are enough of that\n\n48:26.680 --> 48:29.520\nEveryone fight AIDS and watch see so we'll do yeah\n\n48:29.680 --> 48:34.680\nCan we get the beta code if you want to get on see so right now is Harmon fan\n\n48:36.240 --> 48:44.360\nHarmon fan, so I won't remember that available for all the CISO concerts right a bunch of contents. Yeah, and eventually Harmon quest\n\n48:45.040 --> 48:46.880\nOnly one ring in them\n\n48:46.880 --> 48:53.040\nYeah, only there is no lord of the rings like they did the elders is obviously fucking Sauron\n\n48:53.040 --> 48:59.240\nWell, he only have our arms didn't call it Sauron. They call the call all three books Sauron dear\n\n48:59.840 --> 49:01.320\nour token\n\n49:01.320 --> 49:06.280\nYou missed named your book that in\n\n49:07.400 --> 49:14.080\n2015 there's 90 movies about what what what did he do wrong? Hey? Yeah, you know that\n\n49:14.080 --> 49:16.840\nI mean if something's popular, then it's right Hitler\n\n49:20.920 --> 49:23.160\nKaboom Sauron kaboom\n\n49:23.760 --> 49:29.080\nYeah, called you there you go lord of the ring. There's so many things to complain about okay\n\n49:29.080 --> 49:33.880\nI'm reading the second one. There's gonna be hopefully at least another ring coming up here\n\n49:37.360 --> 49:43.400\nHe loves the rings he loves rings that's why you watch the movie you love rings you knew you knew\n\n49:43.400 --> 49:47.080\nThey're gonna be a million rings. I like I like the ring in the hobbit. I thought it was oh, yeah\n\n49:47.080 --> 49:50.320\nSo you wanted a million rings cuz it would be lord of the rings\n\n49:50.320 --> 49:56.120\nI want to watch a million rings. What are the other rings? You love rings. You love rings. You love movies about jewelry. I like\n\n49:57.320 --> 49:59.320\nAccurate I like I like\n\n49:59.800 --> 50:05.240\nYeah, yeah, you love logic. That's why you want diehard to be called a guy in a tower\n\n50:05.240 --> 50:14.240\nBut that's an accurate yeah, that'd be great. Neat mop, moops. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm on your side.\n\n50:14.240 --> 50:19.600\nDiehard is a good title. Diehard is better than a guy. Yeah, yeah, but it's not diehard\n\n50:23.040 --> 50:26.760\nWell, it's the thing he doesn't diehard in the movie\n\n50:27.480 --> 50:33.760\nHe fucking lives he stays alive. Yeah forever. Yeah, well that all of the series are called diehard\n\n50:33.760 --> 50:38.200\nHe hasn't died yet. It's hard for him to die. It's a high. He's a hard dire\n\n50:38.200 --> 50:41.720\nIt's a hard die hard dire we'd ask hard dire dire\n\n50:42.240 --> 50:46.360\nSee, I love diehard is a title, but dieharder is a better\n\n50:47.400 --> 50:49.920\nHard diehard. Yeah, hard dire. Yeah, what's that?\n\n50:55.240 --> 51:02.600\nYeah, he's a diehard I'm a diehard liver. Yeah, he's just a badass. No, he's the diehard\n\n51:02.600 --> 51:08.280\nYeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, there was a there was a battery a car battery. They probably still have them called diehard\n\n51:08.680 --> 51:12.640\nYeah, that kind of excited that you were so passionate that you would cry that out\n\n51:13.360 --> 51:15.360\nAre you that big a diehard fan? Oh\n\n51:16.240 --> 51:19.840\nOkay, I'm now I'm now I don't know where to go with you\n\n51:21.680 --> 51:25.040\nMy mom is a fan of yelling things out or Bruce Willis or\n\n51:26.160 --> 51:28.160\nJohn McTiernan or\n\n51:28.160 --> 51:33.800\nI'm a fan of making people believe what I want them to believe. Okay, so you're a witch. You're a\n\n51:34.800 --> 51:36.800\nOr a hypnotist\n\n51:38.160 --> 51:40.160\nAll right, you have powers of persuasion\n\n51:43.520 --> 51:45.520\nNo, you don't\n\n51:46.680 --> 51:52.480\nI found out at the same time I was you know, how old were we Dan you know about the same age\n\n51:52.480 --> 51:56.400\nHow old were we when diehard came out was I was 24\n\n51:56.400 --> 51:58.400\nAll right, I was 15\n\n51:59.480 --> 52:05.320\nSo then I was 14 or 15 and I my mom and I were really in the diehard together cuz I'm just slightly out of you\n\n52:08.080 --> 52:11.160\nMy mom was really in the diehard and whenever time I came on TV\n\n52:11.160 --> 52:14.600\nWe'd watch it together and I loved diehard, but I found out\n\n52:15.160 --> 52:19.240\nLike the third time you watch it that she just had a giant boner for Alexander Goodenoff\n\n52:20.720 --> 52:22.720\nThe blonde bad guy\n\n52:22.720 --> 52:31.080\nI want blood. Yeah, not dissimilar from Nick Manning pussy juice on dick\n\n52:33.960 --> 52:38.960\nDo you watch that guy's porn because you enjoy him as a character or because what's happening is sexy wait\n\n52:38.960 --> 52:45.840\nOkay, it has to be both like like why why why I think in a world where is there do you enjoy him as a\n\n52:45.840 --> 52:54.120\nevery second that we're sitting here another five thousand pieces of porn are made right\n\n52:54.840 --> 53:00.000\nWe clearly if you took one step back from our species and looked at the media\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:05.880\nWe create as you would with the honeybees making whatever they make and don't say honey. Don't say honey\n\n53:06.960 --> 53:10.980\nThey make wax they make wax if you took a step back and looked at what we create\n\n53:10.980 --> 53:15.860\nMedia-wise you would go these people love porn\n\n53:16.140 --> 53:18.900\nThey make a lot of it per second\n\n53:18.900 --> 53:26.580\nSo the question the answer to the question was I watching Nick Manning to like here to make fun or to get turned on\n\n53:26.580 --> 53:30.540\nIt's like I bathed in it. I fucking open my I'm like\n\n53:30.820 --> 53:35.340\nGive me what you got and he's like he did he didn't say drop in loads and I'm like I\n\n53:36.500 --> 53:38.500\nYeah, I eventually came\n\n53:38.500 --> 53:40.500\nI\n\n53:40.580 --> 53:45.940\nBut you like him as a like he I don't like him you don't like him. I don't know him\n\n53:46.700 --> 53:53.260\nHe might be conservative. I don't know him. He might be like dropping loads. We should tag Muslims\n\n53:54.500 --> 53:58.060\nI want to drop a load on each Muslim that you can read at an airport\n\n53:59.500 --> 54:03.420\nWhat is Rob doing here? Rob is getting complicated. I'm getting comfortable\n\n54:03.420 --> 54:10.220\nBecause he's sitting like he's about to tell us something about our school experience\n\n54:12.700 --> 54:17.900\nHey, yeah, I've done some drinking I've done some druggin\n\n54:19.940 --> 54:22.100\nWasn't that cool I'm telling you kids\n\n54:23.140 --> 54:28.740\nGotta read what's going on in the Lego Lego to what do you need?

I'm sorry\n\n01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.600\nI'm not making fun of you. I just don't know what to do. I don't know why I'm here. What brought you to LA Tara\n\n01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:10.520\nYeah, a bunch of reasons. I kind of came for the sun actually the sun. Yeah, and but a bunch of things.

You don't know where you're going\n\n01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:44.360\nYeah, I mean depressed my whole life for sure. But like putting myself alone in a new city\n\n01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.080\nsevere like has triggered it to a point where\n\n01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.480\nDo you have friends or any kind of like connections when you came out or you came out totally alone? No, I came out totally alone\n\n01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:58.120\nWhich is a really good sign because a lot of people don't do that. I didn't do that\n\n01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:02.920\nSchrab had to come out to LA for me to come out. I I never would have gone out\n\n01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.280\nI have to commend you that is a very ballsy thing to do because like dan and I\n\n01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.840\nIn milwaukee said for years we got to get out of here. We got to go to los angeles\n\n01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.480\nI never would have done it if it wasn't if dan would have gone if he was that i'm not going to go\n\n01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.840\nI would have stayed there. So to do it by yourself is\n\n01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.280\nIt's really commendable. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's it doesn't necessarily\n\n01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.080\nFortell anything which I think that's the big crucial issue. How old are you?\n\n01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.040\nYou seem young enough we can ask how old right 27 27\n\n01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.400\nUh, like that's how old I was when I came out. So the importance of uh, I was way younger than that\n\n01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.760\nTo me I was like why is he even bothering to come out 27?\n\n01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:52.280\nYeah, uh, but the the the when we talk about age when we think about it the big crucial issue is outcome\n\n01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.920\nIt's like it's like, oh, I'm gonna I need to accomplish this by this stage and all this stuff\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.120\nLike like like that's the big thing and so it's again come to a big city like LA or new york\n\n01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.760\nAnd it's like oh the reason I'm coming here is because this is the place where you plug into this main frame\n\n01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.120\nAnd then I'm going to become this like heightened version of myself\n\n01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:16.760\nAnd it's going to be at the mercy of this bartender or this agent or this like flyer or this workshop and\n\n01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.920\nYou know, you're fucking dizzy and like like wondering\n\n01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.400\nBecause yeah, I'm sure back home. You've got\n\n01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.960\nProbably a tribe of people that bless their hearts. Maybe aren't totally going\n\n01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.560\nTotally I get it go audition for everything\n\n01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.800\nOh, yeah, I'm not like auditioning for and don't have expectation of joining\n\n01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:47.080\nThe entertainment world, but so you're right now at 27 you're going I got out here\n\n01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.560\nI'm just getting okay, so I'm exiting a\n\n01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.360\na four-year like\n\n01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.600\nRelationship I was gonna say emotionally abusive relationship\n\n01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.280\nSo I kind of flee to a state to come to this state\n\n01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.120\nTo get away from that guy. Yeah. Yeah\n\n01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.120\nGood for you. Good for you\n\n01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.160\nHe's not a bad guy. I'm not an angel either.

01:20:07.440\nIt was you.\n\n01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.440\nWe used my phone to play it.\n\n01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.440\nAnyways, can we please get grounded and be sensitive to people?\n\n01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:19.440\nIt's a movie that made you go, oh.\n\n01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:28.440\nWhat was the movie that turned you into a Japanese stereotype?\n\n01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.440\nI saw that movie Entertainment.\n\n01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.440\nIt was sad, but it made me laugh too.\n\n01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.440\nMaybe not belly laugh.\n\n01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:38.440\nLet's talk about these autistic kids.\n\n01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:45.440\nIn L.A., your job is to, what do you do when you punch in the clock?\n\n01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.440\n9 o'clock?\n\n01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.440\nAnd then you go, who's autistic?\n\n01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.440\nAnd they're like, I won't tell you.\n\n01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.440\nI'm not going to look at you.\n\n01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.440\nAnd you're like, I think you are.\n\n01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.440\nAnd then you grab them and you're like, come on.\n\n01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.440\nAnd they're like, no.\n\n01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.440\nAnd you're like, perfect.\n\n01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.440\nAnd then you're like, five o'clock?\n\n01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.440\nI don't know why I signaled into that.\n\n01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.440\nThat wasn't what I was trying to do.\n\n01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:11.440\nThat's not what I was trying to do.\n\n01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.440\nYou correct me from the moment you punch.\n\n01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.440\n11 o'clock.\n\n01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440\nOh, nice.\n\n01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.440\nMust be nice.\n\n01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:27.440\nBecause of depression, I don't get up for work.\n\n01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.440\nI just won't get up for work if it's early.\n\n01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:33.440\nSo I've had to find jobs that start past 9 a.m.\n\n01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.440\nThis sounds like a joke, but do you tell in the interview?\n\n01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.440\nNo, I just find jobs that I've worked in schools.\n\n01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.440\nI can't do it.\n\n01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:44.440\nI just have found a job that you can start later on and work till 7.\n\n01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:48.440\nSo you consider yourself, you're saying you suffer from depression\n\n01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:52.440\nlike across the board the whole time, every time.\n\n01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440\nLike, are you taking medication for it?\n\n01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.440\nAnd what medication?\n\n01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:02.440\nAnd anytime you want to say, you don't have to answer anything.\n\n01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.440\nBut from what age were you when you were like,\n\n01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.440\nI'm fucking clinically depressed.\n\n01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.440\nWhen did you know?\n\n01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:19.440\nI mean, I always felt like sad for sure,\n\n01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:26.440\nbut probably around going away to college really felt plummeted down.\n\n01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.440\nJust being like, got shipped upstate to upstate New York school\n\n01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:34.440\nwas like completely like alone in the cold and just like shit.\n\n01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:38.440\nIs it a daily thing or is it something that kind of comes and goes or is it day to day?\n\n01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.440\nIt's like day to day.\n\n01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.440\nDid it start to affect you?\n\n01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:48.440\nWhat was the tipping point when you went to a doctor and started treating it\n\n01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:53.440\nas if it was a clinical thing as opposed to a thing that was wrong with you\n\n01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.440\nthat you were dealing with on your own?\n\n01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.440\nGet leaving college.\n\n01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.440\nDid you drop out?\n\n01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.440\nI dropped out when I went back, but I dropped out at 18, went home\n\n01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.440\nand was just completely depressed.\n\n01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.440\nAnd then my mom, you know, I was like, we have to go to therapy.\n\n01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.440\nSo you dropped out because you were like, I can't handle college.\n\n01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.440\nSo there was a course, this is important to a lot of people that are listening.\n\n01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:21.440\nThere was a point where you were like, oh, there's something neat.\n\n01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:30.440\nThere was a point where you atoned with this thing where you were like, oh, it's medical.\n\n01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:35.440\nI mean, and I'm sure as a smart person, you're like, well, I don't want somebody\n\n01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.440\nin a lab coat telling me why my personality is different.\n\n01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.440\nIt's frustrating because I understand it and I know it,\n\n01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:46.440\nbut the behaviors won't change and my emotions won't change.\n\n01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:51.440\nSo I understand everything about it and it's so frustrating, it's so frustrating.\n\n01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.440\nDo you think that, so taking well butchering, what does that do?\n\n01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.440\nDoes it kind of even you out?\n\n01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:02.440\nEverything's not like sharp edges.\n\n01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:05.440\nI'm not reacting to things so harshly.\n\n01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.440\nIt just kind of takes the edge off of things.\n\n01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.440\nIs there anything that you miss?\n\n01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.440\nDo you feel zombified by?\n\n01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.440\nStop taking SSRIs because they completely take away your sex drive and make you gain weight.\n\n01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.440\nWhat's SSRI?\n\n01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.440\nLike serotonin uptake inhibitors.\n\n01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.440\nSelective serotonin uptake inhibitor.\n\n01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.440\nThat defines a different kind of medication.\n\n01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.440\nPsychology major.\n\n01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.440\nThat defines a certain type of medication.\n\n01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.440\nYeah, that affects the serotonin.\n\n01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:35.440\nWell butchering is like a...\n\n01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:38.440\nIt's a MAOI, which I don't even know what it stands for.\n\n01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.440\nSo serotonin, which is like...\n\n01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.440\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.440\nExcuse me, I have a million questions.\n\n01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.440\nSo that happened at what age in your life?\n\n01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.440\nLike when you crossed that threshold?\n\n01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.440\n18.\n\n01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440\nI'm going to deal with this.\n\n01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.440\nAnd you've been on well beechering that whole time?\n\n01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.440\nNo, I've been on SSRIs up until about...\n\n01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.440\nBut those are terrible.\n\n01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.440\nYeah, yeah, I know.\n\n01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:07.440\nI was on them because you just trust your doctor in forever.\n\n01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.440\nAnd I was just like, oh cool.\n\n01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.440\nSo I was on them for so long.\n\n01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.440\nBut then didn't like the effects, kept trying to take myself off.\n\n01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.440\nBut then kept having like really bad episodes.\n\n01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:22.440\nAnd then like finally talked to like actually a holistic psychologist, psychiatrist,\n\n01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.440\nto help me find like the right medication that matched with like what I was good for my body.\n\n01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:34.440\nSo it's a like really long process because like your brain is a fucking like fireworks display.\n\n01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.440\nAnd like there's...\n\n01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.440\nWhen you're 12 years old, people are going to be like,\n\n01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.440\nthis person should have cotton balls taped to their skull.\n\n01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:46.440\nAnd it's like, oh yeah, I'm sure that would help them behave.\n\n01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:50.440\nAnd now I'm clearly pursuing an agenda.\n\n01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:56.440\nBut it just seems like like I have a problem with doctors and pharmacology and stuff.\n\n01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:03.440\nBut at the same time like would you say is going through this labyrinth that you've found like a pill\n\n01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:10.440\nthat it doesn't, it's not like, oh shit, I'm at the top of my game.\n\n01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:17.440\nNo, like I like, if it stays like this for like another 10 years or so, I think like,\n\n01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.440\nI don't think I would try like, I don't know, like EC, like I don't know,\n\n01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.440\nlike I don't know the next step what you would do if you're like depressed forever.\n\n01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.440\nWell, what do you think really would be?\n\n01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.440\nI mean go there, that was the dark crevice that you just approached.\n\n01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440\nLike what would you say?\n\n01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.440\nLike what were you about to say?\n\n01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.440\nI don't want to say ECT, but.\n\n01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.440\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.440\nWhat is it?\n\n01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.440\nLike electroshock therapy.\n\n01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.440\nWell, I mean, but wow, really?\n\n01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.440\nOh yeah, I don't know.\n\n01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.440\nI've heard that works.\n\n01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.440\nLike you would, you would.\n\n01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:48.440\nWell, like one of my favorite authors was severely depressed and he did that,\n\n01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.440\nlike he did that after like multiple years, but then he ended up killing himself.\n\n01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.440\nSo I don't know.\n\n01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.440\nWho was that?\n\n01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.440\nDavid Foster Wallace.\n\n01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.440\nDavid Foster Wallace.\n\n01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.440\nYeah.\n\n01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.440\nThat's what I thought you were going to say.\n\n01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:01.440\nWell, don't.\n\n01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.440\nI'm not going to kill myself.\n\n01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.440\nI'm not going to kill myself.\n\n01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.440\nYou're going to say David Foster Wallace was like, don't say that.\n\n01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.440\nAnd then don't do that.\n\n01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.440\nTara, like what's a good day for you?\n\n01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440\nLike, do you.\n\n01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.440\nI have plenty of good days for sure.\n\n01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.440\nAnd that's just what I just did.\n\n01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.440\nI'm really into yoga.\n\n01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:21.440\nSo I do a lot of yoga, get it up.\n\n01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.440\nIf I get to do yoga, go to work.\n\n01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.440\nI started doing like stand up three weeks ago.\n\n01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.440\nReally?\n\n01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.440\nYeah.\n\n01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.440\nSo.\n\n01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.440\nAwesome.\n\n01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.440\nWhere?\n\n01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.440\nOh, that's fucking ballsy as hell.\n\n01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:38.440\nI have a crazy night feeling that that is like in lieu of like all this fucking like\n\n01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.440\nlabyrinth.\n\n01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.440\nI don't want to keep questioning these guys and their lab coats and stuff.\n\n01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:50.440\nBut like, I, I feel like when you have thoughts in your head and you say them into a microphone\n\n01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:55.440\nand then they can laugh or they can cry or they can sit in silence.\n\n01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.440\nBut what they don't do is the thing that you're afraid that they might do inside your head.\n\n01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.440\nLike the thing that you would project where they would go like, oh, you're a fucking animal.\n\n01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.440\nI'm going to fucking take you and kill you.\n\n01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:12.440\nLike, like, I think like, like, like just talking, just saying it.\n\n01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.440\nThis is very, very self-justifying of me.\n\n01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.440\nBut that that's, I'm not saying it will supplant any kind of therapy.\n\n01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440\nBut I think that's fantastic for you.\n\n01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:28.440\nTo just like communicate and talk empty your head, everything that's in your head, no matter\n\n01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.440\nhow crazy it is, all those jagged edges you're talking about.\n\n01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.440\nI need to like put them out there and then all these people out there like, like, oh, yeah,\n\n01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.440\ntotally.\n\n01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.440\nI got it.\n\n01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.440\nOr some of them are like, really?\n\n01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440\nWow.\n\n01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.440\nOkay.\n\n01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.440\nNew thing to think about.\n\n01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.440\nAnd then like, in any case, it's like, it's gone.\n\n01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.440\nAlso, just to be able to like come up like tonight, not that like we're any big help,\n\n01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.440\nbut like to come up and say the word depression and know that's a thing and say it out loud.\n\n01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:02.440\nBecause we all know people like, you know, like, like Robin, Robin Williams on our show,\n\n01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.440\nlike we met him and stuff.\n\n01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.440\nAnd like, that wasn't something that it was really talked about, you know, and he like,\n\n01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.440\nhe dealt with his own shit for like, for a long, long time.\n\n01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:17.440\nAnd because of him and what happened to him, a lot of comics and like especially comics\n\n01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:23.440\nthat I know that deal with depression, like said, oh, fuck, like, I can, I can talk about\n\n01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.440\nthat.\n\n01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.440\nAnd I need to talk about that.\n\n01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.440\nAnd, and that's a conversation that could happen.\n\n01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.440\nAnd it's not something that's a fake thing.\n\n01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.440\nIt's a real thing.\n\n01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:38.440\nAnd it's a, it's pretty common thing too, especially among artists and like, like in this community.\n\n01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:44.440\nSo like that, you know, like, there was a, there was a time when no one said they had cancer.\n\n01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:48.440\nAnd so people just quietly had cancer and didn't get treatment because that wasn't something\n\n01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:49.440\nthat you did.\n\n01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.440\nYou didn't talk about it.\n\n01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:55.440\nSo it's, it's good to like, like, like open up the like lines of communication on that.\n\n01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:00.440\nAnd like, like, I mean, I can't imagine what that must be like, but it's, it's very impressive\n\n01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:05.440\nthat you can make the journey out to the city and start doing stand-up, which is terrifying.\n\n01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.440\nI do improv stand-up scares me.\n\n01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.440\nLike, well, sadness is never talked about.\n\n01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.440\nIt's like, it's people too sad.\n\n01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.440\nBut it's like fucking hilarious.\n\n01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.440\nYeah.\n\n01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440\nWell, yeah, hilarious.\n\n01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:21.440\nAnd you're like, put like a yes to it.\n\n01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.440\nI'm always harping on that.\n\n01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.440\nSo like the, the, the Campbell talked about that.\n\n01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.440\nThat it's like the first joke we hear is the game of peekaboo, which is like a kid.\n\n01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.440\nIt's just a kid that they need their mom to be there.\n\n01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:38.440\nSo bad that their mom not being there is tear is the equivalent of death.\n\n01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:44.440\nAnd so the mom does not really realizing that she's playing on death with the kid goes like,\n\n01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:48.440\nlike, like it's, it's, it's, it's universal.\n\n01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.440\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.440\nIt transcends language, culture, everything.\n\n01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.440\nIt's like moms with little kids.\n\n01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.440\nThey, they, they do this thing.\n\n01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.440\nThey cover their face and the baby starts to go.\n\n01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:03.440\nAnd then the mom like exposes her face and the baby goes.\n\n01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:10.440\nAnd the baby goes.\n\n01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.440\nIt's, it's the first joke.\n\n01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:17.440\nAnd then like, like his comedy is fucking like, it's, it's like, it only comes from the gut\n\n01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:23.440\nwhen it's like, no, I understand death, like, like despair, like the, the, the bottoms and\n\n01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.440\nthe tops of, of, of this entire valve that we're being pushed through.\n\n01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.440\nThat's, that's what it is.\n\n01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:32.440\nAnd the great standups that like, like all the, all the, all my heroes as a standup,\n\n01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.440\nthere's an incredible, awesome, terrifying loneliness that goes on for the great standups\n\n01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:41.440\nthat get out there and are willing to stand alone on stage and expose themselves like\n\n01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.440\nthat.\n\n01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:46.440\nLike that's, that's, that's a tremendous amount of courage and, and to be good at\n\n01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:51.440\nthat is to be willing to like wallow in that, like that sol, solitude.\n\n01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.440\nYeah.\n\n01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:56.440\nComing out to LA by yourself and subjecting yourself to that, like, who knows if you'd\n\n01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:01.440\never be funny, but like God knows, like, yeah, the, the, the, you're, you're already\n\n01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:02.440\non the right path.\n\n01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:05.440\nLike, like step on the gas in that direction that you would stand in front of a microphone\n\n01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:10.440\nand go, I would experiment with like, what's the least funny thing I could say to these\n\n01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.440\npeople?\n\n01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.440\nWhat's the thing I could say that would make them want to blow their brains out because\n\n01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:21.440\nthey're one step from that to a amazing punchline, which is Mitch Hedberg and like, like, like,\n\n01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:25.440\nlike, you know, it, probably a bad example.\n\n01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:30.440\nThe, the, it's not a bad example because like fucking great comics, they fucking, they,\n\n01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:34.440\nthey die young because they're, they're all over the place.\n\n01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.440\nArtists are all over the place.\n\n01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:40.440\nUm, forgive yourself for being all over the place for sure.\n\n01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:45.440\nLike, like, like, like, like, like, like, just like a Monday, it's like, I'm the greatest\n\n01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:46.440\nperson in the world.\n\n01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.440\nAnd Monday afternoon, it's like, I'm such a piece of shit.\n\n01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:53.440\nI like, like, that's absolutely, that's called being creative.\n\n01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:56.440\nI think that's the engine that drives it.\n\n01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:02.440\nIt's not a license to be like, I call the lumber yard and go, I'm not going to do lumber anymore.\n\n01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:09.440\nDan Harmon told me if I have mood swings, I'm an artist.\n\n01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.440\nIt's not necessarily true.\n\n01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.440\nLike, like, like, like it's, but what it is is it's, it's absolutely part and parcel of,\n\n01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.440\nof, of creating shit for sure.\n\n01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.440\nI kind of, I kind of feel like we dragged you up and asked you for your bullshit and then told you\n\n01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.440\nabout your shit that you probably already know.\n\n01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.440\nLike, let me tell you another thing, young lady.\n\n01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:31.440\nBut the big takeaway is that you're not alone.\n\n01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.440\nThere's, there's, there's so many.\n\n01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.440\nI mean, this podcast has helped a lot.\n\n01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.440\nNo, these pieces are shit.\n\n01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.440\nThey're, they're here for everybody, honestly.\n\n01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:42.440\nI mean, the fact that like half the crowd knew when you said SRTIS, whatever that thing was,\n\n01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:46.440\nlike a couple of people were like, boo, and a couple of people were like, yeah.\n\n01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.440\nPeople knew what it meant.\n\n01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:52.440\nLike, there's probably a handful or more of people that also like suffer from depression here.\n\n01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.440\nLike, it's right.\n\n01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.440\nYup.\n\n01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.440\nDave Kline, you're the first.\n\n01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:02.440\nDave Kline's deep, deep, deep, deep depression sufferer.\n\n01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440\nWe met at Rob Schrupp's birthday.\n\n01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.440\nWe do.\n\n01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.440\nYou had my birthday?\n\n01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.440\nWe smoked a joint in the back.\n\n01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.440\nYou went, you went to my birthday and sent a family?\n\n01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.440\nYeah.\n\n01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.440\nYou had a good time?\n\n01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.440\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:21.440\nThat was very, very sweet of you.\n\n01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.440\nBut Dan was in New York.\n\n01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.440\nDan was in New York. He had an excuse.\n\n01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.440\nHe had an excuse, no.\n\n01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.440\nNo, Dan had an excuse because my birthday only happens once.\n\n01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.440\nAnd it's not a different date every year.\n\n01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.440\nIt's hard to keep track.\n\n01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.440\nBut thank you.\n\n01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.440\nThank you so much for coming.\n\n01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.440\nDid you have a good time?\n\n01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:38.440\nYeah, it was a great birthday party.\n\n01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.440\nThank you.\n\n01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.440\nIt was a fun time.\n\n01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.440\nOh, well, great.\n\n01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.440\nTara, have you made any friends since you've been out here?\n\n01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.440\nLike, how long, how long have you been out again?\n\n01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.440\nAbout a month, a little over a month.\n\n01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.440\nHave you made any friends since you've been here?\n\n01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.440\nKind of?\n\n01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.440\nKind of, yeah.\n\n01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.440\nI mean, that's the hardest part, for sure.\n\n01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.440\nDo you have any close friends back home?\n\n01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.440\nI want, like, genuine connection friends.\n\n01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.440\nOf course.\n\n01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:00.440\nBut you make, like, five-minute friends here.\n\n01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.440\nActually, I know.\n\n01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.440\nBut you'll make lifelong friends very quickly.\n\n01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.440\nYeah.\n\n01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.440\nFor certain.\n\n01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:10.440\nJust reject the first five from this crowd because you've been up here.\n\n01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.440\nThe first five are going to be just flush up.\n\n01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.440\nExcuse me, Ms. Middle-Eady.\n\n01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.440\nI just put them in the battered deck.\n\n01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.440\nThank God Ryan Ridley's not here.\n\n01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:32.440\nWell, would you do us the honor of staying up here and playing Shadowrun with us?\n\n01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.440\nOkay.\n\n01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.440\nYay.\n\n01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.440\nI love it.\n\n01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.440\nAll right.\n\n01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:40.440\nYou missed my Ryan Ridley impression.\n\n01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:46.440\nKids, if you're feeling sad, talk to people.\n\n01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.440\nYou got to talk to someone.\n\n01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.440\nYou're not alone.\n\n01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.440\nDon't do anything.\n\n01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.440\nShe's not case in point.\n\n01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:53.440\nShe's an adult and was, like, dealing with her shit.\n\n01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.440\nI'm saying, as long as we're on the topic, because I have a Tumblr and I get these messages\n\n01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:01.440\nand these kids are, like, fucking, like, tell me what to do.\n\n01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:03.440\nAnd, like, they're on the precipice.\n\n01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:13.440\nIt's a fucking, like, if you're below 35 and you're thinking about, like, the extreme\n\n01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:19.440\nversion of the solution to your problems, just before you do that, experiment, since\n\n01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.440\nyou're about to do that, just try talking to somebody.\n\n01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.440\nJust talk to somebody.\n\n01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.440\nIt's not, like, just give it a shot.\n\n01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:28.440\nDo something crazy.\n\n01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:29.440\nLike, go walk across.\n\n01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:35.440\nLike, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to just, like, try and walk across America first.\n\n01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.440\nLike, if you're going to hit the point, just do something crazy.\n\n01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.440\nLike, do something crazy first, see if it changes anything in your brain.\n\n01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:47.440\nBut it will stress that one of the aggravating things when you're in that state is that people\n\n01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.440\napproaching you logically and saying, the reason you shouldn't do it is because, look,\n\n01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.440\nit's a wonderful life.\n\n01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.440\nAnd it's like, fuck you.\n\n01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.440\nIt's not a logic thing.\n\n01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:58.440\nIt's just, like, fucking, it's a grand theft auto thing.\n\n01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.440\nLike, you're about to do it.\n\n01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.440\nJust fucking do one thing first, talk to somebody.\n\n01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:05.440\nYou've got to hear it.\n\n01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.440\nIt's rattling around in your brain.\n\n01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.440\nIt's not, like, just fucking, have it come out of your mouth.\n\n01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.440\nEverybody feels that way.\n\n01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:16.440\nSometimes you may feel that way all the time.\n\n01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.440\nLike, you've got to talk to somebody about it.\n\n01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.440\nLike, if you're under a certain age, it's an epidemic.\n\n01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:23.440\nWhat are you saying?\n\n01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.440\nAre you saying over 35 steps?\n\n01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:32.440\nNo, I'm just saying, like, over 35, if you want to kill yourself, fuck you.\n\n01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.440\nWell, that's a hard line.\n\n01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:37.440\nDan's taking a hard line.\n\n01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.440\nIt's a joke.\n\n01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.440\nIt's a joke.\n\n01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:44.440\nWell, Tara, thank you, like, for all of our hearts.\n\n01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.440\nThat's fucking awesome.\n\n01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:50.440\nThank you for being vulnerable to us and sharing your...\n\n01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.440\nThank you, guys.\n\n01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.440\nLike, take whatever pain you've got there and, like, turn it into beautiful artwork\n\n01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.440\nfor the rest of us.\n\n01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.440\nDon't tell us what to do.\n\n01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.440\nBecause that's...\n\n01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.440\nI think that you...\n\n01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.440\nIf you look back through the history of, like, art and culture,\n\n01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.440\nI think you'd probably find out a lot of people were going through something similar,\n\n01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.440\nyou know, and different, or maybe exactly the same.\n\n01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:18.440\nI think a lot of what's benefited humanity is people, like, turning intense pain into...\n\n01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:25.440\nThat's what humans probably have different than most other animals is that we take our sadness\n\n01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.440\nand we've created art, you know, so...\n\n01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.440\nAll right, hit the showers, Jeff.\n\n01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.440\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.440\nThat offended you.\n\n01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.440\nNo, it didn't offend me.\n\n01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.440\nIt offended everybody else.\n\n01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:37.440\nThat's not true.\n\n01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.440\nThey laughed.\n\n01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.440\nWe have showers.\n\n01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.440\nI'm gonna hand this pile of things down.\n\n01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.440\nI don't know what to do with them.\n\n01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.440\nI have my own character.\n\n01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.440\nI don't have my sunglasses, so I won't be able to read them.\n\n01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.440\nRob doesn't have his sunglasses.\n\n01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:53.440\nI don't have my sunglasses, so I won't be able to read them.\n\n01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.440\nWhat about Timorge?\n\n01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.440\nAlso...\n\n01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.440\nYeah, Timorge!\n\n01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440\nWhat the fuck is Timorge?\n\n01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.440\nTimorge Brown!\n\n01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.440\nTimorge!\n\n01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440\nWho am I?\n\n01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440\nWhat's my character?\n\n01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.440\nYou can sit on my lap if you want.\n\n01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.440\nI'll take...\n\n01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:11.440\nI'll take...\n\n01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.440\nCan you read it for me?\n\n01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.440\nAre you playing your character?\n\n01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.440\nI'll play...\n\n01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.440\nDo you want to play?\n\n01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:16.440\nDo you want to play?\n\n01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.440\nYou usually hate to play this game.\n\n01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.440\nI think that Timorge should sit.\n\n01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.440\nI was...\n\n01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.440\nThis is racist.\n\n01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.440\nI agree with Spencer.\n\n01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440\nYeah.\n\n01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440\nI think...\n\n01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.440\nI think...\n\n01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.440\nOkay, well let's let you be the judge.\n\n01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:31.440\nIs it racist if you're standing the whole show?\n\n01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.440\nNo.\n\n01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440\nI like you all in black, Timorge.\n\n01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.440\nIt's a good look for you.\n\n01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.440\nThe man in black is nice.\n\n01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:40.440\nI want you to blend in with the tablecloth.\n\n01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.440\nLet's get...\n\n01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.440\nLet's see...\n\n01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:45.440\nI mean, Steve Levy gets paid to just exist.\n\n01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.440\nTimorge, take his seat.\n\n01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.440\nWhoa!\n\n01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.440\nSorry, Steve.\n\n01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.440\nWhat do you mean, whoa?\n\n01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.440\nYou know, it's acceptable losses.\n\n01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.440\nLet's be honest.\n\n01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440\nCapitalism.\n\n01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.440\nLevy knew what he signed up for.\n\n01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.440\nSteve Levy.\n\n01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:00.440\nThanks, man.\n\n01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.440\nHe's been summarily dismissed.\n\n01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:05.440\nHe had my back on Lord of the Rings.\n\n01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.440\nWhat can I say?\n\n01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.440\nCome on, you guys.\n\n01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.440\nI'm right.\n\n01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.440\nI'm right about that.\n\n01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:12.440\nYou know, I've been away for a bit.\n\n01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.440\nThe mission up till now, you guys are off to...\n\n01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.440\nRob has become a southern bell, ghoul, and disguise.\n\n01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.440\nRight?\n\n01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.440\nYeah.\n\n01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:22.440\nDo you know what happened?\n\n01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.440\nYou should tell us.\n\n01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.440\nThat was my ghoul voice.\n\n01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440\nWell, you have the recap for us.\n\n01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.440\nI mean, I don't.\n\n01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.440\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.440\nNo one wrote one.\n\n01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.440\nOkay, real quick.\n\n01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.440\nThis is really falling down.\n\n01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.440\nGet me up to speed on what the mission is and where we're at in the mission.\n\n01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.440\nAll right.\n\n01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440\nYou got hired.\n\n01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440\nYou got hired by Peggy.\n\n01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:42.440\nYou got hired by Peggy to find her daughter, Jim, who was last seen at one of these ghoul\n\n01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.440\nclinics, the kind that teaches ghouls how to not eat people.\n\n01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.200\nSo you were going around.\n\n01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.440\nYou saw David, one of Hortegaard's, no, Dr. Friend's friends.\n\n01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.600\nYou talked to him about meat markets.\n\n01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:55.760\nYou went back.\n\n01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:58.280\nYou called a bunch of people.\n\n01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.120\nAnd then you decided to go to the clinic where you thought that might be some more information.\n\n01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:05.120\nAnd...\n\n01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.120\nDidn't there be music over this?\n\n01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:15.120\nJustin Marshall is driving back from Wisconsin.\n\n01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.120\nOh, he drove there?\n\n01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.120\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.120\nIt's bad weather.\n\n01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.120\nAll right.\n\n01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.120\nSo are we...\n\n01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.120\nAre we...\n\n01:41:22.120 -->

ghoul in disguise and we're going up to a...\n\n01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:29.120\nIs this a fresh to...\n\n01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.120\nFresh to flesh?\n\n01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:31.120\nA flesh to

--> 01:44:05.120\nI have also taken...\n\n01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.120\nWhat character are you playing?\n\n01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.120\nI have no fucking idea.\n\n01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:12.120\nI've taken your makeup kit, and so I have...\n\n01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:17.120\nEve Libertine, I have made myself into Southern Belle as well.\n\n01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:20.120\nYou have a little mush on there.\n\n01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.120\nYou're a little...\n\n01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.120\nHere, let me do it.\n\n01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.120\nAll right.\n\n01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.120\nYou're good.\n\n01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.120\nOkay, now we all look like ghouls.\n\n01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:33.120\nI'm going to go to the front door and see if we can get in here.\n\n01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:39.120\nJust as a bit of descent could hold the guard,\n\n01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.120\nmaybe not go with the makeup kit,\n\n01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:46.120\nand adopt the personality of his security guard ID.\n\n01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.120\nSure, yeah, definitely.\n\n01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.120\nJust as an alternate.\n\n01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.120\nThat...\n\n01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.120\nWhat?\n\n01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:56.120\nIt seems a bit uncomfortable that it...\n\n01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:59.120\nI guess one of us won't be a ghoul then.\n\n01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.120\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\n01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.120\nAll right.\n\n01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:08.120\nI hope that I will stand ten feet behind you as if to present you, possibly.\n\n01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.120\nOkay, so I guess I won't do all the talking.\n\n01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.120\nYou'll do all the talking.\n\n01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:16.120\nOh, no, you can do all the talking.\n\n01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.120\nPlease do.\n\n01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.120\nThey will recognize you as ghouls.\n\n01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.120\nAll right, all right.\n\n01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.120\nSo, like, Tara and I are going to go up,\n\n01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.120\nand you pretend like you're...\n\n01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.120\nYou caught us.\n\n01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.120\nOkay.\n\n01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.120\nYeah, okay, just cheer.\n\n01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.120\nYou got to eat that mic.\n\n01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:34.120\nYou got to eat that mic.\n\n01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.120\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.120\nBut I'm going to knock on the door.\n\n01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.120\nDon't take that from me.\n\n01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.120\nI'm with you, too.\n\n01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.120\nPlease let it be.\n\n01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.120\nAll right, you knock on the door.\n\n01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.120\nYeah, thank you.\n\n01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:54.120\nNever in my mind have I heard such a ghoul-ish knock.\n\n01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.120\nWhat?\n\n01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:56.120\nTwenty...\n\n01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:59.120\nTwenty minutes passes.\n\n01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.120\nI should probably knock again.\n\n01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:20.120\nI should probably knock again.\n\n01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:26.120\nUsing an active soft via electronics,\n\n01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.120\ncan I just access the opening of the door?\n\n01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.120\nOh, I mean, you don't even need electronics.\n\n01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.120\nThere's a handle.\n\n01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:35.120\nYeah.\n\n01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.120\nI reach out and open the door.\n\n01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.120\nAll right.\n\n01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.120\nYou open the door.\n\n01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.120\nBut I'm still fanning with my right hand.\n\n01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:46.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.120\nLeft hand to open the door.\n\n01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.120\nFanning with my right hand.\n\n01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.120\nAll right.\n\n01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.120\nMay I suggest a Blue Angels formation with one in the front,\n\n01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:54.120\ntwo sort of a chevron?\n\n01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.120\nStarburst.\n\n01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.120\nStarburst.\n\n01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.120\nWell, is it starburst or chevron?\n\n01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.120\nLet's get this straight.\n\n01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:02.120\nWe starburst and the starburst, we form a chevron.\n\n01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.120\nOkay.\n\n01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:04.120\nAll right.\n\n01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.120\nYou enter a large waiting room.\n\n01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.120\nIt's walls covered by huge flat panel screens,\n\n01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.120\ncalming scenes of nature.\n\n01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.120\nYou see several low waiting chairs\n\n01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:16.120\nand a young man seated at a large circular desk\n\n01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:18.120\nin the middle of the room.\n\n01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.120\nI'll do all the talking.\n\n01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.120\nHe's pale and you can see from his clawed fingers\n\n01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:26.120\nthat he's clearly a ghoul.\n\n01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.120\nHe's got the dead eyes of a ghoul.\n\n01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.120\nAre you listening?\n\n01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:32.120\nHe's a fucking ghoul.\n\n01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:34.120\nHe's dressed like a ghoul.\n\n01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.120\nI'm dressed like a ghoul too.\n\n01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:38.120\nI've got my parasol and my fan.\n\n01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.120\nHi.\n\n01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:43.120\nAs you get closer, you see his dead eyes\n\n01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.120\nhave been replaced with robot eyes.\n\n01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.120\nCyber eyes, rather.\n\n01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:51.120\nI couldn't help but notice you have some cyber eyes.\n\n01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:59.120\nPerhaps you could tell me where they keep all of the meat.\n\n01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.120\nWhat are we after?\n\n01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.120\nWe're after the...\n\n01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.120\nYeah, look to meat.\n\n01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:09.120\nWe're trying to find Jim Peggy's daughter.\n\n01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:13.120\nWe're trying to find Peggy's daughter, Jim.\n\n01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.120\nMaybe you could use your cybernetic eye sockets\n\n01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.120\nto show us where that could be,\n\n01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:24.120\nseeing as how we're both ghouls and all.\n\n01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.120\nYeah, no, no problem.\n\n01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:28.120\nLet me just check the registry.\n\n01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:30.120\nTicket, ticket, ticket, ticket.\n\n01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.120\nShe's not listed here.\n\n01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:35.120\nIs there a last name or anything?\n\n01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.120\nUh, probably. Could you check again?\n\n01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.120\nYeah, certainly.\n\n01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.120\nTicket, ticket, ticket, ticket.\n\n01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.120\nNope, there's no one by that name.\n\n01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.120\nWe're a pretty new operation,\n\n01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.120\nso it's pretty easy to see whether or not\n\n01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.120\nanyone has come through or not,\n\n01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:52.120\nand I'm not seeing that.\n\n01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:55.120\nOh, do we have the last name or not?\n\n01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:57.120\nHill.\n\n01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.120\nHill was the last name.\n\n01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.120\nJim Hill.\n\n01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.120\nYep.\n\n01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.120\nYou did.\n\n01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:07.120\nOkay, or Dan will.\n\n01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:13.120\nI've spent the last couple of days researching your operation.\n\n01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.120\nPretty familiar with the fact that your spreadsheets\n\n01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.120\ndon't include everything they should.\n\n01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:24.120\nKind of looking for a girl that came through\n\n01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.120\nand then went out, you know what I mean?\n\n01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:29.120\nYeah, no, like I said, we just opened up pretty recently.\n\n01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.120\nLike goodness, I could have told you\n\n01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.120\nanyone who's walked through these doors,\n\n01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.120\nthat name, definitely not here.\n\n01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.120\nSo here's what I'm going to tell you.\n\n01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.120\nLike, this is the point where you either\n\n01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:43.120\nbetray yourself to be useless or useful.\n\n01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:45.120\nOkay.\n\n01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:47.120\nIf you're useful, it's because you're lying.\n\n01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:49.120\nIf you're useless, it's because you're an idiot.\n\n01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.120\nAlright.\n\n01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:54.120\nI got a gun in my arm.\n\n01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.120\nIt's going to come out at the speed of light.\n\n01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.120\nA bullet's going to go through your brain.\n\n01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.120\nAlright.\n\n01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.120\nWell, I'm sorry, what?\n\n01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:05.120\nBoop.\n\n01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.120\nBoom, shooting you.\n\n01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.120\nLet's do a reaction.\n\n01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.120\nSorry.\n\n01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:13.120\nIt's reflect.\n\n01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:15.120\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.120\nIt's what I do.\n\n01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.120\nYou had your chance.\n\n01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.120\nYou did a terrible job.\n\n01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.120\nI tried once and you shot it in the brain.\n\n01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.120\nYou talk to people and you say garbage.\n\n01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:27.120\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.120\nI shoot people in the head.\n\n01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.120\nIt's my job.\n\n01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.120\nIt's all I do.\n\n01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:35.120\nWhat is he doing?\n\n01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:37.120\nI shoot people in the head.\n\n01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:39.120\nOh gosh.\n\n01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.120\nThe minute I'm needed\n\n01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:43.120\nis the minute you failed.\n\n01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.120\nAlright.\n\n01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.120\nWell, he's dead.\n\n01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:49.120\nOkay, quick.\n\n01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:51.120\nHe's dead.\n\n01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:53.120\nWhat?\n\n01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.120\nWhat?\n\n01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.120\nI can't hear the game master.\n\n01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.120\nWhat happened?\n\n01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.120\nYeah, I don't care what everyone's laughing at.\n\n01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:03.120\nIt was funny probably.\n\n01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.120\nTerrorists are something funny but I couldn't hear it.\n\n01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:07.120\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:09.120\nSorry, Tara.\n\n01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.120\nTara, what?\n\n01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.120\nIt's fine.\n\n01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:15.120\nIt's just like a perfect Sean Connery impression.\n\n01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.120\nIt's like, do Sean Connery again?\n\n01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:19.120\nNope, nope.\n\n01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:21.120\nMost things down here are not regular.\n\n01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:23.120\nHe falls forward.\n\n01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.120\nOn to the security button.\n\n01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.120\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.120\nI go through his computer\n\n01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.120\nor I guess desk and see if I can
