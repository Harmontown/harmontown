WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.560
Alright, that was chosen at random. Ladies and gentlemen, buckle your holy shit belts.

00:15.560 --> 00:22.600
From the Nerdmelt Theater in Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session!

00:22.600 --> 00:37.040
From the deepest darkest mists of my imagination, and all the concentration I can conjure, is

00:37.040 --> 00:53.200
there a Spencer Crittenden among us? Spencer Crittenden to the stage!

00:53.200 --> 00:58.000
You got your shorts back on. Oh yeah. I heard about your pants last week and I was alarmed.

00:58.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh, everyone was. Everyone was. How you doing, Spencer? I'm so good. That means he's high!

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:12.000 --> 01:33.000
Beat, beat to the street, street, everyone two feet, two feet, walk two feet, walk on the street, to the beat.

01:33.000 --> 01:48.000
Whoa, hey, beat to the street, two feet, what the fuck, what the fuck, two feet, beat to the street.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Street meat, the king of the street, you see him walking two feet from across the street.

01:53.000 --> 02:07.000
Street feet is a lesson too, because you can't let the two feet beat you.

02:07.000 --> 02:16.000
Okay, sorry about that. I didn't know that. I didn't know we had beef.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
Dan, our fucking street beef has gone on for two lives. Street beef, the beef.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
You see him rocking that? Black on the street to the beef. I mean, don't let the beef street you.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
Dan, as the mayor, you walked out and you said, keep that beat going, keep that beat going.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
There was only 30 seconds left of that beat. So your solution was to hit the pedal to the middle.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
Do you want to go back to that beat? No, no, give me a different beat.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
You sure? Yeah. Give me a good one. A slow one.

02:54.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, same beat. Yeah, same beat. Same beat. Yeah, same beat.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
Culture, Christmas, street rhythm.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
That's not part of the rap. You have one minute 40 left.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
You want to start from the top? Ignoring that. No, ignoring that.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Two minutes. Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
Street beef, street. Street beef, street beef, street beef.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Every street has a beat to it's street. Every street has one or two feet.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
Every street walks along its own street. It seems like a contradiction.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
How can you walk on yourself? The answer is, oh shit. Street beef, yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
You got to ask yourself, how can you walk on yourself, on yourself? Street beef, street beef.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm the street beef. My name is street beef. I'm a street beef.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Professor street beats go into the beats. I got one, two left, right, right.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
I went down to the street today and I saw your mama and I said, hey,

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
and she said, do you want a newspaper? And I said, no, because of the internet.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Okay. All right. That's good.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
You have a minute and five left. You have a minute and five left.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Okay, okay, okay. What else is going on? Dick Cheney?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I heard Dick Cheney. One minute. Yo.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Dick Cheney. Iraq War or Dick Cheney? Dick Cheney.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
And Plummer and Reggae. Okay. 54 seconds.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
I saw Dick Cheney just the other day. He was fighting in an Iraq war in his usual way.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
He was trying to flim the toilet and ISIS came and whoa.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
40 seconds. All right. 4chan. Did you say 4chan?

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
40 seconds. I thought he said 4chan.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
All right. Yo, yo, yo, yo. Okay. Two minutes. You have two minutes.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Two minutes. He's like an aerobics instructor.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
You and the lady in the front row with the yellow hat on.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
That's Heather. That's our friend. Hello, Heather.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Heather. Good to see you.

05:07.000 --> 05:15.000
Heather, name or say a word that starts with the first letter of Dan's name.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
Duck. Okay. Yo, yo, okay. Two minutes. Two minutes.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Yo, yo, duck. Make it all about ducks. No tangents. Just ducks.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
Yo, yo, one, two, rap, go.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Web feet on the pond swimming around.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
A woman, a fond of, is over on the other shore.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
I'm going to go over to her and say, hey, you want more of my duck penis?

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
She's like, no. And then we're into a whole thing.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
But migraton, migraton. Duck leader flies through the sky.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
It's time to fly south and we don't know why, because our brains are the size of peas,

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
but they're developed over six million years and we've got magnets in our ears.

06:09.000 --> 06:18.000
And that's like a mix of fly and like a truly intricate like patterns that even humans marvel at.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Yo.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah, I think rhyming is overrated.

06:23.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah. All right. Thank you everybody. Jeff Davis.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
I was here to help the fucking set you up to fucking blow people's mind.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
You see, Dan, people only pay $5 to watch you make that face.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Most people listen for free and they don't know that you're making a face.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
No, you did a great job. You're a really good friend.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
For your listening, he's giving two thumbs up.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Wait, he just gave three thumbs up?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
One's his dick.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Obviously, tonight's one of those nights when we're all a little, probably a little drunk.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm fucking sober as a judge.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
All right. I'll be the noble one and admit that I got a little drunk today.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah. Thank you, kid. Thank you.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
You really think it's so glamorous and then I'll see you in fucking hell.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
Here's what I got. Everything's about fucking porn and stuff on my notes.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
When you say it's about fucking porn, is it just porn on your notes?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I don't know. It's just all about dicks and balls and stuff.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Or those things relating to it.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
Like last week, we had the young lady come up and she tried to explain Tinder to me and Rob.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
And I was talking about it because I was like, still, oh, she didn't...

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
She tried to explain Tinder and she did say, I think the most interesting thing that she said

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
was because I'll never understand Tinder.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I haven't installed it and used it, but I thought...

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
I was thinking and I wrote it down and the most important thing was that Tinder was an offshoot of Grindr,

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
which Grindr was like gay dudes going like, who wants to fuck a butt or suck a nut?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Or it doesn't have to rhyme when you're gay.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Okay. We're going to play it.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
Yo. Yo. Yo. Grindr. MC Grindr.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
I'm equal to everyone and you've chased me to the shadows.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
You get what you deserve. Yo. Yo.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
My IQ is 200. I have a bowel disposable income.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
I'm a good person. I deserve to have the right to be married.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
And you underestimate me? Fuck you.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
MC Grindr. Fucking butts. MC Grindr. Licking nuts.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
MC Grindr. What is butts? MC Grindr.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Oh!

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Okay. All right.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
That's a... I'm a big fan of the gay people.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
I'll tell you, meltdown audience, we haven't heard the last of MC Grindr tonight.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
He will certainly be repriezed at some point.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
There will be gay MCs emailing in going like, that's not fair.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
You're making me seem like being gay makes you a bad rapper.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
I say to all... I say to all of our gay MC listeners out there,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
I challenge you to come down to Meltdown Comics.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
That would be amazing.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Just have a gay MC Grindr rep off.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
If you're a gay MC, well, obviously you should just come down no matter what.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I don't want to pit them against each other.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
No, no. Them against you.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
It's you.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Is there a way I could just be a bad guy?

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Could I just be like cis rapper?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Like straight heteronormative rapper?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
MC heteronormative.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Yo, everyone should fit in a dichotomy.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Yo, yo, your pleasure needs a lobotomy.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
Yo, I'm the mainstream Jim Belushi.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
I'm fat, 45-year-old, piece of shit.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Another guy comes up, whoa, yo, state the name.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
My name's MC Grindr and I'm here to say it.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
He's like, he rocks the world.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Or she.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Is Grindr only men?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Is Grindr only gay males or is it gay women too?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Of course it's gay women too.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I don't fucking know.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
What kind of genie lamp are you trying to rub?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Of course it's gay women too.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't...

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's what?

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
You're all racist.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
No, I meant the gay rap battles for women too.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I don't know what Grindr's for.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Is there a woman homosexual Grindr?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Is there a scissor?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Scissor?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Are you joking?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
It's scissor without an O, it's a scissor.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Scissor.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Scissor and the slogan is, it doesn't exist.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
It's not real.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
It's a myth.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
There are several gay women apps?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Datch.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Datch?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
What does datch mean?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
It's a lesbian dating app, but it wasn't successful for me.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
It wasn't successful for you.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Datch didn't work for you?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Why, you met the wrong kind of people?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
It just didn't meet anybody.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
You didn't meet anybody?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
No.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
There's no one on it, it's not like...

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
It's easier to swipe on Tinder and figure out who's queer.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Alright.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
You guys, go away.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I have a conversation with Heather who...

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Remember, she's like...

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
It's easier to use Tinder and try to figure out who's gay.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Heather, was it you that made the awesome comic strip?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
No.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Who's that?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Who was the person that made the awesome comic?

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Rob Schrupp.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
Okay, alright, okay.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Rob Schrupp to the stage.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Bring him out, bring him out.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
No, get him out here.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Rob.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
The phantom of the opera is here.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Bring him out.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Schrupp.

12:12.000 --> 12:35.000
What's up, Rob?

12:35.000 --> 12:45.000
I'm just making a drink.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
Stop, stop.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
This guy likes ice.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
A lot of ice.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
Alright, I'm sorry.

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
What was your comic book called?

13:09.000 --> 13:16.000
Alright, so who in the crowd...

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Well, sit there for the cameras.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Right there?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Is that good, Chris?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Alright.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
We went a nice two shot of you guys.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Give me a good two shot.

13:27.000 --> 13:37.000
You guys are familiar with a male porn performer named Nick Manning.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
His catchphrase is dropping loads.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
It's a man who, when he comes, he says dropping loads.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
He says it out loud.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
He goes dropping loads, dropping loads.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I'm not the first person to this party.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
He's been on Stern and stuff like that.

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
He was in a Batman parody where he said dropping bat load.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So it's obviously like, because I was tired.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I was like, well, who's the dropping loads guy?

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
And I said, yeah.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I was looking for his videos.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
He's in a million videos, but his most...

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
You were looking for his videos in particular?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah, I typed his name in to...

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Because you like watching the guys say dropping loads while they're coming?

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
I wanted to check up on him and see if he was...

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
I don't see a problem.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
His most recent videos, he maintains this caveman persona.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
He goes like, he no longer says dropping loads.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
This is the fascinating thing.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
No, you gotta pay him.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
That's why I think he signed a contract.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
I haven't dug deep, but I clicked on the first three videos.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
It's just him going like, he grabs a woman and goes like, sex.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
And then she starts thinking, he goes, dick in mouth.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
He's basically Cookie Monster.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
But you're into this guy?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Am I into this guy?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
You're searching his videos in particular.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Is America into FDR?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I don't know.

15:11.000 --> 15:18.000
He dropped the loads of socialism on a country that needed it when it needed it.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
You enjoy that porn?

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
The Golden Gate Bridge exists because of loads dropped at the right time.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't know, am I into it?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I don't know.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Are you into Jellinger?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Are you into Ben Franklin?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Are you into Kitty Hawk?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Are you into fucking Skittles?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Are you into Apple Pie?

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
This is the weirdest parade I've ever seen.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
Are you clicking on this guy's porn because it's sexy to you or because you like him as a personality?

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I want to check in on him and I want to know.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I want to watch him say drop in loads.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
I bet you somebody's got a super cut.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
Of course, on YouTube it's all audio, but the thing is, I want to see dick.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Why did he drop him?

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
I want to just see the audio, I want to see him say dropping loads and his dick.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Instead of going to YouTube?

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
But trivia, Rick and Morty fans, season two, there's a... season two?

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
The Zardaz thing that's floating in the planet, it's going drop in loads.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
That's a Nick Manning reference.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
And the Zardaz face is Nick Manning.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
But he doesn't say it anywhere, but he says these crazy things and goes,

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
Oh, your pussy juice is on my balls.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Are you jerking off to this shit?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
You're watching him and he's going like, are you...

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
He's like Lenny Bruce.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
It's like you don't like porn.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
He doesn't like it.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
He's like, porn is bullshit.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I feel like he's screaming at us and going,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, pussy juice is great.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And you're kind of like...

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
Oh, so you are jerking off to this guy's porn?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Whoa, why wouldn't I?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm there.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
It's porn.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
But you're clicking in.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Grow up.

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
You're typing in the name of a guy that says dropping loads and I'm going to eat that pussy juice.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
You're already making him sound dumber than he is.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah, but you're not going to take this seriously.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
You can just stand down for a second.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Dropping loads.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
And you're jerking off.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Okay, you went too far on that one.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
You don't like it.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I don't feel like you're receptive to this.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I'm listening.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm receptive to finding out what the fuck is going on.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
My whole list is about just fucking...

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Loads and rapping.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Tonight's a blue show.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
We're working blue.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Because we were talking to Dino tonight.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Dino was telling the story.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Here, get ready to go.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Our truth.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Dino has this...

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
This classic story.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
That's green.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
He's told a million times.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I know.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
It's beyond blue.

17:56.000 --> 18:03.000
I'm pretty sure Dino's told the story on the podcast where Dino was in a hotel somewhere out of town.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
And he ran into a trans...

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
He knew he or she and put a pin in your offence.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Because that's the point of the story.

18:16.000 --> 18:24.000
He saw a prostitute kind of figure hanging outside a hotel.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
Upon first sight of him said, like, hi.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Room 315.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
And he was like, okay.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And then later on that night he went up to the room.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
And then this person who was presenting as a very attractive woman.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
But who had a wiener.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
And that Dino knew had a wiener when he saw her.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
But was like, I'm into this.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
I'm going to go to this room.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
And he went to the room.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
And then he has this sexual encounter with this person.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
And he was retelling the story tonight.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And I just thought it was so funny.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
Because while he was saying it, I don't know if it was a man or a woman.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And that triggered my millennial...

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I was like, well, come on.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
What were they presenting as?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
But it's so funny because Dino is the new Archie Bunker.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Because all he...

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
We were like riffing on if all in the family was made today.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
Meathead would be the one going, Archie, come on.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Are you telling me you spent the night with this person?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
You don't know what they were presenting as?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
What pronoun they preferred?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And Archie Bunker would be the one going,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Geez, meathead, look, I sucked on the dick.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I fucked the butt.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I'm out of town.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
What does it matter?

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
It was just Christ.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It was just like the Gen X mentality.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Because I was like, I don't know.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
It's a fucking dude.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
It's a girl.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
It's like he was in the bus.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Oh, I'm cheese.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I fucking got the poop in the dick.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And I'm licking the balls.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
And I don't care what that's a glittery pussy.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
What is this person?

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah, geez, meathead.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
It's pretty funny to me that truly...

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Because I was like, we were riffing on that.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
And that actually is the case, the today's meathead.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Watch this show all in the family.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I'm going to have this guy on the show, Norman Lear,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
who's like 903.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
You're going to be Norman Lear on the show?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Well, I got an in.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
We could have him.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Oh, fucking, we could have him tomorrow.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I could have him on a paper plate.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Norman Lear, we've got a new pitch for you.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
All in the family, but all in the right now.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
All right. All right.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Knock it off.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Okay.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Knocking it off.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
All right.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
One more thing, and then I'm done with my...

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And then we're freewheeling.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
The fly pass.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
That wasn't freewheeling.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
That was not freewheeling.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I'm trying to move forward post-device into a new era

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
where I'm going to dress...

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
I want to wear all the same outfit all the time.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
I learned this from a character called Seth Brundle

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
in the Kronenberg's remake of the fly.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
You tried this a long time ago.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
You, for a while...

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
And I did it, and I fucking, I ruled.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
You wrote Monster House in that outfit, I think.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
No.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
The first 25 pages.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
The character of Seth Brundle in Kronenberg's remake of the fly,

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Gina Davis opens up a closet, and she says...

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
And she goes, when are you going to change your clothes?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
And he goes, I change them over your day.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
And then she opens the closet, and there's like five of the same outfit.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And she's like, what the hell?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
And he goes, I learned it from Einstein.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
You don't have to waste your time thinking about outfits or whatever.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
And that's the moment when she like jumps on him

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
and starts making out with him.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
So I was like 13, and I was like, okay, so here we go.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
So what's your outfit going to be?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
What are you going to wear for us?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm glad you asked.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
So I, like, always, I went through these phases.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
I should do that.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
So here's the thing.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
In the meantime, I've learned Einstein, he didn't learn that from Einstein.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
That's a myth.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Einstein wore whatever the fuck he wanted.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Einstein wore pajamas on Monday.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
He always wore, like, black or white or, like, grayish stuff.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I mean, like, check it out.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Look online.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Like, it's either...

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
But, yeah, I agree with you.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
I agree with you.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Like, he, uh, I totally agree with you.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Like, he wore different types of shirts and jackets,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
but they were either, like, black or white or gray.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
They were certainly shades of a gray scale.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Yeah.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I think it was a thing, because everybody around them was,

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
at the time, they were wearing that color and stuff,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
and that, not a lot of things.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
So Einstein didn't do it.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
So the originator of that concept is Seth Brundle in the fly.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
So in keeping with his principle, which he states in the movie,

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
he credits Einstein with it, but Einstein never did it.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
He's saying, in the movie, he says,

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
that way you don't have to expend any mental energy on what you're going to wear.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
So what are you going to wear?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
What's the outfit going to be?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Guess what?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Seth Brundle's outfit.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Which is?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Well...

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Those telepods.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Leather jacket and jeans?

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
It's a gray black and white herringbone suit jacket with a white colored shirt,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
a dark red tie, and pants.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
My assistant's in charge of tracking the stuff down.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
That's a good look, though.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
But he said pants, because the thing is, when you google Seth Brundle,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
you don't get a clear look at any of his pants.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
A lot of the imagery is of a fly man climbing on walls.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Right.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
And he's wearing a tweed kind of jacket?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah, it's a herringbone.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Yeah, a tweed.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
No, he nailed everything from the waist up.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
You can see that.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
So you're going to freestyle on the waist down?

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
No, freestyle is necessary. We're going to watch the movie together,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
and we're going to get this right.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Because you fucked up a little bit.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Do you remember, like, as they're like...

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Well, no, he's saying he disagreed.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
The thing is, if you go on the google,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
despite Seth Brundle's protests,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
he seems to be wearing three separate pairs of pants throughout the movie.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Whoa, wild card.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
It's the antithesis of his claims, that he wears the same outfit.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
So the solution to that problem is to make me try on and off the same pair of pants

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
that are the wrong color over its three...

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
Yeah, that was completely related to this problem.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
No, yeah, we got to figure out the right...

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
See, we can't get his sizes, so I had to eyeball the pants,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
and then take him to the tailor, and then they go,

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
I can't hem this, you have to have him come in, and I'd say, fuck you.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
And then they'd hem the pants, and I'd bring him back, and they'd be hemmed wrong,

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
and so I had to go back and get him to fix it again.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
So when you guys figured this out,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
you were actually going to commit to wearing that outfit across the board.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
Dan, we've been burned before with the eye harm,

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
and that was a flash in the pan.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Are you going to commit to this one, or are you going to bail on it?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I feel like it.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
That's not it. I don't do it for you.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
No, I'm saying, you wanted me to have the eye harm in around your neck.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I know what you're saying.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
Look, I want you to commit to this. I'm all for this.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I want you to be consistent.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Want to make it interesting?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
I wear a suit all the fucking time.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Sometimes you're my friend, and then sometimes you're attacking me.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Hey, hey, I got a solution.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
What?

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Let's make it interesting.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
All right.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
A little side money harm again.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
Okay, one year.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Too much? Too much? We'll go down.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
How about this?

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
Dan, once you find the outfit, and I'm all for this,

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
I'm not antagonistic to this idea at all,

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
when you find the comfort zone, you go,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
okay, this is the color of the trouser.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
This is the jacket. This is the thing.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
We're going to get, how many do you think Spencer and Dan will need?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Five.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Five?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Yeah, maybe less than that jacket.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
We'll put a calendar right here, right here, right here,

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
and it will check it out.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I'm going to make one exception at the outset.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I don't want to wear his shoes.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I don't like the fucking dress shoes.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Okay, what do you want to do?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I'm really like my normal shoes.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Okay, you can wear some colors.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
Those are going to stay the same for a couple of years anyway, so...

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
What do you mean?

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
You strike me as somebody who doesn't wear a lot of different shoes.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
I don't.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
See, Rob, Dan is hearing...

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
You strike me as somebody who don't change them shoes a lot.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Dan, you're hearing attack where there isn't a lot.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
You may change those shoes, bro.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
We're in the same old, nasty ass shoes all the time.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
You need to change them shoes.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Dan, we're on your side.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I'm totally...

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I'm not attacking this at all.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Are you guys perceiving me as being in a grumpy mood, like a defensive mood?

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
Well, I think right now, there are times when you hear attack when there is none.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
You hear combat when there is no combat.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Really?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I'm saying absolutely do that.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
I would love that.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Because like Steve Jobs, he wore the turtleneck, right?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
And Zuckerberg...

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Look where he is now.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
The Zuckerberg wears the gray t-shirt.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Two biopics.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Beat that.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Follow that.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Look where Steve Brundle is.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Or Brundle fly.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Steve Brundle.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Look where Steve Brundle is.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
The famous Steve Brundle that you've been talking about for a while.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
All right.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Well, we're off-roading now.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
So I hope you guys brought your show.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Because those are the...

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Do you remember the fly?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Why are you upset?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
We're saying yes and no to this idea.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
No, I'm not.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Don't tell me I'm upset.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
You piece of shit.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
You seem...

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I want you to start wearing an outfit.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm going to.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Yeah, but you're so...

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
I want the pants to be right.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Okay.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I want to help you get the right pants.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm trying to get them right.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
We're going to get the right pants.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
All right.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Of that, we can be sure.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
But my prediction is that you're going to go...

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Stop miming eating.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
I didn't know what else to do.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Trying to...

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
I think this is going to go the way of the eye Harmon.

28:28.000 --> 28:35.000
Or the last time you wore Einstein outfit where you wore your powder blue short sleeve tucked in buttoned down shirt.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
Well, I want every kid out there listening right now to listen to what Jeff's trying to do.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
What he's doing is called identity bullying.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
Like if you decide one week that you want to be like Captain EO.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
I'm trying to modernize the reference.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
You want to shoot lasers and make people dance?

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
If you go through a phase there and you're like, oh, I'm going to do this every day.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
I'm all for it.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And then on Thursday, you're like, this is boring.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Go ahead.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
It's better to do it and get bored.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I support it all the way.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
Guys like this are always going to be like, no, you got to make up your mind.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
You're manufacturing a confrontation.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Don't listen to him right now.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
He's going to tell you that you're manufacturing conflict.

29:26.000 --> 29:32.000
But what he's trying to do by saying that is kill you and murder you.

29:32.000 --> 29:41.000
What Dan is doing right now is apologizing for him wearing the Brundle fly outfit for two Harmontowns and then giving it up.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Oh, no.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
We went through the same thing.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Remember when Dan wore the outfit?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Oh, no.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
The enemy.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
He's the enemy.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Just follow your bliss.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Follow your heart, kids.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
If you fall in love, fall in love.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Love that person for two days.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Two days?

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
If you don't love them for three days, that's not on you or them.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
That's on God.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
I think he brought me out too early.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
Let's send Rob off for a bit.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
That was Rob Schafer, buddy.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Thank you.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
That was Rob Schafer.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
We'll bring him out later on.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
We'll bring him out later on.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
It was too early.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
It was too early.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Too early to bring out Rob Schafer.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
All right.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
I'm glad this happened because obviously tonight's about retooling the format of the show.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I'd like to bring Rob Schrab back out.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Rob Schrab.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
Let's bring Rob Schrab back out too.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Because now it feels right.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Now the time is right.

30:56.000 --> 31:05.000
I want him to understand who's in charge.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
I think it feels right.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Rob, can you do a dance on this?

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
Can you get up on top of the podium here and do a little podium dance?

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
I'm not going to get up on that.

31:18.000 --> 31:24.000
All right. Rob Schrab, everybody.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Thank you so much, Rob.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
You are welcome.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
You got any LEGO spoilers for us?

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Nope.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
All right.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
Rob Schrab, everybody.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
There he goes.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
He's gone.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Oh, he's leaving?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
No, he's staying.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
All right.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
See, I'm out of control then.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yep.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
There's something that goes wrong.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
What was the first moment you guys remember meeting each other?

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
Do you guys both have the same memory of the first time you guys locked eyes?

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
It was like in the back of Colts and Milwaukee.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Comedy sports, probably.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Or was it LA Freeway stand-up?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Yeah, it was Colts.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Colts?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Yeah.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
He's probably there.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I've been there.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Oh, yeah, you have been there.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I was there before.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
After it was not Comedy Sports anymore, but I went there one time with you guys.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
So what was the first time you guys met?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
What was the circumstance?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
I don't know.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Just we were at an improv workshop.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
I don't know.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
Dan, you were like probably 18?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
17.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
17.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
17.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
I was 39.

32:29.000 --> 32:37.000
But I remember, yeah, I remember Rob being funny.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
I remember when he was funny.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
The good old days.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah, he was funny back then.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
Well, I remember, we did some improv exercises, and then I remember you were off.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
We were done with the workshop, and you were sitting, and then you had a bag of chips,

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
and then you had a soda, and you were talking about how you had read that the chips had

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
riboflavin in them, and that the riboflavin was a tenderizer, and that it was designed.

33:07.000 --> 33:14.000
The same companies created the soft drinks and the chips, because the riboflavin tenderizes

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
you.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
I don't think that's right.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I don't think that's right.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I don't think riboflavin does that.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Does anybody know what riboflavin does?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Riboflavin?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Riboflavin?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Does anybody?

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
All right.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Well, that's not why I brought it up.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
That's my memory of you.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I didn't think you were right.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
That's my memory of you.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
What was the first moment when you guys connected and thought you guys could be, like, maybe

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
friends?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I remember the first time I was about to do...

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
That was a chair.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
What?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Sorry, that was a...

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
What?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
That was a chair.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
Dan farted in this part from out there.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
It was a chair.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Dan's blaming us for it on a chair.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Sorry, it's a terrible show tonight.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
It doesn't need to be a good one.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
It's pretty bad.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
It's $10.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I'll give you all your money back.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
It doesn't matter, and life doesn't matter.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Just find someone you're happy with.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Just find someone you're happy with.

34:10.000 --> 34:17.000
Just find someone.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Just feel around in the dark and...

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
That's what I do to...

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
I don't do the Seth Brundle thing.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
I get dressed...

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
I get up before Kate does, so I get dressed in the dark.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
So that removes everything.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
So I just like, oh, okay, this and that, and then I walk out looking...

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Looking a little...

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Looking a little weird sometimes.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
Do you ever wear the different color socks and shoes?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Oh, God, yes.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
For real?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Oh, my gosh, and it's crazy.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Everybody goes, wow, who's this guy?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Different...

34:49.000 --> 34:55.000
Different colored socks, because you know how everybody looks at other people's socks?

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
This is the shit that I would go through every fucking Sunday morning with my mother,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
you know, and I would put on white socks.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
You can't wear white socks with dress shoes.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
I'm like, who's looking at my socks in church?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
We're all sitting down.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
I'm behind a pew.

35:11.000 --> 35:19.000
If they're looking at my socks, maybe what we're listening to is fucking boring.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Hey, that's a new commandment.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Of the 11th commandment.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Try to be more interesting than socks.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Yeah.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
Right.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Fix the air conditioning.

35:33.000 --> 35:42.000
At the premiere for Monster House, because it's a Halloween movie, the invitation said,

35:42.000 --> 35:50.000
wear your favorite Halloween costume, and the only people that paid attention to that

35:50.000 --> 36:00.000
part of the invitation were Rob and his wife, and some kid who dressed up as Jack Sparrow.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
In order to get people to watch his Nickelodeon show.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Right.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Like some kid that was like, ooh, I'm Jack Sparrow.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Yeah, so Kate and I get up.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
Everybody is fucking Monster House world premiere, and everyone's like, ooh, the house is a

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
monster.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Hello, Mr. Zemeckis.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Yes, we did it.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Oh, we did it.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Next step, Oscars, and then Rob gets out of a limo.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Because it's Tron?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Tron.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
It was a good Tron.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Skin tight fucking.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Hard on.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Circuitry.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Puffy paint circuitry.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Fucking Tron.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Rob, full on Tron.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Was it Ram or Tron?

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
It was Ram, wasn't it?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
It was Tron.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
No, I dressed up as Ram.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
You guys don't know who I am?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
No, it's...

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Didn't you do Ram one time with the red something?

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
I think you're thinking of a different Rob.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
That was back when you were triple gym in it.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
You used to go to the gym three times a day, and this motherfucker was in shape.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I was crazy.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah, he wore tights for a living.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
All you wore was a body suit at all times.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Not at all times, but I could pull it off.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
You did.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Yeah.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Your ass was like a space helmet.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
It was fucking...

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
It was a good ass.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Yeah.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
It's a great ass.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Not that you noticed.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
No, I did.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
I went like, we're in the limo.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
We're in the limo.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I'm dressed as Tron.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Kate's dressed as the Tooth Fairy.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
And just before we get out, I go, you know something?

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
I bet you we're going to be the only ones dressed in costume.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Hello, I'm right.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
And we're getting our picture taken, and everybody's going...

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Excuse me.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Excuse me.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
This is the camera.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Why are you dressed up?

37:56.000 --> 38:02.000
It says in the invitation.

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
And they would all go, yeah, we know.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
I didn't realize it's Hollywood, so you don't do stuff that...

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
No, you don't.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
No, it's a test.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Yeah.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
When someone says, have fun, that's a test.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
If you have fun, you're a fucking nerd.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
So we walk the red carpet, and we get our picture taken,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
and then the next day we go, oh, gosh, that's our first premiere.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Let's go see it.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
We look online and go, oh, oh, shit, shit.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Oh, Dan Harmon, writer.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Oh, Gil Kennan, director.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Oh, I guess it's Robertson mechanism.

38:37.000 --> 38:45.000
And then Kate and I, background.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Like, background.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
You know, when you go to a premiere and you have, like, hired people dressed up

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
as, like, idiots in the back...

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
You're saying the image...

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
The image of us is a picture of us as a background.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Oh, no.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
It didn't say...

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Under yours it said, writer, me, background.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
It's not even Tron, not even Tooth Fairy, just background.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
Don't know why they're on the red carpet.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
Don't know why they're Tron and the Tooth Fairy.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.000
They sure are smiling like, I'm supposed to know why they did that.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Background.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
For lack of a better word, background.

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
Spencer, what have you been doing?

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
How about, have you heard about these Chinese murder vans?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
No, okay.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
I have not.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Film me in a Chinese murder vans.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
No, no, no.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
I've filled everybody in.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
They murder people in vans.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
What is their angle?

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
The murder is their angle.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Is it vengeance?

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Or are they just going out and randomly killing strangers?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah, it's vengeance.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Okay.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
The people who killed their van parents.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
All right.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Clearly you read one article.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
They stalked the streets.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
I'm picturing a Ford, a Conor Lyon bubble window van from the 70s.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
What kind of van are they in?

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Like one of those except with a lot more screaming.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
Do they kill you inside the van or do they jump out of the van and then kill you back

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
in the van?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
No, they kill you in the van.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
No, okay.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Sorry.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
This is a joke.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
I've talked about this before.

40:26.000 --> 40:32.000
No, the real thing that's been happening in my life is Lord of the Rings.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
What?

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
That's the real thing that's been happening.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
No, no.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Okay.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
So I was on the computer.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
I built a computer.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
No.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Yeah, no.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I know it's hard to believe, Rob.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
That was on the computer.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
That was bullying.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
I recognize that.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
I'm sorry.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
I'm sorry.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
I know where this is going and I'm leaving.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
And I get a phone call from Rob Schrab.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Yeah.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
What did you say?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
How do I work my computer?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
No, no, no.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
No, I'm driving in because I worked at Leggo this morning.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Oh, you were driving.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I'm driving, driving, driving, and I'm going, huh.

41:03.000 --> 41:10.000
Like, yo, yo, Spence, what's up?

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
So I'm masturbating and I'm like, I'm just, you know, I'm just on, I'm just on that Internet.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I'm on that Kotaku.com.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
No, no, no, no.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Go that we don't, we don't have the VR this.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Just go ahead and explain.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I'm just telling the people what happened.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
No, you explain.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
You call me up and start a sale.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
What's Kotaku.com?

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
It's just a website that's not porn.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
But you jerk off to it.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Yeah, no.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Okay.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
That's what I tell Rob when he calls me when I'm jerking off.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
I got you.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
What site were you on?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Oh, no, I was playing Minecraft.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
That's a joke.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
All right, come on.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Okay, okay, okay.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Let's get serious.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
So I go, I'm driving and I have a question.

41:51.000 --> 42:01.000
So I called our dungeon master and I went, hey, why is it called Lord of the Rings when there's only one ring?

42:01.000 --> 42:13.000
I don't understand that because as far as what I'm seeing and I've read in the books and stuff like that,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
there seems to be only one ring.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
One ring.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
And it's the ring of invisibility and Bilbo got it.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
And then did they...

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
What do the other rings do?

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Well, first of all, where are they?

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
They're in the first 15 seconds of the movie.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
Well, then name the fucking whole thing after it.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Oh my God.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Oh, oh my God.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
I'm sorry.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
I must be mistaken.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
The first 15 seconds of the whole thing.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
No, okay, but...

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
Name the whole thing after it then.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
If that's what the story's about.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
If that's what the story's about.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Oh, it isn't.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
It's not what the story's about, right?

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Oh, okay.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Hey.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Let's call it...

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
Let's call it King Kong's.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
But there's only one King Kong.

43:05.000 --> 43:13.000
Yes, but he had a mother and a father.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
Doesn't make sense.

43:17.000 --> 43:22.000
So King Kong would be called the Kong family?

43:22.000 --> 43:32.000
Think about the pitch he walks into whatever bar with C.S. Lewis and there's fucking H.P.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Lovecraft hanging out in the corner and going,

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
whoa, just got done with my whole books.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Oh man, what's it about?

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
It's called Lord of the Rings.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Wow.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Oh wow.

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
Is it about a guy, a lord who finds all these rings and then there's...

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
It's fighting over all these rings?

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
No.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
It's nothing to do with rings, it's just one ring.

43:55.000 --> 44:03.000
Well, off to my series of 17 books that are all about lions, witches, and wardrobes.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Yeah.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
Hey, it's more accurate than...

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
There's not even a lord of the rings.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
I mean, presumably whoever made all those rings was a lord of the rings.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Do the story about him.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
There's no, but that person has not even been like...

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Well, no, he's the lord of one ring.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
What are you talking about?

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
He made all the rings.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I don't think so.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
I don't think he...

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
What movies were you guys watching?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I think he made all the rings.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
I'm pretty sure elves made all the rings, gave three of them to dwarves.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
What?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
No.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Three of them to humans.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
No, Sauron had a guy make all the rings.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
What did the other rings do?

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
They gave them, they gifted them to the...

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Levy, what does it say you're looking up on Wikipedia, right?

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Steve Levy, get out of here.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Steve Levy, everybody.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Steve, get out of here.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I'm sure someone knows.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
This isn't...

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
This isn't a debate.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
No, no, no.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
It is.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
It is.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
It is.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
It is a debate.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
I'm taking it down and I'm going to win.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
It's not a debate.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
No, it is.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
What did the other rings do?

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
They turned...

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
Whoa, here's the thing that pisses me off.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Okay.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
My name is Sauron.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
I have this ring.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Now I'm really powerful.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
I'm going to do this thing with the sword and everybody's going to fly all over the place

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
because I did this thing with the sword and I'm so powerful because I'm wearing this ring

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
and then somebody cuts off my finger and it falls down and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
blah, blah.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
And then, okay, Bilbo gets it, he puts it on and turns invisible.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Why?

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Why?

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Why?

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Come on.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Well, that's always been fucked up.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
I never got that.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Because Sauron isn't invisible.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
He isn't invisible.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
He's wearing this ring and he doesn't turn invisible.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
If I were to...

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
A little clunky.

45:39.000 --> 45:46.000
If I were to defend the mythology, I would say that the cowardice of mortal beings means

45:46.000 --> 45:55.000
that the biggest power that you would have if a ring of that power imbued itself in you,

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
that the very first and foremost thing you would do before you could fly or do anything,

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
that you would just be a creepy, invisible person.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
But that's me apologizing for a mythology that I agree is flawed.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
Do you mean he had a bunch of rings made?

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
The whole point was that he had all his rings made.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
The ring of power is the ring that controls all the rings.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
He had a bunch of rings before the story started.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Okay, good.

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
Let's do three books about not that.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
What did Steve have to say?

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Spencer's right.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
It was an elf, right, or something?

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
Here's what they did.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
They killed Sauron and they went, well, fuck, that guy had that one ring.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
We need to have rings to battle evil if that ever comes back.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah, but let's never talk about them or use them ever.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Here's the first thing that comes up when you're right.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Who made the rings in Lord of the Rings?

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Well, I know because I played the video game.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Right, yeah.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
I met that guy.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
I worked for him.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Spoilers.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Met him.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I had lunch with him.

46:55.000 --> 47:03.000
He gave me superpowers that were curiously compatible with Warner Brothers Interactive's total game engine.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
I'm so sorry.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
Hobbit is the only good book.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
You hear that?

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
That's the sound of just failure.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Yeah.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
I don't care.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
No one cares what Bob book says.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
No one says that you're right.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
People hate books.

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
We're in the back of a comic book store, not in the comic book store itself.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
The idea that the thing that threw you is that that's all explained in the beginning.

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
They made a bunch of rings, and there was one ring to rule them all and the darkness behind them.

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
THat thing that should throw you is after three movies that span nine years,

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
it turns out all you gotta do to set things right is talk to green ghosts.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Well, that's not true.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
That didn't say what was the story at all.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Green ghosts kill everything.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
The green ghosts go, brrrrrrrr.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
They call it Lord of the Green Ghost.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Yeah, king of the that I would that I would agree. That's a better title. Lord of the rings

47:59.760 --> 48:05.760
There's there's only one green ghosts. All right. Call it the ring move. Can we talk about vaccinations talk about AIDS?

48:06.080 --> 48:14.120
Hey, do you guys? Oh shit AIDS? I don't like a prevention. Oh omaze omaze.com slash Rick and Morty go there

48:14.120 --> 48:18.560
Yeah, fight AIDS fight it's enough with that. That was a good plug. Oh wait. We got one more plug

48:18.560 --> 48:25.760
It's a so beta. Yeah, go to Harmon. Okay, go to see so beta are enough of that

48:26.680 --> 48:29.520
Everyone fight AIDS and watch see so we'll do yeah

48:29.680 --> 48:34.680
Can we get the beta code if you want to get on see so right now is Harmon fan

48:36.240 --> 48:44.360
Harmon fan, so I won't remember that available for all the CISO concerts right a bunch of contents. Yeah, and eventually Harmon quest

48:45.040 --> 48:46.880
Only one ring in them

48:46.880 --> 48:53.040
Yeah, only there is no lord of the rings like they did the elders is obviously fucking Sauron

48:53.040 --> 48:59.240
Well, he only have our arms didn't call it Sauron. They call the call all three books Sauron dear

48:59.840 --> 49:01.320
our token

49:01.320 --> 49:06.280
You missed named your book that in

49:07.400 --> 49:14.080
2015 there's 90 movies about what what what did he do wrong? Hey? Yeah, you know that

49:14.080 --> 49:16.840
I mean if something's popular, then it's right Hitler

49:20.920 --> 49:23.160
Kaboom Sauron kaboom

49:23.760 --> 49:29.080
Yeah, called you there you go lord of the ring. There's so many things to complain about okay

49:29.080 --> 49:33.880
I'm reading the second one. There's gonna be hopefully at least another ring coming up here

49:37.360 --> 49:43.400
He loves the rings he loves rings that's why you watch the movie you love rings you knew you knew

49:43.400 --> 49:47.080
They're gonna be a million rings. I like I like the ring in the hobbit. I thought it was oh, yeah

49:47.080 --> 49:50.320
So you wanted a million rings cuz it would be lord of the rings

49:50.320 --> 49:56.120
I want to watch a million rings. What are the other rings? You love rings. You love rings. You love movies about jewelry. I like

49:57.320 --> 49:59.320
Accurate I like I like

49:59.800 --> 50:05.240
Yeah, yeah, you love logic. That's why you want diehard to be called a guy in a tower

50:05.240 --> 50:14.240
But that's an accurate yeah, that'd be great. Neat mop, moops. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm on your side.

50:14.240 --> 50:19.600
Diehard is a good title. Diehard is better than a guy. Yeah, yeah, but it's not diehard

50:23.040 --> 50:26.760
Well, it's the thing he doesn't diehard in the movie

50:27.480 --> 50:33.760
He fucking lives he stays alive. Yeah forever. Yeah, well that all of the series are called diehard

50:33.760 --> 50:38.200
He hasn't died yet. It's hard for him to die. It's a high. He's a hard dire

50:38.200 --> 50:41.720
It's a hard die hard dire we'd ask hard dire dire

50:42.240 --> 50:46.360
See, I love diehard is a title, but dieharder is a better

50:47.400 --> 50:49.920
Hard diehard. Yeah, hard dire. Yeah, what's that?

50:55.240 --> 51:02.600
Yeah, he's a diehard I'm a diehard liver. Yeah, he's just a badass. No, he's the diehard

51:02.600 --> 51:08.280
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, there was a there was a battery a car battery. They probably still have them called diehard

51:08.680 --> 51:12.640
Yeah, that kind of excited that you were so passionate that you would cry that out

51:13.360 --> 51:15.360
Are you that big a diehard fan? Oh

51:16.240 --> 51:19.840
Okay, I'm now I'm now I don't know where to go with you

51:21.680 --> 51:25.040
My mom is a fan of yelling things out or Bruce Willis or

51:26.160 --> 51:28.160
John McTiernan or

51:28.160 --> 51:33.800
I'm a fan of making people believe what I want them to believe. Okay, so you're a witch. You're a

51:34.800 --> 51:36.800
Or a hypnotist

51:38.160 --> 51:40.160
All right, you have powers of persuasion

51:43.520 --> 51:45.520
No, you don't

51:46.680 --> 51:52.480
I found out at the same time I was you know, how old were we Dan you know about the same age

51:52.480 --> 51:56.400
How old were we when diehard came out was I was 24

51:56.400 --> 51:58.400
All right, I was 15

51:59.480 --> 52:05.320
So then I was 14 or 15 and I my mom and I were really in the diehard together cuz I'm just slightly out of you

52:08.080 --> 52:11.160
My mom was really in the diehard and whenever time I came on TV

52:11.160 --> 52:14.600
We'd watch it together and I loved diehard, but I found out

52:15.160 --> 52:19.240
Like the third time you watch it that she just had a giant boner for Alexander Goodenoff

52:20.720 --> 52:22.720
The blonde bad guy

52:22.720 --> 52:31.080
I want blood. Yeah, not dissimilar from Nick Manning pussy juice on dick

52:33.960 --> 52:38.960
Do you watch that guy's porn because you enjoy him as a character or because what's happening is sexy wait

52:38.960 --> 52:45.840
Okay, it has to be both like like why why why I think in a world where is there do you enjoy him as a

52:45.840 --> 52:54.120
every second that we're sitting here another five thousand pieces of porn are made right

52:54.840 --> 53:00.000
We clearly if you took one step back from our species and looked at the media

53:00.000 --> 53:05.880
We create as you would with the honeybees making whatever they make and don't say honey. Don't say honey

53:06.960 --> 53:10.980
They make wax they make wax if you took a step back and looked at what we create

53:10.980 --> 53:15.860
Media-wise you would go these people love porn

53:16.140 --> 53:18.900
They make a lot of it per second

53:18.900 --> 53:26.580
So the question the answer to the question was I watching Nick Manning to like here to make fun or to get turned on

53:26.580 --> 53:30.540
It's like I bathed in it. I fucking open my I'm like

53:30.820 --> 53:35.340
Give me what you got and he's like he did he didn't say drop in loads and I'm like I

53:36.500 --> 53:38.500
Yeah, I eventually came

53:38.500 --> 53:40.500
I

53:40.580 --> 53:45.940
But you like him as a like he I don't like him you don't like him. I don't know him

53:46.700 --> 53:53.260
He might be conservative. I don't know him. He might be like dropping loads. We should tag Muslims

53:54.500 --> 53:58.060
I want to drop a load on each Muslim that you can read at an airport

53:59.500 --> 54:03.420
What is Rob doing here? Rob is getting complicated. I'm getting comfortable

54:03.420 --> 54:10.220
Because he's sitting like he's about to tell us something about our school experience

54:12.700 --> 54:17.900
Hey, yeah, I've done some drinking I've done some druggin

54:19.940 --> 54:22.100
Wasn't that cool I'm telling you kids

54:23.140 --> 54:28.740
Gotta read what's going on in the Lego Lego to what do you need? What do you ask me any question?

54:28.740 --> 54:34.300
I'll tell you the absolute truth. Have Phil and Chris

54:34.740 --> 54:41.860
Stepped foot in the building sent in the last year. Absolutely. Yeah, okay every day. All right is fire style in the next movie

54:44.260 --> 54:46.260
Yep

54:46.420 --> 54:54.380
You sound like my mom. Yeah, is that fire style gonna be in the movie? No wild style. I think you mean of course

54:54.380 --> 54:59.660
She's in it. Yeah, good. Good. When do you when do you leave you go to Vancouver right to make it? Yep

54:59.660 --> 55:01.660
When do you leave town?

55:01.700 --> 55:05.140
At the end of 2016. Oh, so it's way off

55:05.740 --> 55:10.900
Are you gonna miss me? Yes, why won't you look at me because I'll start crying

55:12.980 --> 55:15.620
What are you gonna miss most about then Rob most

55:16.220 --> 55:19.100
Most but what am I gonna miss most about Dan?

55:19.100 --> 55:24.780
Oh, yeah, or name your one or two or three top things that you're gonna miss about about not being in the same city with Dan

55:26.620 --> 55:28.620
Watching dumb movies with them

55:32.500 --> 55:36.900
Dan what are you gonna miss about Rob when he goes away for a year and a half his pain

55:42.180 --> 55:45.100
You like his pain yeah, it makes me feel effective

55:45.100 --> 55:48.860
In his defense, it is pretty funny

55:50.500 --> 55:52.420
It's delicious

55:52.420 --> 55:57.940
Very nice. Well, I mean I have this I miss I mean we I mean here's the thing me and Rob

55:58.260 --> 56:02.460
What we were kids were like remember, you know an LA story

56:03.100 --> 56:09.420
When Steve Martin and what's your name like they're like and they go out in the garden and I

56:09.420 --> 56:11.420
I

56:13.820 --> 56:15.820
Hope that's not fucking

56:16.140 --> 56:18.780
Well, they fucked they fucked that's the scene where they fuck

56:18.780 --> 56:25.860
But it's like like there's an envious song playing it like we came to LA because we wanted, you know, we wanted to be

56:26.780 --> 56:28.780
Who we are now? Yeah

56:29.620 --> 56:31.620
but like

56:31.620 --> 56:40.940
It's not it's not like being who we are now required us like holding hands and like no, I like we barely talked to each other

56:40.940 --> 56:43.880
But look what and we like like, you know

56:44.460 --> 56:47.780
It's nice. I'm very thankful like our friendship

56:50.140 --> 56:56.100
Yeah, it's foundational to it and it's good. No, I'm I'm all for it. I

56:56.100 --> 57:04.140
I mean, I I wish I don't understand why you have to go to Vancouver to make Legos move

57:04.140 --> 57:07.260
It doesn't make any sense. I could do that here on the floor

57:08.460 --> 57:12.420
For one-tenth the budget. I don't understand. I don't get it

57:12.420 --> 57:18.260
Well, I but I you're welcome to come visit. Well, I don't I've obviously the most important thing for me to make it

57:18.260 --> 57:22.220
We make make clear is that no one can ever hurt me ever

57:22.220 --> 57:28.140
It's not possible. No, I don't have no feelings. No that are available

57:28.140 --> 57:34.020
Like from the outside. No, that's not that's not something that you can do like nobody can hurt remember

57:34.020 --> 57:41.740
Remember that one New Year's where it was like, you know, I think I think we both of us like we're in our third

57:41.740 --> 57:46.180
Like you just turned 30 and we were it was a New Year's and we were like, well

57:47.220 --> 57:48.740
party's over

57:48.740 --> 57:51.240
New Year's with 30 now. Let's uh

57:51.240 --> 57:56.960
Then we're not going to go out and have fun and rave it up with all those youngins and stuff

57:56.960 --> 58:01.200
Let's let's stay home and watch some TV and it's just we'll call it a night

58:01.200 --> 58:06.560
You know around 1130 or something like that and your girlfriend at the time like came over and she was like

58:07.720 --> 58:13.160
Yeah, I guess I'll do that too. Um, I got a bag of mushrooms that I

58:14.160 --> 58:16.160
found in the freezer and

58:16.160 --> 58:20.680
And it was like a like a trash bag. They're in the freezer

58:21.520 --> 58:27.800
They've been there for like about a year or something. They're not let me tell you something. They're not gonna work

58:27.840 --> 58:29.840
We're not gonna get high

58:29.840 --> 58:32.600
So if anybody wants them with it and we all went

58:32.920 --> 58:37.280
Sure there too. I don't think you were there. I think we were trying to get you there

58:37.280 --> 58:42.360
I think we were on the phone with you and you're like, I'm not you can say who's there. How late are you gonna be there?

58:42.360 --> 58:43.760
I'll be there

58:43.760 --> 58:46.200
It's an inside joke. It's what Jeff always does, okay?

58:46.880 --> 58:48.880
So I remember I remember

58:49.560 --> 58:53.640
No, no, no, we'll get back to this pain. We'll get back to it. So anyway, so

58:55.320 --> 58:59.880
Favorite memories of of hanging out with Dan is like it was like you me Kristalman

58:59.880 --> 59:04.600
It was like Robin Roth and we had and she she puts them down there and we're like going, oh, okay

59:04.600 --> 59:12.200
Oh, there's all these mushrooms. All right. Well, I guess I'll take a handful too. I remember looking at my hand and

59:12.200 --> 59:13.840
and a

59:13.840 --> 59:19.960
Like a pile of mushrooms and I'm like going, okay, you said this is just it's not gonna work

59:19.960 --> 59:24.920
It's not gonna work. It's not gonna work famous last words and we all went fuck it

59:26.680 --> 59:32.560
Oh, man, I'm so fucking old jeez. That's 30 years old. Holy shit. No, it's all over with

59:32.560 --> 59:39.400
Oh, I think I think we're both broke at the time and whatever and then Robin was I brought my dance dance revolution machine around here

59:39.400 --> 59:46.280
All right, all right, I love it hooks it up to the TV and Chris Talman and I are sitting just kind of crashed out on the couch

59:46.520 --> 59:51.960
Watching it kind of sleeply watching it and Dan's in front of us on the dance dance revolution

59:53.080 --> 59:55.080
And it starts off the music's like

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.440
And then there's a level why you did it

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.760
And then the beat keeps going

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.360
every level goes

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:12.800
The lights and stuff like that and all of a sudden lights are coming out of the TV and and and Dan is like

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.400
Dancing

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.480
Dan is dancing

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:25.800
Level 12 level 13 perfect perfect perfect level 15 20

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.120
67

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:35.920
And it's why are you Dan Dan's like going I can't stop losing. I can't stop losing and it's all that

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.240
I looked over it Rob

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.200
I was playing any other game. I'd be like

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.360
Looked over it Rob

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.360
I was like, oh

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:04.720
Just like the music is like going through the roof and our ears are shattering and I looked at Chris Talman and I went oh

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:13.600
No, and he said yeah, we took way too much and and we were just like

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.600
Ah

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.680
Like we work a hyper speed like Dan's dancing all over the place

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:28.520
Robin took off and ran down the street and like it was just like it was the I think the most high

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.720
I've ever been in my life like the walls were growing hair and everything was like

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.880
Black light, but there was nothing on and we were and and then like Steve Agee gave me like a

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.200
Hand job what it gave me a hand job

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:50.440
No, he gave he gave me like a couple days earlier like a videotape of of like like unerid famous

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:56.040
unerid pilots that you never seen or something like that just clips of it and they had like the

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.000
Pilot the original pilot for the Munsters

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:06.120
Oh God, oh God, which is that okay? What you don't know is that I shot two pilots for the month that night

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:11.480
That was that night. That was a night. That's when the old boy. It's like I got it became a bad trip

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.200
Yeah, it became a bad. Yeah. Yeah, but I guess I was like I'm fucking I could dance

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.720
I really so happy and then we watched your legs were I couldn't see him anymore. They were moving so fast

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:28.760
God God God made the game God made my feet. It's like I get nothing to do with this perfect perfect perfect

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.080
The game was like who are you?

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:37.960
I call Konami. You you have a you have a vacation awaiting you and I was like, no, I can't

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.520
So you lose and I put in this yeah, but then we got we watch

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:48.760
Munsters there was like is that the original Munsters so you guys don't even know the Munsters

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:53.640
But there was like a Herman Munster and there was a Mrs. Munster and there was other Munsters

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.600
Who knows the Munsters? Okay. Okay. There was a

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.040
Son there was a son

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.280
And he thanks kids. Thanks

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.240
He was uh

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.240
He had a widow's peak and blah blah blah

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.840
That's the recast like that's the Michael J. Fox. There was an Eric Stoltz

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.120
of

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.680
The Munsters so then they showed it and it was like and the kid's name was like happy something happy smith

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:28.360
Happy smith or whatever kid same cast the original idea with Eddie Munster is that he was part werewolf

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.480
Yeah, so and there's they show the Munsters

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:38.440
It's a Fred Gwynne and he's the every the everything's the normal Munsters and then this fucking kid comes down the stairs and goes

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:45.960
And he was like a werewolf boy and like we were in mushrooms and shit got dark we we

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.240
Because I don't remember putting in the tape

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.240
But I put it in tape and then we were like watching and then we just said now whatever and we started talking about

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.200
Yeah, man, you know like it's just so great that we know each other after all this time and just your comedy

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.200
Is just

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.240
So great

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.440
When you're doing psychedelic drugs like oh, yeah have a great time

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.560
But then there's that always that moment when there's one thing that oh my you're like wait if that's true

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:27.720
If a kid if there's a kid who thought he was going to be Eddie Munster who never got to be Eddie Munster

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.280
Just because he was ugly and terrifying which is what Munsters are supposed to be

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.680
But like like like like with them. What are we and what are we doing with our lives?

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.200
And why am I 32 and on drugs like I have

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:47.240
Shit to do I like like my accountant is wondering where I am tonight and he just fucking tailspin. I wanted to kill myself

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.560
It's pretty it's pretty weird like just imagine like any sitcom

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:57.560
Um, where everything's the same except the one thing that was like a side character comes in and it's just like a

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.560
I mean that that was the original version of Eddie Munster pretty funny, but it didn't really reply

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.000
But it was didn't land with them

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But there's a there's a different party

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.080
As long as we're like the fuck this show

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.240
The there's a different party

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.200
What was the party where we're like, what were you?

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.160
It was a halloween. We're all the business

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.960
You're not gonna tell the

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.720
Why are you doing this?

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.600
And then we're like like everyone came over and we're like, ah this party is not working and there was I guess there was some

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.000
Ecstasy or something and yeah, maybe we were tripping and maybe we weren't but I think it was dressed as Tron

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.760
If they were tripping or not you were but then like one person said well, you know what?

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.680
I'm gonna go. Schrab was dressed as Tron

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:50.040
I was I was dressed as I was 99 cent store cowboy. I made a cowboy outfit out of all things from the 99 cent store

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.160
so I had a giant cowboy hat made of kitten calendars and

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.320
As we were all we were super high and the party ended up in your office

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.720
Which is like the smallest room in the apartment and we're on beanbags

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.560
And then someone said well, I'm gonna go and then Schrab

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.920
Had this disney land they give kids these swingy things. What are they?

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:17.400
They're little spinny things. I gotta stick it around and then Schrab was in his Tron costume

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.160
And and and so he's a little not in the little

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.080
turgid

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.080
Penis okay visible

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.400
Like like head-to-toe spandex Tron circuitry and these

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.920
And then you're waving these disney things and then you go why are you leaving?

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.600
Why are you leaving?

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:44.840
And then other people started going why are you leaving gay party gay party?

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:52.440
Gay party gay party why are you leaving and everyone's going gay party gay party?

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:58.200
Why are you leaving why are you leaving gay party? It was politically incorrect then too

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:05.800
But the idea was the well, there was no idea it was just a funny experience

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:11.000
This is how I mean and it went on forever to the point the point is kids to do more drugs

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:16.600
Just get together in your apartments in your homes and do them in my bedroom you guys

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:24.840
Like in my bedroom. I have a picture from my I think it's my 27th birthday and it's rob dan chris tolman and I

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.920

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.920
We had just done

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.200
ecstasy

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.200
And we were at the beauty bar

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.960
on coanga

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.600
And there's a picture of us there. I think

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.240

Oh my god, it was the worst if it was we'd have way way higher numbers

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.200
Who is in pain here who has

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.800
That's a bad sign

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.880
You you're raising your hand like in silence. Do you want to come up here and share your pain?

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.080
Oh, well, well then don't then then

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:50.920
Well, they're just stay there then it's called being in the audience. Yeah, it's fine

No, I'm saying like is anybody like I want to be on stage right now. Well, okay

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.640
We got our friend here

Well, that's about season five. It's adorable, but so much pain. There was a guy who had a heart transplant last week

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.400
Oh, he's got a beard on voice and he's from Canada. What?

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:26.680
Uh, get card jacked, but it's don't think about it so much as like, what do I have to do to get up on stage?

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.400
Think about it more like

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.320
Oh my god, I'm in so much fucking pain. Like, okay, what's it?

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.280

You're in a lot of fucking pain. All right. Is it cool if you share it?

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.880
Podcast dynamite

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.760
But maybe not for you. I you can

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.040
Yeah, we'll we'll chippy-toe through

01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:02.440
Yo, yo, sometimes human pain could be rung like a rag into a bottle and

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.400
You can drink it and you can sell it for a subscription fee

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.720
What's your name young lady? Tara Tara. Sorry to call you young lady. I'm sure that's

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.480
It's some some view. That's gotta be that's gotta be somehow

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.160
But shut up buddy

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.360
Don't don't don't don't old man's plane

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440
How to talk to a young lady

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.440
Tara, where are you from?

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.920
I'm from New York Long Island. Oh, yeah. Are you a la resident now? Are you visiting?

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.160
Uh, yeah, I just moved here like a month ago

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.400
Welcome

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.680
You enjoying it?

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.120
Yeah, yeah

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.000
Settling in yeah, what part of Long Island you from? I'm from

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:51.400
South Shore Suffolk County. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you miss it. You're family all there. Yeah, everyone's there. Yeah

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.760
I don't miss Long Island. I miss my family. What brought you out here

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.600
I'm not making fun of you. I just don't know what to do. I don't know why I'm here. What brought you to LA Tara

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:10.520
Yeah, a bunch of reasons. I kind of came for the sun actually the sun. Yeah, and but a bunch of things. Yeah job

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120
Maybe try stand-up comedy. Oh, yeah

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Yeah

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.880
So now you said that you're going through some some tough pain right now

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:27.720
Uh, yeah, I'm just like very severely depressed and can't really seem to get past it

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:33.720
Is it sort of just as a general thing because you've come out to LA you're living here?

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.880
Is it what we could predict which is you don't know what you're doing. You don't know where you're going

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:44.360
Yeah, I mean depressed my whole life for sure. But like putting myself alone in a new city

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.080
severe like has triggered it to a point where

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.480
Do you have friends or any kind of like connections when you came out or you came out totally alone? No, I came out totally alone

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:58.120
Which is a really good sign because a lot of people don't do that. I didn't do that

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:02.920
Schrab had to come out to LA for me to come out. I I never would have gone out

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.280
I have to commend you that is a very ballsy thing to do because like dan and I

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.840
In milwaukee said for years we got to get out of here. We got to go to los angeles

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.480
I never would have done it if it wasn't if dan would have gone if he was that i'm not going to go

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.840
I would have stayed there. So to do it by yourself is

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.280
It's really commendable. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's it doesn't necessarily

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.080
Fortell anything which I think that's the big crucial issue. How old are you?

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.040
You seem young enough we can ask how old right 27 27

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.400
Uh, like that's how old I was when I came out. So the importance of uh, I was way younger than that

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.760
To me I was like why is he even bothering to come out 27?

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:52.280
Yeah, uh, but the the the when we talk about age when we think about it the big crucial issue is outcome

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.920
It's like it's like, oh, I'm gonna I need to accomplish this by this stage and all this stuff

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.120
Like like like that's the big thing and so it's again come to a big city like LA or new york

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.760
And it's like oh the reason I'm coming here is because this is the place where you plug into this main frame

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.120
And then I'm going to become this like heightened version of myself

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:16.760
And it's going to be at the mercy of this bartender or this agent or this like flyer or this workshop and

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.920
You know, you're fucking dizzy and like like wondering

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.400
Because yeah, I'm sure back home. You've got

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.960
Probably a tribe of people that bless their hearts. Maybe aren't totally going

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.560
Totally I get it go audition for everything

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.800
Oh, yeah, I'm not like auditioning for and don't have expectation of joining

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:47.080
The entertainment world, but so you're right now at 27 you're going I got out here

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.560
I'm just getting okay, so I'm exiting a

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.360
a four-year like

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.600
Relationship I was gonna say emotionally abusive relationship

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.280
So I kind of flee to a state to come to this state

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.120
To get away from that guy. Yeah. Yeah

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.120
Good for you. Good for you

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.160
He's not a bad guy. I'm not an angel either. So whatever

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.600
I kind of I had it coming

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.640
Just so you guys know

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:25.080
But sometimes like like negative negative things like that's that's rocket fuel

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.680
like the way with the way rockets get off the ground is by firing

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:33.480
Things in the opposite direction like that negative stuff is something that can get you into

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:37.160
You know into orbit and like to go to places you want to go so

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:45.480
Like that's that's what I'm very happy that you that you chose to land here on a sunday night with us

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:51.640
That's very cool. Well, do you have big fears about tomorrow? Like I'm sure you have like what's the what's the financial issue?

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.520
Like LA's an expensive place. What's your situation?

01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:00.920
I do have a job. I got a job before I came here. I work as a behavioral therapist with autistic kids

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.680
Oh, yeah

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.440
well

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.440
That sounds like it pulls down a lot of years

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.000
That's that's here in LA. I guess I just have like christmas blues

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.280
I just like cried for two days. I watched uh

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:21.240
The fault in our stars last night. Oh god. Oh my god. Oh god. That's the best movie ever

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.360
Oh my god, it's such a good movie. It's like human drain. Oh, I've been crying for two days. The fault in our stars

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.280
Is there is there is there more than one star in the movie?

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.800
Because if I I haven't seen it yet

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:43.560
If I go seeing it and they're just like, oh well, there's just one star I'm I'm gonna my brain will blow up it'll blow up

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.800
It'll blow up my brain will blow up. It'll blow up

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.440
It'll blow up my brain's gonna blow

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.680
I happen to have seen that movie

01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:00.520
I was 42 years old in a luxury hotel in venice

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:06.360
At christmas time with a woman. I loved very much. There was absolutely nothing

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:11.080
Wrong with my life and that movie fucked made me wobbly

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.080
I was like, what is a gondola? What does it matter?

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:21.400
So if if if if you're if you're 27 and you're like like you don't you know

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:26.680
Necessarily have a mortgage and a health plan and like make you watch that movie. That's the good

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.920
That's like fucking. What do they call it a neti pot?

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.240
That shit clears you out

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:37.160
That movie will fuck you up watch it watch it you piece of shit

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.800
You need to watch jeff davis. You need to watch the fault in our stars. I'm writing it down

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.680
It's on HBO go

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.080
It'll fuck you up. I have

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:52.360
Watch the fault in our stars. It'll fuck you up

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
But there's definitely a positive message from it

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.680
I thought the I thought the in frank set piece was a little weird

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.480
Spoilers weird spoilers

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.200
But

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:11.560
Yeah, yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, sorry give us a second

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:20.360
No, it was insane. I've actually never seen a movie that had something that insane in it that I also still at the end

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:25.480
It was like I was fucking weeping. It was like that's a good movie. I like I hate children now

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.080
I was like like I

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.080
I just like weeping uh

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:37.560
Yeah, no a good movie nice movie well written nicely shot whatever so honestly, there's a good chance that movie's your problem

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.560
Well

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:45.320
There's a really because I'm telling you that's some potent shit like like you made me just need three days off of that

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.400

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.160
You may just need to watch cannonball run to

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:58.280
The sure thing and uh hudson hawk. What's the last movie that you watched that made you go?

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:05.400

It's the Fault in Our Stars of Comedy!

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.440
It cleans you out!

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.440
Which episode?

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.440
I just watched the season finale of the second season.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.440
I haven't watched the third season yet.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.440
He's on three, right?

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.440
He's awesome. We should have him on the show.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.440
I could totally.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.440
I got his number in my phone.

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:53.440
Do you remember last season where the weight loss episode?

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.440
Excuse me if I say it.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.440
Levy, book Nathan Fielder.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.440
We could book Nathan Fielder.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.440
Yeah, do it.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.440
Done.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.440
And you know what?

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.440
Steve Levy is taking out his iPhone.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.440
I feel a diamond.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.440
And Lena's done him.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:11.440
Steve, let's find out if Dan's full of shit and just call him right now.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.440
Call him up.

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.440
You have his number?

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.440
Call Nathan right now.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.440
You don't have his number?

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.440
Dan has his number.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.440
Dan has his number?

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.440
No, but I can get.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.440
Dan's going to Chevy Chase this shit right now.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.440
He's going to leave him a drunk voicemail.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.440
He's going to fucking go viral.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:36.440
Okay, it's looking like I don't actually have his number.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.440
A lot of times what I'll do is if somebody's following me on Twitter,

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:45.440
I'll consider that having my number.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.440
Oh, yeah, that's his Wikipedia.

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.440
Okay.

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.440
Oh, that's Nathan Fillion.

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.440
Okay.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.440
All right.

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:53.440
Call Nathan Fillion.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.440
Well, okay.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.440
Call Nathan Fillion.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:01.440
Why don't you suck my integrity?

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.440
This guy was like, you had to play Chevy Chase's voicemails.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.440
It was him.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.440
It was you.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.440
We used my phone to play it.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.440
Anyways, can we please get grounded and be sensitive to people?

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:19.440
It's a movie that made you go, oh.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:28.440
What was the movie that turned you into a Japanese stereotype?

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.440
I saw that movie Entertainment.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.440
It was sad, but it made me laugh too.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.440
Maybe not belly laugh.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:38.440
Let's talk about these autistic kids.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:45.440
In L.A., your job is to, what do you do when you punch in the clock?

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.440
9 o'clock?

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.440
And then you go, who's autistic?

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.440
And they're like, I won't tell you.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.440
I'm not going to look at you.

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.440
And you're like, I think you are.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.440
And then you grab them and you're like, come on.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.440
And they're like, no.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.440
And you're like, perfect.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.440
And then you're like, five o'clock?

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.440
I don't know.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.440
I don't know why I signaled into that.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.440
That wasn't what I was trying to do.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:11.440
That's not what I was trying to do.

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.440
You correct me from the moment you punch.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.440
11 o'clock.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440
Oh, nice.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.440
Must be nice.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:27.440
Because of depression, I don't get up for work.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.440
I just won't get up for work if it's early.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:33.440
So I've had to find jobs that start past 9 a.m.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.440
This sounds like a joke, but do you tell in the interview?

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.440
No, I just find jobs that I've worked in schools.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.440
I can't do it.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:44.440
I just have found a job that you can start later on and work till 7.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:48.440
So you consider yourself, you're saying you suffer from depression

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:52.440
like across the board the whole time, every time.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440
Like, are you taking medication for it?

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.440
And what medication?

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:02.440
And anytime you want to say, you don't have to answer anything.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.440
But from what age were you when you were like,

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.440
I'm fucking clinically depressed.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.440
When did you know?

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:19.440
I mean, I always felt like sad for sure,

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:26.440
but probably around going away to college really felt plummeted down.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.440
Just being like, got shipped upstate to upstate New York school

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:34.440
was like completely like alone in the cold and just like shit.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:38.440
Is it a daily thing or is it something that kind of comes and goes or is it day to day?

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.440
It's like day to day.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.440
Did it start to affect you?

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:48.440
What was the tipping point when you went to a doctor and started treating it

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:53.440
as if it was a clinical thing as opposed to a thing that was wrong with you

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.440
that you were dealing with on your own?

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.440
Get leaving college.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.440
Did you drop out?

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.440
I dropped out when I went back, but I dropped out at 18, went home

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.440
and was just completely depressed.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.440
And then my mom, you know, I was like, we have to go to therapy.

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.440
So you dropped out because you were like, I can't handle college.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.440
So there was a course, this is important to a lot of people that are listening.

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:21.440
There was a point where you were like, oh, there's something neat.

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:30.440
There was a point where you atoned with this thing where you were like, oh, it's medical.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:35.440
I mean, and I'm sure as a smart person, you're like, well, I don't want somebody

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.440
in a lab coat telling me why my personality is different.

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.440
It's frustrating because I understand it and I know it,

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:46.440
but the behaviors won't change and my emotions won't change.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:51.440
So I understand everything about it and it's so frustrating, it's so frustrating.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.440
Do you think that, so taking well butchering, what does that do?

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.440
Does it kind of even you out?

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:02.440
Everything's not like sharp edges.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:05.440
I'm not reacting to things so harshly.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.440
It just kind of takes the edge off of things.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.440
Is there anything that you miss?

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.440
Do you feel zombified by?

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.440
Stop taking SSRIs because they completely take away your sex drive and make you gain weight.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.440
What's SSRI?

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.440
Like serotonin uptake inhibitors.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.440
Selective serotonin uptake inhibitor.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.440
That defines a different kind of medication.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.440
Psychology major.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.440
That defines a certain type of medication.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.440
Yeah, that affects the serotonin.

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:35.440
Well butchering is like a...

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:38.440
It's a MAOI, which I don't even know what it stands for.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.440
So serotonin, which is like...

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.440
Yeah, okay.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.440
Excuse me, I have a million questions.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.440
So that happened at what age in your life?

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.440
Like when you crossed that threshold?

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.440
18.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440
I'm going to deal with this.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.440
And you've been on well beechering that whole time?

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.440
No, I've been on SSRIs up until about...

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.440
But those are terrible.

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.440
Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:07.440
I was on them because you just trust your doctor in forever.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.440
And I was just like, oh cool.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.440
So I was on them for so long.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.440
But then didn't like the effects, kept trying to take myself off.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.440
But then kept having like really bad episodes.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:22.440
And then like finally talked to like actually a holistic psychologist, psychiatrist,

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.440
to help me find like the right medication that matched with like what I was good for my body.

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:34.440
So it's a like really long process because like your brain is a fucking like fireworks display.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.440
And like there's...

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.440
When you're 12 years old, people are going to be like,

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.440
this person should have cotton balls taped to their skull.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:46.440
And it's like, oh yeah, I'm sure that would help them behave.

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:50.440
And now I'm clearly pursuing an agenda.

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:56.440
But it just seems like like I have a problem with doctors and pharmacology and stuff.

01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:03.440
But at the same time like would you say is going through this labyrinth that you've found like a pill

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:10.440
that it doesn't, it's not like, oh shit, I'm at the top of my game.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:17.440
No, like I like, if it stays like this for like another 10 years or so, I think like,

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.440
I don't think I would try like, I don't know, like EC, like I don't know,

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.440
like I don't know the next step what you would do if you're like depressed forever.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.440
Well, what do you think really would be?

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.440
I mean go there, that was the dark crevice that you just approached.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440
Like what would you say?

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.440
Like what were you about to say?

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.440
I don't want to say ECT, but.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.440
What does that mean?

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.440
What is it?

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.440
Like electroshock therapy.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.440
Well, I mean, but wow, really?

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.440
Oh yeah, I don't know.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.440
I've heard that works.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.440
Like you would, you would.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:48.440
Well, like one of my favorite authors was severely depressed and he did that,

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.440
like he did that after like multiple years, but then he ended up killing himself.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.440
So I don't know.

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.440
Who was that?

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.440
David Foster Wallace.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.440
David Foster Wallace.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.440
Yeah.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.440
That's what I thought you were going to say.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:01.440
Well, don't.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.440
I'm not going to kill myself.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.440
I'm not going to kill myself.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.440
You're going to say David Foster Wallace was like, don't say that.

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.440
And then don't do that.

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.440
Tara, like what's a good day for you?

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440
Like, do you.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.440
I have plenty of good days for sure.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.440
And that's just what I just did.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.440
I'm really into yoga.

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:21.440
So I do a lot of yoga, get it up.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.440
If I get to do yoga, go to work.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.440
I started doing like stand up three weeks ago.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.440
Really?

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.440
Yeah.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.440
So.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.440
Awesome.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.440
Where?

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.440
Oh, that's fucking ballsy as hell.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:38.440
I have a crazy night feeling that that is like in lieu of like all this fucking like

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.440
labyrinth.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.440
I don't want to keep questioning these guys and their lab coats and stuff.

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:50.440
But like, I, I feel like when you have thoughts in your head and you say them into a microphone

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:55.440
and then they can laugh or they can cry or they can sit in silence.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.440
But what they don't do is the thing that you're afraid that they might do inside your head.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.440
Like the thing that you would project where they would go like, oh, you're a fucking animal.

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.440
I'm going to fucking take you and kill you.

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:12.440
Like, like, I think like, like, like just talking, just saying it.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.440
This is very, very self-justifying of me.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.440
But that that's, I'm not saying it will supplant any kind of therapy.

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440
But I think that's fantastic for you.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:28.440
To just like communicate and talk empty your head, everything that's in your head, no matter

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.440
how crazy it is, all those jagged edges you're talking about.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.440
I need to like put them out there and then all these people out there like, like, oh, yeah,

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.440
totally.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.440
I got it.

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.440
Or some of them are like, really?

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440
Wow.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.440
Okay.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.440
New thing to think about.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.440
And then like, in any case, it's like, it's gone.

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.440
Also, just to be able to like come up like tonight, not that like we're any big help,

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.440
but like to come up and say the word depression and know that's a thing and say it out loud.

01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:02.440
Because we all know people like, you know, like, like Robin, Robin Williams on our show,

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.440
like we met him and stuff.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.440
And like, that wasn't something that it was really talked about, you know, and he like,

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.440
he dealt with his own shit for like, for a long, long time.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:17.440
And because of him and what happened to him, a lot of comics and like especially comics

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:23.440
that I know that deal with depression, like said, oh, fuck, like, I can, I can talk about

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.440
that.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.440
And I need to talk about that.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.440
And, and that's a conversation that could happen.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.440
And it's not something that's a fake thing.

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.440
It's a real thing.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:38.440
And it's a, it's pretty common thing too, especially among artists and like, like in this community.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:44.440
So like that, you know, like, there was a, there was a time when no one said they had cancer.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:48.440
And so people just quietly had cancer and didn't get treatment because that wasn't something

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:49.440
that you did.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.440
You didn't talk about it.

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:55.440
So it's, it's good to like, like, like open up the like lines of communication on that.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:00.440
And like, like, I mean, I can't imagine what that must be like, but it's, it's very impressive

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:05.440
that you can make the journey out to the city and start doing stand-up, which is terrifying.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.440
I do improv stand-up scares me.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.440
Like, well, sadness is never talked about.

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.440
It's like, it's people too sad.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.440
But it's like fucking hilarious.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.440
Yeah.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440
Well, yeah, hilarious.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:21.440
And you're like, put like a yes to it.

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.440
I'm always harping on that.

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.440
So like the, the, the Campbell talked about that.

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.440
That it's like the first joke we hear is the game of peekaboo, which is like a kid.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.440
It's just a kid that they need their mom to be there.

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:38.440
So bad that their mom not being there is tear is the equivalent of death.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:44.440
And so the mom does not really realizing that she's playing on death with the kid goes like,

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:48.440
like, like it's, it's, it's, it's universal.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.440
It doesn't matter.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.440
It transcends language, culture, everything.

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.440
It's like moms with little kids.

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.440
They, they, they do this thing.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.440
They cover their face and the baby starts to go.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:03.440
And then the mom like exposes her face and the baby goes.

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:10.440
And the baby goes.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.440
It's, it's the first joke.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:17.440
And then like, like his comedy is fucking like, it's, it's like, it only comes from the gut

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:23.440
when it's like, no, I understand death, like, like despair, like the, the, the bottoms and

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.440
the tops of, of, of this entire valve that we're being pushed through.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.440
That's, that's what it is.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:32.440
And the great standups that like, like all the, all the, all my heroes as a standup,

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.440
there's an incredible, awesome, terrifying loneliness that goes on for the great standups

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:41.440
that get out there and are willing to stand alone on stage and expose themselves like

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.440
that.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:46.440
Like that's, that's, that's a tremendous amount of courage and, and to be good at

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:51.440
that is to be willing to like wallow in that, like that sol, solitude.

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.440
Yeah.

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:56.440
Coming out to LA by yourself and subjecting yourself to that, like, who knows if you'd

01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:01.440
ever be funny, but like God knows, like, yeah, the, the, the, you're, you're already

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:02.440
on the right path.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:05.440
Like, like step on the gas in that direction that you would stand in front of a microphone

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:10.440
and go, I would experiment with like, what's the least funny thing I could say to these

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.440
people?

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.440
What's the thing I could say that would make them want to blow their brains out because

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:21.440
they're one step from that to a amazing punchline, which is Mitch Hedberg and like, like, like,

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:25.440
like, you know, it, probably a bad example.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:30.440
The, the, it's not a bad example because like fucking great comics, they fucking, they,

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:34.440
they die young because they're, they're all over the place.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.440
Artists are all over the place.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:40.440
Um, forgive yourself for being all over the place for sure.

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:45.440
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, just like a Monday, it's like, I'm the greatest

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:46.440
person in the world.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.440
And Monday afternoon, it's like, I'm such a piece of shit.

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:53.440
I like, like, that's absolutely, that's called being creative.

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:56.440
I think that's the engine that drives it.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:02.440
It's not a license to be like, I call the lumber yard and go, I'm not going to do lumber anymore.

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:09.440
Dan Harmon told me if I have mood swings, I'm an artist.

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.440
It's not necessarily true.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.440
Like, like, like, like it's, but what it is is it's, it's absolutely part and parcel of,

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.440
of, of creating shit for sure.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.440
I kind of, I kind of feel like we dragged you up and asked you for your bullshit and then told you

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.440
about your shit that you probably already know.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.440
Like, let me tell you another thing, young lady.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:31.440
But the big takeaway is that you're not alone.

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.440
There's, there's, there's so many.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.440
I mean, this podcast has helped a lot.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.440
No, these pieces are shit.

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.440
They're, they're here for everybody, honestly.

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:42.440
I mean, the fact that like half the crowd knew when you said SRTIS, whatever that thing was,

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:46.440
like a couple of people were like, boo, and a couple of people were like, yeah.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.440
People knew what it meant.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:52.440
Like, there's probably a handful or more of people that also like suffer from depression here.

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.440
Like, it's right.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.440
Yup.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.440
Dave Kline, you're the first.

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:02.440
Dave Kline's deep, deep, deep, deep depression sufferer.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440
We met at Rob Schrupp's birthday.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.440
We do.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.440
You had my birthday?

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.440
We smoked a joint in the back.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.440
You went, you went to my birthday and sent a family?

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.440
Yeah.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.440
You had a good time?

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.440
Mm-hmm.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:21.440
That was very, very sweet of you.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.440
But Dan was in New York.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.440
Dan was in New York. He had an excuse.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.440
He had an excuse, no.

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.440
No, Dan had an excuse because my birthday only happens once.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.440
And it's not a different date every year.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.440
It's hard to keep track.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.440
But thank you.

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.440
Thank you so much for coming.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.440
Did you have a good time?

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:38.440
Yeah, it was a great birthday party.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.440
Thank you.

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.440
It was a fun time.

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.440
Oh, well, great.

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.440
Tara, have you made any friends since you've been out here?

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.440
Like, how long, how long have you been out again?

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.440
About a month, a little over a month.

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.440
Have you made any friends since you've been here?

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.440
Kind of?

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.440
Kind of, yeah.

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.440
I mean, that's the hardest part, for sure.

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.440
Do you have any close friends back home?

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.440
I want, like, genuine connection friends.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.440
Of course.

01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:00.440
But you make, like, five-minute friends here.

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.440
Actually, I know.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.440
But you'll make lifelong friends very quickly.

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.440
Yeah.

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.440
For certain.

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:10.440
Just reject the first five from this crowd because you've been up here.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.440
The first five are going to be just flush up.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.440
Excuse me, Ms. Middle-Eady.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.440
I just put them in the battered deck.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.440
Thank God Ryan Ridley's not here.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:32.440
Well, would you do us the honor of staying up here and playing Shadowrun with us?

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.440
Okay.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.440
Yay.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.440
I love it.

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.440
All right.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:40.440
You missed my Ryan Ridley impression.

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:46.440
Kids, if you're feeling sad, talk to people.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.440
You got to talk to someone.

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.440
You're not alone.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.440
Don't do anything.

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.440
She's not case in point.

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:53.440
She's an adult and was, like, dealing with her shit.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.440
I'm saying, as long as we're on the topic, because I have a Tumblr and I get these messages

01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:01.440
and these kids are, like, fucking, like, tell me what to do.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:03.440
And, like, they're on the precipice.

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:13.440
It's a fucking, like, if you're below 35 and you're thinking about, like, the extreme

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:19.440
version of the solution to your problems, just before you do that, experiment, since

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.440
you're about to do that, just try talking to somebody.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.440
Just talk to somebody.

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.440
It's not, like, just give it a shot.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:28.440
Do something crazy.

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:29.440
Like, go walk across.

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:35.440
Like, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to just, like, try and walk across America first.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.440
Like, if you're going to hit the point, just do something crazy.

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.440
Like, do something crazy first, see if it changes anything in your brain.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:47.440
But it will stress that one of the aggravating things when you're in that state is that people

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.440
approaching you logically and saying, the reason you shouldn't do it is because, look,

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.440
it's a wonderful life.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.440
And it's like, fuck you.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.440
It's not a logic thing.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:58.440
It's just, like, fucking, it's a grand theft auto thing.

01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.440
Like, you're about to do it.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.440
Just fucking do one thing first, talk to somebody.

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:05.440
You've got to hear it.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.440
It's rattling around in your brain.

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.440
It's not, like, just fucking, have it come out of your mouth.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.440
Everybody feels that way.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:16.440
Sometimes you may feel that way all the time.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.440
Like, you've got to talk to somebody about it.

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.440
Like, if you're under a certain age, it's an epidemic.

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:23.440
What are you saying?

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.440
Are you saying over 35 steps?

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:32.440
No, I'm just saying, like, over 35, if you want to kill yourself, fuck you.

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.440
Well, that's a hard line.

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:37.440
Dan's taking a hard line.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.440
It's a joke.

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.440
It's a joke.

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:44.440
Well, Tara, thank you, like, for all of our hearts.

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.440
That's fucking awesome.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:50.440
Thank you for being vulnerable to us and sharing your...

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.440
Thank you, guys.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.440
Like, take whatever pain you've got there and, like, turn it into beautiful artwork

01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.440
for the rest of us.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.440
Don't tell us what to do.

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.440
Because that's...

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.440
I think that you...

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.440
If you look back through the history of, like, art and culture,

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.440
I think you'd probably find out a lot of people were going through something similar,

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.440
you know, and different, or maybe exactly the same.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:18.440
I think a lot of what's benefited humanity is people, like, turning intense pain into...

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:25.440
That's what humans probably have different than most other animals is that we take our sadness

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.440
and we've created art, you know, so...

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.440
All right, hit the showers, Jeff.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.440
I'm sorry.

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.440
That offended you.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.440
No, it didn't offend me.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.440
It offended everybody else.

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:37.440
That's not true.

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.440
They laughed.

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.440
We have showers.

01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.440
I'm gonna hand this pile of things down.

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.440
I don't know what to do with them.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.440
I have my own character.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.440
I don't have my sunglasses, so I won't be able to read them.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.440
Rob doesn't have his sunglasses.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:53.440
I don't have my sunglasses, so I won't be able to read them.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.440
What about Timorge?

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.440
Also...

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.440
Yeah, Timorge!

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440
What the fuck is Timorge?

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.440
Timorge Brown!

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.440
Timorge!

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.440
I don't know.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440
Who am I?

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440
What's my character?

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.440
You can sit on my lap if you want.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.440
I'll take...

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:11.440
I'll take...

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.440
Can you read it for me?

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.440
Are you playing your character?

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.440
I'll play...

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.440
Do you want to play?

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:16.440
Do you want to play?

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.440
You usually hate to play this game.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.440
I think that Timorge should sit.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.440
I was...

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.440
This is racist.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.440
I agree with Spencer.

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440
Yeah.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440
I think...

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.440
I think...

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.440
Okay, well let's let you be the judge.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:31.440
Is it racist if you're standing the whole show?

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.440
No.

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440
I like you all in black, Timorge.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.440
It's a good look for you.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.440
The man in black is nice.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:40.440
I want you to blend in with the tablecloth.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.440
Let's get...

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.440
Let's see...

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:45.440
I mean, Steve Levy gets paid to just exist.

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.440
Timorge, take his seat.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.440
Whoa!

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.440
Sorry, Steve.

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.440
What do you mean, whoa?

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.440
You know, it's acceptable losses.

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.440
Let's be honest.

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440
Capitalism.

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.440
Levy knew what he signed up for.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.440
Steve Levy.

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:00.440
Thanks, man.

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.440
He's been summarily dismissed.

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:05.440
He had my back on Lord of the Rings.

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.440
What can I say?

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.440
Come on, you guys.

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.440
I'm right.

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.440
I'm right about that.

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:12.440
You know, I've been away for a bit.

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.440
The mission up till now, you guys are off to...

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.440
Rob has become a southern bell, ghoul, and disguise.

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.440
Right?

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.440
Yeah.

01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:22.440
Do you know what happened?

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.440
You should tell us.

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.440
That was my ghoul voice.

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440
Well, you have the recap for us.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.440
I mean, I don't.

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.440
That's the thing.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.440
No one wrote one.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.440
Okay, real quick.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.440
This is really falling down.

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.440
Get me up to speed on what the mission is and where we're at in the mission.

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.440
All right.

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440
You got hired.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440
You got hired by Peggy.

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:42.440
You got hired by Peggy to find her daughter, Jim, who was last seen at one of these ghoul

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.440
clinics, the kind that teaches ghouls how to not eat people.

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.200
So you were going around.

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.440
You saw David, one of Hortegaard's, no, Dr. Friend's friends.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.600
You talked to him about meat markets.

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:55.760
You went back.

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:58.280
You called a bunch of people.

01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.120
And then you decided to go to the clinic where you thought that might be some more information.

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:05.120
And...

01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.120
Didn't there be music over this?

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:15.120
Justin Marshall is driving back from Wisconsin.

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.120
Oh, he drove there?

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.120
Jesus Christ.

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.120
It's bad weather.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.120
All right.

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.120
So are we...

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.120
Are we...

01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:23.120
Are we...

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.120
We got an Uber.

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.120
I listened to the last one.

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.120
Rob became a Southern Belle ghoul in disguise and we're going up to a...

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:29.120
Is this a fresh to...

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.120
Fresh to flesh?

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:31.120
A flesh to flesh?

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.120
It's...

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.120
This one's called Press F5 to Reflesh.

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:35.120
Press...

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.120
Press F5 to Reflesh.

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.120
Thank you.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.120
I'm so sorry, young lady.

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:39.120
I forget your name and...

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:40.120
Tara.

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:41.120
I'm so sorry.

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.120
Tara.

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:43.120
I'm so sorry, audience.

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.120
The problem, Tara.

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:45.120
Thank you for coming to my birthday party.

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:46.120
You too, DeMorge.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:47.120
Oh, thank you.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.120
Thank you, DeMorge.

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.120
Thank you for having me.

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.120
No, no, no.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:51.120
No, I was just...

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:52.120
Made...

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.120
Made...

01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:57.120
Just, you know, we're not all going to be here forever, you know.

01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.120
It's just great that...

01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.120
It's good to have friends.

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.120
Good to have friends.

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:01.120
It's good to have...

01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:02.120
Good to have friends.

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:03.120
I want a friend.

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.120
Friends that stick by you.

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.120
I was a peer mediator in junior high, if you guys want me to...

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.120
No, you were what?

01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:11.120
Would you please peer mediator?

01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:13.120
A peer mediator in junior high.

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.120
Do we have a show next week?

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.120
Leavey?

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.120
Yes.

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:17.120
Yes.

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.120
Can she come peer-mediate me and Schrab?

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.120
A lot of shit to work on.

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.120
Let's do it right now.

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.120
Why don't we...

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.120
No, we got a fucking shadow ride.

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.120
We don't have to do shit.

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.120
Yeah, we...

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.120
Come on.

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.120
Piece of shit.

01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:30.120
Can you peer-mediate three-way?

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:31.120
Can you do it?

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.120
Okay.

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.120
Yeah, we need to work some shit out.

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:42.120
Because I've been friends with a couple of fucking shitheads for 20 years.

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:47.120
And it takes its toll.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.120
Worked out for you.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.120
Worked out for you pretty good.

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:51.120
Yeah.

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:54.120
Worked out for me.

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.120
Worked out for me.

01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.120
I built myself out of dirt without permission.

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.120
Yep.

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.120
I fucking clawed my way out of this Batman hole.

01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.120
The broken back came back to Gotham.

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:07.120
Shouldn't there be music under this?

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.120
No one ever did me any favors.

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:11.120
Yeah.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.120
Yeah.

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:13.120
Yeah.

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.120
All right.

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.120
Fucking cool it.

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.120
Let's play a shadow ride.

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.120
Yeah.

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.120
It's always been me and me.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:22.120
Wow, what's his problem, Tara?

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.120
I know.

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.120
Fucking...

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:25.120
Guys, fucking mad on Vulcan.

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:26.120
We'll mediate next week.

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:28.120
Tune in.

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.120
Tara's got a peer mediate.

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.120
It's going to get to the bottom of this shit.

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:34.120
This guy's been chiseling away.

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:36.120
He's coming to my birthday party.

01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:37.120
It's fucked up.

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.120
It makes me feel bad.

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.120
Why didn't you go to the birthday party?

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:40.120
I don't remember.

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:45.120
I had to go to New York because I was doing the thing about it.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:48.120
I'm offended by that.

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:52.120
As an Asian.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.120
All right, so we're out front of the Press 5 to Reflesh?

01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.120
Let me do all the talking.

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:02.120
All right.

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:05.120
I have also taken...

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.120
What character are you playing?

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.120
I have no fucking idea.

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:12.120
I've taken your makeup kit, and so I have...

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:17.120
Eve Libertine, I have made myself into Southern Belle as well.

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:20.120
You have a little mush on there.

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.120
You're a little...

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.120
Here, let me do it.

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.120
All right.

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.120
You're good.

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.120
Okay, now we all look like ghouls.

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:33.120
I'm going to go to the front door and see if we can get in here.

01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:39.120
Just as a bit of descent could hold the guard,

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.120
maybe not go with the makeup kit,

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:46.120
and adopt the personality of his security guard ID.

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.120
Sure, yeah, definitely.

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.120
Just as an alternate.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.120
That...

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.120
What?

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:56.120
It seems a bit uncomfortable that it...

01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:59.120
I guess one of us won't be a ghoul then.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.120
Okay, that makes sense.

01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.120
All right.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:08.120
I hope that I will stand ten feet behind you as if to present you, possibly.

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.120
Okay, so I guess I won't do all the talking.

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.120
You'll do all the talking.

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:16.120
Oh, no, you can do all the talking.

01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.120
Please do.

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.120
They will recognize you as ghouls.

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.120
All right, all right.

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.120
So, like, Tara and I are going to go up,

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.120
and you pretend like you're...

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.120
You caught us.

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.120
Okay.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.120
Yeah, okay, just cheer.

01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.120
You got to eat that mic.

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:34.120
You got to eat that mic.

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.120
Okay, okay.

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.120
But I'm going to knock on the door.

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.120
Don't take that from me.

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.120
I'm with you, too.

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.120
Please let it be.

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.120
All right, you knock on the door.

01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.120
Yeah, thank you.

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:54.120
Never in my mind have I heard such a ghoul-ish knock.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.120
What?

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:56.120
Twenty...

01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:59.120
Twenty minutes passes.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.120
I should probably knock again.

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.120
Okay.

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.120
Okay.

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120
Okay.

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.120
Okay.

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120
Okay.

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.120
Okay.

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.120
Okay.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.120
Okay.

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.120
Okay.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.120
Okay.

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.120
Okay.

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:20.120
I should probably knock again.

01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:26.120
Using an active soft via electronics,

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.120
can I just access the opening of the door?

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.120
Oh, I mean, you don't even need electronics.

01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.120
There's a handle.

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:35.120
Yeah.

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.120
I reach out and open the door.

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.120
All right.

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.120
You open the door.

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.120
But I'm still fanning with my right hand.

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.120
Okay.

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.120
Okay.

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:46.120
Okay.

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.120
Left hand to open the door.

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.120
Fanning with my right hand.

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.120
All right.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.120
May I suggest a Blue Angels formation with one in the front,

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:54.120
two sort of a chevron?

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.120
Starburst.

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.120
Starburst.

01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.120
Well, is it starburst or chevron?

01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.120
Let's get this straight.

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:02.120
We starburst and the starburst, we form a chevron.

01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.120
Okay.

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:04.120
All right.

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.120
You enter a large waiting room.

01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.120
It's walls covered by huge flat panel screens,

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.120
calming scenes of nature.

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.120
You see several low waiting chairs

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:16.120
and a young man seated at a large circular desk

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:18.120
in the middle of the room.

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.120
I'll do all the talking.

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.120
He's pale and you can see from his clawed fingers

01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:26.120
that he's clearly a ghoul.

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.120
He's got the dead eyes of a ghoul.

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.120
Are you listening?

01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:32.120
He's a fucking ghoul.

01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:34.120
He's dressed like a ghoul.

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.120
I'm dressed like a ghoul too.

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:38.120
I've got my parasol and my fan.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.120
Hi.

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:43.120
As you get closer, you see his dead eyes

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.120
have been replaced with robot eyes.

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.120
Cyber eyes, rather.

01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:51.120
I couldn't help but notice you have some cyber eyes.

01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:59.120
Perhaps you could tell me where they keep all of the meat.

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.120
What are we after?

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.120
We're after the...

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.120
Yeah, look to meat.

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:09.120
We're trying to find Jim Peggy's daughter.

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:13.120
We're trying to find Peggy's daughter, Jim.

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.120
Maybe you could use your cybernetic eye sockets

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.120
to show us where that could be,

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:24.120
seeing as how we're both ghouls and all.

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.120
Yeah, no, no problem.

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:28.120
Let me just check the registry.

01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:30.120
Ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket.

01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.120
She's not listed here.

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:35.120
Is there a last name or anything?

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.120
Uh, probably. Could you check again?

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.120
Yeah, certainly.

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.120
Ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket.

01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.120
Nope, there's no one by that name.

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.120
We're a pretty new operation,

01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.120
so it's pretty easy to see whether or not

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.120
anyone has come through or not,

01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:52.120
and I'm not seeing that.

01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:55.120
Oh, do we have the last name or not?

01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:57.120
Hill.

01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.120
Hill was the last name.

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.120
Jim Hill.

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.120
Yep.

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.120
You did.

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:07.120
Okay, or Dan will.

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:13.120
I've spent the last couple of days researching your operation.

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.120
Pretty familiar with the fact that your spreadsheets

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.120
don't include everything they should.

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:24.120
Kind of looking for a girl that came through

01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.120
and then went out, you know what I mean?

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:29.120
Yeah, no, like I said, we just opened up pretty recently.

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.120
Like goodness, I could have told you

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.120
anyone who's walked through these doors,

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.120
that name, definitely not here.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.120
So here's what I'm going to tell you.

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.120
Like, this is the point where you either

01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:43.120
betray yourself to be useless or useful.

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:45.120
Okay.

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:47.120
If you're useful, it's because you're lying.

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:49.120
If you're useless, it's because you're an idiot.

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.120
Alright.

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:54.120
I got a gun in my arm.

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.120
It's going to come out at the speed of light.

01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.120
A bullet's going to go through your brain.

01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.120
Alright.

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.120
Well, I'm sorry, what?

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:05.120
Boop.

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.120
Boom, shooting you.

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.120
Let's do a reaction.

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.120
Sorry.

01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:13.120
It's reflect.

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:15.120
What are you doing?

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.120
It's what I do.

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.120
You had your chance.

01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.120
You did a terrible job.

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.120
I tried once and you shot it in the brain.

01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.120
You talk to people and you say garbage.

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:27.120
What are you doing?

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.120
I shoot people in the head.

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.120
It's my job.

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.120
It's all I do.

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:35.120
What is he doing?

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:37.120
I shoot people in the head.

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:39.120
Oh gosh.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.120
The minute I'm needed

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:43.120
is the minute you failed.

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.120
Alright.

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.120
Well, he's dead.

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:49.120
Okay, quick.

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:51.120
He's dead.

01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:53.120
What?

01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.120
What?

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.120
I can't hear the game master.

01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.120
What happened?

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.120
Yeah, I don't care what everyone's laughing at.

01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:03.120
It was funny probably.

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.120
Terrorists are something funny but I couldn't hear it.

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:07.120
Oh, sorry.

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:09.120
Sorry, Tara.

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.120
Tara, what?

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.120
It's fine.

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:15.120
It's just like a perfect Sean Connery impression.

01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.120
It's like, do Sean Connery again?

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:19.120
Nope, nope.

01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:21.120
Most things down here are not regular.

01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:23.120
He falls forward.

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.120
On to the security button.

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.120
What are you doing?

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.120
I go through his computer

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.120
or I guess desk and see if I can find...

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.120
Flax on sound.

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.120
Obviously, I moved the...

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.120
Yeah, because as I just said...

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:39.120
The security button obviously would never let that person

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:41.120
fall onto a security button.

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.120
Uh...

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:45.120
Tell that to the security button.

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.120
Well, okay, so I moved them

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:49.120
but I'm just letting you know they moved them.

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.120
What?

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:53.120
Well, I moved them.

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:55.120
What does that mean, Satan?

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:57.120
I shot the person.

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.120
They died.

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:01.120
They fell onto the button.

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:03.120
I accept that you're allowed to create a security button.

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:05.120
He was pressing it.

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.120
That's why you shot him.

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.120
Obviously...

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:11.120
He didn't fall onto the button.

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.120
No, he fell onto the button.

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.120
I'm not crying foul, I'm just saying to you...

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.120
I moved them off of the security button.

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:19.120
It's been pressed.

01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:21.120
Lord of the Guard can use his...

01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:23.120
his detect enemy sense to see if there is some

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:25.120
maneuvering going on behind the scenes.

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.120
Yeah, you could definitely...

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:29.120
you could definitely feel seven or eight guards.

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:31.120
So here's what I proposed

01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:33.120
given that I am dressed as a security guard

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.120
and that my alias would be Frank Douglas.

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:37.120
That perhaps you guys pretend

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:39.120
to be ghouls I have captured

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:41.120
and if they do arrive, we use this as some sort of cover.

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:43.120
Such a good idea.

01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:45.120
Should I heal the guy who killed

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:47.120
me? I don't know if he's...

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.120
He's had a bad day.

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:51.120
I don't think he's healable.

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.120
Honestly, if we talk later

01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.120
I'll tell you, I regret what I did.

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.120
But in the moment

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.120
I'm telling you, my objective was

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:01.120
to make him sick beyond healing.

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:05.120
I'm not bragging.

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:07.120
I succeeded.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.120
He's dead.

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:11.120
I kill people.

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:13.120
As a matter of urgency

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:15.120
this situation can be multi-phasic

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.120
so that we could do all these things at once.

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.120
For example, you could try to heal him

01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:21.120
at the same time provided that does not work

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.120
or the door opens sooner. He's dead.

01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.120
I could be a security guard.

01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:27.120
Honestly, I'm offended by the idea that you can heal this guy.

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:29.120
I do one thing for a living

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:31.120
and when I do it, it's done.

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:33.120
If you could heal him, I'm fired.

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.120
I position myself behind the desk

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:39.120
in case people are coming in

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:41.120
to overtake us.

01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:43.120
What else is in the room?

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:45.120
It's just a waiting room.

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:47.120
There's chairs, there's a potted plant,

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.120
there's large TVs.

01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:51.120
I hide behind the pot of the plant.

01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:53.120
It's not that big, but okay.

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:55.120
I didn't say it had to be.

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:57.120
Okay guys, here's the thing.

01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:59.120
We got three minutes.

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:01.120
Why were we here?

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:03.120
We got to find Peggy Hill

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:05.120
and get her out of here.

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:07.120
Jim Hill to get to bring her back to Peggy Hill.

01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:09.120
Of course she's here.

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:11.120
The smoke grenade flies through the hallway

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:13.120
into the waiting room.

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:15.120
Clink, clink, clink.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.120
I cast mana barrier over the smoke grenade

01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.120
to make it not cover us.

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:21.120
It takes longer than that to cast a mana barrier.

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:23.120
Well, I fucking start.

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.120
Can I cast physical barrier?

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:27.120
Creates a dome or wall?

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:29.120
It takes the same amount of time.

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:33.120
Smoke spills out into the room,

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:35.120
starts to mist the area.

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:37.120
I start banning the smoke.

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:39.120
The barrier goes up,

01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:41.120
starts covering the smoke.

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:45.120
This is doing nothing?

01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:47.120
No, no, it's not.

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:49.120
I might suggest to the other ghosts

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:51.120
that they all also fan the smoke

01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.120
and the creative sort of feelings.

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:55.120
I use my southern bell fan to fan the...

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:57.120
Everybody.

01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:59.120
We all do it.

01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:01.120
This isn't helping.

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:03.120
I summon a giant eagle

01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:05.120
who is also dressed as a southern bell.

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:07.120
And the eagle...

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:09.120
His wings are made out of giant southern bell fans.

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.120
All right.

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:13.120
To waft the smoke away from us.

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:15.120
A lot of ghouls in this room.

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:17.120
The room is covered in gunfire as it cuts through the area.

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:19.120
The hallway...

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:21.120
is ablaze with guns.

01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:23.120
You guys all, you're being hit.

01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:25.120
Get down!

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:27.120
You're being hit, though.

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.120
Oh, my dick!

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:31.120
Oh, fuck! Oh, my dick!

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:33.120
Using combat since I've taken invasive action

01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:35.120
behind the counter.

01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:37.120
I also have my armor jacket on.

01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.120
Oh, God, give me your armor jacket.

01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:41.120
My dick's all fucked up.

01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:43.120
Oh, shit!

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:45.120
Hold the jacket.

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:47.120
Being at his roots, Scandinavian removes the armor jacket

01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:49.120
and place it around the pelvis.

01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:51.120
Oh, God.

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:53.120
The pain goes right up the side.

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.120
Oh, fuck.

01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:57.120
Do we see target, Spencer? Do we see the people?

01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.120
No, you're being shot.

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.120
You're taking damage.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.120
Are there gun guns around the thing?

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:05.120
They're just guns, gun guns.

01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:07.120
Bullets cut into your body.

01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.120
Oh, my fucking dick!

01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:11.120
Everybody except Hortegaard in his superhuman agility

01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:13.120
takes four wounds.

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:15.120
Just regular style, though.

01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:17.120
Can Hortegaard yell out to them,

01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:19.120
stop, stop with the firing?

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.120
Say this, I am a security guard.

01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:23.120
I am here for you.

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:25.120
I have brought you more meat, more flesh,

01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:27.120
more potential action

01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.120
for the profit of this organization

01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:31.120
and you are destroying

01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:33.120
the prime directive of the building

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:35.120
for which you were.

01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:37.120
You say those things,

01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:39.120
and then you see a flashbang grenade

01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:41.120
whizz into the center of the room.

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.120
As I am Scandinavian,

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:45.120
can I summon a sort of innate

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.120
football sense and

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:49.120
appropriate myself to the right?

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.120
Alright, maybe. We'll see about that.

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:53.120
Where's my mana barrier?

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:55.120
Did I ever get that?

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.120
It's covering the grenade, I thought, right?

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.120
Let me scan with my

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:01.120
gym nightblade skills.

01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:03.120
You can't tell me that I, out of all these people

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:05.120
who knew this was going to happen,

01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:07.120
you can't tell me I don't see some

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:09.120
air vent or egress

01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.120
that I can't.

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:13.120
There's the front door.

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:15.120
Hortegaard nimbly

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:17.120
kicks the flashbang

01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:19.120
moments before it explodes down the hallway.

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:21.120
You guys avoid taking an eye

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:23.120
full of flash. Nice job, Hortegaard.

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:25.120
I'm saying there's got to be an air vent

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:27.120
in

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:29.120
every story.

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:31.120
There's got to be an air vent.

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:33.120
Okay, there's an air vent.

01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:35.120
I use my

01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.120
grappling hook

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:39.120
Batman style.

01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:41.120
To me, it's not about

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:43.120
abandoning my friends, it's about me

01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.120
I'm going to save them later.

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:47.120
So I shoot my

01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:49.120
grappling hook at the thing

01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:51.120
that you're saying I saw.

01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.120
And I'm going to, the objective

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:55.120
is to, you know, ask Batman

01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:57.120
I'm going to go

01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:59.120
up into the air vent.

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.120
You hit the air vent with the grappling hook

01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:03.120
and you pull the retraction trigger

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:05.120
and it just, it pulls the grate

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:07.120
off.

01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.120
As fire continues

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.120
to spread through the room, gunfire,

01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:13.120
not fire fire.

01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:15.120
Hortegaard also has

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.120
a grappling gun. No one gets hit by that one though.

01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:19.120
Hortegaard has a grappling gun, perhaps I sacrifice

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:21.120
the gun for this purpose and shoot it into the vent.

01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:23.120
Alright.

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:25.120
Then taking it and anchoring it underneath

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:27.120
the office desk, I provide

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:29.120
a rope, direct

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.120
ground, the line from the ground to the thing.

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:33.120
If they're willing to climb, they can climb.

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.120
Alright.

01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.120
Those of you who are willing to climb can climb.

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:39.120
I know you're wearing dresses, I won't look up.

01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.120
I'll climb.

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:43.120
We should climb, you go first.

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:45.120
You go first, you go first.

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:47.120
And as we're climbing, I want to just make sure

01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:49.120
that you know that when we're climbing,

01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:51.120
this is weaving

01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:53.120
to make it harder for us to be shot.

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:55.120
Yeah.

01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:57.120
Serpentine. Serpentine.

01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:59.120
Climbing a rope is not a great way to avoid being shot at.

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:01.120
I don't know

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:03.120
if you heard me because sometimes my voice

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:05.120
doesn't carry, but if you just,

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:07.120
we're doing...

01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:09.120
Do we see who's shooting us?

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.120
We're doing that and it would

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:13.120
be harder than

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:15.120
not doing that.

01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:17.120
I look around to see who's shooting us.

01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:19.120
Who's shooting us?

01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.120
There's security guards.

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:23.120
They're in this hallway that those grenades were coming out of.

01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:25.120
They're just posted up

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:27.120
and a phalanx just spread

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:29.120
and bullets.

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:31.120
I shoot lightning bolts

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:33.120
at that corridor.

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:35.120
Force 4.

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:37.120
Force 4? Jesus.

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:41.120
Alright.

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:43.120
You only...

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:45.120
You only hit three of them.

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:47.120
They get buzzed

01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:49.120
by the things. You see them

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:51.120
shaking off their electricity

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:53.120
as they...

01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:55.120
They're just...

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:57.120
I can't talk.

01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:59.120
They're stunned for a moment.

01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:01.120
No.

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:03.120
We won. We won.

02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:05.120
No, you did not win.

02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:07.120
Three of the four of them have taken some

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.120
electricity damage.

02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:11.120
Three of the eight of them have taken some damage.

02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:13.120
Three of the eight.

02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:15.120
Is it my turn?

02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:17.120
Sure.

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:19.120
I believe the...

02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.120
Obviously, through the hole...

02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:23.120
We did the bit earlier where I pulled the vent down.

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:25.120
Yeah.

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.120
Now I go up through the hole.

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.120
Come on, man.

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:31.120
Alright.

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:33.120
Again, climbing a rope is not the best way to...

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:35.120
I don't need a rope. I'm gin nightblade.

02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:37.120
Nightblade. I use my super leap.

02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:39.120
Do you have...

02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:43.120
I have cybernetic... Don't look.

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.120
I'm

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:47.120
cybernetically augmented.

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:49.120
You don't have cybernetic legs, though.

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:51.120
Alright.

02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.120
Well, obviously...

02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.120
Why don't we just come down and kill these guys

02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:57.120
in the corridor here?

02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.120
You guys running through air vents.

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.120
I need a wardrobe change before I do that.

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.120
I'm still...

02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:05.120
Tell me what I accomplished.

02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:07.120
I'd like to get up through the vent

02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:09.120
and I'd like to go up into it.

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.120
I'm a coward.

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:13.120
Alright, you take two bullets in the leg

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.120
as you climb up.

02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:17.120
You get out, though. Taking three more wounds.

02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:19.120
Ow! Ow!

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.120
What about us?

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:25.120
Have we finished climbing

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.120
up the rope? Oh, good.

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.120
You climbed without getting any further damage.

02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:31.120
You two are the only ones who have climbed up.

02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.120
So,

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.120
no bullets in the leg?

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:37.120
Well, you had bullets earlier.

02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:39.120
You got hit earlier.

02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:41.120
But not in the legs.

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.120
Can I use my healing spells to heal us?

02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.120
Yeah, but you're still down on the floor level.

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.120
You haven't climbed up yet.

02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.120
What? I thought we were both climbing...

02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:51.120
Two people climbed successfully.

02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:53.120
No, Dan and Rob.

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.120
Oh.

02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:57.120
Yeah.

02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:59.120
I thought we were climbing together.

02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:01.120
Oh, do I have enough spell power?

02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:03.120
I jumped down.

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.120
I jumped down.

02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:07.120
But I got a hoop skirt on it.

02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:15.120
Get your mother-fucking-ass up there!

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:21.120
It is a disappointed hope

02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.120
that God shakes his leg.

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:29.120
I catch you fuckers at a bad time.

02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:33.120
I just start shooting my

02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:35.120
aris predator at the end of the hallway.

02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:37.120
I just start just blazing away

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:39.120
down the corridor to get the rest of the people.

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:41.120
All right. I mean,

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:43.120
yeah, you're still being fired at as you do there.

02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:45.120
I'm firing back. No dice?

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:47.120
There's no dice in the mood?

02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:49.120
I got the dice.

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:51.120
If you've ever played Shadowrun,

02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:53.120
there's no dice either.

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:55.120
There's a lot of dice.

02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:57.120
Don't you worry about that shit.

02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.120
How dare you?

02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:01.120
Half the fun is rolling the dice.

02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:03.120
Feel free to roll any dice you desire.

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:05.120
Guys, don't fight.

02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:07.120
Eve Libertine pops off a few shots

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:09.120
from her pistol,

02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:11.120
plugging another guy in the head.

02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:13.120
One of the guys goes down.

02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:15.120
Dead.

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:17.120
Hey, guys,

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:19.120
give my regards to the air conditioning system.

02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:21.120
I'm here fighting like a person.

02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:25.120
Can't hear you engaging

02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:27.120
in a narrative.

02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:31.120
Hodergaard applies mystic armor

02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.120
and then

02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:35.120
draws his aris alpha sight rifle

02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:37.120
and

02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:39.120
likewise shoots into the crowd.

02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:41.120
All right.

02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:43.120
You do that.

02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:45.120
Your mystic armor

02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.120
is already around, by the way.

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.120
That's given.

02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.120
You hit another guy.

02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:53.120
This one in his arm.

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.120
Your bullet smashes through his arm

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:57.120
and blows it clean off.

02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.120
He drops his gun.

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.120
Shit.

02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:03.120
Let's switch to the crusader.

02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:05.120
Let's have some fun here.

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:07.120
It's a machine pistol.

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.120
Let's start rapid-fire shooting

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:11.120
with the pistol.

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:13.120
Well, yeah, no. It's someone else's chair right now.

02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.120
Do you have weapons?

02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.120
I have a smart gun.

02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:19.120
Yeah, use the smart gun on him.

02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:21.120
That'll put him in.

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:23.120
You do that.

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.120
You also shoot someone.

02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:27.120
That's great.

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:29.120
He gets shot in the head,

02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:31.120
but he has a helmet this guy,

02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:33.120
so it just knocks him back several feet.

02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:35.120
He doesn't seem to be harmed.

02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.120
I run up to him

02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.120
and I use

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.120
astral beacon on him.

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.120
All right. You get torn apart

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:45.120
by a machine gun fire.

02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:51.120
As you approach

02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.120
six or seven security guards,

02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.120
their bullets

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.120
rip through your body,

02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:59.120
incorporating it into pink mist.

02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:01.120
What?

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:03.120
Cliffhanger!

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:07.120
You died.

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.120
Because you're the bad person.

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:11.120
Because having a birthday makes you bad.

02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:13.120
Not forgetting it.

02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.120
Let's thank DeMorge Brown.

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:19.120
Let's thank Chara for coming up.

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:21.120
Chara.

02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.120
Thank you so much, Chara.

02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:25.120
Thank you.

02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:27.120
Rob Schrab.

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.120
I'm Jeff Davis.

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:31.120
Your mayor is Dan Harmon.

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:35.120
Thank you, Zach.

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:37.120
The audio maniac in the booth.

02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:39.120
Justin Marshall.

02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:41.120
He's driving back from Wisconsin.

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:43.120
Kris Boruff, our director.

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:45.120
Kevin Day, our producer somewhere out in the ether.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.120
Thank you so much.

02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:49.120
We'll be back next week, right?

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:51.120
Are we? Yeah, we are.

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:53.120
Drive fast, take chances.

02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:55.120
We'll see you at the drawing.

02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:57.120
Did you get any of that?

02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:09.120
It's a good show.
