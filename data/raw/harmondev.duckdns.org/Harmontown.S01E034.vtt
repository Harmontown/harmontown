{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:27.200\nFrom the lofty heights of the comedy attic in Bloomington, Harmontown once again is in\n\n00:27.200 --> 00:32.800\nsession. Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:32.800 --> 01:01.960\nHello! He's making a drink, because he drank too much backstage, gotta make another drink.\n\n01:01.960 --> 01:12.560\nBut that wouldn't make sense. Wow, the rooms fall! I'm a Midwestern, or Indiana's\n\n01:12.560 --> 01:18.120\nthe Midwest, right? We're now even closer. We were in Pittsburgh last night and I was\n\n01:18.120 --> 01:23.400\nstarting to feel that familiar chill as I explained to my girlfriend. There's different\n\n01:23.400 --> 01:28.920\nkinds of coldness, and we're getting closer and closer to the coldness of my home. A coldness\n\n01:28.920 --> 01:35.480\nthat makes your heart cold, not just your skin. But it's a different flavor, and Indiana's\n\n01:35.480 --> 01:41.440\ncold is feeling more and more like Milwaukee's cold, and we're in the Midwest. I know that\n\n01:41.440 --> 01:47.640\nthere's a culture that comes with the Midwest that is directly attributed to its climate.\n\n01:47.640 --> 01:56.440\nWhen you live someplace where it gets this cold, you are the product of people whose\n\n01:56.440 --> 02:06.440\nwagons broke down, half way to California, and who decided, let's stick it out here.\n\n02:06.440 --> 02:10.360\nThere's a religion that has to come with that, a personal religion and a cosmic religion of\n\n02:10.360 --> 02:18.440\nlike, you know, don't have too much pretentiousness. We're an honest people in the Midwest because\n\n02:18.440 --> 02:24.560\nwe don't want to commit the crime of being overly ambitious, overly cocky. We stick\n\n02:24.560 --> 02:28.800\nto that Icarus myth very much. When you move to California from the Midwest, the people\n\n02:28.800 --> 02:34.440\nalways say, you'll be back, and they mean it as both an insult and a compliment. I know\n\n02:34.440 --> 02:39.440\nyou guys know this. I know Garrison Keeler already told you, and I know that every comic\n\n02:39.440 --> 02:42.680\nthat comes through here probably reminds you of it because there's an outside perspective\n\n02:42.680 --> 02:48.360\non that because I'm from the Midwest, Jeff. I just wanted to celebrate Indiana as being\n\n02:48.360 --> 02:55.280\nthe most exciting, specific state in the entire country. It's not...\n\n02:55.280 --> 02:56.840\nWhat makes it so specific?\n\n02:56.840 --> 03:02.600\nWell, there's a lot of things that make it very specific, Jeff.\n\n03:02.600 --> 03:03.680\nWhat is the typewriter?\n\n03:03.680 --> 03:13.920\nAs you know, I Wikipedia research every place we go, and yeah, you can see in just the effort\n\n03:13.920 --> 03:20.080\nthat someone took to... Sorry, I didn't actually have this up until you mentioned that. This\n\n03:20.080 --> 03:24.080\nwasn't like a pre-rehearsed bit. He just reminded me of the fact that... I don't know. Well,\n\n03:24.080 --> 03:27.760\nit doesn't matter. Why am I going to look? I don't read it. I looked at the Wikipedia\n\n03:27.760 --> 03:33.960\nthing and said, Indiana is the 19th state to blah, blah, blah. Everything's right in\n\n03:33.960 --> 03:40.040\nthe middle. Everything's like, it's the 16th coldest state. One thing, it started real\n\n03:40.040 --> 03:51.520\nhot. It was like, Indiana is the least extensive state in the contiguous United States, west\n\n03:51.520 --> 03:57.600\nof the Appalachians. Just even an attempt to be the least something came up short. It\n\n03:57.600 --> 04:03.560\njust bobbed right to the middle of the tank. Nothing extreme can be said or happen here.\n\n04:03.560 --> 04:06.640\nBut we're going to change that tonight. We're going to make Indiana the most extreme place\n\n04:06.640 --> 04:16.440\nin the world. Yeah, a guy just yelled out extreme Pringles for no reason. That's a new\n\n04:16.440 --> 04:24.920\nthing that happened here. A guy feeling comfortable yelling out extreme Pringles. Did you know,\n\n04:24.920 --> 04:33.280\nJeff, that Indiana invented glass? I thought that was the Phoenicians. Did you know that\n\n04:33.280 --> 04:43.560\nIndiana has more murders with hammers? Between the Appalachians and the Rockies, just the\n\n04:43.560 --> 04:48.960\nmost murders with hammers, period. Out of anywhere in the world. Did you know, Jeff,\n\n04:48.960 --> 05:00.520\nthat Indiana... I did not know that. Did you know they once successfully invaded Michigan?\n\n05:00.520 --> 05:06.720\nWhy didn't they annex it and keep it? Because they're cool people. They're good people.\n\n05:06.720 --> 05:18.880\nThey like it in Indiana. Did you know that fluorescent light was banned here for 13 years?\n\n05:18.880 --> 05:26.480\nBecause there was a socialist mare of Indianapolis? I don't know.\n\n05:26.480 --> 05:33.480\nWorth a try. Let's do... Also, the state famous for its basketball! Sports Corner!\n\n05:33.480 --> 05:44.760\nSports Corner! Hey, everybody, that's happening at the Dan Harmon Sports Corner. He knows about\n\n05:44.760 --> 05:51.480\nsports. He knows you like sports. We're going to talk about sports.\n\n05:51.480 --> 06:01.280\nBoy, the Hoosiers, Jeff, really out there dribbling the sphere. They've taken it basket\n\n06:01.280 --> 06:04.280\nto basket. It's been a great, great quarterly season.\n\n06:04.280 --> 06:09.600\nDo you feel that Gene Hackman's coming down too hard on the team?\n\n06:09.600 --> 06:14.120\nHackman's always been an offensive coach. In a time of defense, there are times when\n\n06:14.120 --> 06:18.960\nyou've got to go defense in the fiscal quarter.\n\n06:18.960 --> 06:21.680\nWhich of the four quarters is the most fiscal?\n\n06:21.680 --> 06:24.480\nWell, certainly you've got the Winter Conference, you've got the Spring Conference, and you've\n\n06:24.480 --> 06:31.720\ngot the Pumpkin, Pumpkin Bowl. Hackman, obviously, is going to be able to push that ball closer\n\n06:31.720 --> 06:39.520\nto the net. We're talking again about a game of yardage in those fall months, that fall\n\n06:39.520 --> 06:45.280\nseason, Jeff. So the key is to handicap the players. You've got to keep handicapping them.\n\n06:45.280 --> 06:47.600\nHow do you feel about all this Notre Dame scandal?\n\n06:47.600 --> 06:53.600\nWell, that was Chickens coming home to roost when you have a team poised with that kind\n\n06:53.600 --> 06:57.960\nof hubris. They're saying the things they're saying at the All-Stars, saying what they're\n\n06:57.960 --> 07:04.480\nsaying at Regionals, saying again, doubling down at All-Star Regionals, that you've got\n\n07:04.480 --> 07:11.080\na team that's got too much, too much high game and not enough low game. They've taken\n\n07:11.080 --> 07:16.520\ntoo many three-pointers, too many free agents, too much scrimmage, too much offense, Jeff.\n\n07:16.520 --> 07:20.400\nAnd it was going to cry, it was going to come tumbling down. They built a glass menagerie,\n\n07:20.400 --> 07:21.400\nJeff.\n\n07:21.400 --> 07:25.840\nGot you. And what do you do? Do you like the Pacers this year? What do you think?\n\n07:25.840 --> 07:28.600\nThey're good. They're looking good. They've got to keep those knees iced. They've got\n\n07:28.600 --> 07:37.360\nto keep everything. They're ducking around. Just keep focusing on the lines of scrimmage.\n\n07:37.360 --> 08:02.200\nNext corner! I had the volume down.\n\n08:02.200 --> 08:08.160\nSome facts about Bloomington, the city, Jeff. Six blocks from here is where Lincoln was\n\n08:08.160 --> 08:09.160\nshot.\n\n08:09.160 --> 08:10.160\nThe first time.\n\n08:10.160 --> 08:11.160\nYeah.\n\n08:11.160 --> 08:12.160\nYeah.\n\n08:12.160 --> 08:18.680\nLittle, I got winged in the leg on the way to a rehearsal for my American cousin at the\n\n08:18.680 --> 08:21.200\nFord Junior Theater.\n\n08:21.200 --> 08:23.680\nTake a hint, Abe.\n\n08:23.680 --> 08:27.960\nPeople don't publicize it because they want to make him into a big martyr. The truth is,\n\n08:27.960 --> 08:32.480\nhe was warned. And that was back when he supported slavery.\n\n08:32.480 --> 08:33.480\nYes.\n\n08:33.480 --> 08:34.480\nYeah.\n\n08:34.480 --> 08:37.120\nIt would have been a terrible news item back then.\n\n08:37.120 --> 08:46.560\nYeah, yeah, yeah. And the guy who assassinated him, John Wilkes Bench, the guy that shot\n\n08:46.560 --> 08:48.120\nhim the first time in the leg.\n\n08:48.120 --> 08:50.080\nOh, yeah. Gabriel Byrne.\n\n08:50.080 --> 08:55.320\nYou know what he, Bench. Gabriel Byrne Bench.\n\n08:55.320 --> 09:00.400\nYou know what he said to him in Latin as he shot him in the leg?\n\n09:00.400 --> 09:11.360\nTyrannus, Maltanus, Sixth Semper, don't anus, nanus, which means don't be a tyrant and\n\n09:11.360 --> 09:15.200\nthis won't happen in a more fatal way to you.\n\n09:15.200 --> 09:16.800\nAnd then what did Lincoln do?\n\n09:16.800 --> 09:21.960\nOh, that's a ball of slavery. Go see a play, idiot.\n\n09:21.960 --> 09:22.960\nHad it coming.\n\n09:22.960 --> 09:29.960\nHe didn't have it coming. Nobody has it coming, but he saw it coming and he did it.\n\n09:29.960 --> 09:41.880\nIs there a mouse in here?\n\n09:41.880 --> 09:44.960\nThis is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Podcast listeners can't appreciate this,\n\n09:44.960 --> 09:51.840\nbut there's a grip on the mic stand that adjusts the height of it. It's not, usually there's\n\n09:51.840 --> 09:56.160\na twisty thing. You've all seen that twisty motion that comics have to, as a man who's\n\n09:56.160 --> 10:02.760\nhad to do this 20 nights in a row, I couldn't be more excited about this.\n\n10:02.760 --> 10:13.000\nThis is like a professional like me invented this, Jeff, a professional entertainer.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.800\nLet's get Spencer up here.\n\n10:14.800 --> 10:15.800\nYeah.\n\n10:15.800 --> 10:16.800\nYeah.\n\n10:16.800 --> 10:21.800\nWe've been bringing him up earlier and earlier in the show because the fact is, Spencer\n\n10:21.800 --> 10:23.800\nis the show.\n\n10:23.800 --> 10:26.800\nYeah. There's no bad Spencer. It's better to have him than not.\n\n10:26.800 --> 10:27.800\nYeah.\n\n10:27.800 --> 10:29.800\nHello, Spencer. Hey, how's it going?\n\n10:29.800 --> 10:32.800\nGood. How was the merch table? How were sales?\n\n10:32.800 --> 10:36.800\nSales were average to subpar by stuff, you guys.\n\n10:36.800 --> 10:37.800\nOh, wow.\n\n10:37.800 --> 10:44.800\nWell, it's all right if you don't. I don't care. We're not trying to make any money or anything.\n\n10:44.800 --> 10:49.800\nWe're trying to free up the bus space. Our bus driver almost quit when he saw the amount\n\n10:49.800 --> 10:54.800\nof merch that we had endeavored to bring on this trip because there's no room for us on\n\n10:54.800 --> 10:58.800\nthe bus. There's just trash bags of shirts. We could have brought a third of that probably,\n\n10:58.800 --> 10:59.800\nright?\n\n10:59.800 --> 11:00.800\nYeah.\n\n11:00.800 --> 11:05.800\nSo tonight, Jeff, is it going to be, we couldn't figure out, we're a couple podcasts behind\n\n11:05.800 --> 11:10.800\nin the broadcasting of what we've been recording. You haven't yet heard the show in Arlington,\n\n11:10.800 --> 11:14.800\nwhich was a little Nashvilly, I guess. I don't know, it was a little more kind of raucous,\n\n11:14.800 --> 11:17.800\nkind of sloppy, sloppy Joe, I would say.\n\n11:17.800 --> 11:18.800\nArlington?\n\n11:18.800 --> 11:20.800\nYeah, I think we brought all black people up on stage.\n\n11:20.800 --> 11:26.800\nYeah, we had all eight black audience members up on stage. And we somehow managed to set\n\n11:26.800 --> 11:29.800\ncivil rights back about 45 years.\n\n11:29.800 --> 11:36.800\nBut that's what we do out here. We experiment on the road. It was a fun show, but a drunken\n\n11:36.800 --> 11:43.800\nraucous one. Then in Pittsburgh, I became very ill, I think from shaking everyone's hands\n\n11:43.800 --> 11:46.800\nand things, and it's not on you.\n\n11:46.800 --> 11:47.800\nIt's on Rhode Island.\n\n11:47.800 --> 11:56.800\nYeah, something's on them that I'll purell so you don't get it tonight. But it was an\n\n11:56.800 --> 11:58.800\nemotionally cathartic show, Jeff.\n\n11:58.800 --> 12:09.800\nYeah, and then D&D became Sally Jesse Raphael, and there was deep sadness and deep on we.\n\n12:09.800 --> 12:15.800\nYeah, Aaron and I talked to each other about our relationship during D&D, brought the house\n\n12:15.800 --> 12:22.800\ndown, but not in a funny ha-ha way, and a sad, brought it down, brought the house down\n\n12:22.800 --> 12:24.800\nemotionally.\n\n12:24.800 --> 12:27.800\nAnd then we ended.\n\n12:27.800 --> 12:33.800\nSo the big question is, according to Joseph Campbell, was last night the meeting with\n\n12:33.800 --> 12:39.800\nthe goddess, therefore is tonight the beginning of the troubles, or was last night the end\n\n12:39.800 --> 12:44.800\nof a road of trials, therefore tonight is going to be weightless and carefree and mellow,\n\n12:44.800 --> 12:48.800\nlike a kind of dream-poppy, meditative experience.\n\n12:48.800 --> 12:54.800\nLet's experiment with that first. Do you have any new age music in there, Jeff?\n\n12:54.800 --> 12:56.800\nI have kind of something mellow.\n\n13:04.800 --> 13:09.800\nCan we bring the lights down just a little bit?\n\n13:09.800 --> 13:13.800\nPerfect, thank you.\n\n13:13.800 --> 13:15.800\nOoh, yeah.\n\n13:15.800 --> 13:17.800\nCan we bring them down even more?\n\n13:17.800 --> 13:19.800\nEven more?\n\n13:19.800 --> 13:22.800\nThat's good.\n\n13:22.800 --> 13:28.800\nThat's good. That's really not what I had in mind what you're playing, but I don't think you have.\n\n13:28.800 --> 13:32.800\nI want to go on a cosmic voyage.\n\n13:32.800 --> 13:39.800\nI'm using all stuff for our movie that we have the right to use, unlicensed stuff, so I don't have a hook.\n\n13:39.800 --> 13:41.800\nIs there anybody in here?\n\n13:41.800 --> 13:48.800\nIs there a female vocalist in the room so talented that you think you could kind of riff just a melodic kind of...\n\n13:48.800 --> 13:50.800\nLike an Enya kind of thing?\n\n13:50.800 --> 13:56.800\nYeah, like an Enya kind of just copyright free Enya kind of...\n\n13:56.800 --> 13:59.800\nSee, I can practically do it. You shouldn't be that intimidated.\n\n13:59.800 --> 14:00.800\nAnybody?\n\n14:00.800 --> 14:02.800\nI see your hand raised. You want to come up?\n\n14:02.800 --> 14:03.800\nAlright.\n\n14:03.800 --> 14:09.800\nJust give it a shot. You can't be...\n\n14:09.800 --> 14:10.800\nYour name?\n\n14:10.800 --> 14:16.800\nRuth, everybody. Wow. You got a Dalek snowman on your shirt. That's very cool.\n\n14:16.800 --> 14:21.800\nWe see a lot of Doctor Who's t-shirts in our audience. I love that.\n\n14:21.800 --> 14:22.800\nYeah.\n\n14:22.800 --> 14:23.800\nAlright, Ruth.\n\n14:23.800 --> 14:26.800\nThat's why a new sports corner would work.\n\n14:26.800 --> 14:28.800\nEnya, was the idea?\n\n14:28.800 --> 14:30.800\nYeah, just kind of like a mythical...\n\n14:30.800 --> 14:32.800\nNew Agey, like you're getting a middle-earth...\n\n14:32.800 --> 14:34.800\nYou're getting a massage, you know.\n\n14:34.800 --> 14:36.800\nMaybe quitting smoking.\n\n14:36.800 --> 14:42.800\nYeah, maybe an elf is, you know, the nimbly running through the woodland area or something like that.\n\n14:42.800 --> 14:44.800\nLike a non-smoking elf, you know.\n\n14:44.800 --> 14:45.800\nNon-smoking elf.\n\n14:45.800 --> 14:46.800\nYeah.\n\n14:46.800 --> 14:49.800\nLike...\n\n14:49.800 --> 14:53.800\nClose your eyes.\n\n14:53.800 --> 14:55.800\nDrift to the center.\n\n14:55.800 --> 15:02.800\nCome with me on a voyage of the cosmos.\n\n15:02.800 --> 15:07.800\nYour soul is not bound to your corporeal frame.\n\n15:07.800 --> 15:15.800\nIt is rising, rising above the stratosphere.\n\n15:15.800 --> 15:16.800\nNice reverb.\n\n15:16.800 --> 15:17.800\nWow.\n\n15:17.800 --> 15:18.800\nHey, what are you doing here?\n\n15:18.800 --> 15:19.800\nJess, sorry.\n\n15:19.800 --> 15:21.800\nJeez, I'm trying to relax these people.\n\n15:21.800 --> 15:23.800\nI'm sorry.\n\n15:23.800 --> 15:25.800\nPretend I'm not here.\n\n15:25.800 --> 15:26.800\nJesus.\n\n15:26.800 --> 15:28.800\nFucking asshole.\n\n15:28.800 --> 15:31.800\nKeep going.\n\n15:31.800 --> 15:32.800\nSorry.\n\n15:32.800 --> 15:34.800\nWhere were we, the stratosphere?\n\n15:34.800 --> 15:35.800\nOkay.\n\n15:35.800 --> 15:38.800\nYour body pulls back.\n\n15:38.800 --> 15:44.800\nGrowing ever distant from its terrestrial origins.\n\n15:44.800 --> 15:47.800\nYou see Jupiter pass on the right.\n\n15:47.800 --> 15:51.800\nGoodbye, Jupiter.\n\n15:51.800 --> 15:56.800\nIt's a big planet, but not a lot happens there.\n\n15:56.800 --> 15:59.800\nSome say it's compensating for something.\n\n15:59.800 --> 16:02.800\nSome say that's a dumb joke.\n\n16:02.800 --> 16:05.800\nThen still others, and these are the people I agree with,\n\n16:05.800 --> 16:09.800\nI'm making it up and you get what you pay for.\n\n16:09.800 --> 16:11.800\nThen another guy might come in and say,\n\n16:11.800 --> 16:13.800\nthey probably paid a lot.\n\n16:13.800 --> 16:16.800\nThen maybe a sixth guy would come in and say,\n\n16:16.800 --> 16:18.800\nhow much?\n\n16:18.800 --> 16:21.800\nSeventh guy would say, at least 20 bucks, I'm imagining.\n\n16:21.800 --> 16:22.800\nI don't know.\n\n16:22.800 --> 16:23.800\nHey, Ruth, what's up?\n\n16:23.800 --> 16:24.800\nSorry.\n\n16:24.800 --> 16:25.800\nWhat's going on?\n\n16:25.800 --> 16:26.800\nYou making me laugh?\n\n16:26.800 --> 16:27.800\nYou need a hall tablet?\n\n16:27.800 --> 16:28.800\nStay in the game, Ruth.\n\n16:28.800 --> 16:33.800\nI'm stuck just behind Jupiter.\n\n16:33.800 --> 16:35.800\nFloating out here like an asshole.\n\n16:35.800 --> 16:39.800\nThe cosmic show must go on.\n\n16:39.800 --> 16:41.800\nJeff, Jeff, can I, I'm sorry,\n\n16:41.800 --> 16:42.800\nevery time you appear in the cosmos here,\n\n16:42.800 --> 16:44.800\nyou sound a little ghostly.\n\n16:44.800 --> 16:46.800\nI don't know if you understand the difference\n\n16:46.800 --> 16:48.800\nbetween the cosmic things and spooky things.\n\n16:48.800 --> 16:50.800\nI don't know what you mean, Dan.\n\n16:50.800 --> 16:55.800\nI'm a ghostly vampire.\n\n16:55.800 --> 17:00.800\nI've lived in the cosmos for seven million years.\n\n17:00.800 --> 17:01.800\nSorry, please.\n\n17:01.800 --> 17:02.800\nI forgot your name, cosmos lady.\n\n17:02.800 --> 17:03.800\nRuth.\n\n17:03.800 --> 17:04.800\nYes.\n\n17:04.800 --> 17:05.800\nRuth, can I make with the...\n\n17:05.800 --> 17:09.800\nI'm not actually 90 if people want to know.\n\n17:09.800 --> 17:10.800\n90?\n\n17:10.800 --> 17:11.800\nOh, because you have an old lady's name?\n\n17:11.800 --> 17:12.800\nYeah.\n\n17:12.800 --> 17:13.800\nOh.\n\n17:13.800 --> 17:15.800\nI kind of never crossed my mind.\n\n17:15.800 --> 17:18.800\n70 tops.\n\n17:18.800 --> 17:22.800\nRuthie Aslan, who edited the community's best seasons,\n\n17:22.800 --> 17:27.800\nshe's a young spry, little hipster with truck tailors.\n\n17:27.800 --> 17:31.800\nJeff.\n\n17:31.800 --> 17:34.800\nStealing my melody.\n\n17:34.800 --> 17:37.800\nYou're sinking in space now.\n\n17:37.800 --> 17:39.800\nWe've lost our momentum.\n\n17:39.800 --> 17:41.800\nWe're floating ever downward through space,\n\n17:41.800 --> 17:45.800\nto the space below space, under space,\n\n17:45.800 --> 17:48.800\ncrawl space.\n\n17:48.800 --> 17:51.800\nThere's a dead chipmunk here.\n\n17:51.800 --> 17:56.800\nStinking up your universe for years.\n\n17:56.800 --> 17:59.800\nThat's what that was.\n\n17:59.800 --> 18:03.800\nLet's grab that chipmunk, scoop it out,\n\n18:03.800 --> 18:08.800\nget rid of it, put it in the garbage.\n\n18:08.800 --> 18:11.800\nIs this special pickup required for that?\n\n18:11.800 --> 18:13.800\nIf it sat there under your house for two years,\n\n18:13.800 --> 18:18.800\nit could certainly sit in the garbage for three days.\n\n18:18.800 --> 18:25.800\nGo back in the house.\n\n18:25.800 --> 18:28.800\nReach for the highest cabinet you can find.\n\n18:28.800 --> 18:30.800\nOpen it.\n\n18:30.800 --> 18:33.800\nThere's a human head in it.\n\n18:33.800 --> 18:35.800\nJason's come back.\n\n18:35.800 --> 18:39.800\nHe's followed you to your home outside New York.\n\n18:39.800 --> 18:42.800\nAnd yet, so many years later,\n\n18:42.800 --> 18:47.800\nwe'd make a big deal out of him going to Manhattan.\n\n18:47.800 --> 18:49.800\nRelax.\n\n18:49.800 --> 18:51.800\nIt's not like he's a killer that hasn't traveled before.\n\n18:51.800 --> 18:54.800\nHe seems to know the transit system.\n\n18:54.800 --> 18:57.800\nI think some of you 40-year-olds know what I'm talking about.\n\n18:57.800 --> 18:59.800\nJason Voorhees...\n\n18:59.800 --> 19:01.800\nPlatholes.\n\n19:01.800 --> 19:07.800\nLet's get some consistency at table one, the 13th.\n\n19:07.800 --> 19:09.800\nRelax.\n\n19:09.800 --> 19:11.800\nSorry.\n\n19:11.800 --> 19:13.800\nYou're rising up through your own roof,\n\n19:13.800 --> 19:15.800\nleaving Jason Voorhees behind.\n\n19:15.800 --> 19:18.800\nYou're going back out into space.\n\n19:18.800 --> 19:20.800\nYou see Jupiter again.\n\n19:20.800 --> 19:22.800\nLet's go past it.\n\n19:22.800 --> 19:24.800\nI think maybe Saturn.\n\n19:24.800 --> 19:27.800\nI can't keep track. I can't remember.\n\n19:27.800 --> 19:28.800\nThere's Venus.\n\n19:28.800 --> 19:31.800\nNo, that should have been...\n\n19:31.800 --> 19:33.800\nOkay, we're going the wrong way.\n\n19:33.800 --> 19:34.800\nI'm sorry.\n\n19:34.800 --> 19:36.800\nApple Maps joke.\n\n19:36.800 --> 19:38.800\nApple Maps joke here.\n\n19:38.800 --> 19:40.800\nSorry for deconstructing the Apple Maps joke\n\n19:40.800 --> 19:44.800\ninstead of just giving it to you straight.\n\n19:44.800 --> 19:48.800\nThere's the sun.\n\n19:48.800 --> 19:52.800\nYou definitely went the wrong way.\n\n19:52.800 --> 19:55.800\nGo into the center of the sun.\n\n19:55.800 --> 19:57.800\nThe heat can't hurt you.\n\n19:57.800 --> 20:00.800\nYou have no body.\n\n20:00.800 --> 20:05.800\nDid you know the center of the sun is actually quite cold?\n\n20:05.800 --> 20:09.800\nIt works like a refrigerator.\n\n20:09.800 --> 20:13.800\nYou know, you touch the back of a refrigerator.\n\n20:13.800 --> 20:15.800\nIt burns your hand.\n\n20:15.800 --> 20:19.800\nEven though it's in the inside, milk is cold.\n\n20:19.800 --> 20:23.800\nIt's cold here in the center of the sun.\n\n20:23.800 --> 20:27.800\nHave a glass of milk.\n\n20:27.800 --> 20:30.800\nRelax.\n\n20:30.800 --> 20:35.800\nIndiana, this is where you are.\n\n20:35.800 --> 20:37.800\nAt the center of all.\n\n20:37.800 --> 20:41.800\nYou will crave less cigarettes.\n\n20:41.800 --> 20:44.800\nHeavy creams and sauces cannot give you comfort.\n\n20:44.800 --> 20:47.800\nThey will only make you gain weight.\n\n20:47.800 --> 20:49.800\nYou will be more productive at work.\n\n20:49.800 --> 20:52.800\nMore positive in your social affairs.\n\n20:52.800 --> 20:56.800\nSwimming will become easier for you.\n\n20:56.800 --> 20:58.800\nYou will grow gills.\n\n20:58.800 --> 21:04.800\nYou are now a member of my aquatic super army.\n\n21:04.800 --> 21:13.800\nNon-smoking, sauce-hating, supervising managers.\n\n21:13.800 --> 21:15.800\nThat swim 900 miles per hour.\n\n21:15.800 --> 21:17.800\nNow go back to earth with you.\n\n21:17.800 --> 21:22.800\nClaim my birthright.\n\n21:22.800 --> 21:24.800\nAlright, thank you, Ruth.\n\n21:24.800 --> 21:29.800\nRuth, everybody.\n\n21:29.800 --> 21:32.800\nWrap, wrap, wrap, wrap.\n\n21:32.800 --> 21:34.800\nShit, wrapping hard.\n\n21:34.800 --> 21:36.800\nWrapping in Indiana, Indiana.\n\n21:36.800 --> 21:37.800\nWrapping to your mama.\n\n21:37.800 --> 21:38.800\nWrapping to your daddy.\n\n21:38.800 --> 21:39.800\nWrapping like a mimer.\n\n21:39.800 --> 21:40.800\nSaid my name was old Patty.\n\n21:40.800 --> 21:41.800\nGot a cookie.\n\n21:41.800 --> 21:43.800\nOn my titty and my dick.\n\n21:43.800 --> 21:44.800\nWrapped your mama.\n\n21:44.800 --> 21:45.800\nYour mama's name's St. Nick.\n\n21:45.800 --> 21:47.800\nPut her in a chimney pussy.\n\n21:47.800 --> 21:48.800\nI fucked your mama.\n\n21:48.800 --> 21:49.800\nNothing rhymes with pussy.\n\n21:49.800 --> 21:50.800\nGod damn it.\n\n21:50.800 --> 21:51.800\nWhat rhymes with pussy?\n\n21:51.800 --> 21:54.800\nNothing rhymes with pussy.\n\n21:54.800 --> 21:55.800\nWussy?\n\n21:55.800 --> 21:56.800\nWussy, yeah.\n\n21:56.800 --> 21:58.800\nWussy is it?\n\n21:58.800 --> 22:03.800\nGarrett Busy's not bad.\n\n22:03.800 --> 22:04.800\nWho said that?\n\n22:04.800 --> 22:05.800\nGet up on stage.\n\n22:05.800 --> 22:06.800\nRap battle.\n\n22:06.800 --> 22:09.800\nCome up on stage, sir.\n\n22:09.800 --> 22:11.800\nWho said Gary Busy?\n\n22:11.800 --> 22:12.800\nWho said Gary Busy?\n\n22:12.800 --> 22:14.800\nGet up here.\n\n22:14.800 --> 22:17.800\nAre you okay coming up?\n\n22:17.800 --> 22:19.800\nWe just want to meet you.\n\n22:19.800 --> 22:22.800\nWe just want to touch you.\n\n22:22.800 --> 22:23.800\nWhat's your name?\n\n22:23.800 --> 22:24.800\nMatt.\n\n22:24.800 --> 22:25.800\nHey, Matt.\n\n22:25.800 --> 22:26.800\nHi.\n\n22:26.800 --> 22:27.800\nHey, Dan.\n\n22:27.800 --> 22:28.800\nIt's not a firm rhyme.\n\n22:28.800 --> 22:30.800\nNo, it's good enough, man.\n\n22:30.800 --> 22:31.800\nI thought it would kind of shoehorn there.\n\n22:31.800 --> 22:32.800\nA little bit in there.\n\n22:32.800 --> 22:33.800\nThanks.\n\n22:33.800 --> 22:35.800\nThat's what rap is all about.\n\n22:35.800 --> 22:38.800\nRhyming shit that you didn't know rhymed.\n\n22:38.800 --> 22:39.800\nThat's what makes Eminem a genius.\n\n22:39.800 --> 22:42.800\nYou said Gary Busy.\n\n22:42.800 --> 22:43.800\nPeople would know.\n\n22:43.800 --> 22:44.800\nRight.\n\n22:44.800 --> 22:50.800\nIf I said I fucked your mama's titties, I fucked your pussy, I made her ask crazy like her name was Gary Busy.\n\n22:50.800 --> 22:52.800\nPeople would be impressed by that.\n\n22:52.800 --> 22:55.800\nThey would have bought a t-shirt.\n\n22:55.800 --> 22:56.800\nI think you get a t-shirt.\n\n22:56.800 --> 22:59.800\nGive them a t-shirt for Gary Busy.\n\n22:59.800 --> 23:02.800\nThank you.\n\n23:02.800 --> 23:03.800\nMatt.\n\n23:03.800 --> 23:07.800\nMatt, what's your fondest ambition?\n\n23:07.800 --> 23:11.800\nWhat can we somehow give to you in the form of even just fantasy?\n\n23:11.800 --> 23:14.800\nOh, dear God.\n\n23:14.800 --> 23:21.800\nI think that if Tori Amos got her old face back.\n\n23:21.800 --> 23:23.800\nOh, no, she'd been doing plastic surgery?\n\n23:23.800 --> 23:24.800\nYeah.\n\n23:24.800 --> 23:26.800\nOh, no, I was in love with Tori Amos.\n\n23:26.800 --> 23:28.800\nYeah, you could probably imagine.\n\n23:28.800 --> 23:29.800\nMaybe even.\n\n23:29.800 --> 23:30.800\nYeah.\n\n23:30.800 --> 23:31.800\nSo now you know I was too.\n\n23:31.800 --> 23:32.800\nOh.\n\n23:32.800 --> 23:33.800\nI hate to admit it.\n\n23:33.800 --> 23:34.800\nSorry.\n\n23:34.800 --> 23:36.800\nShe just kind of destroyed her looks now?\n\n23:36.800 --> 23:37.800\nYeah.\n\n23:37.800 --> 23:40.800\nWell, if you do the before and after, she has this very elfin.\n\n23:40.800 --> 23:42.800\nShe had the dimples.\n\n23:42.800 --> 23:48.800\nThe dimples are gone.\n\n23:48.800 --> 23:49.800\nIt's very bad.\n\n23:49.800 --> 23:50.800\nThat's a bummer.\n\n23:50.800 --> 23:51.800\nI'm sorry.\n\n23:51.800 --> 23:57.800\nWell, I mean, I guess I could give that to you in the form of like a smartly improvised\n\n23:57.800 --> 23:58.800\nscene.\n\n23:58.800 --> 23:59.800\nOkay.\n\n23:59.800 --> 24:00.800\nAll right.\n\n24:00.800 --> 24:01.800\nAnd there's nothing else.\n\n24:01.800 --> 24:02.800\nCan we add to that?\n\n24:02.800 --> 24:03.800\nOh, you go ahead.\n\n24:03.800 --> 24:04.800\nJust read it.\n\n24:04.800 --> 24:07.800\nNo, but I mean like, well, okay, I'm hearing the word pickle.\n\n24:07.800 --> 24:11.800\nNo, I meant like anything else like that you that you want.\n\n24:11.800 --> 24:17.800\nWell, what happens in the 13th episode after Giorgio Morozo helped save the earth?\n\n24:17.800 --> 24:21.800\nWho?\n\n24:21.800 --> 24:25.800\nOh, yeah, it's my smooth music.\n\n24:25.800 --> 24:26.800\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n24:26.800 --> 24:27.800\nThat's a yacht rock.\n\n24:27.800 --> 24:28.800\nHoly fuck.\n\n24:28.800 --> 24:29.800\nWow.\n\n24:29.800 --> 24:30.800\nYacht rock.\n\n24:30.800 --> 24:33.800\nBut you're asking, is it a trivia question or is it an ending that you don't know?\n\n24:33.800 --> 24:35.800\nWill there ever be another episode?\n\n24:35.800 --> 24:36.800\nOh, yeah.\n\n24:36.800 --> 24:37.800\nI don't know.\n\n24:37.800 --> 24:39.800\nThat JD Rizner would have to know that.\n\n24:39.800 --> 24:40.800\nI mean, I'm just a guy.\n\n24:40.800 --> 24:41.800\nI just played.\n\n24:41.800 --> 24:42.800\nWhat's his name?\n\n24:42.800 --> 24:43.800\nYou don't even know.\n\n24:43.800 --> 24:44.800\nI can't remember his name.\n\n24:44.800 --> 24:45.800\nTed Templeman.\n\n24:45.800 --> 24:46.800\nYeah.\n\n24:46.800

Wars.\n\n24:58.800 --> 24:59.800\nAnd Tori Eames gets her face fixed.\n\n24:59.800 --> 25:00.800\nThank you, Matt.\n\n25:00.800 --> 25:01.800\nIt's all possible.\n\n25:01.800 --> 25:02.800\nAbsolutely.\n\n25:02.800 --> 25:03.800\nLet's hear it for Matt.\n\n25:03.800 --> 25:04.800\nMatt, everybody.\n\n25:04.800 --> 25:05.800\nThank you.\n\n25:05.800 -->

face.\n\n25:32.800 --> 25:51.800\nI want it to be pretty.\n\n25:51.800 --> 25:52.800\nSubtitles.\n\n25:52.800 --> 25:54.800\nWould you like a better looking face?\n\n25:54.800 --> 25:55.800\nGeneratory?\n\n25:55.800 --> 26:02.800\nGeneratory?\n\n26:02.800 --> 26:05.800\nYes, I would.\n\n26:05.800 --> 26:06.800\nFrom outside.\n\n26:06.800 --> 26:11.800\nThe door blasts open.\n\n26:11.800 --> 26:17.800\nCopyright infringement.\n\n26:17.800 --> 26:22.300\nWinch comes out of her face and goes up to a rafter.\n\n26:22.300 --> 26:27.800\nShe goes up to a thing on the roof and there's a clinic and she gets a better face.\n\n26:27.800 --> 26:33.800\nPart of good improv is knowing when to throw in the towel.\n\n26:33.800 --> 26:34.800\nNo, that's the end.\n\n26:34.800 --> 26:36.600\nYou were back to the DVD menu there.\n\n26:36.600 --> 26:37.600\nThat's why he was...\n\n26:37.600 --> 26:38.800\nLet's go to special features.\n\n26:38.800 --> 26:41.800\nYeah, deleted Gary Busey scenes.\n\n26:41.800 --> 26:45.200\nSpecial features deleted Gary Busey scenes.\n\n26:45.200 --> 26:51.800\nFeature in Gary Busey talking behind the scenes, but it's been a very interesting experience.\n\n26:51.800 --> 26:57.800\nStar Wars is not a movie.\n\n26:57.800 --> 27:00.800\nIt's a state of mind.\n\n27:00.800 --> 27:06.800\nAnd it's merged with what I've done to create a shamanic experience.\n\n27:06.800 --> 27:07.800\nSubtitles.\n\n27:07.800 --> 27:08.800\nStar Wars is not a movie.\n\n27:08.800 --> 27:12.800\nIt's a state of mind to create a sort of shamanic experience.\n\n27:12.800 --> 27:13.800\nAll right.\n\n27:13.800 --> 27:16.800\nWell, I hope Matt got what he wanted.\n\n27:16.800 --> 27:18.800\nI think the audience got what they wanted.\n\n27:18.800 --> 27:25.800\nA deleted scene where Gary Busey faces down with, I guess, Darth Vader.\n\n27:25.800 --> 27:26.800\nHe faces down?\n\n27:26.800 --> 27:28.800\nYeah, he faces down.\n\n27:28.800 --> 27:29.800\nWhat does that mean?\n\n27:29.800 --> 27:32.800\nI was trying to say faces off and I got a little drunk.\n\n27:32.800 --> 27:33.800\nOkay.\n\n27:33.800 --> 27:34.800\nNo, no, no.\n\n27:34.800 --> 27:38.800\nThis is a rare...it's a space down.\n\n27:38.800 --> 27:41.800\nSurrender your life server, Darth Vader.\n\n27:41.800 --> 27:48.800\nThere's something you need to do to understand the way lore works.\n\n27:48.800 --> 27:51.800\nYou're fucked up.\n\n27:51.800 --> 27:54.800\nYou know, that's a very interesting phrase people use when they're speaking to me.\n\n27:54.800 --> 27:55.800\nIt's fucked up.\n\n27:55.800 --> 27:58.800\nIt makes me wonder why all the other worlds are fucked up.\n\n27:58.800 --> 28:00.800\nOh, safety and polarity.\n\n28:00.800 --> 28:04.800\nIt's more sort of worn a helmet.\n\n28:04.800 --> 28:08.800\nI do.\n\n28:08.800 --> 28:14.800\nAll right, deleted scene, but Star Wars is Gary Busey.\n\n28:14.800 --> 28:18.800\nYou guys didn't know you were going to come in here and get fucking high octane,\n\n28:18.800 --> 28:20.800\nwhose line is it anyway, style improv up here?\n\n28:20.800 --> 28:22.800\nI like to sprinkle a little in.\n\n28:22.800 --> 28:24.800\nYou're a quadruple threat.\n\n28:24.800 --> 28:25.800\nI don't mind.\n\n28:25.800 --> 28:29.800\nYou got improv, rapping, sports knowledge.\n\n28:29.800 --> 28:37.800\nI don't mind springing a little in, like a little mainstream, like a really, really tight, awesome comedy like that into the show.\n\n28:37.800 --> 28:40.800\nSpencer was not used enough in that.\n\n28:40.800 --> 28:42.800\nWe missed user resource there.\n\n28:42.800 --> 28:46.800\nSpencer, what does it sound like when...\n\n28:46.800 --> 28:47.800\nShit.\n\n28:47.800 --> 28:48.800\nIs this doing the thing?\n\n28:48.800 --> 28:49.800\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n28:49.800 --> 28:50.800\nWe found a thing that Spencer can do.\n\n28:50.800 --> 28:53.800\nHe can kind of freestyle, dungeon master any kind of monster attacking you.\n\n28:53.800 --> 28:59.800\nSo you can make up a monster and he instantly goes into the character description of that monster.\n\n28:59.800 --> 29:02.800\nSpencer, a...\n\n29:02.800 --> 29:03.800\nGary Busey.\n\n29:03.800 --> 29:05.800\nGary Busey.\n\n29:05.800 --> 29:09.800\nA guy that I don't recognize walks into the room.\n\n29:09.800 --> 29:14.800\nHe says he's from things, but you're not entirely sure.\n\n29:14.800 --> 29:18.800\nHe might just be one of L.A.'s crazy people.\n\n29:18.800 --> 29:19.800\nSorry, I don't watch movies.\n\n29:19.800 --> 29:20.800\nHe doesn't know who Gary Busey is.\n\n29:20.800 --> 29:21.800\nThat's right.\n\n29:21.800 --> 29:22.800\nI mean, I know who he is.\n\n29:22.800 --> 29:24.800\nHe's a guy who's famous for, like, acting.\n\n29:24.800 --> 29:25.800\nYeah.\n\n29:25.800 --> 29:27.800\nBut, like, that describes many, many people.\n\n29:27.800 --> 29:28.800\nHe was in point break.\n\n29:28.800 --> 29:29.800\nDo you ever see that?\n\n29:29.800 --> 29:30.800\nWhat?\n\n29:30.800 --> 29:33.800\nThat was a good Keanu impression, actually.\n\n29:33.800 --> 29:35.800\nNo!\n\n29:35.800 --> 29:36.800\nYou don't see things.\n\n29:36.800 --> 29:37.800\nYou don't watch any movies?\n\n29:37.800 --> 29:39.800\nI don't watch most movies.\n\n29:39.800 --> 29:44.800\nIf someone says, do you want to watch a movie, I'll say, nope.\n\n29:44.800 --> 29:45.800\nThat's a good policy.\n\n29:45.800 --> 29:49.800\nIt's kept your brain free for, like, every injury in the monster manual.\n\n29:49.800 --> 29:52.800\nYeah, all the other, you know, useless factoid information.\n\n29:52.800 --> 29:53.800\nYou know what an owlbear is.\n\n29:53.800 --> 29:56.800\nYou know an owlbear's armor class.\n\n29:56.800 --> 30:00.800\nNo, that's 16.\n\n30:00.800 --> 30:02.800\nThat might not be right.\n\n30:02.800 --> 30:04.800\nYou don't know.\n\n30:04.800 --> 30:07.800\nIn my day, armor class was negative numbers.\n\n30:07.800 --> 30:08.800\nYeah, yeah.\n\n30:08.800 --> 30:10.800\nIt was, uh, Thacko was a thing.\n\n30:10.800 --> 30:11.800\nYeah.\n\n30:11.800 --> 30:12.800\nGood times.\n\n30:12.800 --> 30:13.800\nTo hit armor class zero, yeah.\n\n30:13.800 --> 30:16.800\nYeah, it used to actually be hard.\n\n30:16.800 --> 30:17.800\nSpencer.\n\n30:17.800 --> 30:20.800\nJust name a not movie reference or something.\n\n30:20.800 --> 30:21.800\nAll right.\n\n30:21.800 --> 30:22.800\nAll right.\n\n30:22.800 --> 30:25.800\nA divorced employee of a craft store.\n\n30:25.800 --> 30:26.800\nA craft store.\n\n30:26.800 --> 30:27.800\nThat's the monster.\n\n30:27.800 --> 30:28.800\nThat's attacking.\n\n30:28.800 --> 30:33.800\nYou hear the steps and jangles of someone with made too many items in his apron.\n\n30:33.800 --> 30:40.800\nYou smell the whiskey before you see him, but rounding the corner is a drunken craft employee.\n\n30:40.800 --> 30:46.800\nHe's holding handfuls of paper stickers that no doubt cost 20 times more what you'd pay for them.\n\n30:46.800 --> 30:48.800\nAll right.\n\n30:48.800 --> 30:50.800\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n30:50.800 --> 30:52.800\nDivorced craft store employee.\n\n30:52.800 --> 30:56.800\nThat was a hard one.\n\n30:56.800 --> 30:59.800\nHe started drinking after the divorce.\n\n30:59.800 --> 31:02.800\nUh, how about Spencer?\n\n31:02.800 --> 31:05.800\nDan Harmon waking up on the tour bus.\n\n31:05.800 --> 31:07.800\nHow about that one?\n\n31:07.800 --> 31:12.800\nThe door creaks open and you can hear several people running for cover.\n\n31:12.800 --> 31:20.800\nYou hear the of the sliding privacy curtain and then a thump as a large figure rolls out of bed onto the floor.\n\n31:20.800 --> 31:28.800\nStanding at full height, he arranges himself before scratching his belly and moving to the next room.\n\n31:28.800 --> 31:33.800\nThat's all, that's all.\n\n31:33.800 --> 31:39.800\nWe got to bring up the guy that is dressed as my wizard character.\n\n31:39.800 --> 31:43.800\nThere's a Dan Harmon Gandalf thing going on here.\n\n31:43.800 --> 31:44.800\nWhat is your name?\n\n31:44.800 --> 31:45.800\nCayman.\n\n31:45.800 --> 31:49.800\nWell, come on stage.\n\n31:49.800 --> 31:53.800\nCayman, for the people listening, he's wearing a blue bathrobe.\n\n31:53.800 --> 31:56.800\nHe has a, is it a sceptre or a walking stick?\n\n31:56.800 --> 31:57.800\nWhat do you got there?\n\n31:57.800 --> 31:58.800\nWhat do you call those?\n\n31:58.800 --> 31:59.800\nWizard staff.\n\n31:59.800 --> 32:00.800\nThere you go.\n\n32:00.800 --> 32:03.800\nWith the Kettle One, a light up Kettle One.\n\n32:03.800 --> 32:05.800\nFor Ray of Frost.\n\n32:05.800 --> 32:09.800\nHe has a light up blue Kettle One bottle on top of his staff.\n\n32:09.800 --> 32:12.800\nAnd he's got a, is that a prop or are you really drinking Kettle One tonight?\n\n32:12.800 --> 32:17.800\nI figured if I'm going to be dressing up like you, I should lark and drink vodka as well.\n\n32:17.800 --> 32:20.800\nLark and.\n\n32:20.800 --> 32:21.800\nLark it up.\n\n32:21.800 --> 32:22.800\nLive action role playing.\n\n32:22.800 --> 32:26.800\nThat's kind of what this podcast has become, Jeff, as like working our relationship troubles out on stage,\n\n32:26.800 --> 32:31.800\nbringing people up, talking in real time to the people we are larking.\n\n32:31.800 --> 32:33.800\nHarmontown is larking.\n\n32:33.800 --> 32:34.800\nNow did you, do you live alone?\n\n32:34.800 --> 32:35.800\nDo you have roommates or a girlfriend?\n\n32:35.800 --> 32:39.800\nNo, I live alone and I was actually supposed to come with the girl, but she canceled on me.\n\n32:39.800 --> 32:40.800\nSo.\n\n32:40.800 --> 32:41.800\nWould she have got?\n\n32:41.800 --> 32:45.800\nWell, I see the irony in that statement too.\n\n32:45.800 --> 32:48.800\nWould she have understood what the purpose of all this was?\n\n32:48.800 --> 32:52.800\nNo, she was completely, she had no idea what Harmontown was.\n\n32:52.800 --> 32:54.800\nIs that why she didn't come, do you think, possibly?\n\n32:54.800 --> 32:56.800\nWell, she said she was sick, so.\n\n32:56.800 --> 32:57.800\nAll right.\n\n32:57.800 --> 32:58.800\nOkay.\n\n32:58.800 --> 32:59.800\nAll right.\n\n32:59.800 --> 33:00.800\nWhat's her name?\n\n33:00.800 --> 33:01.800\nGrace, I believe.\n\n33:01.800 --> 33:02.800\nFuck you, Grace.\n\n33:02.800 --> 33:03.800\nNo.\n\n33:03.800 --> 33:04.800\nYeah, more like clumsy.\n\n33:04.800 --> 33:05.800\nYeah.\n\n33:05.800 --> 33:06.800\nYeah.\n\n33:06.800 --> 33:12.800\nTwo days minimum, notice.\n\n33:12.800 --> 33:13.800\nGrace.\n\n33:13.800 --> 33:15.800\nHow ironic.\n\n33:15.800 --> 33:22.800\nI'm going to name you Grace, so you're out in the world and trip over people's feelings.\n\n33:22.800 --> 33:26.800\nGo, go, go, be a bull in a china shop, Grace.\n\n33:26.800 --> 33:28.800\nShe sounds like an awful person.\n\n33:28.800 --> 33:32.800\nMaybe she's having a Grace period.\n\n33:32.800 --> 33:38.800\nShe's been thriving on the part of the universe for, how old is she?\n\n33:38.800 --> 33:39.800\nI don't actually know.\n\n33:39.800 --> 33:41.800\n23 years.\n\n33:41.800 --> 33:48.800\nAnd tonight, the irony is that if she had come here, she would have avoided that blimp\n\n33:48.800 --> 33:49.800\naccident.\n\n33:49.800 --> 33:54.800\nDid you just curse Grace with a blimp accident?\n\n33:54.800 --> 33:59.800\nSam, that's how, you know, timelines work and shit, sliding doors, stuff.\n\n33:59.800 --> 34:04.800\nIf she would, if she, you guys Facebooked each other, you were like, okay, one last\n\n34:04.800 --> 34:08.800\nritual before we meet at the comedy attic, let's each send each other photos of what\n\n34:08.800 --> 34:12.800\nwe're wearing to make sure that we don't wear the same thing.\n\n34:12.800 --> 34:14.800\nAnd then she's sick all of a sudden.\n\n34:14.800 --> 34:20.800\nIronically, though, this is the only periwinkle blue robe I could find was a woman's robe.\n\n34:20.800 --> 34:22.800\nIs that, that's periwinkle, huh?\n\n34:22.800 --> 34:24.800\nWell, actually, I don't know.\n\n34:24.800 --> 34:26.800\nPeriwinkle's a hard color to find.\n\n34:26.800 --> 34:28.800\nIt's powder blue, right?\n\n34:28.800 --> 34:31.800\nIt's blue.\n\n34:31.800 --> 34:34.800\nAll exclusively female voices are calling out.\n\n34:34.800 --> 34:39.800\nThe room became a vocal swatch catalog for a second.\n\n34:39.800 --> 34:47.800\nRobin's eggs, aquafoam, sing-sang, a lot of nurseries going up this part of town this\n\n34:47.800 --> 34:50.800\nweekend.\n\n34:50.800 --> 34:53.800\nI kind of, yeah, I would just say blue.\n\n34:53.800 --> 34:55.800\nAnd I see navy blue as black.\n\n34:55.800 --> 34:57.800\nIs that a kind of color blindness?\n\n34:57.800 --> 35:00.800\nNo, I'm just certain light, because you normally hang out in dark environments.\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:01.800\nIt's true.\n\n35:01.800 --> 35:04.800\nLike, I wore a navy blue suit, you'd think it was black.\n\n35:04.800 --> 35:06.800\nYeah, that's black, right?\n\n35:06.800 --> 35:07.800\nNo.\n\n35:07.800 --> 35:10.800\nThis is charcoal.\n\n35:10.800 --> 35:12.800\nThis is tangerine.\n\n35:12.800 --> 35:17.800\nI mean, charcoal, that charcoal's different from black, but charcoal's totally black.\n\n35:17.800 --> 35:18.800\nCharcoal?\n\n35:18.800 --> 35:21.800\nNo, it's smokeier.\n\n35:21.800 --> 35:22.800\nIt's dumb.\n\n35:22.800 --> 35:27.800\nIt seems like a dumb thing to spend your brain on, I, I, I, I, artists.\n\n35:27.800 --> 35:28.800\nWhat do you have on?\n\n35:28.800 --> 35:30.800\nKind of a pumpkin, a rust, tortoises?\n\n35:30.800 --> 35:31.800\nRed.\n\n35:31.800 --> 35:32.800\nRed.\n\n35:32.800 --> 35:33.800\nIt's not red.\n\n35:33.800 --> 35:34.800\nRed and brown.\n\n35:34.800 --> 35:36.800\nNo, because yours is oranges, right?\n\n35:36.800 --> 35:37.800\nMine's more red.\n\n35:37.800 --> 35:38.800\nRed.\n\n35:38.800 --> 35:42.800\nI'd say his has a bit more orange in mine, but it's still pretty red.\n\n35:42.800 --> 35:43.800\nYeah.\n\n35:43.800 --> 35:49.800\nEars is made out of multiple different colors of material, woven together.\n\n35:49.800 --> 35:50.800\nIt's dumb.\n\n35:50.800 --> 35:51.800\nColors are dumb.\n\n35:51.800 --> 35:52.800\nFuck them.\n\n35:52.800 --> 36:07.800\nColors, sports, most, most bands, horoscopes, other people, magic, Harry Potter.\n\n36:07.800 --> 36:14.800\nYeah, I knew, I didn't, I didn't come here to win a popularity contest.\n\n36:14.800 --> 36:18.800\nI mean, I saw that, that, that last Harry Potter movie is playing in the hotel room.\n\n36:18.800 --> 36:19.800\nYou don't mind hanging out here.\n\n36:19.800 --> 36:20.800\nNo, I don't.\n\n36:20.800 --> 36:21.800\nOkay, good.\n\n36:21.800 --> 36:24.800\nYeah, that last Harry Potter movie is playing in the hotel rooms right now.\n\n36:24.800 --> 36:26.800\nIt's kind of in rotation.\n\n36:26.800 --> 36:31.800\nI, I can't, there's like, I made a joke, like put on the Harry Potter movie to Erin.\n\n36:31.800 --> 36:33.800\nAnd she's like, oh, I can't believe it's on.\n\n36:33.800 --> 36:34.800\nIt's like, there's 900 of them.\n\n36:34.800 --> 36:37.800\nAnd, and, and they're all the same.\n\n36:37.800 --> 36:41.800\nThat's definitely, definitely shadows part, part seven or whatever.\n\n36:41.800 --> 36:48.800\nAnd like, they sure know how to make a war between wizards look a lot like standing around.\n\n36:48.800 --> 36:54.800\nI don't know what, what contrivance you have to engage in before you get to this point in,\n\n36:54.800 --> 36:57.800\nin where there's a bunch of wizards fighting a bunch of other wizards.\n\n36:57.800 --> 37:01.800\nBut I would think at that point, even a six year old could make it exciting, you know, like,\n\n37:01.800 --> 37:03.800\nthere's two armies of wizards.\n\n37:03.800 --> 37:06.800\nNow, at least for this part, we could get a little interesting.\n\n37:06.800 --> 37:10.800\nAnd I did see a couple of giant spiders, but they were really buried in the background.\n\n37:10.800 --> 37:11.800\nDumb, dumb movies.\n\n37:11.800 --> 37:16.800\nSpencer, so much, so much, the movie keeps, keeps, keeps jabbing you in the ribs and going,\n\n37:16.800 --> 37:19.800\nhuh, how about that book, huh?\n\n37:19.800 --> 37:20.800\nFuck you.\n\n37:20.800 --> 37:22.800\nI don't, I didn't read the book.\n\n37:22.800 --> 37:24.800\nI could wait it for the movie.\n\n37:24.800 --> 37:26.800\nI'm not a bad person.\n\n37:26.800 --> 37:27.800\nI don't care.\n\n37:27.800 --> 37:28.800\nIt reminds you of the book.\n\n37:28.800 --> 37:29.800\nIt's stupid.\n\n37:29.800 --> 37:32.800\nI read the book then, if you like it so much.\n\n37:32.800 --> 37:35.800\nIris Jerry Seinfeld, what are you doing here?\n\n37:35.800 --> 37:39.800\nIt's like, are you going to occupy us or aren't you?\n\n37:39.800 --> 37:44.800\nHow many cars do we have to blow up?\n\n37:44.800 --> 37:46.800\nCease fire.\n\n37:46.800 --> 37:50.800\nWe're like an incessant fire.\n\n37:50.800 --> 37:58.800\nAnyways, it's called rugby, but there's grass everywhere.\n\n37:58.800 --> 38:03.800\nWhy not call it grassy?\n\n38:03.800 --> 38:10.800\nIris Jerry Seinfeld, everybody.\n\n38:10.800 --> 38:13.800\nI like that you decided that it was over, too.\n\n38:13.800 --> 38:14.800\nYou could top that one?\n\n38:14.800 --> 38:16.800\nYou were going to top grassy?\n\n38:16.800 --> 38:18.800\nNo, I was going to try.\n\n38:18.800 --> 38:19.800\nOh, do it.\n\n38:19.800 --> 38:20.800\nFuck it.\n\n38:20.800 --> 38:21.800\nLet's do it.\n\n38:21.800 --> 38:22.800\nNo, no, no.\n\n38:22.800 --> 38:25.800\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to stage, Iris Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n38:25.800 --> 38:29.800\nOh, hello.\n\n38:29.800 --> 38:33.800\nSome things just don't make any sense when you look around and observe them through your\n\n38:33.800 --> 38:35.800\nIrish eyes.\n\n38:35.800 --> 38:39.800\nYou know, why are horseshoes lucky?\n\n38:39.800 --> 38:43.800\nThe worst case scenario is they fall on your head.\n\n38:43.800 --> 38:45.800\nThe best case is they just sit there.\n\n38:45.800 --> 38:47.800\nHow is that lucky?\n\n38:47.800 --> 38:49.800\nIt's not lucky for the horse.\n\n38:49.800 --> 38:51.800\nYou think they like getting those put on them?\n\n38:51.800 --> 38:52.800\nIt probably hurts.\n\n38:52.800 --> 38:58.800\nFuck you guys.\n\n38:58.800 --> 39:00.800\nGlenn Levitt.\n\n39:00.800 --> 39:03.800\nGlenn, oh, that's Scottish.\n\n39:03.800 --> 39:05.800\nWhat's the difference between Irish and Scottish?\n\n39:05.800 --> 39:06.800\nYou ever wonder?\n\n39:06.800 --> 39:08.800\nIt all comes down to the skirts.\n\n39:08.800 --> 39:14.800\nIt's like, you know, I'm Irish Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n39:14.800 --> 39:17.800\nPotato famine.\n\n39:17.800 --> 39:18.800\nI mean, what?\n\n39:18.800 --> 39:21.800\nSo what if the potatoes ran out and have a hot dog?\n\n39:21.800 --> 39:23.800\nIt's stupid.\n\n39:23.800 --> 39:25.800\nIt's just a dumb...\n\n39:25.800 --> 39:30.800\nThat's more offensive to Jerry Seinfeld than to Irish people.\n\n39:30.800 --> 39:33.800\nWell, he's had years to write stuff down.\n\n39:33.800 --> 39:34.800\nClayman?\n\n39:34.800 --> 39:35.800\nCayman.\n\n39:35.800 --> 39:36.800\nCayman.\n\n39:36.800 --> 39:38.800\nThat should be Clayman.\n\n39:38.800 --> 39:40.800\nBill Clayman.\n\n39:40.800 --> 39:42.800\nThat's my Alan Rickman.\n\n39:42.800 --> 39:43.800\nOh.\n\n39:43.800 --> 39:45.800\nOh, sir, are you Professor Sneep now?\n\n39:45.800 --> 39:47.800\nNo, no, that's from Die Hard.\n\n39:47.800 --> 39:48.800\nOh.\n\n39:48.800 --> 39:50.800\nWhen Bruce Willis asked him, which...\n\n39:50.800 --> 39:52.800\nI never get your name.\n\n39:52.800 --> 39:55.800\nAnd then Bruce Willis is looking at the sign behind him,\n\n39:55.800 --> 40:00.800\nand then Alan Rickman, without looking at the sign, says,\n\n40:00.800 --> 40:03.800\nClay, Bill Clay.\n\n40:03.800 --> 40:08.800\nAnd then they engage in this beautiful dance between hero and villain.\n\n40:08.800 --> 40:10.800\nBut they show Clay W, right?\n\n40:10.800 --> 40:13.800\nSo they might be William, so he puts an extra little thing in there.\n\n40:13.800 --> 40:16.800\nYeah, a little fucking reality spin, because he's done his work,\n\n40:16.800 --> 40:19.800\nand it's like the hero and the villain are doing this ballet,\n\n40:19.800 --> 40:23.800\nand Bruce Willis starts to walk away,\n\n40:23.800 --> 40:26.800\nand Alan Rickman goes,\n\n40:26.800 --> 40:28.800\nThe what?\n\n40:28.800 --> 40:30.800\nThe what, the huh?\n\n40:30.800 --> 40:32.800\nNo, no, no, that's shoot the glass, that's later.\n\n40:32.800 --> 40:36.800\nAnd then he points the gun at him, and Bruce Willis goes,\n\n40:36.800 --> 40:39.800\nIt's a hell of an accent, Hans.\n\n40:39.800 --> 40:41.800\nYou could be in Hollywood with that accent.\n\n40:41.800 --> 40:44.800\nAnd then he tries to shoot him, like he did with Takagi.\n\n40:44.800 --> 40:46.800\nClick, oh, what do you think, I'm a fucking idiot?\n\n40:46.800 --> 40:50.800\nHe takes the gun, it's amazing. It's a great movie, you should rent it.\n\n40:50.800 --> 40:52.800\nBill Clay.\n\n40:52.800 --> 40:53.800\nCameron, have you seen Die Hard?\n\n40:53.800 --> 40:54.800\nDie Hard.\n\n40:54.800 --> 40:55.800\nYeah, many times.\n\n40:55.800 --> 40:57.800\nDie Hard, not in the Criterion collection of films.\n\n40:57.800 --> 40:59.800\nDan, do you consider it a Christmas movie?\n\n40:59.800 --> 41:01.800\nYeah, yeah, I think it's a great Christmas movie.\n\n41:01.800 --> 41:04.800\nBut I also think it's a great, great movie, plain and simple.\n\n41:04.800 --> 41:08.800\nNot such a great movie, Armageddon, in the Criterion collection.\n\n41:08.800 --> 41:10.800\nArmageddon's in the Criterion collection?\n\n41:10.800 --> 41:11.800\nYeah.\n\n41:11.800 --> 41:13.800\nYup.\n\n41:13.800 --> 41:15.800\nYup.\n\n41:15.800 --> 41:17.800\nFucking weird.\n\n41:17.800 --> 41:19.800\nThe Rock, also in the Criterion collection.\n\n41:19.800 --> 41:22.800\nNow I'm starting to, yeah, there's some kind of,\n\n41:22.800 --> 41:27.800\nsomething, some paola going on here.\n\n41:27.800 --> 41:31.800\nMore like Casterion.\n\n41:31.800 --> 41:33.800\nThere's some kind of, something happening here, right?\n\n41:33.800 --> 41:35.800\nCayman.\n\n41:35.800 --> 41:36.800\nIndeed.\n\n41:36.800 --> 41:37.800\nCayman, what do you do?\n\n41:37.800 --> 41:38.800\nI'm a scientist, actually.\n\n41:38.800 --> 41:39.800\nFor real?\n\n41:39.800 --> 41:40.800\nYeah.\n\n41:40.800 --> 41:41.800\nIn what field?\n\n41:41.800 --> 41:43.800\nKind of a combination of fields.\n\n41:43.800 --> 41:49.800\nI study planets around other stars and what they need to be able to support life.\n\n41:49.800 --> 41:51.800\nSo is that planetary, geologist?\n\n41:51.800 --> 41:53.800\nIt's like a combination of geology and astronomy.\n\n41:53.800 --> 41:54.800\nReally? How cool.\n\n41:54.800 --> 41:55.800\nYeah.\n\n41:55.800 --> 41:56.800\nThat's fascinating.\n\n41:56.800 --> 42:00.800\nSo you look for like, planets that might be like Earth-like planets that could sustain\n\n42:00.800 --> 42:02.800\nlife based on their proximity to their star?\n\n42:02.800 --> 42:03.800\nYeah.\n\n42:03.800 --> 42:05.800\nAnd what they're made of and all sorts of other things.\n\n42:05.800 --> 42:08.800\nAnd we're finding these new planets all the time now, right?\n\n42:08.800 --> 42:09.800\nWe're finding like a hundred.\n\n42:09.800 --> 42:10.800\nYeah.\n\n42:10.800 --> 42:12.800\nWe've got like over 750 confirmed ones.\n\n42:12.800 --> 42:15.800\nThat are confirmed possible Earth type?\n\n42:15.800 --> 42:16.800\nNo.\n\n42:16.800 --> 42:19.800\nEarth-like, we're actually having a very hard time finding them.\n\n42:19.800 --> 42:20.800\nWhat are the 750?\n\n42:20.800 --> 42:21.800\n750 what?\n\n42:21.800 --> 42:25.800\nDo you mean just planets, whether they're the size of Jupiter or bigger than Earth?\n\n42:25.800 --> 42:26.800\nJust planets.\n\n42:26.800 --> 42:27.800\nOh.\n\n42:27.800 --> 42:28.800\nI thought we'd confirmed.\n\n42:28.800 --> 42:30.800\nI thought we're finding planets by the thousands and thousands.\n\n42:30.800 --> 42:31.800\nRight.\n\n42:31.800 --> 42:32.800\nBut we haven't confirmed them yet.\n\n42:32.800 --> 42:35.800\nHow does a planet get hit with a BB gun?\n\n42:35.800 --> 42:36.800\nRight.\n\n42:36.800 --> 42:37.800\nYeah.\n\n42:37.800 --> 42:38.800\nTakes forever.\n\n42:38.800 --> 42:39.800\nYeah.\n\n42:39.800 --> 42:45.800\nThey have two little flags hanging from their hips and you've got to pull one off.\n\n42:45.800 --> 42:47.800\nHow do you confirm it?\n\n42:47.800 --> 42:50.800\nWell, you just go back and look with another nerd telescope.\n\n42:50.800 --> 42:53.800\nOh, so it's like, check if your answer is right.\n\n42:53.800 --> 42:55.800\nIt could be a smudge on one guy's telescope.\n\n42:55.800 --> 42:57.800\nThose Swedish fuckers, okay.\n\n42:57.800 --> 42:58.800\nWhat telescope do you guys use?\n\n42:58.800 --> 43:00.800\nI don't actually use a telescope.\n\n43:00.800 --> 43:03.800\nSo I steal other people's data.\n\n43:03.800 --> 43:04.800\nBadass.\n\n43:04.800 --> 43:05.800\nWhat is your task?\n\n43:05.800 --> 43:06.800\nWhat's your role in all this?\n\n43:06.800 --> 43:13.800\nSo I look more at the chemistry end and say if you've got this much oxygen and this much\n\n43:13.800 --> 43:16.800\nother stuff, can you make a planet that is habitable?\n\n43:16.800 --> 43:17.800\nRight.\n\n43:17.800 --> 43:22.800\nAnd there's nothing in the near or just the universe that you think could sustain life?\n\n43:22.800 --> 43:23.800\nOh, I think.\n\n43:23.800 --> 43:24.800\nPossibly.\n\n43:24.800 --> 43:25.800\nYeah.\n\n43:25.800 --> 43:28.800\nI would say it would be weird if Earth was the only one.\n\n43:28.800 --> 43:29.800\nOh, certainly.\n\n43:29.800 --> 43:30.800\nYeah.\n\n43:30.800 --> 43:33.800\nBut like even on our own solar system, like there's like Enceladus or there's some moons\n\n43:33.800 --> 43:34.800\nof, you know, like that.\n\n43:34.800 --> 43:35.800\nYeah.\n\n43:35.800 --> 43:38.680\nThey think that we know there's liquid water there and there's more extreme environments\n\n43:38.680 --> 43:41.160\non Earth where life does exist or at least did.\n\n43:41.160 --> 43:43.800\nSo it'd be logical to think it's possible there, right?\n\n43:43.800 --> 43:44.800\nRight.\n\n43:44.800 --> 43:47.800\nAnd my research is saying what does it take to get to that point of making it possible?\n\n43:47.800 --> 43:48.800\nUh-huh.\n\n43:48.800 --> 43:55.360\nBecause your expertise probably stops somewhere short of my next question, which is on these\n\n43:55.360 --> 44:01.520\nplanets that are capable of, they have kind of an Earth-approximate environment and then\n\n44:01.520 --> 44:10.320\ncarbon-based life springs up on them, how kind of inevitable is sentience or is that\n\n44:10.320 --> 44:15.200\nlike a weird flash in the pan too that it would be like, that's a really dumb question.\n\n44:15.200 --> 44:17.720\nSo it's definitely a more of a biology question.\n\n44:17.720 --> 44:18.720\nBut um...\n\n44:18.720 --> 44:19.720\nI said so.\n\n44:19.720 --> 44:20.720\nWhat?\n\n44:20.720 --> 44:21.720\nBut uh...\n\n44:21.720 --> 44:22.720\nI'm a scientist too.\n\n44:22.720 --> 44:23.720\nYeah.\n\n44:23.720 --> 44:24.720\nBut uh...\n\n44:24.720 --> 44:25.720\nOh.\n\n44:25.720 --> 44:30.720\nDan, I thought you had a biology degree.\n\n44:30.720 --> 44:34.840\nNo, not a degree, no.\n\n44:34.840 --> 44:36.320\nSo we don't know.\n\n44:36.320 --> 44:40.840\nBut there's this really cool thing called the Drake equation, which is sort of a calculation\n\n44:40.840 --> 44:44.680\nof how likely would sentient life be in and one of the parameters is what are the chances\n\n44:44.680 --> 44:46.960\nof sentience and we don't know.\n\n44:46.960 --> 44:47.960\nYeah.\n\n44:47.960 --> 44:48.960\nSo that's a cool question.\n\n44:48.960 --> 44:49.960\nI mean it's kind of...\n\n44:49.960 --> 44:54.160\nBecause it's like, we think with our sentience that it's inevitable.\n\n44:54.160 --> 45:00.520\nEven if you're not a religious person, because I tend to think with the atheist part of\n\n45:00.520 --> 45:05.720\nmy brain even that, oh of course a planet that lives and breathes and that has life\n\n45:05.720 --> 45:06.920\ncrap up on it.\n\n45:06.920 --> 45:13.280\nOf course the final goal is the biological weapon known as a giant brain.\n\n45:13.280 --> 45:17.240\nYou just realize you're talking to a guy in a bathrobe on a stage.\n\n45:17.240 --> 45:19.240\nSo who's the crazy one?\n\n45:19.240 --> 45:24.640\nYou said you were a scientist, I can say anything I want, I have confidentiality, right?\n\n45:24.640 --> 45:27.840\nHe might not be a scientist.\n\n45:27.840 --> 45:31.000\nWait, he works at our hotel.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.800\nWait, that's my bro.\n\n45:33.800 --> 45:37.960\nHe's wearing your shoes.\n\n45:37.960 --> 45:41.640\nWe haven't really had like a stalker yet on the tour.\n\n45:41.640 --> 45:42.640\nNo.\n\n45:42.640 --> 45:43.640\nHe did.\n\n45:43.640 --> 45:44.640\nWell I mean...\n\n45:44.640 --> 45:46.680\nI drove pretty far to get here, so it's kind of hard to...\n\n45:46.680 --> 45:47.680\nI guess that's stalking.\n\n45:47.680 --> 45:48.680\nYeah, that's the thing.\n\n45:48.680 --> 45:52.360\nIt's like people drive, like I talk to everybody after the show and that's willing to stick\n\n45:52.360 --> 46:01.760\naround that long and as long as they have some kind of flu on their hands.\n\n46:01.760 --> 46:02.760\nThat's red.\n\n46:02.760 --> 46:06.240\nOne of your girlfriend's red hairs have been hanging off your chin like some sort of weird\n\n46:06.240 --> 46:07.240\ntinder there.\n\n46:07.240 --> 46:08.240\nOh really?\n\n46:08.240 --> 46:09.240\nWas that really distracting all that time?\n\n46:09.240 --> 46:14.920\nI'm sorry, look at this, it won't...\n\n46:14.920 --> 46:19.680\nJust say something next time, not that this will happen again a lot, but just say something.\n\n46:19.680 --> 46:21.680\nIf I'd have said something you would have fumbled with it, you never would have got\n\n46:21.680 --> 46:22.680\nit out of it.\n\n46:22.680 --> 46:25.560\nI'm telling you even then, they're the ones that were dealing with it.\n\n46:25.560 --> 46:29.480\nThe applause that occurred when you did that makes me feel really bad, makes me feel like\n\n46:29.480 --> 46:31.120\nyou zipped up my fly.\n\n46:31.120 --> 46:34.680\nWell I think from my vantage point, because I'm stage left of you and the hair, I think\n\n46:34.680 --> 46:37.480\nwas stage right, and it was kind of falling little by little.\n\n46:37.480 --> 46:41.680\nI was just like, one of the hairs of your beard was growing, and it was like something\n\n46:41.680 --> 46:42.680\nfucking weird going on.\n\n46:42.680 --> 46:47.240\nYou were talking to somebody and they just got the slightest white fleck on their lip,\n\n46:47.240 --> 46:49.840\nand it's such a bummer because you don't want to...\n\n46:49.840 --> 46:55.480\nRight now, everyone went, it's not their fault, it's not your fault, it's not your responsibility,\n\n46:55.480 --> 46:56.480\nit's not theirs.\n\n46:56.480 --> 46:59.320\nYou don't know what to do, they're talking and they have a fleck of foam on their lip,\n\n46:59.320 --> 47:06.400\nand it's just, yeah, I don't know, there was a guy in Amsterdam that was telling us\n\n47:06.400 --> 47:11.200\nabout windmills, and he wasn't speaking in English, he was speaking in whatever they\n\n47:11.200 --> 47:16.920\nspeak there, windmill talk, and he was just talking and he was all excited about windmills\n\n47:16.920 --> 47:21.360\nand how they mill things using the wind power, and just this little bubble of spit came out\n\n47:21.360 --> 47:27.240\nand just rolled over his lip and it was just there, and I was just, I don't speak a sweet\n\n47:27.240 --> 47:32.800\nmark or whatever, they're talking anyway, so I was just focused on this thing and his\n\n47:32.800 --> 47:36.480\nlip and that just popped in my head when you pull, I didn't want them to be subjected to\n\n47:36.480 --> 47:40.760\nthat, if there's a hair, anything, it could be a piece of egg on your forehead.\n\n47:40.760 --> 47:42.440\nWe need rules for that stuff.\n\n47:42.440 --> 47:46.320\nOr just maybe a friend comes up and takes it off and gets a big laugh out of it.\n\n47:46.320 --> 47:50.920\nBut you can't always do that, sometimes you're talking to a guy about windmills, and sometimes\n\n47:50.920 --> 47:51.920\nwho cares?\n\n47:51.920 --> 47:57.440\nI ate in a restaurant on that same vacation, I was in London, had Christmas dinner with\n\n47:57.440 --> 48:01.120\nRob Schrab and his wife Kate Freund and my girlfriend Erin, having a little couple's\n\n48:01.120 --> 48:06.120\nChristmas vacation in Europe because we're fancy, and we were in this restaurant in London\n\n48:06.120 --> 48:11.880\nand a little bit of a tumult at the entrance and people file in and then this wheelchair\n\n48:11.880 --> 48:13.880\ncomes in, Stephen Hawking.\n\n48:13.880 --> 48:14.880\nWow.\n\n48:14.880 --> 48:18.240\nYeah, he ate like nine feet from me.\n\n48:18.240 --> 48:23.200\nEverybody was trying to take pictures of him, I didn't want to be like a fly on a turd.\n\n48:23.200 --> 48:26.920\nYou can't really walk up and go, excuse me, can I have a word with Mr. Hawking?\n\n48:26.920 --> 48:32.880\nMr. Schraub kept saying, he kept going, go tell him you created community.\n\n48:32.880 --> 48:39.480\nHe was on the Simpsons, 40% chance he might have, first of all, thank you, Rob.\n\n48:39.480 --> 48:44.560\nBut second of all, it doesn't, I know, I think also like if you were, like, if I were Stephen\n\n48:44.560 --> 48:49.560\nHawking and a guy came over and said like, if you came over, you're a scientist, I think.\n\n48:49.560 --> 48:51.240\nI am, yeah.\n\n48:51.240 --> 48:56.040\nThen I would be, like, then I would feel okay going up to him, so like, I kind of understand\n\n48:56.040 --> 49:01.600\nsome of the things you talk about and why you are famous.\n\n49:01.600 --> 49:06.160\nAnd I teach a class or something, if I had a photo on my wall of me posing with you,\n\n49:06.160 --> 49:11.560\nthat would be cool, like, and then he'd be like, yeah, it's okay.\n\n49:11.560 --> 49:17.440\nBut like regular people coming up to him and going like, hey, wheelchair guy, like, I know\n\n49:17.440 --> 49:23.040\nyou invented black holes, but like, you don't really, I don't understand anything he does.\n\n49:23.040 --> 49:28.320\nI don't understand why he's, you know, I can't, I feel like I'm not allowed to take a picture\n\n49:28.320 --> 49:34.680\nof him, especially because he's in a wheelchair.\n\n49:34.680 --> 49:39.480\nIf you were just a nice, like, ambulatory dude having dinner, would you have felt comfortable\n\n49:39.480 --> 49:40.480\nwalking up to him then?\n\n49:40.480 --> 49:41.480\nI'm not sure.\n\n49:41.480 --> 49:45.280\nThat's a really interesting question, because part of what makes, part of Stephen Hawking's\n\n49:45.280 --> 49:48.520\ncharisma is like, oh, God, he's all brain.\n\n49:48.520 --> 49:53.280\nWe're all thinking it, like, that it's amazing that it's like this cool poetic thing.\n\n49:53.280 --> 49:58.240\nLike, oh, man, God took, like, took all this body power and put it into his head, like\n\n49:58.240 --> 50:04.280\na, like a little, little balloon, like put all the air into one section of it and, you\n\n50:04.280 --> 50:05.280\nknow, meat.\n\n50:05.280 --> 50:09.040\nI heard something that, I heard something that like he, he keeps being found with like\n\n50:09.040 --> 50:12.640\nbruises on his body and like, like, and he keeps saying like, oh, my, I fell out of my\n\n50:12.640 --> 50:13.640\nchair.\n\n50:13.640 --> 50:17.760\nBut like, the injuries aren't consistent with somebody falling out of a chair and they\n\n50:17.760 --> 50:21.960\nthink that it may be like kind of SNM kind of stuff, like he, he's having, has anybody\n\n50:21.960 --> 50:22.960\nheard that?\n\n50:22.960 --> 50:23.960\nI heard that.\n\n50:23.960 --> 50:24.960\nYeah.\n\n50:24.960 --> 50:29.400\nIt's like, yeah, it's like, like, if you, if your body is very limited in its movement\n\n50:29.400 --> 50:33.400\nand probably limited in its sensation, like sex might involve just like a broom handle\n\n50:33.400 --> 50:39.040\njust fucking whack, you know, like, like, and also fucking, if anyone deserves it, it's\n\n50:39.040 --> 50:40.040\nhim.\n\n50:40.040 --> 50:41.040\nYeah.\n\n50:41.040 --> 50:42.040\nHe's like, like.\n\n50:42.040 --> 50:43.040\nLet him get his Jolly Rogers.\n\n50:43.040 --> 50:44.040\nLet him get his Jolly Rogers.\n\n50:44.040 --> 50:50.000\nJolly Rogers has a gay pirate over here.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:51.000\nWhy add Rogers?\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nLike, is that an Indiana thing?\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:58.320\nWe just, it's just Jolly's in Los Angeles.\n\n50:58.320 --> 51:02.680\nUh, maybe we have more shit to do.\n\n51:02.680 --> 51:03.680\nJolly Rogers.\n\n51:03.680 --> 51:06.680\nHe's sucking me nuts.\n\n51:06.680 --> 51:13.880\nWhy, why are pirates always getting their nuts sucked?\n\n51:13.880 --> 51:18.880\nOh, I'm Jerry McSeinfeld.\n\n51:18.880 --> 51:22.640\nWhy, why is it pieces of eight?\n\n51:22.640 --> 51:24.720\nWhy not just take eight pieces?\n\n51:24.720 --> 51:25.720\nNope.\n\n51:25.720 --> 51:26.720\nI can't.\n\n51:26.720 --> 51:28.720\nHey, cast a wide net.\n\n51:28.720 --> 51:29.720\nI'm going to hit a couple.\n\n51:29.720 --> 51:31.720\nI'll get, I'll get another Graspy.\n\n51:31.720 --> 51:34.360\nGraspy was a goodie.\n\n51:34.360 --> 51:35.360\nThat was a goodie.\n\n51:35.360 --> 51:36.360\nThat was fucking good.\n\n51:36.360 --> 51:37.360\nIt's so good.\n\n51:37.360 --> 51:39.360\nYou didn't even get it until I said, I said, I said, why do they call it rugby?\n\n51:39.360 --> 51:40.360\nThere's grass everywhere.\n\n51:40.360 --> 51:41.360\nAnd you went, whoa.\n\n51:41.360 --> 51:44.360\nAnd then I said, call it Graspy and you're like, whoa.\n\n51:44.360 --> 51:48.120\nLike, and I was like, yeah, I fucking, I got it.\n\n51:48.120 --> 51:49.120\nI got it.\n\n51:49.120 --> 51:52.840\nWell, I mean, I remembered it different.\n\n51:52.840 --> 51:56.440\nI felt like I, I felt like hitting the seven 10 split, like, like, it was kind of like\n\n51:56.440 --> 51:58.080\nI hit the thing and then you were like, what?\n\n51:58.080 --> 51:59.920\nAnd there was a delay and then the ball went in the thing.\n\n51:59.920 --> 52:00.920\nI'm mixing sports.\n\n52:00.920 --> 52:01.920\nIs this sports corner again?\n\n52:01.920 --> 52:02.920\nYeah.\n\n52:02.920 --> 52:03.920\nAll right.\n\n52:03.920 --> 52:04.920\nBreakdown.\n\n52:04.920 --> 52:06.920\nRap in sports corner.\n\n52:06.920 --> 52:13.520\nSports corner introduction or rap, you don't know.\n\n52:13.520 --> 52:14.640\nIt's a Schrodinger's rap.\n\n52:14.640 --> 52:16.800\nIs it an intro or a regular rap?\n\n52:16.800 --> 52:19.200\nYou don't know till the positrons collide with the megatrons.\n\n52:19.200 --> 52:20.840\nIt's going to open the box.\n\n52:20.840 --> 52:21.840\nIt's theoretical.\n\n52:21.840 --> 52:24.280\nFuck your mama like her name was hypothetical.\n\n52:24.280 --> 52:25.440\nIt's the same word, basically.\n\n52:25.440 --> 52:30.760\nFuck your mom like her name was Pythagoras, a fuck your mom like she was a stegosaurus.\n\n52:30.760 --> 52:33.920\nKind of, she's so scientific words, doesn't matter.\n\n52:33.920 --> 52:34.920\nOkay.\n\n52:34.920 --> 52:35.920\nThank you.\n\n52:35.920 --> 52:36.920\nOkay.\n\n52:36.920 --> 52:37.920\nScience rap.\n\n52:37.920 --> 52:43.320\nSchrodinger's rap.\n\n52:43.320 --> 52:54.120\nI won't question what you guys deem worthy of applause, but I just won't.\n\n52:54.120 --> 52:56.120\nBut you disagree with that applause.\n\n52:56.120 --> 53:00.520\nFrankly, sirs and madams, I disagree with your applause there.\n\n53:00.520 --> 53:04.840\nI wouldn't let me get away that easy is what I'm saying.\n\n53:04.840 --> 53:05.920\nYou paid top dollar.\n\n53:05.920 --> 53:06.920\nWhat were the tickets?\n\n53:06.920 --> 53:07.920\n20 bucks?\n\n53:07.920 --> 53:08.920\nOkay.\n\n53:08.920 --> 53:09.920\nThat's pretty good.\n\n53:09.920 --> 53:10.920\nWho drove that?\n\n53:10.920 --> 53:11.920\nWhat?\n\n53:11.920 --> 53:12.920\n100.\n\n53:12.920 --> 53:13.920\nOh, you're joking.\n\n53:13.920 --> 53:14.920\nSome girl said, what?\n\n53:14.920 --> 53:15.920\nI paid 100.\n\n53:15.920 --> 53:19.400\nAnd it was worth it, right?\n\n53:19.400 --> 53:20.640\nWho drove the furthest?\n\n53:20.640 --> 53:22.120\nSometimes that's an embarrassing thing to answer.\n\n53:22.120 --> 53:23.120\nSome people are proud of it.\n\n53:23.120 --> 53:24.120\nSome people are ashamed.\n\n53:24.120 --> 53:27.000\nI've talked to people who drove six hours to gigs and stuff.\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:34.480\nWe got Louisville, Cincinnati, Columbus, and those are like how far away, I mean, four\n\n53:34.480 --> 53:35.480\nor five.\n\n53:35.480 --> 53:40.120\nIt's kind of hard to have this conversation with 100 people.\n\n53:40.120 --> 53:42.120\nAnd what's your name?\n\n53:42.120 --> 53:46.760\nJimmer Harmon, Nancy.\n\n53:46.760 --> 53:50.520\nBut yeah, I think that's amazing when people drive all that way.\n\n53:50.520 --> 53:53.520\nAnd then sometimes I go, are you staying at a hotel here tonight?\n\n53:53.520 --> 53:56.200\nAnd they say, no, they're going to drive all the way back.\n\n53:56.200 --> 53:59.640\nAnd then sometimes I reach out and I take their hand and I say, you're staying with\n\n53:59.640 --> 54:00.640\nme.\n\n54:00.640 --> 54:11.640\nAnd whether it's a dude or a girl or hopefully both, Aaron and I take him back to our hotel\n\n54:11.640 --> 54:23.640\nroom at the Comfort Inn and we put on some Chardet, we smoke a J, do a little TM, it's\n\n54:23.640 --> 54:29.080\ntranscendental meditation.\n\n54:29.080 --> 54:33.840\nAnd basically enact that SNL sketch about the guys at Lake Cuantro, okay.\n\n54:33.840 --> 54:38.400\nAll right, Cayman, what do we do for you?\n\n54:38.400 --> 54:39.400\nWhat do you want?\n\n54:39.400 --> 54:40.400\nWhat do I want?\n\n54:40.400 --> 54:41.400\nI'm kidding.\n\n54:41.400 --> 54:42.400\nI don't know.\n\n54:42.400 --> 54:43.400\nNo, I mean, I mean, what do you want?\n\n54:43.400 --> 54:44.400\nI just didn't mean to say it.\n\n54:44.400 --> 54:45.400\nI'll take some more vodka.\n\n54:45.400 --> 54:46.400\nOh, okay.\n\n54:46.400 --> 54:48.400\nI don't mean to steamroll it.\n\n54:48.400 --> 54:49.400\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n54:49.400 --> 54:50.400\nYou've earned it.\n\n54:50.400 --> 54:53.040\nYou've earned these lights.\n\n54:53.040 --> 54:54.800\nDrink your science spinach.\n\n54:54.800 --> 54:57.240\nWell, it's Monday night.\n\n54:57.240 --> 54:59.360\nEvery night is drink night for scientists.\n\n54:59.360 --> 55:00.840\nIt's what powers science, basically.\n\n55:00.840 --> 55:01.840\nReally?\n\n55:01.840 --> 55:02.840\nYeah.\n\n55:02.840 --> 55:06.040\nSo like most science gets done Tuesday morning or?\n\n55:06.040 --> 55:09.000\nMost science gets done at the bar, I'd say.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nYou guys get drunk and then the...\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:16.160\nAre there any science bars in town where...\n\n55:16.160 --> 55:17.160\nThe slide rule?\n\n55:17.160 --> 55:18.160\nThe...\n\n55:18.160 --> 55:19.160\nThe...\n\n55:19.160 --> 55:20.160\nThe...\n\n55:20.160 --> 55:21.160\nThe bronze slide rule.\n\n55:21.160 --> 55:22.920\nThe bronze slide rule.\n\n55:22.920 --> 55:29.320\nThe graduated cylinder.\n\n55:29.320 --> 55:34.080\nThe nanoshot.\n\n55:34.080 --> 55:35.080\nThe flask.\n\n55:35.080 --> 55:36.080\nYeah.\n\n55:36.080 --> 55:37.080\nOkay.\n\n55:37.080 --> 55:38.080\nThe Erlenmeyer flask.\n\n55:38.080 --> 55:39.080\nThe dot connector.\n\n55:39.080 --> 55:40.080\nThat's science-y.\n\n55:40.080 --> 55:41.080\nUh...\n\n55:41.080 --> 55:42.080\nUh...\n\n55:42.080 --> 55:43.080\nSchrodinger's hangover.\n\n55:43.080 --> 55:46.840\nE equals gym beam squared.\n\n55:46.840 --> 55:47.840\nNo, that's...\n\n55:47.840 --> 55:48.840\nThat's...\n\n55:48.840 --> 55:52.440\nThat's a specific drink special at that place.\n\n55:52.440 --> 55:53.440\nWine...\n\n55:53.440 --> 55:54.440\nWinesteins?\n\n55:54.440 --> 55:55.440\nYeah.\n\n55:55.440 --> 55:56.440\nWhat?\n\n55:56.440 --> 55:57.440\nDumb.\n\n55:57.440 --> 55:58.440\nCome on.\n\n55:58.440 --> 55:59.440\nAnybody got one?\n\n55:59.440 --> 56:00.440\nBeakman's World is the...\n\n56:00.440 --> 56:01.440\nIt's the...\n\n56:01.440 --> 56:02.440\nWhat's the name of the lady's...\n\n56:02.440 --> 56:03.440\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n56:03.440 --> 56:04.440\nThat's not nice.\n\n56:04.440 --> 56:05.440\nThat's Garrett with one R.\n\n56:05.440 --> 56:06.440\nIt's from Nashville, right?\n\n56:06.440 --> 56:07.440\nYeah.\n\n56:07.440 --> 56:08.440\nIt's the...\n\n56:08.440 --> 56:09.440\nWhat's the name of the lady's dance at the bar?\n\n56:09.440 --> 56:10.440\nIt's made by your...\n\n56:10.440 --> 56:11.440\nCoyote Ugly.\n\n56:11.440 --> 56:12.440\nCoyote Ugly?\n\n56:12.440 --> 56:13.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n56:13.440 --> 56:14.440\nBeakman's World is the coyote ugly science bar.\n\n56:14.440 --> 56:15.440\nThat's too long.\n\n56:15.440 --> 56:16.440\nThat's too long.\n\n56:16.440 --> 56:17.440\nYeah.\n\n56:17.440 --> 56:18.440\nYeah.\n\n56:18.440 --> 56:19.440\nYeah.\n\n56:19.440 --> 56:20.440\nYeah.\n\n56:20.440 --> 56:22.440\nYeah.\n\n56:22.440 --> 56:24.440\nThat's too long.\n\n56:24.440 --> 56:25.440\nJesus.\n\n56:25.440 --> 56:26.440\nHoly crap.\n\n56:26.440 --> 56:27.440\nYeah.\n\n56:27.440 --> 56:28.440\nThat was a Mobius Strip.\n\n56:28.440 --> 56:29.440\nI like that.\n\n56:29.440 --> 56:30.440\nI like that.\n\n56:30.440 --> 56:31.440\nThe Mobius Strip Club.\n\n56:31.440 --> 56:32.440\nYeah.\n\n56:32.440 --> 56:33.440\nThe Mobius Strip Club.\n\n56:33.440 --> 56:34.440\nAh, there you go.\n\n56:34.440 --> 56:35.440\nWhere...\n\n56:35.440 --> 56:36.440\nWhere...\n\n56:36.440 --> 56:37.440\nThere's only one titty, but it goes up like it's like it's all...\n\n56:37.440 --> 56:38.440\nIt goes all around.\n\n56:38.440 --> 56:39.440\nIt is no nipple.\n\n56:39.440 --> 56:40.440\nYeah.\n\n56:40.440 --> 56:41.440\nInfinite titties.\n\n56:41.440 --> 56:42.440\nYeah.\n\n56:42.440 --> 56:43.440\nYeah.\n\n56:43.440 --> 56:46.440\nYou get a lap dance, but it's like all of a sudden you're on her lap, but it's...\n\n56:46.440 --> 56:48.440\nPut your hands together for...\n\n56:48.440 --> 56:49.440\nTesseract.\n\n56:49.440 --> 56:54.440\nShe's a wrinkle in time, boys.\n\n56:54.440 --> 56:56.440\nGet your tips out.\n\n56:56.440 --> 57:05.440\nShe's got infinite titties, but we don't have infinite time.\n\n57:05.440 --> 57:08.440\nRemember, Heisenberg's principle still applies.\n\n57:08.440 --> 57:14.440\nIf you touch it, it stops being allowed.\n\n57:14.440 --> 57:18.440\nDon't forget, you can get a private lap dance in the wormhole.\n\n57:18.440 --> 57:21.440\nWho knows what goes back there?\n\n57:21.440 --> 57:24.440\nGet your superstrings out.\n\n57:24.440 --> 57:26.440\nYeah, I know.\n\n57:26.440 --> 57:27.440\nIt's getting...\n\n57:27.440 --> 57:29.440\nIt's getting grotesque.\n\n57:29.440 --> 57:31.440\nIt's singularity, man.\n\n57:31.440 --> 57:34.440\nAnybody who came alone.\n\n57:34.440 --> 57:36.440\nAll right.\n\n57:36.440 --> 57:37.440\nAll right.\n\n57:37.440 --> 57:38.440\nSo what's the...\n\n57:38.440 --> 57:39.440\nWhat's the...\n\n57:39.440 --> 57:40.440\nWhat's the...\n\n57:40.440 --> 57:42.440\nWe've got a scientist up on stage, Jeff.\n\n57:42.440 --> 57:43.440\nYeah.\n\n57:43.440 --> 57:44.440\nPop quiz.\n\n57:44.440 --> 57:45.440\nOkay.\n\n57:45.440 --> 57:46.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n57:46.440 --> 57:48.440\nWe've got questions to try to stump him.\n\n57:48.440 --> 57:51.440\nOkay.\n\n57:51.440 --> 57:54.440\nOh, boy.\n\n57:54.440 --> 57:59.440\nCould science ever...\n\n57:59.440 --> 58:01.440\nWell, I mean...\n\n58:01.440 --> 58:05.440\nFight the predator?\n\n58:05.440 --> 58:06.440\nWho would win in a fight?\n\n58:06.440 --> 58:10.440\nScience or the predator?\n\n58:10.440 --> 58:12.440\nScience could at least see the predator.\n\n58:12.440 --> 58:13.440\nRight.\n\n58:13.440 --> 58:14.440\nSo...\n\n58:14.440 --> 58:15.440\nAnd measure him.\n\n58:15.440 --> 58:16.440\nOr her.\n\n58:16.440 --> 58:17.440\nI don't know.\n\n58:17.440 --> 58:18.440\nRight.\n\n58:18.440 --> 58:19.440\nNice.\n\n58:19.440 --> 58:20.440\nAll right.\n\n58:20.440 --> 58:21.440\nScientific, very open-minded.\n\n58:21.440 --> 58:22.440\nPredator might be a lady.\n\n58:22.440 --> 58:23.440\nSocial science.\n\n58:23.440 --> 58:24.440\nAll right.\n\n58:24.440 --> 58:25.440\nWell, let's have a hand for Cayman.\n\n58:25.440 --> 58:26.440\nCayman, everybody.\n\n58:26.440 --> 58:33.440\nAnd send him back to his lab.\n\n58:33.440 --> 58:48.440\nHi-Haw.\n\n58:48.440 --> 58:49.440\nScience.\n\n58:49.440 --> 58:50.440\nScience.\n\n58:50.440 --> 58:51.440\nScience.\n\n58:51.440 --> 58:52.440\nWell, two plus two is four.\n\n58:52.440 --> 58:53.440\nAnd a boot plus a boot is a shoe.\n\n58:53.440 --> 58:54.440\nI'm a funky science cowboy.\n\n58:54.440 --> 58:55.440\nHow do you do?\n\n58:55.440 --> 58:57.440\nLike to take you back to my ranch shack and put you on your back.\n\n58:57.440 --> 58:58.440\nGive a double slide rule track.\n\n58:58.440 --> 58:59.440\nFuck your butt and lick your nuts.\n\n58:59.440 --> 59:00.440\nPut my hat on the foot.\n\n59:00.440 --> 59:01.440\nSo you can see the predator.\n\n59:01.440 --> 59:03.440\nPut your nuts.\n\n59:03.440 --> 59:05.440\nPut my hat on the foot of your bed.\n\n59:05.440 --> 59:08.440\nNot much of rhyming happening.\n\n59:08.440 --> 59:11.440\nBut I got a big bowl crappin' in.\n\n59:11.440 --> 59:17.440\nOut in the back with my Carl Sagan Shack Science Cowboy.\n\n59:17.440 --> 59:19.440\nOuter space is the place for me.\n\n59:19.440 --> 59:22.440\nGot a big green face and an old TV.\n\n59:22.440 --> 59:24.440\nGot a big boot cowboy.\n\n59:24.440 --> 59:28.440\nBoot, floor, boot, plate.\n\n59:28.440 --> 59:31.440\nLine, dance in, square, dance in.\n\n59:31.440 --> 59:34.440\nFour lines make a square.\n\n59:34.440 --> 59:35.440\nI played the short version.\n\n59:35.440 --> 59:36.440\nI fucked up.\n\n59:36.440 --> 59:48.440\nYou got a big bowl crappin' in?\n\n59:48.440 --> 59:50.440\nYou fucked his butt.\n\n59:50.440 --> 59:53.440\nLicked his nuts.\n\n59:53.440 --> 59:57.440\nBut you put your hat on the foot of his bed.\n\n59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.440\nBecause you're a science cowboy.\n\n01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.440\nIt's what you do.\n\n01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.440\nIt's called peer review.\n\n01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.440\nIt's a scientific principle.\n\n01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.440\nHis ass was the control.\n\n01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.440\nI'll see.\n\n01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.440\nThe hypothesis is over.\n\n01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440\nMy hat's on your bed.\n\n01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.440\nYou got fucked.\n\n01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.440\nIt's a law now.\n\n01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.440\nScience, nobody ever understands this when I say this.\n\n01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.440\nScience is the best religion.\n\n01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.440\nScientists get offended by that because they're like,\n\n01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.440\nwe're not a religion.\n\n01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.440\nOf course, religious people don't want to think\n\n01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.440\nthat science is a religion.\n\n01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.440\nReligion should be like, how much more religious\n\n01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.440\ncould you get than trying to figure out how everything works?\n\n01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.440\nEverybody joining hands and moving toward the center\n\n01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.440\nof the universe and trying to find like,\n\n01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.440\ncorner God.\n\n01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.440\nEither he's going to be there or nothing will be there.\n\n01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.440\nIn which case, nothing is God who cares.\n\n01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440\nIt's still awesome.\n\n01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.440\nJust playing peek-a-boo with the origins of everything\n\n01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.440\nand not letting it escape by calling each other out on everything\n\n01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.440\nand publishing all your findings and being open source\n\n01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.440\nand kneeling before this altar of these rules that say,\n\n01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.440\nthis is how you figure shit out.\n\n01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.440\nAlways be careful.\n\n01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.440\nAlways be calling yourself out on your own bullshit.\n\n01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.440\nOtherwise, someone will also call you out on it\n\n01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.440\nand it's a beautiful little, and they have little outfits\n\n01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.440\nwith little white coats.\n\n01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440\nEven if they're not doing anything that involves.\n\n01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.440\nIt's kind of priestly. It's kind of clerical.\n\n01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440\nAnd it is the new religion.\n\n01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.440\nI mean, obviously, for better or for worse.\n\n01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.440\nBut some people use that as an excuse to get all jaded and cynical.\n\n01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.440\nThey're like, oh, there is no God.\n\n01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.440\nWell, yeah, there's not a Santa Claus God.\n\n01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.440\nWe know that.\n\n01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.440\nWe disprove that when we dug up a dinosaur bone.\n\n01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.440\nBut you don't have to be an asshole\n\n01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.440\njust because your mom was wrong.\n\n01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:55.440\nLike, yeah, we have like hover cars and stuff.\n\n01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.440\nNow more than ever, don't be a dick\n\n01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.440\nbecause you can hit more people with a hover car.\n\n01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.440\nLike, bombs that could blow up the whole world.\n\n01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.440\nBe a good person.\n\n01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.440\nLike, Genghis Khan would do a lot of damage these days.\n\n01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.440\nYou know?\n\n01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:19.440\nScientists have to, like, they're the only ones that can save us.\n\n01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:28.440\nI think if they adopt a kind of like, you know, humanist perspective\n\n01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.440\nand go, okay, look, we're a group of scientists\n\n01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.440\nand we've decided like we got to be cool to one another.\n\n01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.440\nBecause no one else has any power.\n\n01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440\nNobody's listening to anybody else\n\n01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.440\nbecause the other people that are saying you have to be cool to one another\n\n01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.440\nare also hiding rapists.\n\n01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.440\nLike, they're not, you know, they can't be trusted.\n\n01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.440\nThey're weird.\n\n01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440\nThey say that the Bible's a newspaper.\n\n01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.440\nThey're like backward.\n\n01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.440\nYeah, don't be evil.\n\n01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.440\nWhich means just don't like hurt other people\n\n01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.440\nbecause it's your species, you know?\n\n01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.440\nLike, that's scientific.\n\n01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.440\nProtect the DNA.\n\n01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.440\nWe were a nearly extinct species\n\n01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.440\nand we were in God's crosshairs so many times.\n\n01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.440\nLike, this is a planet that's been trying to kill us forever.\n\n01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.440\nLike, we're a freak.\n\n01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.440\nWe're like the Harry Potter of species.\n\n01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.440\nLike, we're not supposed to be walking around\n\n01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.440\nwith these big melons on top of our shoulders.\n\n01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.440\nLike, we took weird risks to get where we are.\n\n01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.440\nBut there are people that say that competition between humans,\n\n01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.440\nlike, there are people that think that that's what makes us advance.\n\n01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.440\nLike, that human conflict is that that's what propels, you know, progress.\n\n01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.440\nAnd that may have been, maybe that was true for 6,000 years\n\n01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440\nand now it has to stop being true.\n\n01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.440\nI mean, maybe it's like we're choking on each other.\n\n01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.440\nWe're sleeping on top of each other.\n\n01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.440\nIf you also want to stab somebody, it's like,\n\n01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.440\nthat's going to, a lot of people are going to get stabbed.\n\n01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.440\nLike, I think when we were tribal and you were walking around\n\n01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.440\nand you encountered another tribe, yeah,\n\n01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.440\nmaybe the instinct to not all lay down together\n\n01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.440\nand have half as many berries, maybe that was like a bad idea.\n\n01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.440\nMaybe it was important to slit each other's

01:12:41.160\nHaven't you ever put something in your zipper and pretended it was your dick?\n\n01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160\nMy dick.\n\n01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.160\nI guess the answer is no.\n\n01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160\nI don't know.\n\n01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.160\nAll right, Spencer, catch us up to date, if you would.\n\n01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.400\nOkay, we want to pass this down.\n\n01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.440\nThe character should be dispensed.\n\n01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:59.000\nWhen we last met, our heroes came to in the belly of a mythical creature known only as\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.920\nthe Infinifish.\n\n01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.840\nOur heroes were discovered by a group of seven humans and halfling that formed a tribe deep\n\n01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.480\nwithin the bowels of the Great Beast.\n\n01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.280\nMeeting with Aliyah, the leader of the fish dwellers, the chieftain led the heroes to\n\n01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:17.680\ntheir village, a safe haven nestled between the arterial landscape of the fishes' insides.\n\n01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.320\nIt was there that Mulraine and Sharpie, in a moment of tension and feelings, had a deep\n\n01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.760\nbut important conversation about their complicated relationship.\n\n01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.960\nAfterwards, they headed to one of the villagers' stores and bought some ropes, potions, and\n\n01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.680\nsyringes full of paralyzing agents.\n\n01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.400\nThey didn't know how, but they knew they had to escape.\n\n01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.920\nGo, Spencer, everybody.\n\n01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.560\nSo, if you recall, you're in this village.\n\n01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.080\nIt's been made out of things that the fish has eaten, and yeah, you were talking to the\n\n01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.080\nchieftain.\n\n01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.080\nYeah.\n\n01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.080\nYou got some stuff.\n\n01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.640\nAll right, so we were talking about making this fish barf us up, you know, like Pinocchio\n\n01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640\nstyle, right?\n\n01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.640\nYeah, there are two episodes behind it.\n\n01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.640\nWe got swallowed by a big giant fish and we were trying to make it barf.\n\n01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.640\nWhat about it?\n\n01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.640\nTeleportation one.\n\n01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.120\nYeah, you have that cloak.\n\n01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120\nIt teleports.\n\n01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.680\nJesus, I have a teleportation cloak.\n\n01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.680\nYeah.\n\n01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.680\nWow.\n\n01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.680\nCan you teleport out to the blowhole?\n\n01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.160\nOr maybe it doesn't have a blowhole.\n\n01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.760\nMaybe it's not a whale.\n\n01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.800\nHow does that cloak work?\n\n01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.040\nYou don't even know, man.\n\n01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.720\nYour dad showed it to you and he didn't seem to have a mastery of it.\n\n01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.160\nAll right.\n\n01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.200\nCan I think about the top of this infinite fish?\n\n01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.320\nOkay, you can think about the top of it.\n\n01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560\nThink about it.\n\n01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560\nAll right, you're thinking about it.\n\n01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560\nI used the cloak.\n\n01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560\nClearing your mind.\n\n01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.520\nWhip it around me like Alex Baldwin with a shadow.\n\n01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.080\nIt makes a weird noise.\n\n01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.360\nIt looks like it's out of juice for the day.\n\n01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.640\nYou're out of juice for the day.\n\n01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.000\nJudging snap.\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.920\nIf anyone wants to top me off.\n\n01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:53.880\nAll right, so we have to get this whale to expirge us somehow, right?\n\n01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.640\nWe want to get coughed up out of here.\n\n01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.160\nHey, give me some of those crystals.\n\n01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.200\nRemember when we got first on board this infinite fish and you had your healing crystals shattered\n\n01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.880\nand it had little crystals that were absorbed into your body?\n\n01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.880\nYou got back up to 40 hit points.\n\n01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.760\nDo you have any of those extra crystals left?\n\n01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.920\nI handed my crystals.\n\n01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.640\nAll right, you handed me your crystals.\n\n01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.280\nCan I rub them on the cloak?\n\n01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.280\nThe rest of the crib.\n\n01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.280\nIs there a battery compartment?\n\n01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.240\nRubbing the crystals on the cloak.\n\n01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.240\nThey glow softly, but then grow inert.\n\n01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.560\nAll right, you can have them back, they're dumb.\n\n01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.400\nSeveral of the crystals dissolve, healing you to full health.\n\n01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.640\nOh, sorry, I accidentally healed myself.\n\n01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:38.000\nThese people, their dwellings are made out of wood.\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.880\nWhat if we ask them if we could set their homes on fire?\n\n01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.000\nGo on.\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.720\nAnd obviously take them with us and we, maybe if we set their homes on fire, the fish would\n\n01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.480\nspit us out or just burn up or we'd all die.\n\n01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.640\nDo you want to consult or do you just want to start setting fires?\n\n01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.760\nNo, no, may I consult with the leader of the fish dwellers?\n\n01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.600\nI am the leader of the fish dwellers.\n\n01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.600\nHey.\n\n01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.720\nI heard you talking about things.\n\n01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.720\nYes.\n\n01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.240\nFirst of all, I want to say that I greatly respect your architecture and your house.\n\n01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.840\nAnd secondly, can we set it on fire?\n\n01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.840\nWe live here.\n\n01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.840\nIs there any reason?\n\n01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.840\nDo you just like?\n\n01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840\nAre you a pyromaniac?\n\n01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:32.120\nI don't hate fire, but I, you know, you said that you've been here for a long time.\n\n01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.840\nI don't know how passionate you are about leaving, but we certainly are.\n\n01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.720\nMaybe we can work together, set your home on fire and we can all leave.\n\n01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.880\nMaybe the mouth will just open, the fish will open its mouth.\n\n01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880\nWe can all leave.\n\n01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.880\nAlso, you look great.\n\n01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.880\nThanks.\n\n01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.880\nThanks.\n\n01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.840\nWell, you see, stories tell of my grandpappy.\n\n01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.560\nThe first three ships that sailed through here, we did indeed light on fire, hoping\n\n01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:59.320\nthat would work, but it seems the beast's insides are quite resistant to heat.\n\n01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.320\nOh, okay.\n\n01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.040\nJeff, do you have a little note pad?\n\n01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040\nYeah.\n\n01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040\nDo you keep little D&D notes?\n\n01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.040\nI sometimes.\n\n01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.040\nYeah.\n\n01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040\nYeah.\n\n01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.040\nSomeone's got to take this shit seriously, you guys.\n\n01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.040\nWhat is that word on your paper?\n\n01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040\nWhat does that say?\n\n01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.040\nIt's Leah, the leader of the fish people.\n\n01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.040\nShit.\n\n01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.040\nI write down the names of the people that come up on stage so I can thank them later on.\n\n01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.040\nThat's very nice.\n\n01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.040\nI draw little pictures of people.\n\n01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:33.040\nI've got my famous buttermilk biscuit recipe down in here.\n\n01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.540\nAll right, so that was a good idea, Mulrainee.\n\n01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.040\nI liked what you were going with that one, but it sounds like it's a no-go.\n\n01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.040\nIt sounds like a no.\n\n01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.040\nIt sounds like it's not a good idea.\n\n01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.040\nI'm glad I asked.\n\n01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.040\nIf you want to damage various parts of the fish's insides, that might work.\n\n01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.040\nLet's go down and let's, yes.\n\n01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.540\nI mean, I don't know if killing the fish is a great idea, you know, or hurting it.\n\n01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:59.040\nIt's like if this thing is like floating through the air, you know, and then you've heard it,\n\n01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.040\nlike.\n\n01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:04.040\nWhere the fish is, where the amphida fish is gag reflexes, where it's uvula is?\n\n01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:09.040\nYou don't, but you have a feeling it might be somewhere along the digestive tract.\n\n01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.040\nWeird.\n\n01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:16.040\nI lead us off in the direction of the esophageal part of the fish.\n\n01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.040\nOliah says, you can go fish west to its primary digestive tract.\n\n01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.040\nYou can go fish south, but no one ever goes fish south.\n\n01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.040\nWhy?\n\n01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.040\nWhy doesn't anyone?\n\n01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.040\nBecause you get pooped.\n\n01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.040\nLet's go get pooped.\n\n01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.040\nLet's go pooped.\n\n01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.040\nYes, but why do we get pooped?\n\n01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.040\nBecause everyone who ever gone that way is dead.\n\n01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.040\nWell, because I've never seen them again?\n\n01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.040\nYeah, I kind of tried it once.\n\n01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.040\nHe never returned.\n\n01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:47.040\nSome say he escaped, but others say he perished, and others maintained that he never existed.\n\n01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.040\nSo, I mean, either way.\n\n01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:57.040\nSo we can make him sneeze or gag, or we can punch a hole through him, or we can go get pooped\n\n01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:01.040\ninto a fish, but then we're going to be floating out in the sky, right?\n\n01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.040\nMaybe.\n\n01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.040\nMaybe not.\n\n01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.040\nOkay, and we don't want that.\n\n01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.040\nSo, hypothetically, we want a ship to fly inside the fish.\n\n01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:11.040\nThen we get on the fish on the ship.\n\n01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040\nYou could.\n\n01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.040\nYou also have a broken ship.\n\n01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.040\nYou could repair it if you thought you wanted a ship.\n\n01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.040\nCan I use portable hole?\n\n01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.040\nTo do what?\n\n01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.040\nTo fall through it?\n\n01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.040\nIt doesn't put a hole in a wall.\n\n01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040\nIt just makes a pit appear.\n\n01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:28.040\nSo, like, you get in the pit, and it wouldn't take you to the other side.\n\n01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040\nSo, it's more like a hiding spot?\n\n01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.040\nYeah, it's a hiding spot.\n\n01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.040\nAre you able to pull those holes?\n\n01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.040\nI'm just curious.\n\n01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.040\nLike, would you go into them, or are you able to pull them down into the hole?\n\n01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.040\nLike, pull it into itself?\n\n01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.040\nYeah.\n\n01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.040\nLike, you'd probably turn inside out and explode or something.\n\n01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040\nI'm feeling lucky today.\n\n01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:48.040\nI said we go try the poop shoot.\n\n01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.040\nYeah.\n\n01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.040\nYou see a purple pulsating sphincter to the south.\n\n01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.040\nIt seems tiny, but you might be able to squeeze through.\n\n01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.040\nCan you say that ten times fast?\n\n01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.040\nNo.\n\n01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:09.040\nI'm a little, I'll go first.\n\n01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.040\nWait, wait, stop.\n\n01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.040\nYeah?\n\n01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.040\nI just want to Instagram this.\n\n01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.040\nNo, no, I want to tie a rope around you.\n\n01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.040\nOh, great idea.\n\n01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.040\nYeah, thanks.\n\n01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.040\nYou bought rope, didn't you?\n\n01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.040\nYeah, I have rope.\n\n01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.040\nI'll tie, I'm tying rope around Quirk's waist.\n\n01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.040\nI'm tying that to my...\n\n01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.040\nTwo tugs means I'm in an infinite toilet and I'm drowning.\n\n01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040\nPull me back.\n\n01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.040\nOne tug means...\n\n01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.040\nGood to go.\n\n01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.040\nFollow me.\n\n01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.040\nOkay.\n\n01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:43.040\nYeah, and if you start tugging a lot of times, we'll start writing it down like it's a song.\n\n01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.040\nLike Morse code?\n\n01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:47.040\nYeah, yeah, but a song, but a beat to a song.\n\n01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.040\nBut I eliminate one tug as an option because one tug could be a chaotic thing generated by...\n\n01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.040\nYeah.\n\n01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.040\nOkay, so shave and a haircut.\n\n01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.040\nThat means don't come in here.\n\n01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.040\nDon't come in.\n\n01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.040\nYeah, don't come in.\n\n01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:03.040\nBut if I go, that means you can come in.\n\n01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.040\nThat means...\n\n01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.040\nSo if you...\n\n01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.040\nYank, yank, yank, yank, yank.\n\n01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.040\nDon't come in.\n\n01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.040\nI don't think...\n\n01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.040\nYank, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.\n\n01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.040\nThat means it's good to go.\n\n01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.040\nQuirk, so if you go through the anus and it's imminent danger,\n\n01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.040\nyou're going to be like, all right.\n\n01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.040\nYeah, because that's the system.\n\n01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.040\nOkay.\n\n01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040\nThat's the system.\n\n01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.040\nAll right.\n\n01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.040\nOkay.\n\n01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.040\nAll right.\n\n01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.040\nSo you think you'll have that presence of mind no matter what happens.\n\n01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.040\nLook, fuck it.\n\n01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.040\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.040\nYank, yank, yank, yank, yank.\n\n01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040\nDon't come.\n\n01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.040\nDon't come.\n\n01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.040\nBut calm down.\n\n01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.040\nCalm down.\n\n01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.040\nI am the toilet.\n\n01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.040\nCalm down.\n\n01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.040\nCalm down.\n\n01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.040\nOkay.\n\n01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.040\nYeah.\n\n01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.040\nOkay.\n\n01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.040\nRight.\n\n01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.040\nOkay.\n\n01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:55.040\nSo I tie the rope firmly around my midsection and squeeze through the purple pulsating anus.\n\n01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.040\nMuscular action sucks you in.\n\n01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.040\nYou find yourself in a narrow, red passageway.\n\n01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:08.040\nIt opens up to an outcropping that looks over a lake of acid on the far wall.\n\n01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.040\nYou can see a similar outcropping.\n\n01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.040\nAm I safe where I'm standing?\n\n01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.040\nYou're safe where you're standing.\n\n01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.040\nYank, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.\n\n01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.040\nSo that means we don't go.\n\n01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.040\nNo, no.\n\n01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.040\nDidn't you hear the last two yanks?\n\n01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.040\nOh.\n\n01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:29.040\nI mean, that means he's probably perfectly safe not standing over an outcropping of acid.\n\n01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.040\nSo we'll keep our end of the bargain and follow him.\n\n01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.040\nOkay.\n\n01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:41.040\nSharpie, really quick before we go into Zanus, I just have to tell you that I, you know,\n\n01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.040\nlast night was pretty heavy, but I love you and I love you forever.\n\n01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.040\nI don't care what happens.\n\n01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:53.040\nI know.\n\n01:22:53.040 --> 01:23:00.040\nI give her a passionate kiss or at least one that it's so that it's taken so long to do\n\n01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.040\nthat it's passionate.\n\n01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.040\nTo the fans.\n\n01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.040\nOne part of yank, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.\n\n01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.040\nDid you guys not understand?\n\n01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:22.040\nOkay, I'm going into the anus.\n\n01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.040\nI proceed.\n\n01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:30.040\nAll right.\n\n01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:35.040\nOn the far wall, you see a similar purple pulsating sphincter.\n\n01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:38.040\nA few giant wasps flipped around the room.\n\n01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.040\nWasps.\n\n01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.040\nThese circling loops.\n\n01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.040\nWasps?\n\n01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.040\nYeah, giant ones.\n\n01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.040\nAll right.\n\n01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.040\nWell, the biological analog is breaking down for me.\n\n01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.040\nSo there are two, there are two sphincters?\n\n01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.040\nThere's two.\n\n01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.040\nYeah.\n\n01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.040\nSo it's, we've ventured through one and there's another one along the other passage.\n\n01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:55.040\nSo like, you know, we could be in a stomach kind of chamber.\n\n01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.040\nIt's acid.\n\n01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:01.040\nSo I think the infinite fish being, being an infinitely big, almost organism probably just\n\n01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:05.040\nhas more like big lakes of acid that kind of break down things in different stages.\n\n01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040\nYeah.\n\n01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040\nWe're in the stomach right now.\n\n01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.040\nBut if you could fly above it, you wouldn't dissolve.\n\n01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040\nOh.\n\n01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.040\nYep.\n\n01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.040\nI fly above it.\n\n01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.040\nWell, I use my teleportation.\n\n01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.040\nOh, wait.\n\n01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.040\nYou said it's out of juice.\n\n01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.040\nYeah.\n\n01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.040\nBut can't you, can't you fly then?\n\n01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.040\nAnd didn't you have a fly thing?\n\n01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.040\nWell, I have a feather fall.\n\n01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:27.040\nIf I start to fall, I could slowly lower myself into the acid.\n\n01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.040\nI wouldn't like break my neck on impact or anything.\n\n01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:36.040\nI take one of Mulraine's arrows and tie the rope to it and say, shoot the arrow into the\n\n01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.040\nfar wall and we'll climb across it like rope bridge style.\n\n01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040\nOh, boy.\n\n01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.040\nI shoot an arrow.\n\n01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:49.040\nYou shoot an arrow and it flies across the room, but much like the cord of your microphone,\n\n01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.040\nwhich just fell on the floor, the rope disengages itself.\n\n01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.040\nIt doesn't cross the chasm.\n\n01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.040\nI need to consult you about one of my spells.\n\n01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.040\nYeah.\n\n01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.040\nDon't I have tensors floating disc?\n\n01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.040\nTensors floating disc.\n\n01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.040\nYes.\n\n01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.040\nDoes that have any range to it?\n\n01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.040\nCan anyone get on that and I can send them across?\n\n01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:10.040\nThey can get on it, but I feel like there's a weight limit.\n\n01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040\nI think it's like...\n\n01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.040\nExcuse me?\n\n01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.040\nWell, Sharpie's pretty small.\n\n01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.040\nOr quark.\n\n01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.040\nYeah.\n\n01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.040\nOkay.\n\n01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.040\nYou could probably send quark over.\n\n01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.040\nYou're not so sure whether you...\n\n01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.040\nYou put me in a frisbee and throw me across the acid like...\n\n01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.040\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040\nYeah.\n\n01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.040\nYeah, I have like a thing called tensors floating disc.\n\n01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.040\nIt's like a floating hover sled so I can put equipment on it.\n\n01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040\nOkay.\n\n01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:38.040\nBut, Spencer, after I turn into a woman, I weigh like 50 pounds now, right?\n\n01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.040\n50?\n\n01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.040\nWhat's the standard weight for a woman?\n\n01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.040\nDead.\n\n01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.040\nLadies?\n\n01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.040\nOkay.\n\n01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.040\n100.\n\n01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.040\nJust 100.\n\n01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.040\nYeah, a reduced person.\n\n01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.040\nYeah, reduce one of us.\n\n01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040\nYeah, reduce me.\n\n01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.040\nReduce Mulraine and throw her across the acid.\n\n01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.040\nIf I reduce Mulraine, will the weight limit of her...\n\n01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.040\nWill she plus quark be under the weight limit of tensors floating disc?\n\n01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.040\nI'm just gonna say yes.\n\n01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.040\nOkay.\n\n01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.040\nAll right.\n\n01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.040\nI cast reduced person on Mulraine.\n\n01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.040\nTypical.\n\n01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.040\nThen I cast tensors floating disc.\n\n01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.040\nOkay.\n\n01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.040\nPut the two of them on the disc.\n\n01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.040\nYep, yep.\n\n01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.040\nAnd oogie boogie.\n\n01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040\nAll right.\n\n01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040\nYour maneuver works.\n\n01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.040\nThey're on the other side.\n\n01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.040\nSee you later.\n\n01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:31.040\nThey applauded for less in Brooklyn.\n\n01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.040\nCan I...\n\n01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.040\nThey applauded like a three-point ray of frost.\n\n01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.040\nCan we throw the disc back to him so he can get on it?\n\n01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.040\nYeah.\n\n01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.040\nI throw the disc back to Sharpie.\n\n01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.040\nThere you go.\n\n01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.040\nAnd I scream out, this is from both of us.\n\n01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.040\nWell, I don't think I can...\n\n01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.040\nCan I get on my own floating disc?\n\n01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040\nYeah.\n\n01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.040\nYeah.\n\n01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.040\nYou sound unsure.\n\n01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.040\nI'm just rolling with it.\n\n01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.040\nI'm rolling with it.\n\n01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.040\nAll right.\n\n01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.040\nI get on my own floating disc.\n\n01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.040\nWoo.\n\n01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.040\nSlowly, it hovers across.\n\n01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.040\nYou've peaked the attention of the flying wasps.\n\n01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.040\nOh, shit.\n\n01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:12.040\nShit, man.\n\n01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.040\nAre you using the dice the guy gave you?\n\n01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.040\nYeah, I am.\n\n01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.040\nAnd it's not boating well.\n\n01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.040\nThanks, bland.\n\n01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.040\nTwo of the wasps streak out of the air towards you,\n\n01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.040\npointing their vicious stings.\n\n01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.040\nYou manage to deflect one of the blows,\n\n01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.040\nbut it strikes you right in the shoulder.\n\n01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.040\nYou feel stinging pain as seven damage enters you.\n\n01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.040\nIt enters your body.\n\n01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.040\nScorching ray.\n\n01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.040\nScorching ray.\n\n01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:47.040\nIt misses.\n\n01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.040\nIt flies into the wall.\n\n01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.040\nWhat's your arrows?\n\n01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.040\nWhat should I fire them at?\n\n01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.040\nThe wasp.\n\n01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.040\nOh, the wasp.\n\n01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.040\nYeah.\n\n01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040\nYeah.\n\n01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.040\nSorry.\n\n01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.040\nYou just made out with this guy,\n\n01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.040\nand now you're just watching him getting his ass kicked.\n\n01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.040\nI'm swooning.\n\n01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040\nI'm swooning.\n\n01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.040\nYou're standing up here.\n\n01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.040\nI'm swooning.\n\n01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.040\nI'm swooning.\n\n01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040\nI'm swooning.\n\n01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.040\nAs a woman, I'm just thinking about babies and doilies.\n\n01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.040\nI fired.\n\n01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.040\nOkay.\n\n01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.040\nSo it's just one wasp.\n\n01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.040\nI fire one arrow.\n\n01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.040\nLike a regular arrow?\n\n01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.040\nA regular arrow, but I'm really,\n\n01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.040\nI'm really focusing, Spencer.\n\n01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.040\nYeah, you are.\n\n01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:25.040\nYou hit it.\n\n01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.040\nYeah.\n\n01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.040\nRight in the wing.\n\n01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:32.040\nThe wing falls off of its body and careens into the lake of acid.\n\n01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.040\nAll right.\n\n01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.040\nYour ascent movement continues.\n\n01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.040\nAll right.\n\n01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.040\nTinser is nice.\n\n01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.040\nYou get to the far outcropping.\n\n01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:47.040\nTinser's disc out.\n\n01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.040\nThe other wasp is droning lazily around.\n\n01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.040\nHe knows better than the mess with y'all.\n\n01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.040\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.040\nLet's not fuck with that guy.\n\n01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.040\nNo.\n\n01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.040\nAll right.\n\n01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.040\nSo what are we looking at now, Spencer?\n\n01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.040\nPurple sphincter.\n\n01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.040\nPurple sphincter.\n\n01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.040\nSame system.\n\n01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040\nSame system.\n\n01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040\nSame system.\n\n01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.040\nAlthough can I recommend?\n\n01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.040\nCan we talk about those shoes in a haircut?\n\n01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.040\nYeah.\n\n01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:11.040\nLike, it just seems like, like, now let's just pick this.\n\n01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.040\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.040\nOkay.\n\n01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.040\nBut it's okay.\n\n01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:19.040\nIf something's going wrong, then you say...\n\n01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.040\nOkay.\n\n01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:21.040\nSo that's bad.\n\n01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.040\nSo that's bad.\n\n01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.040\nThat's right.\n\n01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.040\nYeah.\n\n01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.040\nBecause that's what happened before.\n\n01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040\nI'm in a butthole.\n\n01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040\nCome in.\n\n01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.040\nCome in.\n\n01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.040\nI'm in a butthole.\n\n01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.040\nI'm in a butthole.\n\n01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.040\nIf I don't...\n\n01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.040\nIf I don't...\n\n01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040\nThink of it this way.\n\n01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.040\nOkay.\n\n01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.040\nDid you...\n\n01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.040\nThink of it this way.\n\n01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:42.040\nI'm in terrible danger.\n\n01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.040\nJust kidding.\n\n01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.040\nThat makes sense to me.\n\n01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.040\nThat makes sense to me.\n\n01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.040\nOh, God.\n\n01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.040\nBaby's so smart.\n\n01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.040\nBaby's system's so good.\n\n01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.040\nIs there something on my face?\n\n01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.040\nNo.\n\n01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.040\nI'm worried that there is mine.\n\n01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.040\nI don't...\n\n01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.040\nI've been conditioned before you got up here.\n\n01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.040\nThere was hair hanging everywhere.\n\n01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.040\nAll right.\n\n01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.040\nI'm in terrible danger.\n\n01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.040\nOkay.\n\n01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:10.040\nI tied the rope around my waist and eased my way through the other sphincter.\n\n01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:14.040\nYou climb into the sphincter and immediately feel embraced by powerful muscular action.\n\n01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.040\nStory of Jeff's life.\n\n01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.040\nYeah.\n\n01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:19.040\nThat's true.\n\n01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.040\nImmediately you feel the rope snap.\n\n01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.040\nYour side.\n\n01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.040\nSharpie and Mulrani go slack.\n\n01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.040\nOh, no.\n\n01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.040\nOh, no.\n\n01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:28.040\nYou're being pushed through a fleshy opening with insane speed.\n\n01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:33.040\nYou feel like you're falling and then being pulled upwards and all around and suddenly\n\n01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.040\nyou're falling again.\n\n01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.040\nOh, shit.\n\n01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.040\nSo we're not feeling any signals.\n\n01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.040\nIs he fine?\n\n01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.040\nNo, you feel it go slack.\n\n01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.040\nNo, I know.\n\n01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.040\nHoly shit.\n\n01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.040\nWait.\n\n01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.040\nIt's the rope.\n\n01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.040\nI pull on the rope.\n\n01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.040\nIt comes out.\n\n01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.040\nIt's broken?\n\n01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.040\nYes.\n\n01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040\nOkay.\n\n01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.040\nI tie the rope to another arrow.\n\n01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.040\nOkay.\n\n01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.040\nI fire the arrow right on the rim of the sphincter.\n\n01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.040\nAll right.\n\n01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.040\nYou miss.\n\n01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.040\nYou can...\n\n01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.040\nOkay.\n\n01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.040\nYou can just stab it in if you'd like.\n\n01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.040\nOh, okay.\n\n01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.040\nI stab it in.\n\n01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.040\nThat's fair.\n\n01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.040\nOkay.\n\n01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.040\nAlso gross.\n\n01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.040\nOkay.\n\n01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.040\nGroser than shooting it.\n\n01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.040\nOkay.\n\n01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.040\nSo if I'm able to stab it...\n\n01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.040\nOkay.\n\n01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.040\nI thought I had to like go across something.\n\n01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.040\nMe while...\n\n01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.040\nLittle help!\n\n01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.040\nMy chicken noodle can't talk.\n\n01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.040\nOkay.\n\n01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:20.040\nI tie the rope to my foot.\n\n01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.040\nI give the...\n\n01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.040\nI tie the rope to my foot.\n\n01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.040\nI take out two arrows.\n\n01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:31.040\nI am holding them in my hand and I say to Sharpie, hold on to the other side of the rope.\n\n01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.040\nOkay.\n\n01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.040\nWe'll do the same system.\n\n01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.040\nI'm going to find quirk.\n\n01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.040\nOkay.\n\n01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.040\nIt's going to snap.\n\n01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.040\nThe rope's going to snap.\n\n01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.040\nNo, but it won't because I have arrows with me.\n\n01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.040\nHe didn't have any arrows.\n\n01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.040\nHow's the arrow...\n\n01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.040\nHow are the arrows...\n\n01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.040\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.040\nBecause maybe something stabbed the rope apart and they didn't have a...\n\n01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.040\nIs this a bad idea?\n\n01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.040\nWe can switch.\n\n01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:56.040\nThis is going to get the same results here.\n\n01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.040\nWe need to...\n\n01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:02.040\nHe's gone into the intestinal tract.\n\n01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:07.040\nWe need to either follow him or forget we ever knew him.\n\n01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.040\nWell, then let's follow him.\n\n01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:13.040\nLet's double-bind our feet just to be...\n\n01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.040\nI have a potion of enlarged person.\n\n01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:18.040\nI'm wondering if I drink it just as I go in.\n\n01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.040\nRight.\n\n01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.040\nJust give this thing the biggest...\n\n01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.040\nHe may enlarge the tunnel and if he's stuck, then he'll...\n\n01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.040\nYeah, that's a great idea.\n\n01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:31.040\nIt just seems like a random thing to do.\n\n01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:36.040\nDon't be shy, you're so smart.\n\n01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:41.040\nI charge headlong into the sphincter as I drink a potion of enlarged person.\n\n01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.040\nAlright.\n\n01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.040\nStraight in life?\n\n01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.040\nYou too get sucked into the sphincter.\n\n01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:50.040\nYou travel around in it.\n\n01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:56.040\nAs you get larger and larger, it doesn't seem to affect the speed of the esophageal ascendance.\n\n01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.040\nYou too soon are falling.\n\n01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:03.040\nYou land on a fleshy outcropping on the side of a big red pit.\n\n01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:06.040\nBelow you, you could see the ship you crashed here on.\n\n01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.040\nAm I there too?\n\n01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.040\nYou were there too.\n\n01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:10.040\nWhat's up?\n\n01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.040\nYou've just been sitting there for a bit.\n\n01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.040\nWhat were you guys doing?\n\n01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:19.040\nTalking about how smart you were and just fucking doing bullshit?\n\n01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:24.040\nBefore you get judgmental, you might want to realize you're going to be around us for a while.\n\n01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040\nWe just came full circle.\n\n01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.040\nThat's our ship down there.\n\n01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.040\nOh wait, so we just wasted a bunch of time?\n\n01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:36.040\nOn the small ledge is a small campfire as well as a green tent.\n\n01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.040\nWho's on this ledge?\n\n01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.040\nYou guys are both on this.\n\n01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.040\nOh, we're both on it?\n\n01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.040\nWe're on the other side of the sphincter.\n\n01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.040\nLet's go up to the green tent.\n\n01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.040\nAlright, that happens.\n\n01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.040\nI knock on the flap.\n\n01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:55.040\nIt doesn't sound like much, but you hear the rustling and shaking of something exiting the tent.\n\n01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.040\nWhat's he look like?\n\n01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.040\nOkay.\n\n01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.040\nOut climbs a tall, thin elf with long blonde hair.\n\n01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:07.040\nHe's wearing stained red leather clothes and at his side is a magnificent long sword with a pristine golden blade.\n\n01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:15.040\nHuldo, I am Prince Valesant of the Valesant Phyftum.\n\n01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.040\nHello?\n\n01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:23.040\nWhat brings you to my outcropping?\n\n01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.040\nWe just went through some butts.\n\n01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:30.040\nWe were trying to get pooped out of a fish.\n\n01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.040\nWell, you were close.\n\n01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.040\nYou got pooped somewhere just to my little camp.\n\n01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.040\nHow's it going?\n\n01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.040\nDo you want a sandwich?\n\n01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.040\nWhat's it made of?\n\n01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.040\nFish innards.\n\n01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.040\nIs there a way to get out of this fish?\n\n01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:51.040\nI don't know much about navigation, although what I do know is sword mastery.\n\n01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:55.040\nI am a sword master and I master all swords.\n\n01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.040\nCan't we just slice our way out of this thing?\n\n01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.040\nCan't we just start slicing and dicing and punch a hole?\n\n01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:04.040\nThe thing about such great beasts is although you can do hefty damage to their insides,\n\n01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:08.040\nmuscular action tends to close the wounds, sealing any pathway out.\n\n01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.040\nYou'd have to do something pretty dangerous to some of the vital organs to knock this thing out of the air.\n\n01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.040\nMeanwhile, I jump into the sphincter to join them.\n\n01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:21.040\nBut if we knock this thing out of the air, don't we all die anyway?\n\n01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.040\nMaybe. That's all up to you.\n\n01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:28.040\nWhat if it vomits you into a cushioned plane, a plane of eternal cushioning?\n\n01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:33.040\nWe have to go get to a heart or a lung or something like that and go stab it in the heart?\n\n01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:37.040\nI am not much of an infinifish biologist by any means.\n\n01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.040\nYou were more of a swordsman.\n\n01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.040\nWhat are you good at?\n\n01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.040\nI'm good at swords.\n\n01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.040\nOkay, okay, check this out. Shoot an arrow.\n\n01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:49.040\nAlright, I shoot one arrow.\n\n01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.040\nOkay, you shoot it over the side of the pit.\n\n01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:59.040\nAs it descends towards the earth, he unsheathes his sword and in a single fluid motion strikes with his blade.\n\n01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.040\nAlthough he's a good 30 feet off, you could see the arrow break into half and fall into pieces.\n\n01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.040\nLike Robin Hood men in tights?\n\n01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.040\nDoes he have like magic far sword powers?\n\n01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.040\nHe's just as fast as a knife. It's a Milbrox maybe. It's not realistic.\n\n01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:19.040\nAlright, so we need to take this guy on a journey up to the organs and use his sword to destroy the heart of this thing probably, right?\n\n01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.040\nHe's got far sword abilities.\n\n01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:25.040\nI don't have a problem with you guys escaping, but I kind of dig it.\n\n01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.040\nThe Vellicent Kingdom was pretty shitty.\n\n01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:31.040\nWait, what are you talking about? You like it inside a fish?\n\n01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.040\nYeah, it's like there's sandwiches.\n\n01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:41.040\nListen, if you come with us, you'll have sandwiches that aren't made of fish innards.\n\n01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.040\nLike, what else do you put in a sandwich?\n\n01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.040\nHow long have you been here?\n\n01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:51.040\nI mean, we just ate fish sandwiches too. That was typical.\n\n01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.040\nThere's a whole world out there.\n\n01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.040\nMaybe we can show you some affection.\n\n01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:01.040\nYeah, my girlfriend will fuck you, I guess, is what she's saying. I don't know why she's saying that.\n\n01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:04.040\nOh, she'll fuck you.\n\n01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.040\nAnd I mean, fuck you.\n\n01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.040\nYou're going to have a pussy sandwich.\n\n01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:14.040\nBelieve me, I have my share of portable holes.\n\n01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.040\nOh!\n\n01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:21.040\nWhich portable holes had never existed in this universe?\n\n01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.040\nI can make mine pretty stationary.\n\n01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.040\nWell, I guess the conversations move because you said you'd like to help us, but you want to stay.\n\n01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:31.040\nMaybe you could just show us away and then go back.\n\n01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:36.040\nIs there anything that we could offer you that you value that we might be able to bribe you with?\n\n01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:39.040\nDo you have any weapons?\n\n01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.040\nI have a couple swords.\n\n01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.040\nI have an emerald dagger.\n\n01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:49.040\nI have a sense of adventure.\n\n01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.040\nWait, didn't you say you'd be happy to help us?\n\n01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:57.040\nI'd be happy to help you with any sword-related problems or sword-related expertise.\n\n01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:00.040\nI have a great flaming sword. It's pretty cool.\n\n01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.040\nYou don't have to give him anything. He's going to help us anyway.\n\n01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:03.040\nHe is?\n\n01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:06.040\nCome with us. We'll just talk swords.\n\n01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.040\nYou and I, we'll talk swords all day long. We'll play sword fight.\n\n01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.040\nHave you heard the new broadsword monthly?\n\n01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:17.040\nHell yeah. I wrote a piece for it.\n\n01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.040\nI can't believe it gets delivered here of all places.\n\n01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.040\nYou seem pretty cool. Let's talk. Let's go.\n\n01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.040\nHow do I get down?\n\n01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:30.040\nI've got to get up.\n\n01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.040\nFeather fall?\n\n01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.040\nCan I cast that on other people?\n\n01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.040\nSounds good.\n\n01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.040\nI can cast that on other people?\n\n01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.040\nYeah, you can cast it on people.\n\n01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.040\nI cast feather fall on everybody.\n\n01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:44.040\nOn everybody.\n\n01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.040\nThat's going to take up most of your spells.\n\n01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:49.040\nYou're going to need some rest after this, but you gently float to the pit.\n\n01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.040\nThe bottom of it. You're back where you started.\n\n01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.040\nBack where we started. What a great adventure. Back where we started.\n\n01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.040\nClipping in!\n\n01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:01.040\nClipping in. Back where we started.\n\n01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.040\nBack where you started.\n\n01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:08.040\nThank you, Erin McGathy.\n\n01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:14.040\nNow, we're not where we started because now we've got a guy with super-far sword powers\n\n01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.040\nand he's going to help us kick ass.\n\n01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:19.040\nI know. That's the point of his story. Jeff, you go on little cycles.\n\n01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.040\nYeah?\n\n01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.040\nI wasn't being derogatory when I said back where we started.\n\n01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:28.840\nOh good. Now what do you feel like you started the show speaking of cycles\n\n01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.760\nwondering where we were in the Joseph Kimbellion thing? It seems like tonight\n\n01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:36.640\nwas pretty easy. It was very supportive. Maybe too easy. Too easy for $20 right?\n\n01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:42.600\nLike some people I drove six hours why was it for $20? Do you feel like the audience needs\n\n01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:45.760\nyou to work a little harder break a sweat up here? No I think the audience needs to\n\n01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:52.320\ngive me validation so that I can know that I gave them their $20 worth. Well\n\n01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.960\nthey already gave you $20 though. They gave the club $20 but I'm saying\n\n01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.720\nlike I just I don't want to cheat them. I don't want them to call the Better\n\n01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:07.000\nBusiness Bureau. I want to buck some mamas. Oh fuck some mamas. Okay I think\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.280\nthey're saying that if I do some rapping, if I do some freestyle rapping then\n\n01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.560\nthat'll make their ticket price worthwhile. All right do you want to do the\n\n01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.280\nGrand Finale rap? Do you want to do one of the freestyle styles? Let's try the\n\n01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.440\ndo it. Do we have any Rihanna's in the audience? Any Dytos? Any\n\n01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:27.120\ngirls that can come up and sing the P.S. Yellow Puppet's Brown Hook to our\n\n01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.520\nthing? At the very least we have Ruth right? Yeah Ruth.

The phrase at the very least was not appropriate. I just meant because you\n\n01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:55.480\nalready... Well I have no idea what y'all are talking about. Okay. There's a\n\n01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:02.240\nrefrain okay so I do a terrible awesome freestyle rapping and then there's a\n\n01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:21.880\nchorus that's like sort of a that's just you singing like the lyrics are.
