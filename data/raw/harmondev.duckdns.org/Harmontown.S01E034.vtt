00:00.000 --> 00:27.200
From the lofty heights of the comedy attic in Bloomington, Harmontown once again is in

00:27.200 --> 00:32.800
session. Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:32.800 --> 01:01.960
Hello! He's making a drink, because he drank too much backstage, gotta make another drink.

01:01.960 --> 01:12.560
But that wouldn't make sense. Wow, the rooms fall! I'm a Midwestern, or Indiana's

01:12.560 --> 01:18.120
the Midwest, right? We're now even closer. We were in Pittsburgh last night and I was

01:18.120 --> 01:23.400
starting to feel that familiar chill as I explained to my girlfriend. There's different

01:23.400 --> 01:28.920
kinds of coldness, and we're getting closer and closer to the coldness of my home. A coldness

01:28.920 --> 01:35.480
that makes your heart cold, not just your skin. But it's a different flavor, and Indiana's

01:35.480 --> 01:41.440
cold is feeling more and more like Milwaukee's cold, and we're in the Midwest. I know that

01:41.440 --> 01:47.640
there's a culture that comes with the Midwest that is directly attributed to its climate.

01:47.640 --> 01:56.440
When you live someplace where it gets this cold, you are the product of people whose

01:56.440 --> 02:06.440
wagons broke down, half way to California, and who decided, let's stick it out here.

02:06.440 --> 02:10.360
There's a religion that has to come with that, a personal religion and a cosmic religion of

02:10.360 --> 02:18.440
like, you know, don't have too much pretentiousness. We're an honest people in the Midwest because

02:18.440 --> 02:24.560
we don't want to commit the crime of being overly ambitious, overly cocky. We stick

02:24.560 --> 02:28.800
to that Icarus myth very much. When you move to California from the Midwest, the people

02:28.800 --> 02:34.440
always say, you'll be back, and they mean it as both an insult and a compliment. I know

02:34.440 --> 02:39.440
you guys know this. I know Garrison Keeler already told you, and I know that every comic

02:39.440 --> 02:42.680
that comes through here probably reminds you of it because there's an outside perspective

02:42.680 --> 02:48.360
on that because I'm from the Midwest, Jeff. I just wanted to celebrate Indiana as being

02:48.360 --> 02:55.280
the most exciting, specific state in the entire country. It's not...

02:55.280 --> 02:56.840
What makes it so specific?

02:56.840 --> 03:02.600
Well, there's a lot of things that make it very specific, Jeff.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.680
What is the typewriter?

03:03.680 --> 03:13.920
As you know, I Wikipedia research every place we go, and yeah, you can see in just the effort

03:13.920 --> 03:20.080
that someone took to... Sorry, I didn't actually have this up until you mentioned that. This

03:20.080 --> 03:24.080
wasn't like a pre-rehearsed bit. He just reminded me of the fact that... I don't know. Well,

03:24.080 --> 03:27.760
it doesn't matter. Why am I going to look? I don't read it. I looked at the Wikipedia

03:27.760 --> 03:33.960
thing and said, Indiana is the 19th state to blah, blah, blah. Everything's right in

03:33.960 --> 03:40.040
the middle. Everything's like, it's the 16th coldest state. One thing, it started real

03:40.040 --> 03:51.520
hot. It was like, Indiana is the least extensive state in the contiguous United States, west

03:51.520 --> 03:57.600
of the Appalachians. Just even an attempt to be the least something came up short. It

03:57.600 --> 04:03.560
just bobbed right to the middle of the tank. Nothing extreme can be said or happen here.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.640
But we're going to change that tonight. We're going to make Indiana the most extreme place

04:06.640 --> 04:16.440
in the world. Yeah, a guy just yelled out extreme Pringles for no reason. That's a new

04:16.440 --> 04:24.920
thing that happened here. A guy feeling comfortable yelling out extreme Pringles. Did you know,

04:24.920 --> 04:33.280
Jeff, that Indiana invented glass? I thought that was the Phoenicians. Did you know that

04:33.280 --> 04:43.560
Indiana has more murders with hammers? Between the Appalachians and the Rockies, just the

04:43.560 --> 04:48.960
most murders with hammers, period. Out of anywhere in the world. Did you know, Jeff,

04:48.960 --> 05:00.520
that Indiana... I did not know that. Did you know they once successfully invaded Michigan?

05:00.520 --> 05:06.720
Why didn't they annex it and keep it? Because they're cool people. They're good people.

05:06.720 --> 05:18.880
They like it in Indiana. Did you know that fluorescent light was banned here for 13 years?

05:18.880 --> 05:26.480
Because there was a socialist mare of Indianapolis? I don't know.

05:26.480 --> 05:33.480
Worth a try. Let's do... Also, the state famous for its basketball! Sports Corner!

05:33.480 --> 05:44.760
Sports Corner! Hey, everybody, that's happening at the Dan Harmon Sports Corner. He knows about

05:44.760 --> 05:51.480
sports. He knows you like sports. We're going to talk about sports.

05:51.480 --> 06:01.280
Boy, the Hoosiers, Jeff, really out there dribbling the sphere. They've taken it basket

06:01.280 --> 06:04.280
to basket. It's been a great, great quarterly season.

06:04.280 --> 06:09.600
Do you feel that Gene Hackman's coming down too hard on the team?

06:09.600 --> 06:14.120
Hackman's always been an offensive coach. In a time of defense, there are times when

06:14.120 --> 06:18.960
you've got to go defense in the fiscal quarter.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.680
Which of the four quarters is the most fiscal?

06:21.680 --> 06:24.480
Well, certainly you've got the Winter Conference, you've got the Spring Conference, and you've

06:24.480 --> 06:31.720
got the Pumpkin, Pumpkin Bowl. Hackman, obviously, is going to be able to push that ball closer

06:31.720 --> 06:39.520
to the net. We're talking again about a game of yardage in those fall months, that fall

06:39.520 --> 06:45.280
season, Jeff. So the key is to handicap the players. You've got to keep handicapping them.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.600
How do you feel about all this Notre Dame scandal?

06:47.600 --> 06:53.600
Well, that was Chickens coming home to roost when you have a team poised with that kind

06:53.600 --> 06:57.960
of hubris. They're saying the things they're saying at the All-Stars, saying what they're

06:57.960 --> 07:04.480
saying at Regionals, saying again, doubling down at All-Star Regionals, that you've got

07:04.480 --> 07:11.080
a team that's got too much, too much high game and not enough low game. They've taken

07:11.080 --> 07:16.520
too many three-pointers, too many free agents, too much scrimmage, too much offense, Jeff.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.400
And it was going to cry, it was going to come tumbling down. They built a glass menagerie,

07:20.400 --> 07:21.400
Jeff.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.840
Got you. And what do you do? Do you like the Pacers this year? What do you think?

07:25.840 --> 07:28.600
They're good. They're looking good. They've got to keep those knees iced. They've got

07:28.600 --> 07:37.360
to keep everything. They're ducking around. Just keep focusing on the lines of scrimmage.

07:37.360 --> 08:02.200
Next corner! I had the volume down.

08:02.200 --> 08:08.160
Some facts about Bloomington, the city, Jeff. Six blocks from here is where Lincoln was

08:08.160 --> 08:09.160
shot.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.160
The first time.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
Yeah.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.160
Yeah.

08:12.160 --> 08:18.680
Little, I got winged in the leg on the way to a rehearsal for my American cousin at the

08:18.680 --> 08:21.200
Ford Junior Theater.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.680
Take a hint, Abe.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.960
People don't publicize it because they want to make him into a big martyr. The truth is,

08:27.960 --> 08:32.480
he was warned. And that was back when he supported slavery.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.480
Yes.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.480
Yeah.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.120
It would have been a terrible news item back then.

08:37.120 --> 08:46.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the guy who assassinated him, John Wilkes Bench, the guy that shot

08:46.560 --> 08:48.120
him the first time in the leg.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.080
Oh, yeah. Gabriel Byrne.

08:50.080 --> 08:55.320
You know what he, Bench. Gabriel Byrne Bench.

08:55.320 --> 09:00.400
You know what he said to him in Latin as he shot him in the leg?

09:00.400 --> 09:11.360
Tyrannus, Maltanus, Sixth Semper, don't anus, nanus, which means don't be a tyrant and

09:11.360 --> 09:15.200
this won't happen in a more fatal way to you.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.800
And then what did Lincoln do?

09:16.800 --> 09:21.960
Oh, that's a ball of slavery. Go see a play, idiot.

09:21.960 --> 09:22.960
Had it coming.

09:22.960 --> 09:29.960
He didn't have it coming. Nobody has it coming, but he saw it coming and he did it.

09:29.960 --> 09:41.880
Is there a mouse in here?

09:41.880 --> 09:44.960
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Podcast listeners can't appreciate this,

09:44.960 --> 09:51.840
but there's a grip on the mic stand that adjusts the height of it. It's not, usually there's

09:51.840 --> 09:56.160
a twisty thing. You've all seen that twisty motion that comics have to, as a man who's

09:56.160 --> 10:02.760
had to do this 20 nights in a row, I couldn't be more excited about this.

10:02.760 --> 10:13.000
This is like a professional like me invented this, Jeff, a professional entertainer.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.800
Let's get Spencer up here.

10:14.800 --> 10:15.800
Yeah.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
Yeah.

10:16.800 --> 10:21.800
We've been bringing him up earlier and earlier in the show because the fact is, Spencer

10:21.800 --> 10:23.800
is the show.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.800
Yeah. There's no bad Spencer. It's better to have him than not.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.800
Yeah.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.800
Hello, Spencer. Hey, how's it going?

10:29.800 --> 10:32.800
Good. How was the merch table? How were sales?

10:32.800 --> 10:36.800
Sales were average to subpar by stuff, you guys.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.800
Oh, wow.

10:37.800 --> 10:44.800
Well, it's all right if you don't. I don't care. We're not trying to make any money or anything.

10:44.800 --> 10:49.800
We're trying to free up the bus space. Our bus driver almost quit when he saw the amount

10:49.800 --> 10:54.800
of merch that we had endeavored to bring on this trip because there's no room for us on

10:54.800 --> 10:58.800
the bus. There's just trash bags of shirts. We could have brought a third of that probably,

10:58.800 --> 10:59.800
right?

10:59.800 --> 11:00.800
Yeah.

11:00.800 --> 11:05.800
So tonight, Jeff, is it going to be, we couldn't figure out, we're a couple podcasts behind

11:05.800 --> 11:10.800
in the broadcasting of what we've been recording. You haven't yet heard the show in Arlington,

11:10.800 --> 11:14.800
which was a little Nashvilly, I guess. I don't know, it was a little more kind of raucous,

11:14.800 --> 11:17.800
kind of sloppy, sloppy Joe, I would say.

11:17.800 --> 11:18.800
Arlington?

11:18.800 --> 11:20.800
Yeah, I think we brought all black people up on stage.

11:20.800 --> 11:26.800
Yeah, we had all eight black audience members up on stage. And we somehow managed to set

11:26.800 --> 11:29.800
civil rights back about 45 years.

11:29.800 --> 11:36.800
But that's what we do out here. We experiment on the road. It was a fun show, but a drunken

11:36.800 --> 11:43.800
raucous one. Then in Pittsburgh, I became very ill, I think from shaking everyone's hands

11:43.800 --> 11:46.800
and things, and it's not on you.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.800
It's on Rhode Island.

11:47.800 --> 11:56.800
Yeah, something's on them that I'll purell so you don't get it tonight. But it was an

11:56.800 --> 11:58.800
emotionally cathartic show, Jeff.

11:58.800 --> 12:09.800
Yeah, and then D&D became Sally Jesse Raphael, and there was deep sadness and deep on we.

12:09.800 --> 12:15.800
Yeah, Aaron and I talked to each other about our relationship during D&D, brought the house

12:15.800 --> 12:22.800
down, but not in a funny ha-ha way, and a sad, brought it down, brought the house down

12:22.800 --> 12:24.800
emotionally.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.800
And then we ended.

12:27.800 --> 12:33.800
So the big question is, according to Joseph Campbell, was last night the meeting with

12:33.800 --> 12:39.800
the goddess, therefore is tonight the beginning of the troubles, or was last night the end

12:39.800 --> 12:44.800
of a road of trials, therefore tonight is going to be weightless and carefree and mellow,

12:44.800 --> 12:48.800
like a kind of dream-poppy, meditative experience.

12:48.800 --> 12:54.800
Let's experiment with that first. Do you have any new age music in there, Jeff?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.800
I have kind of something mellow.

13:04.800 --> 13:09.800
Can we bring the lights down just a little bit?

13:09.800 --> 13:13.800
Perfect, thank you.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.800
Ooh, yeah.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.800
Can we bring them down even more?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.800
Even more?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.800
That's good.

13:22.800 --> 13:28.800
That's good. That's really not what I had in mind what you're playing, but I don't think you have.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.800
I want to go on a cosmic voyage.

13:32.800 --> 13:39.800
I'm using all stuff for our movie that we have the right to use, unlicensed stuff, so I don't have a hook.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.800
Is there anybody in here?

13:41.800 --> 13:48.800
Is there a female vocalist in the room so talented that you think you could kind of riff just a melodic kind of...

13:48.800 --> 13:50.800
Like an Enya kind of thing?

13:50.800 --> 13:56.800
Yeah, like an Enya kind of just copyright free Enya kind of...

13:56.800 --> 13:59.800
See, I can practically do it. You shouldn't be that intimidated.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.800
Anybody?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.800
I see your hand raised. You want to come up?

14:02.800 --> 14:03.800
Alright.

14:03.800 --> 14:09.800
Just give it a shot. You can't be...

14:09.800 --> 14:10.800
Your name?

14:10.800 --> 14:16.800
Ruth, everybody. Wow. You got a Dalek snowman on your shirt. That's very cool.

14:16.800 --> 14:21.800
We see a lot of Doctor Who's t-shirts in our audience. I love that.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.800
Yeah.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.800
Alright, Ruth.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.800
That's why a new sports corner would work.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.800
Enya, was the idea?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
Yeah, just kind of like a mythical...

14:30.800 --> 14:32.800
New Agey, like you're getting a middle-earth...

14:32.800 --> 14:34.800
You're getting a massage, you know.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.800
Maybe quitting smoking.

14:36.800 --> 14:42.800
Yeah, maybe an elf is, you know, the nimbly running through the woodland area or something like that.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.800
Like a non-smoking elf, you know.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.800
Non-smoking elf.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.800
Yeah.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.800
Like...

14:49.800 --> 14:53.800
Close your eyes.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.800
Drift to the center.

14:55.800 --> 15:02.800
Come with me on a voyage of the cosmos.

15:02.800 --> 15:07.800
Your soul is not bound to your corporeal frame.

15:07.800 --> 15:15.800
It is rising, rising above the stratosphere.

15:15.800 --> 15:16.800
Nice reverb.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.800
Wow.

15:17.800 --> 15:18.800
Hey, what are you doing here?

15:18.800 --> 15:19.800
Jess, sorry.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.800
Jeez, I'm trying to relax these people.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.800
I'm sorry.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.800
Pretend I'm not here.

15:25.800 --> 15:26.800
Jesus.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
Fucking asshole.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.800
Keep going.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.800
Sorry.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.800
Where were we, the stratosphere?

15:34.800 --> 15:35.800
Okay.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.800
Your body pulls back.

15:38.800 --> 15:44.800
Growing ever distant from its terrestrial origins.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.800
You see Jupiter pass on the right.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.800
Goodbye, Jupiter.

15:51.800 --> 15:56.800
It's a big planet, but not a lot happens there.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.800
Some say it's compensating for something.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.800
Some say that's a dumb joke.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.800
Then still others, and these are the people I agree with,

16:05.800 --> 16:09.800
I'm making it up and you get what you pay for.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.800
Then another guy might come in and say,

16:11.800 --> 16:13.800
they probably paid a lot.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.800
Then maybe a sixth guy would come in and say,

16:16.800 --> 16:18.800
how much?

16:18.800 --> 16:21.800
Seventh guy would say, at least 20 bucks, I'm imagining.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.800
I don't know.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
Hey, Ruth, what's up?

16:23.800 --> 16:24.800
Sorry.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.800
What's going on?

16:25.800 --> 16:26.800
You making me laugh?

16:26.800 --> 16:27.800
You need a hall tablet?

16:27.800 --> 16:28.800
Stay in the game, Ruth.

16:28.800 --> 16:33.800
I'm stuck just behind Jupiter.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.800
Floating out here like an asshole.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.800
The cosmic show must go on.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.800
Jeff, Jeff, can I, I'm sorry,

16:41.800 --> 16:42.800
every time you appear in the cosmos here,

16:42.800 --> 16:44.800
you sound a little ghostly.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.800
I don't know if you understand the difference

16:46.800 --> 16:48.800
between the cosmic things and spooky things.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.800
I don't know what you mean, Dan.

16:50.800 --> 16:55.800
I'm a ghostly vampire.

16:55.800 --> 17:00.800
I've lived in the cosmos for seven million years.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.800
Sorry, please.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.800
I forgot your name, cosmos lady.

17:02.800 --> 17:03.800
Ruth.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.800
Yes.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.800
Ruth, can I make with the...

17:05.800 --> 17:09.800
I'm not actually 90 if people want to know.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.800
90?

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
Oh, because you have an old lady's name?

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
Yeah.

17:12.800 --> 17:13.800
Oh.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.800
I kind of never crossed my mind.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.800
70 tops.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.800
Ruthie Aslan, who edited the community's best seasons,

17:22.800 --> 17:27.800
she's a young spry, little hipster with truck tailors.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.800
Jeff.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.800
Stealing my melody.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.800
You're sinking in space now.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.800
We've lost our momentum.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.800
We're floating ever downward through space,

17:41.800 --> 17:45.800
to the space below space, under space,

17:45.800 --> 17:48.800
crawl space.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.800
There's a dead chipmunk here.

17:51.800 --> 17:56.800
Stinking up your universe for years.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.800
That's what that was.

17:59.800 --> 18:03.800
Let's grab that chipmunk, scoop it out,

18:03.800 --> 18:08.800
get rid of it, put it in the garbage.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.800
Is this special pickup required for that?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.800
If it sat there under your house for two years,

18:13.800 --> 18:18.800
it could certainly sit in the garbage for three days.

18:18.800 --> 18:25.800
Go back in the house.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.800
Reach for the highest cabinet you can find.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.800
Open it.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.800
There's a human head in it.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.800
Jason's come back.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.800
He's followed you to your home outside New York.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.800
And yet, so many years later,

18:42.800 --> 18:47.800
we'd make a big deal out of him going to Manhattan.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.800
Relax.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.800
It's not like he's a killer that hasn't traveled before.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.800
He seems to know the transit system.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.800
I think some of you 40-year-olds know what I'm talking about.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.800
Jason Voorhees...

18:59.800 --> 19:01.800
Platholes.

19:01.800 --> 19:07.800
Let's get some consistency at table one, the 13th.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.800
Relax.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.800
Sorry.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.800
You're rising up through your own roof,

19:13.800 --> 19:15.800
leaving Jason Voorhees behind.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.800
You're going back out into space.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.800
You see Jupiter again.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.800
Let's go past it.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.800
I think maybe Saturn.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.800
I can't keep track. I can't remember.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.800
There's Venus.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.800
No, that should have been...

19:31.800 --> 19:33.800
Okay, we're going the wrong way.

19:33.800 --> 19:34.800
I'm sorry.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.800
Apple Maps joke.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.800
Apple Maps joke here.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.800
Sorry for deconstructing the Apple Maps joke

19:40.800 --> 19:44.800
instead of just giving it to you straight.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.800
There's the sun.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.800
You definitely went the wrong way.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.800
Go into the center of the sun.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.800
The heat can't hurt you.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.800
You have no body.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.800
Did you know the center of the sun is actually quite cold?

20:05.800 --> 20:09.800
It works like a refrigerator.

20:09.800 --> 20:13.800
You know, you touch the back of a refrigerator.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.800
It burns your hand.

20:15.800 --> 20:19.800
Even though it's in the inside, milk is cold.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.800
It's cold here in the center of the sun.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.800
Have a glass of milk.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.800
Relax.

20:30.800 --> 20:35.800
Indiana, this is where you are.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.800
At the center of all.

20:37.800 --> 20:41.800
You will crave less cigarettes.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.800
Heavy creams and sauces cannot give you comfort.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.800
They will only make you gain weight.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.800
You will be more productive at work.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.800
More positive in your social affairs.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.800
Swimming will become easier for you.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.800
You will grow gills.

20:58.800 --> 21:04.800
You are now a member of my aquatic super army.

21:04.800 --> 21:13.800
Non-smoking, sauce-hating, supervising managers.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.800
That swim 900 miles per hour.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.800
Now go back to earth with you.

21:17.800 --> 21:22.800
Claim my birthright.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.800
Alright, thank you, Ruth.

21:24.800 --> 21:29.800
Ruth, everybody.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.800
Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.800
Shit, wrapping hard.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.800
Wrapping in Indiana, Indiana.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.800
Wrapping to your mama.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.800
Wrapping to your daddy.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.800
Wrapping like a mimer.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
Said my name was old Patty.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
Got a cookie.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.800
On my titty and my dick.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.800
Wrapped your mama.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.800
Your mama's name's St. Nick.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.800
Put her in a chimney pussy.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.800
I fucked your mama.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.800
Nothing rhymes with pussy.

21:49.800 --> 21:50.800
God damn it.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.800
What rhymes with pussy?

21:51.800 --> 21:54.800
Nothing rhymes with pussy.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.800
Wussy?

21:55.800 --> 21:56.800
Wussy, yeah.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.800
Wussy is it?

21:58.800 --> 22:03.800
Garrett Busy's not bad.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.800
Who said that?

22:04.800 --> 22:05.800
Get up on stage.

22:05.800 --> 22:06.800
Rap battle.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.800
Come up on stage, sir.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.800
Who said Gary Busy?

22:11.800 --> 22:12.800
Who said Gary Busy?

22:12.800 --> 22:14.800
Get up here.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.800
Are you okay coming up?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.800
We just want to meet you.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.800
We just want to touch you.

22:22.800 --> 22:23.800
What's your name?

22:23.800 --> 22:24.800
Matt.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.800
Hey, Matt.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.800
Hi.

22:26.800 --> 22:27.800
Hey, Dan.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.800
It's not a firm rhyme.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.800
No, it's good enough, man.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.800
I thought it would kind of shoehorn there.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.800
A little bit in there.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.800
Thanks.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.800
That's what rap is all about.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.800
Rhyming shit that you didn't know rhymed.

22:38.800 --> 22:39.800
That's what makes Eminem a genius.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.800
You said Gary Busy.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.800
People would know.

22:43.800 --> 22:44.800
Right.

22:44.800 --> 22:50.800
If I said I fucked your mama's titties, I fucked your pussy, I made her ask crazy like her name was Gary Busy.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.800
People would be impressed by that.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.800
They would have bought a t-shirt.

22:55.800 --> 22:56.800
I think you get a t-shirt.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.800
Give them a t-shirt for Gary Busy.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.800
Thank you.

23:02.800 --> 23:03.800
Matt.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.800
Matt, what's your fondest ambition?

23:07.800 --> 23:11.800
What can we somehow give to you in the form of even just fantasy?

23:11.800 --> 23:14.800
Oh, dear God.

23:14.800 --> 23:21.800
I think that if Tori Amos got her old face back.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.800
Oh, no, she'd been doing plastic surgery?

23:23.800 --> 23:24.800
Yeah.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.800
Oh, no, I was in love with Tori Amos.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.800
Yeah, you could probably imagine.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.800
Maybe even.

23:29.800 --> 23:30.800
Yeah.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.800
So now you know I was too.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.800
Oh.

23:32.800 --> 23:33.800
I hate to admit it.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
Sorry.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.800
She just kind of destroyed her looks now?

23:36.800 --> 23:37.800
Yeah.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.800
Well, if you do the before and after, she has this very elfin.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.800
She had the dimples.

23:42.800 --> 23:48.800
The dimples are gone.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.800
It's very bad.

23:49.800 --> 23:50.800
That's a bummer.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.800
I'm sorry.

23:51.800 --> 23:57.800
Well, I mean, I guess I could give that to you in the form of like a smartly improvised

23:57.800 --> 23:58.800
scene.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.800
Okay.

23:59.800 --> 24:00.800
All right.

24:00.800 --> 24:01.800
And there's nothing else.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.800
Can we add to that?

24:02.800 --> 24:03.800
Oh, you go ahead.

24:03.800 --> 24:04.800
Just read it.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.800
No, but I mean like, well, okay, I'm hearing the word pickle.

24:07.800 --> 24:11.800
No, I meant like anything else like that you that you want.

24:11.800 --> 24:17.800
Well, what happens in the 13th episode after Giorgio Morozo helped save the earth?

24:17.800 --> 24:21.800
Who?

24:21.800 --> 24:25.800
Oh, yeah, it's my smooth music.

24:25.800 --> 24:26.800
I have no idea what you're talking about.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.800
That's a yacht rock.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.800
Holy fuck.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.800
Wow.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
Yacht rock.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.800
But you're asking, is it a trivia question or is it an ending that you don't know?

24:33.800 --> 24:35.800
Will there ever be another episode?

24:35.800 --> 24:36.800
Oh, yeah.

24:36.800 --> 24:37.800
I don't know.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.800
That JD Rizner would have to know that.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.800
I mean, I'm just a guy.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.800
I just played.

24:41.800 --> 24:42.800
What's his name?

24:42.800 --> 24:43.800
You don't even know.

24:43.800 --> 24:44.800
I can't remember his name.

24:44.800 --> 24:45.800
Ted Templeman.

24:45.800 --> 24:46.800
Yeah.

24:46.800 --> 24:47.800
Yeah.

24:47.800 --> 24:48.800
Same episode.

24:48.800 --> 24:49.800
Same episode.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.800
Well, I want Gary Busey to be in the next Star Wars.

24:53.800 --> 24:54.800
All right.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.800
Done.

24:55.800 --> 24:56.800
All right.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.800
All right.

24:57.800 --> 24:58.800
Gary Busey is in the next Star Wars.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.800
And Tori Eames gets her face fixed.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.800
Thank you, Matt.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.800
It's all possible.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.800
Absolutely.

25:02.800 --> 25:03.800
Let's hear it for Matt.

25:03.800 --> 25:04.800
Matt, everybody.

25:04.800 --> 25:05.800
Thank you.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.800
Done.

25:06.800 --> 25:13.800
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

25:13.800 --> 25:14.800
dun.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.800
It is a dark time for the rebellion.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.800
Gary Busey is in Star Wars.

25:21.800 --> 25:32.800
And Tori Eames is on Planet Boogaflap looking at her face.

25:32.800 --> 25:51.800
I want it to be pretty.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.800
Subtitles.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.800
Would you like a better looking face?

25:54.800 --> 25:55.800
Generatory?

25:55.800 --> 26:02.800
Generatory?

26:02.800 --> 26:05.800
Yes, I would.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.800
From outside.

26:06.800 --> 26:11.800
The door blasts open.

26:11.800 --> 26:17.800
Copyright infringement.

26:17.800 --> 26:22.300
Winch comes out of her face and goes up to a rafter.

26:22.300 --> 26:27.800
She goes up to a thing on the roof and there's a clinic and she gets a better face.

26:27.800 --> 26:33.800
Part of good improv is knowing when to throw in the towel.

26:33.800 --> 26:34.800
No, that's the end.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.600
You were back to the DVD menu there.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.600
That's why he was...

26:37.600 --> 26:38.800
Let's go to special features.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.800
Yeah, deleted Gary Busey scenes.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.200
Special features deleted Gary Busey scenes.

26:45.200 --> 26:51.800
Feature in Gary Busey talking behind the scenes, but it's been a very interesting experience.

26:51.800 --> 26:57.800
Star Wars is not a movie.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.800
It's a state of mind.

27:00.800 --> 27:06.800
And it's merged with what I've done to create a shamanic experience.

27:06.800 --> 27:07.800
Subtitles.

27:07.800 --> 27:08.800
Star Wars is not a movie.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.800
It's a state of mind to create a sort of shamanic experience.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.800
All right.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.800
Well, I hope Matt got what he wanted.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.800
I think the audience got what they wanted.

27:18.800 --> 27:25.800
A deleted scene where Gary Busey faces down with, I guess, Darth Vader.

27:25.800 --> 27:26.800
He faces down?

27:26.800 --> 27:28.800
Yeah, he faces down.

27:28.800 --> 27:29.800
What does that mean?

27:29.800 --> 27:32.800
I was trying to say faces off and I got a little drunk.

27:32.800 --> 27:33.800
Okay.

27:33.800 --> 27:34.800
No, no, no.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.800
This is a rare...it's a space down.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.800
Surrender your life server, Darth Vader.

27:41.800 --> 27:48.800
There's something you need to do to understand the way lore works.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.800
You're fucked up.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.800
You know, that's a very interesting phrase people use when they're speaking to me.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.800
It's fucked up.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.800
It makes me wonder why all the other worlds are fucked up.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.800
Oh, safety and polarity.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.800
It's more sort of worn a helmet.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.800
I do.

28:08.800 --> 28:14.800
All right, deleted scene, but Star Wars is Gary Busey.

28:14.800 --> 28:18.800
You guys didn't know you were going to come in here and get fucking high octane,

28:18.800 --> 28:20.800
whose line is it anyway, style improv up here?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.800
I like to sprinkle a little in.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.800
You're a quadruple threat.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
I don't mind.

28:25.800 --> 28:29.800
You got improv, rapping, sports knowledge.

28:29.800 --> 28:37.800
I don't mind springing a little in, like a little mainstream, like a really, really tight, awesome comedy like that into the show.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.800
Spencer was not used enough in that.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.800
We missed user resource there.

28:42.800 --> 28:46.800
Spencer, what does it sound like when...

28:46.800 --> 28:47.800
Shit.

28:47.800 --> 28:48.800
Is this doing the thing?

28:48.800 --> 28:49.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:49.800 --> 28:50.800
We found a thing that Spencer can do.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.800
He can kind of freestyle, dungeon master any kind of monster attacking you.

28:53.800 --> 28:59.800
So you can make up a monster and he instantly goes into the character description of that monster.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.800
Spencer, a...

29:02.800 --> 29:03.800
Gary Busey.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.800
Gary Busey.

29:05.800 --> 29:09.800
A guy that I don't recognize walks into the room.

29:09.800 --> 29:14.800
He says he's from things, but you're not entirely sure.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.800
He might just be one of L.A.'s crazy people.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.800
Sorry, I don't watch movies.

29:19.800 --> 29:20.800
He doesn't know who Gary Busey is.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.800
That's right.

29:21.800 --> 29:22.800
I mean, I know who he is.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.800
He's a guy who's famous for, like, acting.

29:24.800 --> 29:25.800
Yeah.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.800
But, like, that describes many, many people.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.800
He was in point break.

29:28.800 --> 29:29.800
Do you ever see that?

29:29.800 --> 29:30.800
What?

29:30.800 --> 29:33.800
That was a good Keanu impression, actually.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.800
No!

29:35.800 --> 29:36.800
You don't see things.

29:36.800 --> 29:37.800
You don't watch any movies?

29:37.800 --> 29:39.800
I don't watch most movies.

29:39.800 --> 29:44.800
If someone says, do you want to watch a movie, I'll say, nope.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.800
That's a good policy.

29:45.800 --> 29:49.800
It's kept your brain free for, like, every injury in the monster manual.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.800
Yeah, all the other, you know, useless factoid information.

29:52.800 --> 29:53.800
You know what an owlbear is.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.800
You know an owlbear's armor class.

29:56.800 --> 30:00.800
No, that's 16.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.800
That might not be right.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.800
You don't know.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.800
In my day, armor class was negative numbers.

30:07.800 --> 30:08.800
Yeah, yeah.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.800
It was, uh, Thacko was a thing.

30:10.800 --> 30:11.800
Yeah.

30:11.800 --> 30:12.800
Good times.

30:12.800 --> 30:13.800
To hit armor class zero, yeah.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.800
Yeah, it used to actually be hard.

30:16.800 --> 30:17.800
Spencer.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.800
Just name a not movie reference or something.

30:20.800 --> 30:21.800
All right.

30:21.800 --> 30:22.800
All right.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.800
A divorced employee of a craft store.

30:25.800 --> 30:26.800
A craft store.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.800
That's the monster.

30:27.800 --> 30:28.800
That's attacking.

30:28.800 --> 30:33.800
You hear the steps and jangles of someone with made too many items in his apron.

30:33.800 --> 30:40.800
You smell the whiskey before you see him, but rounding the corner is a drunken craft employee.

30:40.800 --> 30:46.800
He's holding handfuls of paper stickers that no doubt cost 20 times more what you'd pay for them.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.800
All right.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.800
Divorced craft store employee.

30:52.800 --> 30:56.800
That was a hard one.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.800
He started drinking after the divorce.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.800
Uh, how about Spencer?

31:02.800 --> 31:05.800
Dan Harmon waking up on the tour bus.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.800
How about that one?

31:07.800 --> 31:12.800
The door creaks open and you can hear several people running for cover.

31:12.800 --> 31:20.800
You hear the of the sliding privacy curtain and then a thump as a large figure rolls out of bed onto the floor.

31:20.800 --> 31:28.800
Standing at full height, he arranges himself before scratching his belly and moving to the next room.

31:28.800 --> 31:33.800
That's all, that's all.

31:33.800 --> 31:39.800
We got to bring up the guy that is dressed as my wizard character.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.800
There's a Dan Harmon Gandalf thing going on here.

31:43.800 --> 31:44.800
What is your name?

31:44.800 --> 31:45.800
Cayman.

31:45.800 --> 31:49.800
Well, come on stage.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.800
Cayman, for the people listening, he's wearing a blue bathrobe.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.800
He has a, is it a sceptre or a walking stick?

31:56.800 --> 31:57.800
What do you got there?

31:57.800 --> 31:58.800
What do you call those?

31:58.800 --> 31:59.800
Wizard staff.

31:59.800 --> 32:00.800
There you go.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.800
With the Kettle One, a light up Kettle One.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.800
For Ray of Frost.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.800
He has a light up blue Kettle One bottle on top of his staff.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.800
And he's got a, is that a prop or are you really drinking Kettle One tonight?

32:12.800 --> 32:17.800
I figured if I'm going to be dressing up like you, I should lark and drink vodka as well.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.800
Lark and.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.800
Lark it up.

32:21.800 --> 32:22.800
Live action role playing.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.800
That's kind of what this podcast has become, Jeff, as like working our relationship troubles out on stage,

32:26.800 --> 32:31.800
bringing people up, talking in real time to the people we are larking.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.800
Harmontown is larking.

32:33.800 --> 32:34.800
Now did you, do you live alone?

32:34.800 --> 32:35.800
Do you have roommates or a girlfriend?

32:35.800 --> 32:39.800
No, I live alone and I was actually supposed to come with the girl, but she canceled on me.

32:39.800 --> 32:40.800
So.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.800
Would she have got?

32:41.800 --> 32:45.800
Well, I see the irony in that statement too.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.800
Would she have understood what the purpose of all this was?

32:48.800 --> 32:52.800
No, she was completely, she had no idea what Harmontown was.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.800
Is that why she didn't come, do you think, possibly?

32:54.800 --> 32:56.800
Well, she said she was sick, so.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.800
All right.

32:57.800 --> 32:58.800
Okay.

32:58.800 --> 32:59.800
All right.

32:59.800 --> 33:00.800
What's her name?

33:00.800 --> 33:01.800
Grace, I believe.

33:01.800 --> 33:02.800
Fuck you, Grace.

33:02.800 --> 33:03.800
No.

33:03.800 --> 33:04.800
Yeah, more like clumsy.

33:04.800 --> 33:05.800
Yeah.

33:05.800 --> 33:06.800
Yeah.

33:06.800 --> 33:12.800
Two days minimum, notice.

33:12.800 --> 33:13.800
Grace.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.800
How ironic.

33:15.800 --> 33:22.800
I'm going to name you Grace, so you're out in the world and trip over people's feelings.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.800
Go, go, go, be a bull in a china shop, Grace.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.800
She sounds like an awful person.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.800
Maybe she's having a Grace period.

33:32.800 --> 33:38.800
She's been thriving on the part of the universe for, how old is she?

33:38.800 --> 33:39.800
I don't actually know.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.800
23 years.

33:41.800 --> 33:48.800
And tonight, the irony is that if she had come here, she would have avoided that blimp

33:48.800 --> 33:49.800
accident.

33:49.800 --> 33:54.800
Did you just curse Grace with a blimp accident?

33:54.800 --> 33:59.800
Sam, that's how, you know, timelines work and shit, sliding doors, stuff.

33:59.800 --> 34:04.800
If she would, if she, you guys Facebooked each other, you were like, okay, one last

34:04.800 --> 34:08.800
ritual before we meet at the comedy attic, let's each send each other photos of what

34:08.800 --> 34:12.800
we're wearing to make sure that we don't wear the same thing.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.800
And then she's sick all of a sudden.

34:14.800 --> 34:20.800
Ironically, though, this is the only periwinkle blue robe I could find was a woman's robe.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.800
Is that, that's periwinkle, huh?

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
Well, actually, I don't know.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.800
Periwinkle's a hard color to find.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.800
It's powder blue, right?

34:28.800 --> 34:31.800
It's blue.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.800
All exclusively female voices are calling out.

34:34.800 --> 34:39.800
The room became a vocal swatch catalog for a second.

34:39.800 --> 34:47.800
Robin's eggs, aquafoam, sing-sang, a lot of nurseries going up this part of town this

34:47.800 --> 34:50.800
weekend.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.800
I kind of, yeah, I would just say blue.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.800
And I see navy blue as black.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.800
Is that a kind of color blindness?

34:57.800 --> 35:00.800
No, I'm just certain light, because you normally hang out in dark environments.

35:00.800 --> 35:01.800
It's true.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.800
Like, I wore a navy blue suit, you'd think it was black.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.800
Yeah, that's black, right?

35:06.800 --> 35:07.800
No.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.800
This is charcoal.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.800
This is tangerine.

35:12.800 --> 35:17.800
I mean, charcoal, that charcoal's different from black, but charcoal's totally black.

35:17.800 --> 35:18.800
Charcoal?

35:18.800 --> 35:21.800
No, it's smokeier.

35:21.800 --> 35:22.800
It's dumb.

35:22.800 --> 35:27.800
It seems like a dumb thing to spend your brain on, I, I, I, I, artists.

35:27.800 --> 35:28.800
What do you have on?

35:28.800 --> 35:30.800
Kind of a pumpkin, a rust, tortoises?

35:30.800 --> 35:31.800
Red.

35:31.800 --> 35:32.800
Red.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.800
It's not red.

35:33.800 --> 35:34.800
Red and brown.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.800
No, because yours is oranges, right?

35:36.800 --> 35:37.800
Mine's more red.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.800
Red.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.800
I'd say his has a bit more orange in mine, but it's still pretty red.

35:42.800 --> 35:43.800
Yeah.

35:43.800 --> 35:49.800
Ears is made out of multiple different colors of material, woven together.

35:49.800 --> 35:50.800
It's dumb.

35:50.800 --> 35:51.800
Colors are dumb.

35:51.800 --> 35:52.800
Fuck them.

35:52.800 --> 36:07.800
Colors, sports, most, most bands, horoscopes, other people, magic, Harry Potter.

36:07.800 --> 36:14.800
Yeah, I knew, I didn't, I didn't come here to win a popularity contest.

36:14.800 --> 36:18.800
I mean, I saw that, that, that last Harry Potter movie is playing in the hotel room.

36:18.800 --> 36:19.800
You don't mind hanging out here.

36:19.800 --> 36:20.800
No, I don't.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.800
Okay, good.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.800
Yeah, that last Harry Potter movie is playing in the hotel rooms right now.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.800
It's kind of in rotation.

36:26.800 --> 36:31.800
I, I can't, there's like, I made a joke, like put on the Harry Potter movie to Erin.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.800
And she's like, oh, I can't believe it's on.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.800
It's like, there's 900 of them.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.800
And, and, and they're all the same.

36:37.800 --> 36:41.800
That's definitely, definitely shadows part, part seven or whatever.

36:41.800 --> 36:48.800
And like, they sure know how to make a war between wizards look a lot like standing around.

36:48.800 --> 36:54.800
I don't know what, what contrivance you have to engage in before you get to this point in,

36:54.800 --> 36:57.800
in where there's a bunch of wizards fighting a bunch of other wizards.

36:57.800 --> 37:01.800
But I would think at that point, even a six year old could make it exciting, you know, like,

37:01.800 --> 37:03.800
there's two armies of wizards.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.800
Now, at least for this part, we could get a little interesting.

37:06.800 --> 37:10.800
And I did see a couple of giant spiders, but they were really buried in the background.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.800
Dumb, dumb movies.

37:11.800 --> 37:16.800
Spencer, so much, so much, the movie keeps, keeps, keeps jabbing you in the ribs and going,

37:16.800 --> 37:19.800
huh, how about that book, huh?

37:19.800 --> 37:20.800
Fuck you.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.800
I don't, I didn't read the book.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.800
I could wait it for the movie.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.800
I'm not a bad person.

37:26.800 --> 37:27.800
I don't care.

37:27.800 --> 37:28.800
It reminds you of the book.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.800
It's stupid.

37:29.800 --> 37:32.800
I read the book then, if you like it so much.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.800
Iris Jerry Seinfeld, what are you doing here?

37:35.800 --> 37:39.800
It's like, are you going to occupy us or aren't you?

37:39.800 --> 37:44.800
How many cars do we have to blow up?

37:44.800 --> 37:46.800
Cease fire.

37:46.800 --> 37:50.800
We're like an incessant fire.

37:50.800 --> 37:58.800
Anyways, it's called rugby, but there's grass everywhere.

37:58.800 --> 38:03.800
Why not call it grassy?

38:03.800 --> 38:10.800
Iris Jerry Seinfeld, everybody.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.800
I like that you decided that it was over, too.

38:13.800 --> 38:14.800
You could top that one?

38:14.800 --> 38:16.800
You were going to top grassy?

38:16.800 --> 38:18.800
No, I was going to try.

38:18.800 --> 38:19.800
Oh, do it.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.800
Fuck it.

38:20.800 --> 38:21.800
Let's do it.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.800
No, no, no.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.800
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to stage, Iris Jerry Seinfeld.

38:25.800 --> 38:29.800
Oh, hello.

38:29.800 --> 38:33.800
Some things just don't make any sense when you look around and observe them through your

38:33.800 --> 38:35.800
Irish eyes.

38:35.800 --> 38:39.800
You know, why are horseshoes lucky?

38:39.800 --> 38:43.800
The worst case scenario is they fall on your head.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.800
The best case is they just sit there.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.800
How is that lucky?

38:47.800 --> 38:49.800
It's not lucky for the horse.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.800
You think they like getting those put on them?

38:51.800 --> 38:52.800
It probably hurts.

38:52.800 --> 38:58.800
Fuck you guys.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.800
Glenn Levitt.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.800
Glenn, oh, that's Scottish.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.800
What's the difference between Irish and Scottish?

39:05.800 --> 39:06.800
You ever wonder?

39:06.800 --> 39:08.800
It all comes down to the skirts.

39:08.800 --> 39:14.800
It's like, you know, I'm Irish Jerry Seinfeld.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.800
Potato famine.

39:17.800 --> 39:18.800
I mean, what?

39:18.800 --> 39:21.800
So what if the potatoes ran out and have a hot dog?

39:21.800 --> 39:23.800
It's stupid.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.800
It's just a dumb...

39:25.800 --> 39:30.800
That's more offensive to Jerry Seinfeld than to Irish people.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.800
Well, he's had years to write stuff down.

39:33.800 --> 39:34.800
Clayman?

39:34.800 --> 39:35.800
Cayman.

39:35.800 --> 39:36.800
Cayman.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.800
That should be Clayman.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.800
Bill Clayman.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.800
That's my Alan Rickman.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.800
Oh.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.800
Oh, sir, are you Professor Sneep now?

39:45.800 --> 39:47.800
No, no, that's from Die Hard.

39:47.800 --> 39:48.800
Oh.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.800
When Bruce Willis asked him, which...

39:50.800 --> 39:52.800
I never get your name.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.800
And then Bruce Willis is looking at the sign behind him,

39:55.800 --> 40:00.800
and then Alan Rickman, without looking at the sign, says,

40:00.800 --> 40:03.800
Clay, Bill Clay.

40:03.800 --> 40:08.800
And then they engage in this beautiful dance between hero and villain.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.800
But they show Clay W, right?

40:10.800 --> 40:13.800
So they might be William, so he puts an extra little thing in there.

40:13.800 --> 40:16.800
Yeah, a little fucking reality spin, because he's done his work,

40:16.800 --> 40:19.800
and it's like the hero and the villain are doing this ballet,

40:19.800 --> 40:23.800
and Bruce Willis starts to walk away,

40:23.800 --> 40:26.800
and Alan Rickman goes,

40:26.800 --> 40:28.800
The what?

40:28.800 --> 40:30.800
The what, the huh?

40:30.800 --> 40:32.800
No, no, no, that's shoot the glass, that's later.

40:32.800 --> 40:36.800
And then he points the gun at him, and Bruce Willis goes,

40:36.800 --> 40:39.800
It's a hell of an accent, Hans.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.800
You could be in Hollywood with that accent.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.800
And then he tries to shoot him, like he did with Takagi.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.800
Click, oh, what do you think, I'm a fucking idiot?

40:46.800 --> 40:50.800
He takes the gun, it's amazing. It's a great movie, you should rent it.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.800
Bill Clay.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.800
Cameron, have you seen Die Hard?

40:53.800 --> 40:54.800
Die Hard.

40:54.800 --> 40:55.800
Yeah, many times.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.800
Die Hard, not in the Criterion collection of films.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.800
Dan, do you consider it a Christmas movie?

40:59.800 --> 41:01.800
Yeah, yeah, I think it's a great Christmas movie.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.800
But I also think it's a great, great movie, plain and simple.

41:04.800 --> 41:08.800
Not such a great movie, Armageddon, in the Criterion collection.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.800
Armageddon's in the Criterion collection?

41:10.800 --> 41:11.800
Yeah.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.800
Yup.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.800
Yup.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.800
Fucking weird.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.800
The Rock, also in the Criterion collection.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.800
Now I'm starting to, yeah, there's some kind of,

41:22.800 --> 41:27.800
something, some paola going on here.

41:27.800 --> 41:31.800
More like Casterion.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.800
There's some kind of, something happening here, right?

41:33.800 --> 41:35.800
Cayman.

41:35.800 --> 41:36.800
Indeed.

41:36.800 --> 41:37.800
Cayman, what do you do?

41:37.800 --> 41:38.800
I'm a scientist, actually.

41:38.800 --> 41:39.800
For real?

41:39.800 --> 41:40.800
Yeah.

41:40.800 --> 41:41.800
In what field?

41:41.800 --> 41:43.800
Kind of a combination of fields.

41:43.800 --> 41:49.800
I study planets around other stars and what they need to be able to support life.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.800
So is that planetary, geologist?

41:51.800 --> 41:53.800
It's like a combination of geology and astronomy.

41:53.800 --> 41:54.800
Really? How cool.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.800
Yeah.

41:55.800 --> 41:56.800
That's fascinating.

41:56.800 --> 42:00.800
So you look for like, planets that might be like Earth-like planets that could sustain

42:00.800 --> 42:02.800
life based on their proximity to their star?

42:02.800 --> 42:03.800
Yeah.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.800
And what they're made of and all sorts of other things.

42:05.800 --> 42:08.800
And we're finding these new planets all the time now, right?

42:08.800 --> 42:09.800
We're finding like a hundred.

42:09.800 --> 42:10.800
Yeah.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.800
We've got like over 750 confirmed ones.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.800
That are confirmed possible Earth type?

42:15.800 --> 42:16.800
No.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.800
Earth-like, we're actually having a very hard time finding them.

42:19.800 --> 42:20.800
What are the 750?

42:20.800 --> 42:21.800
750 what?

42:21.800 --> 42:25.800
Do you mean just planets, whether they're the size of Jupiter or bigger than Earth?

42:25.800 --> 42:26.800
Just planets.

42:26.800 --> 42:27.800
Oh.

42:27.800 --> 42:28.800
I thought we'd confirmed.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.800
I thought we're finding planets by the thousands and thousands.

42:30.800 --> 42:31.800
Right.

42:31.800 --> 42:32.800
But we haven't confirmed them yet.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.800
How does a planet get hit with a BB gun?

42:35.800 --> 42:36.800
Right.

42:36.800 --> 42:37.800
Yeah.

42:37.800 --> 42:38.800
Takes forever.

42:38.800 --> 42:39.800
Yeah.

42:39.800 --> 42:45.800
They have two little flags hanging from their hips and you've got to pull one off.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.800
How do you confirm it?

42:47.800 --> 42:50.800
Well, you just go back and look with another nerd telescope.

42:50.800 --> 42:53.800
Oh, so it's like, check if your answer is right.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.800
It could be a smudge on one guy's telescope.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.800
Those Swedish fuckers, okay.

42:57.800 --> 42:58.800
What telescope do you guys use?

42:58.800 --> 43:00.800
I don't actually use a telescope.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.800
So I steal other people's data.

43:03.800 --> 43:04.800
Badass.

43:04.800 --> 43:05.800
What is your task?

43:05.800 --> 43:06.800
What's your role in all this?

43:06.800 --> 43:13.800
So I look more at the chemistry end and say if you've got this much oxygen and this much

43:13.800 --> 43:16.800
other stuff, can you make a planet that is habitable?

43:16.800 --> 43:17.800
Right.

43:17.800 --> 43:22.800
And there's nothing in the near or just the universe that you think could sustain life?

43:22.800 --> 43:23.800
Oh, I think.

43:23.800 --> 43:24.800
Possibly.

43:24.800 --> 43:25.800
Yeah.

43:25.800 --> 43:28.800
I would say it would be weird if Earth was the only one.

43:28.800 --> 43:29.800
Oh, certainly.

43:29.800 --> 43:30.800
Yeah.

43:30.800 --> 43:33.800
But like even on our own solar system, like there's like Enceladus or there's some moons

43:33.800 --> 43:34.800
of, you know, like that.

43:34.800 --> 43:35.800
Yeah.

43:35.800 --> 43:38.680
They think that we know there's liquid water there and there's more extreme environments

43:38.680 --> 43:41.160
on Earth where life does exist or at least did.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.800
So it'd be logical to think it's possible there, right?

43:43.800 --> 43:44.800
Right.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.800
And my research is saying what does it take to get to that point of making it possible?

43:47.800 --> 43:48.800
Uh-huh.

43:48.800 --> 43:55.360
Because your expertise probably stops somewhere short of my next question, which is on these

43:55.360 --> 44:01.520
planets that are capable of, they have kind of an Earth-approximate environment and then

44:01.520 --> 44:10.320
carbon-based life springs up on them, how kind of inevitable is sentience or is that

44:10.320 --> 44:15.200
like a weird flash in the pan too that it would be like, that's a really dumb question.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.720
So it's definitely a more of a biology question.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.720
But um...

44:18.720 --> 44:19.720
I said so.

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
What?

44:20.720 --> 44:21.720
But uh...

44:21.720 --> 44:22.720
I'm a scientist too.

44:22.720 --> 44:23.720
Yeah.

44:23.720 --> 44:24.720
But uh...

44:24.720 --> 44:25.720
Oh.

44:25.720 --> 44:30.720
Dan, I thought you had a biology degree.

44:30.720 --> 44:34.840
No, not a degree, no.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.320
So we don't know.

44:36.320 --> 44:40.840
But there's this really cool thing called the Drake equation, which is sort of a calculation

44:40.840 --> 44:44.680
of how likely would sentient life be in and one of the parameters is what are the chances

44:44.680 --> 44:46.960
of sentience and we don't know.

44:46.960 --> 44:47.960
Yeah.

44:47.960 --> 44:48.960
So that's a cool question.

44:48.960 --> 44:49.960
I mean it's kind of...

44:49.960 --> 44:54.160
Because it's like, we think with our sentience that it's inevitable.

44:54.160 --> 45:00.520
Even if you're not a religious person, because I tend to think with the atheist part of

45:00.520 --> 45:05.720
my brain even that, oh of course a planet that lives and breathes and that has life

45:05.720 --> 45:06.920
crap up on it.

45:06.920 --> 45:13.280
Of course the final goal is the biological weapon known as a giant brain.

45:13.280 --> 45:17.240
You just realize you're talking to a guy in a bathrobe on a stage.

45:17.240 --> 45:19.240
So who's the crazy one?

45:19.240 --> 45:24.640
You said you were a scientist, I can say anything I want, I have confidentiality, right?

45:24.640 --> 45:27.840
He might not be a scientist.

45:27.840 --> 45:31.000
Wait, he works at our hotel.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.800
Wait, that's my bro.

45:33.800 --> 45:37.960
He's wearing your shoes.

45:37.960 --> 45:41.640
We haven't really had like a stalker yet on the tour.

45:41.640 --> 45:42.640
No.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.640
He did.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.640
Well I mean...

45:44.640 --> 45:46.680
I drove pretty far to get here, so it's kind of hard to...

45:46.680 --> 45:47.680
I guess that's stalking.

45:47.680 --> 45:48.680
Yeah, that's the thing.

45:48.680 --> 45:52.360
It's like people drive, like I talk to everybody after the show and that's willing to stick

45:52.360 --> 46:01.760
around that long and as long as they have some kind of flu on their hands.

46:01.760 --> 46:02.760
That's red.

46:02.760 --> 46:06.240
One of your girlfriend's red hairs have been hanging off your chin like some sort of weird

46:06.240 --> 46:07.240
tinder there.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.240
Oh really?

46:08.240 --> 46:09.240
Was that really distracting all that time?

46:09.240 --> 46:14.920
I'm sorry, look at this, it won't...

46:14.920 --> 46:19.680
Just say something next time, not that this will happen again a lot, but just say something.

46:19.680 --> 46:21.680
If I'd have said something you would have fumbled with it, you never would have got

46:21.680 --> 46:22.680
it out of it.

46:22.680 --> 46:25.560
I'm telling you even then, they're the ones that were dealing with it.

46:25.560 --> 46:29.480
The applause that occurred when you did that makes me feel really bad, makes me feel like

46:29.480 --> 46:31.120
you zipped up my fly.

46:31.120 --> 46:34.680
Well I think from my vantage point, because I'm stage left of you and the hair, I think

46:34.680 --> 46:37.480
was stage right, and it was kind of falling little by little.

46:37.480 --> 46:41.680
I was just like, one of the hairs of your beard was growing, and it was like something

46:41.680 --> 46:42.680
fucking weird going on.

46:42.680 --> 46:47.240
You were talking to somebody and they just got the slightest white fleck on their lip,

46:47.240 --> 46:49.840
and it's such a bummer because you don't want to...

46:49.840 --> 46:55.480
Right now, everyone went, it's not their fault, it's not your fault, it's not your responsibility,

46:55.480 --> 46:56.480
it's not theirs.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.320
You don't know what to do, they're talking and they have a fleck of foam on their lip,

46:59.320 --> 47:06.400
and it's just, yeah, I don't know, there was a guy in Amsterdam that was telling us

47:06.400 --> 47:11.200
about windmills, and he wasn't speaking in English, he was speaking in whatever they

47:11.200 --> 47:16.920
speak there, windmill talk, and he was just talking and he was all excited about windmills

47:16.920 --> 47:21.360
and how they mill things using the wind power, and just this little bubble of spit came out

47:21.360 --> 47:27.240
and just rolled over his lip and it was just there, and I was just, I don't speak a sweet

47:27.240 --> 47:32.800
mark or whatever, they're talking anyway, so I was just focused on this thing and his

47:32.800 --> 47:36.480
lip and that just popped in my head when you pull, I didn't want them to be subjected to

47:36.480 --> 47:40.760
that, if there's a hair, anything, it could be a piece of egg on your forehead.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.440
We need rules for that stuff.

47:42.440 --> 47:46.320
Or just maybe a friend comes up and takes it off and gets a big laugh out of it.

47:46.320 --> 47:50.920
But you can't always do that, sometimes you're talking to a guy about windmills, and sometimes

47:50.920 --> 47:51.920
who cares?

47:51.920 --> 47:57.440
I ate in a restaurant on that same vacation, I was in London, had Christmas dinner with

47:57.440 --> 48:01.120
Rob Schrab and his wife Kate Freund and my girlfriend Erin, having a little couple's

48:01.120 --> 48:06.120
Christmas vacation in Europe because we're fancy, and we were in this restaurant in London

48:06.120 --> 48:11.880
and a little bit of a tumult at the entrance and people file in and then this wheelchair

48:11.880 --> 48:13.880
comes in, Stephen Hawking.

48:13.880 --> 48:14.880
Wow.

48:14.880 --> 48:18.240
Yeah, he ate like nine feet from me.

48:18.240 --> 48:23.200
Everybody was trying to take pictures of him, I didn't want to be like a fly on a turd.

48:23.200 --> 48:26.920
You can't really walk up and go, excuse me, can I have a word with Mr. Hawking?

48:26.920 --> 48:32.880
Mr. Schraub kept saying, he kept going, go tell him you created community.

48:32.880 --> 48:39.480
He was on the Simpsons, 40% chance he might have, first of all, thank you, Rob.

48:39.480 --> 48:44.560
But second of all, it doesn't, I know, I think also like if you were, like, if I were Stephen

48:44.560 --> 48:49.560
Hawking and a guy came over and said like, if you came over, you're a scientist, I think.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.240
I am, yeah.

48:51.240 --> 48:56.040
Then I would be, like, then I would feel okay going up to him, so like, I kind of understand

48:56.040 --> 49:01.600
some of the things you talk about and why you are famous.

49:01.600 --> 49:06.160
And I teach a class or something, if I had a photo on my wall of me posing with you,

49:06.160 --> 49:11.560
that would be cool, like, and then he'd be like, yeah, it's okay.

49:11.560 --> 49:17.440
But like regular people coming up to him and going like, hey, wheelchair guy, like, I know

49:17.440 --> 49:23.040
you invented black holes, but like, you don't really, I don't understand anything he does.

49:23.040 --> 49:28.320
I don't understand why he's, you know, I can't, I feel like I'm not allowed to take a picture

49:28.320 --> 49:34.680
of him, especially because he's in a wheelchair.

49:34.680 --> 49:39.480
If you were just a nice, like, ambulatory dude having dinner, would you have felt comfortable

49:39.480 --> 49:40.480
walking up to him then?

49:40.480 --> 49:41.480
I'm not sure.

49:41.480 --> 49:45.280
That's a really interesting question, because part of what makes, part of Stephen Hawking's

49:45.280 --> 49:48.520
charisma is like, oh, God, he's all brain.

49:48.520 --> 49:53.280
We're all thinking it, like, that it's amazing that it's like this cool poetic thing.

49:53.280 --> 49:58.240
Like, oh, man, God took, like, took all this body power and put it into his head, like

49:58.240 --> 50:04.280
a, like a little, little balloon, like put all the air into one section of it and, you

50:04.280 --> 50:05.280
know, meat.

50:05.280 --> 50:09.040
I heard something that, I heard something that like he, he keeps being found with like

50:09.040 --> 50:12.640
bruises on his body and like, like, and he keeps saying like, oh, my, I fell out of my

50:12.640 --> 50:13.640
chair.

50:13.640 --> 50:17.760
But like, the injuries aren't consistent with somebody falling out of a chair and they

50:17.760 --> 50:21.960
think that it may be like kind of SNM kind of stuff, like he, he's having, has anybody

50:21.960 --> 50:22.960
heard that?

50:22.960 --> 50:23.960
I heard that.

50:23.960 --> 50:24.960
Yeah.

50:24.960 --> 50:29.400
It's like, yeah, it's like, like, if you, if your body is very limited in its movement

50:29.400 --> 50:33.400
and probably limited in its sensation, like sex might involve just like a broom handle

50:33.400 --> 50:39.040
just fucking whack, you know, like, like, and also fucking, if anyone deserves it, it's

50:39.040 --> 50:40.040
him.

50:40.040 --> 50:41.040
Yeah.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.040
He's like, like.

50:42.040 --> 50:43.040
Let him get his Jolly Rogers.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.040
Let him get his Jolly Rogers.

50:44.040 --> 50:50.000
Jolly Rogers has a gay pirate over here.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Why add Rogers?

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Like, is that an Indiana thing?

50:53.000 --> 50:58.320
We just, it's just Jolly's in Los Angeles.

50:58.320 --> 51:02.680
Uh, maybe we have more shit to do.

51:02.680 --> 51:03.680
Jolly Rogers.

51:03.680 --> 51:06.680
He's sucking me nuts.

51:06.680 --> 51:13.880
Why, why are pirates always getting their nuts sucked?

51:13.880 --> 51:18.880
Oh, I'm Jerry McSeinfeld.

51:18.880 --> 51:22.640
Why, why is it pieces of eight?

51:22.640 --> 51:24.720
Why not just take eight pieces?

51:24.720 --> 51:25.720
Nope.

51:25.720 --> 51:26.720
I can't.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.720
Hey, cast a wide net.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.720
I'm going to hit a couple.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.720
I'll get, I'll get another Graspy.

51:31.720 --> 51:34.360
Graspy was a goodie.

51:34.360 --> 51:35.360
That was a goodie.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.360
That was fucking good.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.360
It's so good.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.360
You didn't even get it until I said, I said, I said, why do they call it rugby?

51:39.360 --> 51:40.360
There's grass everywhere.

51:40.360 --> 51:41.360
And you went, whoa.

51:41.360 --> 51:44.360
And then I said, call it Graspy and you're like, whoa.

51:44.360 --> 51:48.120
Like, and I was like, yeah, I fucking, I got it.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.120
I got it.

51:49.120 --> 51:52.840
Well, I mean, I remembered it different.

51:52.840 --> 51:56.440
I felt like I, I felt like hitting the seven 10 split, like, like, it was kind of like

51:56.440 --> 51:58.080
I hit the thing and then you were like, what?

51:58.080 --> 51:59.920
And there was a delay and then the ball went in the thing.

51:59.920 --> 52:00.920
I'm mixing sports.

52:00.920 --> 52:01.920
Is this sports corner again?

52:01.920 --> 52:02.920
Yeah.

52:02.920 --> 52:03.920
All right.

52:03.920 --> 52:04.920
Breakdown.

52:04.920 --> 52:06.920
Rap in sports corner.

52:06.920 --> 52:13.520
Sports corner introduction or rap, you don't know.

52:13.520 --> 52:14.640
It's a Schrodinger's rap.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.800
Is it an intro or a regular rap?

52:16.800 --> 52:19.200
You don't know till the positrons collide with the megatrons.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.840
It's going to open the box.

52:20.840 --> 52:21.840
It's theoretical.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.280
Fuck your mama like her name was hypothetical.

52:24.280 --> 52:25.440
It's the same word, basically.

52:25.440 --> 52:30.760
Fuck your mom like her name was Pythagoras, a fuck your mom like she was a stegosaurus.

52:30.760 --> 52:33.920
Kind of, she's so scientific words, doesn't matter.

52:33.920 --> 52:34.920
Okay.

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
Thank you.

52:35.920 --> 52:36.920
Okay.

52:36.920 --> 52:37.920
Science rap.

52:37.920 --> 52:43.320
Schrodinger's rap.

52:43.320 --> 52:54.120
I won't question what you guys deem worthy of applause, but I just won't.

52:54.120 --> 52:56.120
But you disagree with that applause.

52:56.120 --> 53:00.520
Frankly, sirs and madams, I disagree with your applause there.

53:00.520 --> 53:04.840
I wouldn't let me get away that easy is what I'm saying.

53:04.840 --> 53:05.920
You paid top dollar.

53:05.920 --> 53:06.920
What were the tickets?

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
20 bucks?

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
Okay.

53:08.920 --> 53:09.920
That's pretty good.

53:09.920 --> 53:10.920
Who drove that?

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
What?

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
100.

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
Oh, you're joking.

53:13.920 --> 53:14.920
Some girl said, what?

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
I paid 100.

53:15.920 --> 53:19.400
And it was worth it, right?

53:19.400 --> 53:20.640
Who drove the furthest?

53:20.640 --> 53:22.120
Sometimes that's an embarrassing thing to answer.

53:22.120 --> 53:23.120
Some people are proud of it.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.120
Some people are ashamed.

53:24.120 --> 53:27.000
I've talked to people who drove six hours to gigs and stuff.

53:27.000 --> 53:34.480
We got Louisville, Cincinnati, Columbus, and those are like how far away, I mean, four

53:34.480 --> 53:35.480
or five.

53:35.480 --> 53:40.120
It's kind of hard to have this conversation with 100 people.

53:40.120 --> 53:42.120
And what's your name?

53:42.120 --> 53:46.760
Jimmer Harmon, Nancy.

53:46.760 --> 53:50.520
But yeah, I think that's amazing when people drive all that way.

53:50.520 --> 53:53.520
And then sometimes I go, are you staying at a hotel here tonight?

53:53.520 --> 53:56.200
And they say, no, they're going to drive all the way back.

53:56.200 --> 53:59.640
And then sometimes I reach out and I take their hand and I say, you're staying with

53:59.640 --> 54:00.640
me.

54:00.640 --> 54:11.640
And whether it's a dude or a girl or hopefully both, Aaron and I take him back to our hotel

54:11.640 --> 54:23.640
room at the Comfort Inn and we put on some Chardet, we smoke a J, do a little TM, it's

54:23.640 --> 54:29.080
transcendental meditation.

54:29.080 --> 54:33.840
And basically enact that SNL sketch about the guys at Lake Cuantro, okay.

54:33.840 --> 54:38.400
All right, Cayman, what do we do for you?

54:38.400 --> 54:39.400
What do you want?

54:39.400 --> 54:40.400
What do I want?

54:40.400 --> 54:41.400
I'm kidding.

54:41.400 --> 54:42.400
I don't know.

54:42.400 --> 54:43.400
No, I mean, I mean, what do you want?

54:43.400 --> 54:44.400
I just didn't mean to say it.

54:44.400 --> 54:45.400
I'll take some more vodka.

54:45.400 --> 54:46.400
Oh, okay.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.400
I don't mean to steamroll it.

54:48.400 --> 54:49.400
No, no, no, no.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.400
You've earned it.

54:50.400 --> 54:53.040
You've earned these lights.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.800
Drink your science spinach.

54:54.800 --> 54:57.240
Well, it's Monday night.

54:57.240 --> 54:59.360
Every night is drink night for scientists.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.840
It's what powers science, basically.

55:00.840 --> 55:01.840
Really?

55:01.840 --> 55:02.840
Yeah.

55:02.840 --> 55:06.040
So like most science gets done Tuesday morning or?

55:06.040 --> 55:09.000
Most science gets done at the bar, I'd say.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
You guys get drunk and then the...

55:11.000 --> 55:16.160
Are there any science bars in town where...

55:16.160 --> 55:17.160
The slide rule?

55:17.160 --> 55:18.160
The...

55:18.160 --> 55:19.160
The...

55:19.160 --> 55:20.160
The...

55:20.160 --> 55:21.160
The bronze slide rule.

55:21.160 --> 55:22.920
The bronze slide rule.

55:22.920 --> 55:29.320
The graduated cylinder.

55:29.320 --> 55:34.080
The nanoshot.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.080
The flask.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.080
Yeah.

55:36.080 --> 55:37.080
Okay.

55:37.080 --> 55:38.080
The Erlenmeyer flask.

55:38.080 --> 55:39.080
The dot connector.

55:39.080 --> 55:40.080
That's science-y.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.080
Uh...

55:41.080 --> 55:42.080
Uh...

55:42.080 --> 55:43.080
Schrodinger's hangover.

55:43.080 --> 55:46.840
E equals gym beam squared.

55:46.840 --> 55:47.840
No, that's...

55:47.840 --> 55:48.840
That's...

55:48.840 --> 55:52.440
That's a specific drink special at that place.

55:52.440 --> 55:53.440
Wine...

55:53.440 --> 55:54.440
Winesteins?

55:54.440 --> 55:55.440
Yeah.

55:55.440 --> 55:56.440
What?

55:56.440 --> 55:57.440
Dumb.

55:57.440 --> 55:58.440
Come on.

55:58.440 --> 55:59.440
Anybody got one?

55:59.440 --> 56:00.440
Beakman's World is the...

56:00.440 --> 56:01.440
It's the...

56:01.440 --> 56:02.440
What's the name of the lady's...

56:02.440 --> 56:03.440
Adam Goldberg.

56:03.440 --> 56:04.440
That's not nice.

56:04.440 --> 56:05.440
That's Garrett with one R.

56:05.440 --> 56:06.440
It's from Nashville, right?

56:06.440 --> 56:07.440
Yeah.

56:07.440 --> 56:08.440
It's the...

56:08.440 --> 56:09.440
What's the name of the lady's dance at the bar?

56:09.440 --> 56:10.440
It's made by your...

56:10.440 --> 56:11.440
Coyote Ugly.

56:11.440 --> 56:12.440
Coyote Ugly?

56:12.440 --> 56:13.440
Yeah, yeah.

56:13.440 --> 56:14.440
Beakman's World is the coyote ugly science bar.

56:14.440 --> 56:15.440
That's too long.

56:15.440 --> 56:16.440
That's too long.

56:16.440 --> 56:17.440
Yeah.

56:17.440 --> 56:18.440
Yeah.

56:18.440 --> 56:19.440
Yeah.

56:19.440 --> 56:20.440
Yeah.

56:20.440 --> 56:22.440
Yeah.

56:22.440 --> 56:24.440
That's too long.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.440
Jesus.

56:25.440 --> 56:26.440
Holy crap.

56:26.440 --> 56:27.440
Yeah.

56:27.440 --> 56:28.440
That was a Mobius Strip.

56:28.440 --> 56:29.440
I like that.

56:29.440 --> 56:30.440
I like that.

56:30.440 --> 56:31.440
The Mobius Strip Club.

56:31.440 --> 56:32.440
Yeah.

56:32.440 --> 56:33.440
The Mobius Strip Club.

56:33.440 --> 56:34.440
Ah, there you go.

56:34.440 --> 56:35.440
Where...

56:35.440 --> 56:36.440
Where...

56:36.440 --> 56:37.440
There's only one titty, but it goes up like it's like it's all...

56:37.440 --> 56:38.440
It goes all around.

56:38.440 --> 56:39.440
It is no nipple.

56:39.440 --> 56:40.440
Yeah.

56:40.440 --> 56:41.440
Infinite titties.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.440
Yeah.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.440
Yeah.

56:43.440 --> 56:46.440
You get a lap dance, but it's like all of a sudden you're on her lap, but it's...

56:46.440 --> 56:48.440
Put your hands together for...

56:48.440 --> 56:49.440
Tesseract.

56:49.440 --> 56:54.440
She's a wrinkle in time, boys.

56:54.440 --> 56:56.440
Get your tips out.

56:56.440 --> 57:05.440
She's got infinite titties, but we don't have infinite time.

57:05.440 --> 57:08.440
Remember, Heisenberg's principle still applies.

57:08.440 --> 57:14.440
If you touch it, it stops being allowed.

57:14.440 --> 57:18.440
Don't forget, you can get a private lap dance in the wormhole.

57:18.440 --> 57:21.440
Who knows what goes back there?

57:21.440 --> 57:24.440
Get your superstrings out.

57:24.440 --> 57:26.440
Yeah, I know.

57:26.440 --> 57:27.440
It's getting...

57:27.440 --> 57:29.440
It's getting grotesque.

57:29.440 --> 57:31.440
It's singularity, man.

57:31.440 --> 57:34.440
Anybody who came alone.

57:34.440 --> 57:36.440
All right.

57:36.440 --> 57:37.440
All right.

57:37.440 --> 57:38.440
So what's the...

57:38.440 --> 57:39.440
What's the...

57:39.440 --> 57:40.440
What's the...

57:40.440 --> 57:42.440
We've got a scientist up on stage, Jeff.

57:42.440 --> 57:43.440
Yeah.

57:43.440 --> 57:44.440
Pop quiz.

57:44.440 --> 57:45.440
Okay.

57:45.440 --> 57:46.440
Yeah, yeah.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.440
We've got questions to try to stump him.

57:48.440 --> 57:51.440
Okay.

57:51.440 --> 57:54.440
Oh, boy.

57:54.440 --> 57:59.440
Could science ever...

57:59.440 --> 58:01.440
Well, I mean...

58:01.440 --> 58:05.440
Fight the predator?

58:05.440 --> 58:06.440
Who would win in a fight?

58:06.440 --> 58:10.440
Science or the predator?

58:10.440 --> 58:12.440
Science could at least see the predator.

58:12.440 --> 58:13.440
Right.

58:13.440 --> 58:14.440
So...

58:14.440 --> 58:15.440
And measure him.

58:15.440 --> 58:16.440
Or her.

58:16.440 --> 58:17.440
I don't know.

58:17.440 --> 58:18.440
Right.

58:18.440 --> 58:19.440
Nice.

58:19.440 --> 58:20.440
All right.

58:20.440 --> 58:21.440
Scientific, very open-minded.

58:21.440 --> 58:22.440
Predator might be a lady.

58:22.440 --> 58:23.440
Social science.

58:23.440 --> 58:24.440
All right.

58:24.440 --> 58:25.440
Well, let's have a hand for Cayman.

58:25.440 --> 58:26.440
Cayman, everybody.

58:26.440 --> 58:33.440
And send him back to his lab.

58:33.440 --> 58:48.440
Hi-Haw.

58:48.440 --> 58:49.440
Science.

58:49.440 --> 58:50.440
Science.

58:50.440 --> 58:51.440
Science.

58:51.440 --> 58:52.440
Well, two plus two is four.

58:52.440 --> 58:53.440
And a boot plus a boot is a shoe.

58:53.440 --> 58:54.440
I'm a funky science cowboy.

58:54.440 --> 58:55.440
How do you do?

58:55.440 --> 58:57.440
Like to take you back to my ranch shack and put you on your back.

58:57.440 --> 58:58.440
Give a double slide rule track.

58:58.440 --> 58:59.440
Fuck your butt and lick your nuts.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.440
Put my hat on the foot.

59:00.440 --> 59:01.440
So you can see the predator.

59:01.440 --> 59:03.440
Put your nuts.

59:03.440 --> 59:05.440
Put my hat on the foot of your bed.

59:05.440 --> 59:08.440
Not much of rhyming happening.

59:08.440 --> 59:11.440
But I got a big bowl crappin' in.

59:11.440 --> 59:17.440
Out in the back with my Carl Sagan Shack Science Cowboy.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.440
Outer space is the place for me.

59:19.440 --> 59:22.440
Got a big green face and an old TV.

59:22.440 --> 59:24.440
Got a big boot cowboy.

59:24.440 --> 59:28.440
Boot, floor, boot, plate.

59:28.440 --> 59:31.440
Line, dance in, square, dance in.

59:31.440 --> 59:34.440
Four lines make a square.

59:34.440 --> 59:35.440
I played the short version.

59:35.440 --> 59:36.440
I fucked up.

59:36.440 --> 59:48.440
You got a big bowl crappin' in?

59:48.440 --> 59:50.440
You fucked his butt.

59:50.440 --> 59:53.440
Licked his nuts.

59:53.440 --> 59:57.440
But you put your hat on the foot of his bed.

59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.440
Because you're a science cowboy.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.440
It's what you do.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.440
It's called peer review.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.440
It's a scientific principle.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.440
His ass was the control.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.440
I'll see.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.440
The hypothesis is over.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440
My hat's on your bed.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.440
You got fucked.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.440
It's a law now.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.440
Science, nobody ever understands this when I say this.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.440
Science is the best religion.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.440
Scientists get offended by that because they're like,

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.440
we're not a religion.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.440
Of course, religious people don't want to think

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.440
that science is a religion.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.440
Religion should be like, how much more religious

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.440
could you get than trying to figure out how everything works?

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.440
Everybody joining hands and moving toward the center

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.440
of the universe and trying to find like,

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.440
corner God.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.440
Either he's going to be there or nothing will be there.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.440
In which case, nothing is God who cares.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440
It's still awesome.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.440
Just playing peek-a-boo with the origins of everything

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.440
and not letting it escape by calling each other out on everything

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.440
and publishing all your findings and being open source

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.440
and kneeling before this altar of these rules that say,

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.440
this is how you figure shit out.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.440
Always be careful.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.440
Always be calling yourself out on your own bullshit.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.440
Otherwise, someone will also call you out on it

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.440
and it's a beautiful little, and they have little outfits

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.440
with little white coats.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440
Even if they're not doing anything that involves.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.440
It's kind of priestly. It's kind of clerical.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440
And it is the new religion.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.440
I mean, obviously, for better or for worse.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.440
But some people use that as an excuse to get all jaded and cynical.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.440
They're like, oh, there is no God.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.440
Well, yeah, there's not a Santa Claus God.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.440
We know that.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.440
We disprove that when we dug up a dinosaur bone.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.440
But you don't have to be an asshole

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.440
just because your mom was wrong.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:55.440
Like, yeah, we have like hover cars and stuff.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.440
Now more than ever, don't be a dick

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.440
because you can hit more people with a hover car.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.440
Like, bombs that could blow up the whole world.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.440
Be a good person.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.440
Like, Genghis Khan would do a lot of damage these days.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.440
You know?

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:19.440
Scientists have to, like, they're the only ones that can save us.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:28.440
I think if they adopt a kind of like, you know, humanist perspective

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.440
and go, okay, look, we're a group of scientists

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.440
and we've decided like we got to be cool to one another.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.440
Because no one else has any power.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440
Nobody's listening to anybody else

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.440
because the other people that are saying you have to be cool to one another

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.440
are also hiding rapists.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.440
Like, they're not, you know, they can't be trusted.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.440
They're weird.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440
They say that the Bible's a newspaper.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.440
They're like backward.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.440
Yeah, don't be evil.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.440
Which means just don't like hurt other people

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.440
because it's your species, you know?

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.440
Like, that's scientific.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.440
Protect the DNA.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.440
We were a nearly extinct species

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.440
and we were in God's crosshairs so many times.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.440
Like, this is a planet that's been trying to kill us forever.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.440
Like, we're a freak.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.440
We're like the Harry Potter of species.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.440
Like, we're not supposed to be walking around

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.440
with these big melons on top of our shoulders.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.440
Like, we took weird risks to get where we are.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.440
But there are people that say that competition between humans,

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.440
like, there are people that think that that's what makes us advance.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.440
Like, that human conflict is that that's what propels, you know, progress.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.440
And that may have been, maybe that was true for 6,000 years

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440
and now it has to stop being true.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.440
I mean, maybe it's like we're choking on each other.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.440
We're sleeping on top of each other.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.440
If you also want to stab somebody, it's like,

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.440
that's going to, a lot of people are going to get stabbed.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.440
Like, I think when we were tribal and you were walking around

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.440
and you encountered another tribe, yeah,

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.440
maybe the instinct to not all lay down together

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.440
and have half as many berries, maybe that was like a bad idea.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.440
Maybe it was important to slit each other's throat

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.440
and then whoever picks berries better will survive that day.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.440
But we're in a tour bus now.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:11.440
If I got berries on the mind and a switchblade in my hand,

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.440
you're a dead man.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.440
It's more important that we figure out a set of rules

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.440
so we can all have some berries.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.440
And there's also too many berries.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.440
We know how to make a million berries.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.440
We make fake berries.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.440
There's a whole store every five miles full of weird Frankenberries.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.440
Thank you, sir. He knows what I'm talking about.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.440
Don't forget blueberry.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.440
It's not that kind of dialogue.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.440
It's not just say anything.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.440
But how are you supposed to know until you try?

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.440
Just yell out the names of products, it's fine.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.440
I heard Listerine, Bula Hoop,

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.440
Matt and his dad, it's fine.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.440
God knows I don't have anything to say.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.440
What was I talking about, scientists?

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.440
You're talking about tribal people stabbing each other in berries.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.440
Now that we are seven billion strong,

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.440
now that we know how to make buildings float,

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.440
almost, look it up,

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.440
we're almost about to be able to clone each other

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.440
and computers are almost smarter than us

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.440
and all this shit's coming to a head.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.440
We've got to get our shit together,

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.440
not physically, like emotionally.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.440
We've got to get our shit together spiritually,

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.440
for lack of a better word.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.440
We've got to know when this next catastrophe happens,

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.440
like when our priorities are.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.440
It's about to happen.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:35.440
We've got a couple days left, Jeff, three days left.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.440
When does this podcast drop?

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.440
Four days from now.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.440
We really should have speeded that up.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.440
I hope you find it in the bottle.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.440
I'm dry land.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:49.440
I want to be a cult leader.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.440
We'll work on that as we head back home.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.440
I think right now it's time to...

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.440
Say what?

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.440
Oh, really?

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.440
Oh, really? Jim Jones is from Indiana?

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.440
Wow.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.440
This guy says Jim Jones was a Sunday school teacher

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.440
at his grandma's church.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.440
Wow.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.440
Is your grandma alive?

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.440
Okay, good.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.440
Jesus. Holy smoke.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.440
Any other infamous Hoosiers?

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.440
John DeGeneres?

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.440
Larry Bird?

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.440
Larry Bird.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.440
Notorious baby raper?

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.440
Ed Gein?

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.440
Greg Kinnear?

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.440
The infamous Greg Kinnear.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.440
John Mellencalf.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.440
I saw that on Wikipedia.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.440
John Mellencalf still lives here, right?

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.440
Michael Jackson?

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.440
Gary Indiana's from Indiana.

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.440
Not Louisiana, Paris, France, New York or Rome.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.440
But Gary Indiana.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.440
Gary Indiana.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.440
Gary Indiana.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.440
My home sweet home.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.440
Wow.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.440
Big music man following here.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.440
They have to keep a...

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.440
They're in a neck and neck competition

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.440
with Oklahoma for mentions in a musical.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.440
They got it.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.440
If they let it slip in this state,

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.440
everyone's going, oh, that wonderful musical

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.440
where they mention that state.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.440
Indiana's 14th in musical mentions.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.440
All right, D&D time, everybody.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.440
It's D&D time.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.440
All right, can we get Aaron up here?

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.440
Erin McGathy to the stage.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.440
Erin McGathy.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.440
Also a guy named Bland has some dice for me.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.440
Bland?

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.440
His name is Bland.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.440
The dice are not Bland, however.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.440
Bland. Is it Bland?

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.440
All right.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.440
A gentleman has come on stage

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.440
carrying a satchel.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.440
And he has a Pringles can over his dick.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.440
He's wearing a Pringles can out of his dick.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.440
Do people ever call you Pringles dick?

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.440
Some.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440
Yeah?

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.440
It's an extreme dill pickle.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.440
Oh, the flavor is even better.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.440
Did you pick out that can?

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.440
Yeah, nice, specifically.

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.440
Uh-oh.

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.440
Someone's going to get the Jolly Rogers.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.440
Oh, no, guys.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.440
It's a donation to a kid's charity.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.440
Oh, chicken noodle can.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.440
Wow, that is some meta shit.

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.440
For those of you who have no idea what's going on,

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.440
I kind of do.

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.440
We have a song...

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.440
We have songs about Pringles dick

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.440
that we sing on the bus,

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.440
and also a song about where you hold a Pringles can.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.440
Wait, how did you hear that, too?

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.440
You just put it through your fly?

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.440
Yeah.

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.440
Well, you probably have a big dick in the way

01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.440
when you do this stuff.

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.440
I've been able to do this for years.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.440
Here I am.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.440
I ain't got a dick.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.440
I got a chicken noodle can.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.440
Oh, my life.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.440
I've been put in this can.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.440
It's time for chicken noodle wife.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.440
Chicken noodle god, come down from the mountain

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.440
saying chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.440
Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.440
and feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.440
Soup to the bowl,

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.440
bowl to the spoon, spoon to your mouth.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.440
They're gonna get well soon.

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.440
Gotta get a little bed rest, sleep until noon.

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.440
Grab a pot of coffee, then head to the saloon

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.440
saying chicken noodle god, come down from the mountain

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.440
saying chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.440
Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.440
Jordan and feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.440
Well,いる in blue south

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.440
and come work with me, my chicken noodle wife.

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.440
Let me just the other day,

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.440
there's not much else I can do,

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.440
but pray because chicken noodle man,

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.440
you gotta work all day.

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.440
Chicken noodle god, come down from the mountain

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.440
saying chicken noodle guy, you gotta work all day.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.440
Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.440
Jordan and feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.440
Chicken noodle god, come down from the mountain

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:16.760
Blanned, everybody, giving the gift of a chicken noodle can outside of a Pringles can.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.040
We have to write a song that fits inside a chicken noodle soup can, and then it's like

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.880
the Russian nesting dolls.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.800
But I was just thinking, Blanned, I am so sorry about the either already having occurred

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:34.320
or imminent homicide of your parents.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320
Blanned the fourth.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.680
Your dad, meaning like, did your dad name four kids Blanned, or?

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.640
It's Blanned with no D, right?

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640
Or is it Blanned?

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.400
Blanned like dull and tasteless.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.520
And you're the fourth generation of Blans?

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.680
Yes, my father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.920
Holy set, wow.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.920
So that's ironic.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.480
Hence the pierce, though.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:59.040
It is powerful and flavorful that you're the fourth Blanned.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.840
And also that he chose extreme dill to put on his dick.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.840
Yeah.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.840
It's the pickle.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:09.640
Blanned, do you only consume extreme flavors?

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.600
I try to.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.440
Actually, this really made me burp a lot of dill flavors.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.440
Oh, you ate them?

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.440
Yeah, I ate some of them.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.440
And then dumped them.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.080
Yeah, that's not a flavor I'd grab off the shelf or expect to ever find.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.760
It's got a sour meter on it.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760
Oh, God.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.760
It's a super stack.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:33.040
You can test your taste buds, and it's the screamin' dill pickle.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.040
Extreme flavor.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.520
I guess we got to do Pringles Dick song with Blanned.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.400
Do you know Pringles Dick?

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.040
I don't know all of it, but I know some of it.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:48.080
Some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out why.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:53.000
I don't really have a Pringles Dick, I just keep my dick inside.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can, because it keeps my penis safe and dry.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out why.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
No, I never found out, never really found out why.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Blanned.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Thank you, Blanned.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Cheers, brother.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Blanned.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Now we've got a little tie in the back.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.520
That was some complicated shit.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:26.000
It's weird that he put all the time into making the Pringles Dick thing, ate the chip.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
How was that staying?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
It doesn't really know the whole song.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
How was that can staying in your pants?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Just by a zipper force?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Yeah.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I don't know, why are you bewildered by that?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I'm just surprised it didn't fall out.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.160
Haven't you ever put something in your zipper and pretended it was your dick?

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160
My dick.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.160
I guess the answer is no.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160
I don't know.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.160
All right, Spencer, catch us up to date, if you would.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.400
Okay, we want to pass this down.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.440
The character should be dispensed.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:59.000
When we last met, our heroes came to in the belly of a mythical creature known only as

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.920
the Infinifish.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.840
Our heroes were discovered by a group of seven humans and halfling that formed a tribe deep

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.480
within the bowels of the Great Beast.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.280
Meeting with Aliyah, the leader of the fish dwellers, the chieftain led the heroes to

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:17.680
their village, a safe haven nestled between the arterial landscape of the fishes' insides.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.320
It was there that Mulraine and Sharpie, in a moment of tension and feelings, had a deep

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.760
but important conversation about their complicated relationship.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.960
Afterwards, they headed to one of the villagers' stores and bought some ropes, potions, and

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.680
syringes full of paralyzing agents.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.400
They didn't know how, but they knew they had to escape.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.920
Go, Spencer, everybody.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.560
So, if you recall, you're in this village.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.080
It's been made out of things that the fish has eaten, and yeah, you were talking to the

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.080
chieftain.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.080
Yeah.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.080
You got some stuff.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.640
All right, so we were talking about making this fish barf us up, you know, like Pinocchio

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640
style, right?

01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.640
Yeah, there are two episodes behind it.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.640
We got swallowed by a big giant fish and we were trying to make it barf.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.640
What about it?

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.640
Teleportation one.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.120
Yeah, you have that cloak.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120
It teleports.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.680
Jesus, I have a teleportation cloak.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.680
Yeah.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.680
Wow.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.680
Can you teleport out to the blowhole?

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.160
Or maybe it doesn't have a blowhole.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.760
Maybe it's not a whale.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.800
How does that cloak work?

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.040
You don't even know, man.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.720
Your dad showed it to you and he didn't seem to have a mastery of it.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.160
All right.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.200
Can I think about the top of this infinite fish?

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.320
Okay, you can think about the top of it.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.560
That happens.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560
Think about it.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560
All right, you're thinking about it.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560
I used the cloak.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560
Clearing your mind.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.520
Whip it around me like Alex Baldwin with a shadow.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.080
It makes a weird noise.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.360
It looks like it's out of juice for the day.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.640
You're out of juice for the day.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.000
Judging snap.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.920
If anyone wants to top me off.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:53.880
All right, so we have to get this whale to expirge us somehow, right?

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.640
We want to get coughed up out of here.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.160
Hey, give me some of those crystals.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.200
Remember when we got first on board this infinite fish and you had your healing crystals shattered

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.880
and it had little crystals that were absorbed into your body?

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.880
You got back up to 40 hit points.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.760
Do you have any of those extra crystals left?

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.920
I handed my crystals.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.640
All right, you handed me your crystals.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.280
Can I rub them on the cloak?

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.280
The rest of the crib.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.280
Is there a battery compartment?

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.240
Rubbing the crystals on the cloak.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.240
They glow softly, but then grow inert.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.560
All right, you can have them back, they're dumb.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.400
Several of the crystals dissolve, healing you to full health.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.640
Oh, sorry, I accidentally healed myself.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:38.000
These people, their dwellings are made out of wood.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.880
What if we ask them if we could set their homes on fire?

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.000
Go on.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.720
And obviously take them with us and we, maybe if we set their homes on fire, the fish would

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.480
spit us out or just burn up or we'd all die.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.640
Do you want to consult or do you just want to start setting fires?

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.760
No, no, may I consult with the leader of the fish dwellers?

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.600
I am the leader of the fish dwellers.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.600
Hey.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.720
I heard you talking about things.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.720
Yes.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.240
First of all, I want to say that I greatly respect your architecture and your house.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.840
And secondly, can we set it on fire?

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.840
We live here.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.840
Is there any reason?

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.840
Do you just like?

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840
Are you a pyromaniac?

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840
No, no, no.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:32.120
I don't hate fire, but I, you know, you said that you've been here for a long time.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.840
I don't know how passionate you are about leaving, but we certainly are.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.720
Maybe we can work together, set your home on fire and we can all leave.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.880
Maybe the mouth will just open, the fish will open its mouth.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880
We can all leave.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.880
Also, you look great.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.880
Thanks.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.880
Thanks.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.840
Well, you see, stories tell of my grandpappy.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.560
The first three ships that sailed through here, we did indeed light on fire, hoping

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:59.320
that would work, but it seems the beast's insides are quite resistant to heat.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.320
Oh, okay.

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.040
Jeff, do you have a little note pad?

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040
Yeah.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040
Do you keep little D&D notes?

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.040
I sometimes.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.040
Yeah.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040
Yeah.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.040
Someone's got to take this shit seriously, you guys.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.040
What is that word on your paper?

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040
What does that say?

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.040
It's Leah, the leader of the fish people.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.040
Shit.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.040
I write down the names of the people that come up on stage so I can thank them later on.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.040
That's very nice.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.040
I draw little pictures of people.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:33.040
I've got my famous buttermilk biscuit recipe down in here.

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.540
All right, so that was a good idea, Mulrainee.

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.040
I liked what you were going with that one, but it sounds like it's a no-go.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.040
It sounds like a no.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.040
It sounds like it's not a good idea.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.040
I'm glad I asked.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.040
If you want to damage various parts of the fish's insides, that might work.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.040
Let's go down and let's, yes.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.540
I mean, I don't know if killing the fish is a great idea, you know, or hurting it.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:59.040
It's like if this thing is like floating through the air, you know, and then you've heard it,

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.040
like.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:04.040
Where the fish is, where the amphida fish is gag reflexes, where it's uvula is?

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:09.040
You don't, but you have a feeling it might be somewhere along the digestive tract.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.040
Weird.

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:16.040
I lead us off in the direction of the esophageal part of the fish.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.040
Oliah says, you can go fish west to its primary digestive tract.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.040
You can go fish south, but no one ever goes fish south.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.040
Why?

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.040
Why doesn't anyone?

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.040
Because you get pooped.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.040
Let's go get pooped.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.040
Let's go pooped.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.040
Yes, but why do we get pooped?

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.040
Because everyone who ever gone that way is dead.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.040
Well, because I've never seen them again?

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.040
Yeah, I kind of tried it once.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.040
He never returned.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:47.040
Some say he escaped, but others say he perished, and others maintained that he never existed.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.040
So, I mean, either way.

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:57.040
So we can make him sneeze or gag, or we can punch a hole through him, or we can go get pooped

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:01.040
into a fish, but then we're going to be floating out in the sky, right?

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.040
Maybe.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.040
Maybe not.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.040
Okay, and we don't want that.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.040
So, hypothetically, we want a ship to fly inside the fish.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:11.040
Then we get on the fish on the ship.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040
You could.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.040
You also have a broken ship.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.040
You could repair it if you thought you wanted a ship.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.040
Can I use portable hole?

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.040
To do what?

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.040
To fall through it?

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.040
It doesn't put a hole in a wall.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040
It just makes a pit appear.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:28.040
So, like, you get in the pit, and it wouldn't take you to the other side.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040
So, it's more like a hiding spot?

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.040
Yeah, it's a hiding spot.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.040
Are you able to pull those holes?

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.040
I'm just curious.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.040
Like, would you go into them, or are you able to pull them down into the hole?

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.040
Like, pull it into itself?

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.040
Yeah.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.040
Like, you'd probably turn inside out and explode or something.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.040
I don't know.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040
I'm feeling lucky today.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:48.040
I said we go try the poop shoot.

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.040
Yeah.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.040
You see a purple pulsating sphincter to the south.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.040
It seems tiny, but you might be able to squeeze through.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.040
Can you say that ten times fast?

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.040
No.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:09.040
I'm a little, I'll go first.

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.040
Wait, wait, stop.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.040
Yeah?

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.040
I just want to Instagram this.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.040
No, no, I want to tie a rope around you.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.040
Oh, great idea.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.040
Yeah, thanks.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.040
You bought rope, didn't you?

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.040
Yeah, I have rope.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.040
I'll tie, I'm tying rope around Quirk's waist.

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.040
I'm tying that to my...

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.040
Two tugs means I'm in an infinite toilet and I'm drowning.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040
Pull me back.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.040
One tug means...

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.040
Good to go.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.040
Follow me.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.040
Okay.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:43.040
Yeah, and if you start tugging a lot of times, we'll start writing it down like it's a song.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.040
Like Morse code?

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:47.040
Yeah, yeah, but a song, but a beat to a song.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.040
But I eliminate one tug as an option because one tug could be a chaotic thing generated by...

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.040
Yeah.

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.040
Okay, so shave and a haircut.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.040
That means don't come in here.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.040
Don't come in.

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.040
Yeah, don't come in.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:03.040
But if I go, that means you can come in.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.040
That means...

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.040
So if you...

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.040
Yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.040
Don't come in.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.040
I don't think...

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.040
Yank, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.040
That means it's good to go.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.040
Quirk, so if you go through the anus and it's imminent danger,

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.040
you're going to be like, all right.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.040
Yeah, because that's the system.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.040
Okay.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040
That's the system.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.040
All right.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.040
Okay.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.040
All right.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.040
So you think you'll have that presence of mind no matter what happens.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.040
Look, fuck it.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.040
Absolutely.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.040
Yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040
Don't come.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.040
Don't come.

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.040
But calm down.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.040
Calm down.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.040
I am the toilet.

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.040
Calm down.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.040
Calm down.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.040
Okay.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.040
Yeah.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.040
Okay.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.040
Right.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.040
Okay.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:55.040
So I tie the rope firmly around my midsection and squeeze through the purple pulsating anus.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.040
Muscular action sucks you in.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.040
You find yourself in a narrow, red passageway.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:08.040
It opens up to an outcropping that looks over a lake of acid on the far wall.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.040
You can see a similar outcropping.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.040
Am I safe where I'm standing?

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.040
You're safe where you're standing.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.040
Yank, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.040
So that means we don't go.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.040
No, no.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.040
Didn't you hear the last two yanks?

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.040
Oh.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:29.040
I mean, that means he's probably perfectly safe not standing over an outcropping of acid.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.040
So we'll keep our end of the bargain and follow him.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.040
Okay.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:41.040
Sharpie, really quick before we go into Zanus, I just have to tell you that I, you know,

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.040
last night was pretty heavy, but I love you and I love you forever.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.040
I don't care what happens.

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:53.040
I know.

01:22:53.040 --> 01:23:00.040
I give her a passionate kiss or at least one that it's so that it's taken so long to do

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.040
that it's passionate.

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.040
To the fans.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.040
One part of yank, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.040
Did you guys not understand?

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:22.040
Okay, I'm going into the anus.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.040
I proceed.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:30.040
All right.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:35.040
On the far wall, you see a similar purple pulsating sphincter.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:38.040
A few giant wasps flipped around the room.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.040
Wasps.

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.040
These circling loops.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.040
Wasps?

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.040
Yeah, giant ones.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.040
All right.

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.040
Well, the biological analog is breaking down for me.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.040
So there are two, there are two sphincters?

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.040
There's two.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.040
Yeah.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.040
So it's, we've ventured through one and there's another one along the other passage.

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:55.040
So like, you know, we could be in a stomach kind of chamber.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.040
It's acid.

01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:01.040
So I think the infinite fish being, being an infinitely big, almost organism probably just

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:05.040
has more like big lakes of acid that kind of break down things in different stages.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040
Yeah.

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040
We're in the stomach right now.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.040
But if you could fly above it, you wouldn't dissolve.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040
Oh.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.040
Yep.

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.040
I fly above it.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.040
Well, I use my teleportation.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.040
Oh, wait.

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.040
You said it's out of juice.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.040
Yeah.

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.040
But can't you, can't you fly then?

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.040
And didn't you have a fly thing?

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.040
Well, I have a feather fall.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:27.040
If I start to fall, I could slowly lower myself into the acid.

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.040
I wouldn't like break my neck on impact or anything.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:36.040
I take one of Mulraine's arrows and tie the rope to it and say, shoot the arrow into the

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.040
far wall and we'll climb across it like rope bridge style.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040
Oh, boy.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.040
I shoot an arrow.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.040
Oh, yeah.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:49.040
You shoot an arrow and it flies across the room, but much like the cord of your microphone,

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.040
which just fell on the floor, the rope disengages itself.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.040
It doesn't cross the chasm.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.040
I need to consult you about one of my spells.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.040
Yeah.

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.040
Don't I have tensors floating disc?

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.040
Tensors floating disc.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.040
Yes.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.040
Does that have any range to it?

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.040
Can anyone get on that and I can send them across?

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:10.040
They can get on it, but I feel like there's a weight limit.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040
I think it's like...

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.040
Excuse me?

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.040
Well, Sharpie's pretty small.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.040
Or quark.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.040
Yeah.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.040
Okay.

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.040
You could probably send quark over.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.040
You're not so sure whether you...

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.040
You put me in a frisbee and throw me across the acid like...

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.040
Yeah, exactly.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040
Yeah.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.040
Yeah, I have like a thing called tensors floating disc.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.040
It's like a floating hover sled so I can put equipment on it.

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040
Okay.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:38.040
But, Spencer, after I turn into a woman, I weigh like 50 pounds now, right?

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.040
50?

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.040
I don't know.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.040
What's the standard weight for a woman?

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.040
Dead.

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.040
Ladies?

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040
I don't know.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.040
Okay.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.040
100.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.040
Just 100.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.040
Yeah, a reduced person.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.040
Yeah, reduce one of us.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040
Yeah, reduce me.

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.040
Reduce Mulraine and throw her across the acid.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.040
If I reduce Mulraine, will the weight limit of her...

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.040
Will she plus quark be under the weight limit of tensors floating disc?

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.040
I'm just gonna say yes.

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.040
Okay.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.040
All right.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.040
I cast reduced person on Mulraine.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.040
Typical.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.040
Then I cast tensors floating disc.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.040
Okay.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.040
Put the two of them on the disc.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.040
Yep, yep.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.040
And oogie boogie.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040
All right.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040
Your maneuver works.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.040
They're on the other side.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.040
See you later.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:31.040
They applauded for less in Brooklyn.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.040
Can I...

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.040
They applauded like a three-point ray of frost.

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.040
Can we throw the disc back to him so he can get on it?

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.040
Yeah.

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.040
I throw the disc back to Sharpie.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.040
There you go.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.040
And I scream out, this is from both of us.

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.040
Well, I don't think I can...

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.040
Can I get on my own floating disc?

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040
Yeah.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.040
Yeah.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.040
You sound unsure.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.040
I'm just rolling with it.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.040
I'm rolling with it.

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.040
All right.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.040
I get on my own floating disc.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.040
Woo.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.040
Slowly, it hovers across.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.040
You've peaked the attention of the flying wasps.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.040
Oh, shit.

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:12.040
Shit, man.

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.040
Are you using the dice the guy gave you?

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.040
Yeah, I am.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.040
And it's not boating well.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.040
Thanks, bland.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.040
Two of the wasps streak out of the air towards you,

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.040
pointing their vicious stings.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.040
You manage to deflect one of the blows,

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.040
but it strikes you right in the shoulder.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.040
You feel stinging pain as seven damage enters you.

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.040
It enters your body.

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.040
Scorching ray.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.040
Scorching ray.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:47.040
It misses.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.040
It flies into the wall.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.040
What's your arrows?

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.040
What should I fire them at?

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.040
The wasp.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.040
Oh, the wasp.

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.040
Yeah.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040
Yeah.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.040
Sorry.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.040
You just made out with this guy,

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.040
and now you're just watching him getting his ass kicked.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.040
I'm swooning.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040
I'm swooning.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.040
You're standing up here.

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.040
I'm swooning.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.040
I'm swooning.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040
I'm swooning.

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.040
As a woman, I'm just thinking about babies and doilies.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.040
I fired.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.040
Okay.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.040
So it's just one wasp.

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.040
I fire one arrow.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.040
Like a regular arrow?

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.040
A regular arrow, but I'm really,

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.040
I'm really focusing, Spencer.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.040
Yeah, you are.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:25.040
You hit it.

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.040
Yeah.

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.040
Right in the wing.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:32.040
The wing falls off of its body and careens into the lake of acid.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.040
All right.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.040
Your ascent movement continues.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.040
All right.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.040
Tinser is nice.

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.040
You get to the far outcropping.

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:47.040
Tinser's disc out.

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.040
The other wasp is droning lazily around.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.040
He knows better than the mess with y'all.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.040
Okay, cool.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.040
Let's not fuck with that guy.

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.040
No.

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.040
All right.

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.040
So what are we looking at now, Spencer?

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.040
Purple sphincter.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.040
Purple sphincter.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.040
Same system.

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040
Same system.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040
Same system.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.040
Although can I recommend?

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.040
Can we talk about those shoes in a haircut?

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.040
Yeah.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:11.040
Like, it just seems like, like, now let's just pick this.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.040
I'm sorry.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.040
Okay.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.040
But it's okay.

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:19.040
If something's going wrong, then you say...

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.040
Okay.

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:21.040
So that's bad.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.040
So that's bad.

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.040
That's right.

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.040
Yeah.

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.040
Because that's what happened before.

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040
I'm in a butthole.

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040
Come in.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.040
Come in.

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.040
I'm in a butthole.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.040
I'm in a butthole.

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.040
If I don't...

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.040
If I don't...

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040
Think of it this way.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.040
Okay.

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.040
Did you...

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.040
Think of it this way.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:42.040
I'm in terrible danger.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.040
Just kidding.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.040
That makes sense to me.

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.040
That makes sense to me.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.040
Oh, God.

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.040
Baby's so smart.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.040
Baby's system's so good.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.040
Is there something on my face?

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.040
No.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.040
I'm worried that there is mine.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.040
I don't...

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.040
I've been conditioned before you got up here.

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.040
There was hair hanging everywhere.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.040
All right.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.040
I'm in terrible danger.

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.040
Okay.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:10.040
I tied the rope around my waist and eased my way through the other sphincter.

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:14.040
You climb into the sphincter and immediately feel embraced by powerful muscular action.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.040
Story of Jeff's life.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.040
Yeah.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:19.040
That's true.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.040
Immediately you feel the rope snap.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.040
Your side.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.040
Sharpie and Mulrani go slack.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.040
Oh, no.

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.040
Oh, no.

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:28.040
You're being pushed through a fleshy opening with insane speed.

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:33.040
You feel like you're falling and then being pulled upwards and all around and suddenly

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.040
you're falling again.

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.040
Oh, shit.

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.040
So we're not feeling any signals.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.040
Is he fine?

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.040
No, you feel it go slack.

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.040
No, I know.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.040
Holy shit.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.040
Wait.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.040
It's the rope.

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.040
I pull on the rope.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.040
It comes out.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.040
It's broken?

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.040
Yes.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040
Okay.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.040
I tie the rope to another arrow.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.040
Okay.

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.040
I fire the arrow right on the rim of the sphincter.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.040
All right.

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.040
You miss.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.040
You can...

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.040
Okay.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.040
You can just stab it in if you'd like.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.040
Oh, okay.

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.040
I stab it in.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.040
That's fair.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.040
Okay.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.040
Also gross.

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.040
Okay.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.040
Groser than shooting it.

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.040
Okay.

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.040
So if I'm able to stab it...

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.040
Okay.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.040
I thought I had to like go across something.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.040
Me while...

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.040
Little help!

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.040
My chicken noodle can't talk.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.040
Okay.

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:20.040
I tie the rope to my foot.

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.040
I give the...

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.040
I tie the rope to my foot.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.040
I take out two arrows.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:31.040
I am holding them in my hand and I say to Sharpie, hold on to the other side of the rope.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.040
Okay.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.040
We'll do the same system.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.040
I'm going to find quirk.

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.040
Okay.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.040
It's going to snap.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.040
The rope's going to snap.

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.040
No, but it won't because I have arrows with me.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.040
He didn't have any arrows.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.040
How's the arrow...

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.040
How are the arrows...

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.040
What do you mean?

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.040
Because maybe something stabbed the rope apart and they didn't have a...

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.040
Is this a bad idea?

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.040
We can switch.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:56.040
This is going to get the same results here.

01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.040
We need to...

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:02.040
He's gone into the intestinal tract.

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:07.040
We need to either follow him or forget we ever knew him.

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.040
Well, then let's follow him.

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:13.040
Let's double-bind our feet just to be...

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.040
I have a potion of enlarged person.

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:18.040
I'm wondering if I drink it just as I go in.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.040
Right.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.040
Just give this thing the biggest...

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.040
He may enlarge the tunnel and if he's stuck, then he'll...

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.040
Yeah, that's a great idea.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.040
I don't know.

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:31.040
It just seems like a random thing to do.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:36.040
Don't be shy, you're so smart.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:41.040
I charge headlong into the sphincter as I drink a potion of enlarged person.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.040
Alright.

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.040
Straight in life?

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.040
You too get sucked into the sphincter.

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:50.040
You travel around in it.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:56.040
As you get larger and larger, it doesn't seem to affect the speed of the esophageal ascendance.

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.040
You too soon are falling.

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:03.040
You land on a fleshy outcropping on the side of a big red pit.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:06.040
Below you, you could see the ship you crashed here on.

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.040
Am I there too?

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.040
You were there too.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:10.040
What's up?

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.040
You've just been sitting there for a bit.

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.040
What were you guys doing?

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:19.040
Talking about how smart you were and just fucking doing bullshit?

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:24.040
Before you get judgmental, you might want to realize you're going to be around us for a while.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040
We just came full circle.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.040
That's our ship down there.

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.040
Oh wait, so we just wasted a bunch of time?

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:36.040
On the small ledge is a small campfire as well as a green tent.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.040
Who's on this ledge?

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.040
You guys are both on this.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.040
Oh, we're both on it?

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.040
We're on the other side of the sphincter.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.040
Let's go up to the green tent.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.040
Alright, that happens.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.040
I knock on the flap.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:55.040
It doesn't sound like much, but you hear the rustling and shaking of something exiting the tent.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.040
What's he look like?

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.040
Okay.

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.040
Out climbs a tall, thin elf with long blonde hair.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:07.040
He's wearing stained red leather clothes and at his side is a magnificent long sword with a pristine golden blade.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:15.040
Huldo, I am Prince Valesant of the Valesant Phyftum.

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.040
Hello?

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:23.040
What brings you to my outcropping?

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.040
We just went through some butts.

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:30.040
We were trying to get pooped out of a fish.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.040
Well, you were close.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.040
You got pooped somewhere just to my little camp.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.040
How's it going?

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.040
Do you want a sandwich?

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.040
What's it made of?

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.040
Fish innards.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.040
Is there a way to get out of this fish?

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:51.040
I don't know much about navigation, although what I do know is sword mastery.

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:55.040
I am a sword master and I master all swords.

01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.040
Can't we just slice our way out of this thing?

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.040
Can't we just start slicing and dicing and punch a hole?

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:04.040
The thing about such great beasts is although you can do hefty damage to their insides,

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:08.040
muscular action tends to close the wounds, sealing any pathway out.

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.040
You'd have to do something pretty dangerous to some of the vital organs to knock this thing out of the air.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.040
Meanwhile, I jump into the sphincter to join them.

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:21.040
But if we knock this thing out of the air, don't we all die anyway?

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.040
Maybe. That's all up to you.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:28.040
What if it vomits you into a cushioned plane, a plane of eternal cushioning?

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:33.040
We have to go get to a heart or a lung or something like that and go stab it in the heart?

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:37.040
I am not much of an infinifish biologist by any means.

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.040
You were more of a swordsman.

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.040
What are you good at?

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.040
I'm good at swords.

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.040
Okay, okay, check this out. Shoot an arrow.

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:49.040
Alright, I shoot one arrow.

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.040
Okay, you shoot it over the side of the pit.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:59.040
As it descends towards the earth, he unsheathes his sword and in a single fluid motion strikes with his blade.

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.040
Although he's a good 30 feet off, you could see the arrow break into half and fall into pieces.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.040
Like Robin Hood men in tights?

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.040
Does he have like magic far sword powers?

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.040
He's just as fast as a knife. It's a Milbrox maybe. It's not realistic.

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:19.040
Alright, so we need to take this guy on a journey up to the organs and use his sword to destroy the heart of this thing probably, right?

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.040
He's got far sword abilities.

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:25.040
I don't have a problem with you guys escaping, but I kind of dig it.

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.040
The Vellicent Kingdom was pretty shitty.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:31.040
Wait, what are you talking about? You like it inside a fish?

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.040
Yeah, it's like there's sandwiches.

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:41.040
Listen, if you come with us, you'll have sandwiches that aren't made of fish innards.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.040
Like, what else do you put in a sandwich?

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.040
How long have you been here?

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:51.040
I mean, we just ate fish sandwiches too. That was typical.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.040
There's a whole world out there.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.040
Maybe we can show you some affection.

01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:01.040
Yeah, my girlfriend will fuck you, I guess, is what she's saying. I don't know why she's saying that.

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:04.040
Oh, she'll fuck you.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.040
And I mean, fuck you.

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.040
You're going to have a pussy sandwich.

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:14.040
Believe me, I have my share of portable holes.

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.040
Oh!

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:21.040
Which portable holes had never existed in this universe?

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.040
I can make mine pretty stationary.

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.040
Well, I guess the conversations move because you said you'd like to help us, but you want to stay.

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:31.040
Maybe you could just show us away and then go back.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:36.040
Is there anything that we could offer you that you value that we might be able to bribe you with?

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:39.040
Do you have any weapons?

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.040
I have a couple swords.

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.040
I have an emerald dagger.

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:49.040
I have a sense of adventure.

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.040
Wait, didn't you say you'd be happy to help us?

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:57.040
I'd be happy to help you with any sword-related problems or sword-related expertise.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:00.040
I have a great flaming sword. It's pretty cool.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.040
You don't have to give him anything. He's going to help us anyway.

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:03.040
He is?

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:06.040
Come with us. We'll just talk swords.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.040
You and I, we'll talk swords all day long. We'll play sword fight.

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.040
Have you heard the new broadsword monthly?

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:17.040
Hell yeah. I wrote a piece for it.

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.040
I can't believe it gets delivered here of all places.

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.040
You seem pretty cool. Let's talk. Let's go.

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.040
How do I get down?

01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:30.040
I've got to get up.

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.040
Feather fall?

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.040
Can I cast that on other people?

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.040
Sounds good.

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.040
I can cast that on other people?

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.040
Yeah, you can cast it on people.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.040
I cast feather fall on everybody.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:44.040
On everybody.

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.040
That's going to take up most of your spells.

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:49.040
You're going to need some rest after this, but you gently float to the pit.

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.040
The bottom of it. You're back where you started.

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.040
Back where we started. What a great adventure. Back where we started.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.040
Clipping in!

01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:01.040
Clipping in. Back where we started.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.040
Back where you started.

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:08.040
Thank you, Erin McGathy.

01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:14.040
Now, we're not where we started because now we've got a guy with super-far sword powers

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.040
and he's going to help us kick ass.

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:19.040
I know. That's the point of his story. Jeff, you go on little cycles.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.040
Yeah?

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.040
I wasn't being derogatory when I said back where we started.

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:28.840
Oh good. Now what do you feel like you started the show speaking of cycles

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.760
wondering where we were in the Joseph Kimbellion thing? It seems like tonight

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:36.640
was pretty easy. It was very supportive. Maybe too easy. Too easy for $20 right?

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:42.600
Like some people I drove six hours why was it for $20? Do you feel like the audience needs

01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:45.760
you to work a little harder break a sweat up here? No I think the audience needs to

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:52.320
give me validation so that I can know that I gave them their $20 worth. Well

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.960
they already gave you $20 though. They gave the club $20 but I'm saying

01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.720
like I just I don't want to cheat them. I don't want them to call the Better

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:07.000
Business Bureau. I want to buck some mamas. Oh fuck some mamas. Okay I think

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.280
they're saying that if I do some rapping, if I do some freestyle rapping then

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.560
that'll make their ticket price worthwhile. All right do you want to do the

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.280
Grand Finale rap? Do you want to do one of the freestyle styles? Let's try the

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.440
do it. Do we have any Rihanna's in the audience? Any Dytos? Any

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:27.120
girls that can come up and sing the P.S. Yellow Puppet's Brown Hook to our

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.520
thing? At the very least we have Ruth right? Yeah Ruth. That's the very least.

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:34.080
That didn't mean that. Yeah let's just re-invite Ruth to the stage. Ruth with your

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:45.400
mind? The phrase at the very least was not appropriate. I just meant because you

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:55.480
already... Well I have no idea what y'all are talking about. Okay. There's a

01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:02.240
refrain okay so I do a terrible awesome freestyle rapping and then there's a

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:21.880
chorus that's like sort of a that's just you singing like the lyrics are. Yo trial

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:27.200
run with the first verse could be better motherfucker could be worse put some

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:31.760
chicken on my dick and some Pringles inside fuck your mama till I saw she

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.440
was twice as wide I've said the same words before and you rhyme the same words

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:42.120
that you did before before rhymes with before it doesn't matter it's a first

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:47.200
verse and it doesn't matter sing

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.160

to go I made her internal compass in her inner ear spitting around so she was

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.760

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:15.080

went to the middle of the place called the US and saw a new face called Indiana

01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:25.380
and it looked real good and it chopped lots of wood and it brought me inside

01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:48.780
for soup tasting good damn good soup I fucked your mama in her womb and I started to make a

01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:56.220
little baby tiny version of me and it draw sustenance from the walls and it's eating

01:59:56.220 --> 02:00:05.060
food that your mama takes in all the time so if she hops then it's gonna be bent the

02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:11.220
baby's gonna be deformed don't let her do that I'm not gonna be around I'm a

02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:16.780
traveling entertainer but if your mama fucks up that baby I put in her I'll be

02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:24.060
back with the lawyer and I'll take take her to court and I'll take that baby

02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:31.660
away from your mom and I'll raise it in my Los Angeles mansion and I'll teach

02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:36.300
you to read Beatles records and it's I won't really know how to read and I'll

02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:42.380
tell it that math is based on fairies so fancy German school and it'll only suck

02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:48.740
it's up till it's 13 and it'll have coke in its system until it's 17 and I'll

02:00:48.740 --> 02:01:03.380
think that's normal and then when I go broke at 60 your mama's kids will be

02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:10.260
broke too and it'll just be wandering around out there like Andy Dickson just
