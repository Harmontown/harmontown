00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know where you are tonight, but tonight we are in Harmontown.

00:09.000 --> 00:18.000
Let us waste no time in bringing up the stars, the mayor, the aldermen, the corrupt council people.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
First to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
You know him. Love him. God bless him.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Thank you.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
You also know him, Spencer Britton Day. If you don't know him, I don't know what you're doing.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Here he comes.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Are we going to bring up the most illustrious, most beautiful, Steve Levy?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
No, let's leave him out there for a little bit.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Let's leave him sweat.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Steve Levy.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Welcome back to Harmontown. Thank you.

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
We are back at our old home, but we are not violating any permits that I know of, because there's no audience.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
There's like 40 sewing machines out there with people at them. People don't know about this, but other than that, we're good.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
So I thought, yeah, you know, it wasn't really working on the VO booth. We could go back there when we wanted to.

01:16.000 --> 01:26.000
It was more the tech kind of was more challenging at the booth, right? Because we have this whole kit and caboodle that we then have to fit into this tiny room that's also set up for its own recording stuff.

01:26.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, we do have so much more equipment than the booth can can make useful. And the equipment was used with subscriber money to try to make the show better for subscribers.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
They're the people that we really care about, even if there's a lot less of them.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
We love our free listeners, but we want to impress the subscribers.

01:47.000 --> 01:57.000
And when we move to the booth, it's like, even though those people, you know, probably are kind of irritated by the live audience sometime, it's like, you know, we really missed that stage.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
So we figured it out. We figured it out. There's no more ingredients missing.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
No, no, the audience is missing.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
No, I wanted to do it. Did you ever hear that Andrew Dice Clay tape, the day the laughter died?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
No, at least.

02:13.000 --> 02:30.000
Or like a Neil Hamburger thing or like, like, like, like this is something really fun and wrong and painful about, like, just format performances in spaces where there's the glaringly missing thing is an audience reacting.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
And I just wanted to see if that would like what that did to my energy and stuff.

02:36.000 --> 02:47.000
So I now there's no jealousy, which is great, because there's always a little bit of jealousy between the people who live streamed and watched it, and those people who had to wait and then just listen to it.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah, who knows what relationship they had. Also, we found out our numbers were wrong.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, we were wrong.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
It turned out it was fake news.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, we shouldn't have trust Steve's numbers when they came from Breitbart.com.

02:58.000 --> 03:07.000
We started, yeah, we shouldn't go to Ear Wolf, Ear Wolf's news site for our for our podcast numbers. We thought we were tanking.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
It turns out, Ockerman's just on a warpath.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
He spent eight hours golfing with the Japanese Prime Minister today.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
I still don't believe that hair is real. Ockerman, we have beef. Is Ockerman still Ear Wolf?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
No, okay.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
But you know who is Ear Wolf, I think, is maybe Brandon.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Don't you have an Ear Wolf podcast?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I do. I had, I don't know if we got renewed or what.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Oh, okay. It was a seasonal.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
It's a really sore subject.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I will say this.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I'm not sorry. I was kidding.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
I thought Ockerman was still at Ear Wolf in a capacity because he has a couple shows, right?

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
I think he does his own shows, and I think he might be like a consulting producer or something, but I don't think he's evolved in the day to day that he used to be.

03:51.000 --> 04:02.000
I think he was like one half step ahead of me in trying what I have now tried, which is like, I kind of got into bed with Farrell and like, I was like, let me help this.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Now we know the truth.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
What is the truth?

04:05.000 --> 04:14.000
The podcasting industry, the stakes are not high enough for any kind of satisfying competition. Don't worry. We're all friends.

04:14.000 --> 04:28.000
I don't know if you call it a buyer's market or a seller's market, but it's just sort of like, you know, if you're podcasting, you're doing it for funsies, I think, unless you're like my favorite murder.

04:28.000 --> 04:39.000
It's like a sea of gold panners, man. See, this is where the audience would bail me out.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
They'd be like, oh, the word gold reminds me of something. I'd be like, hey, fuck you guys for talking.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
No, but anyways, I don't want to talk about the podcasting industry, except to say, if you have a podcast out there, we love you, wish you luck.

04:53.000 --> 05:05.000
It's a great medium. I actually do have a great podcast recommended in the vein of like, I mean, there's podcasts that you listen to because they're organic and anything can happen and there's no preparation.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
So you might accidentally listen to two hours of a horrible windbag just like trying to find his way.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
And I can recommend some of those to you, too.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
But there's all then there's the produced ones, you know, and among them are true crime ones. There's true crime ones that are sloppy.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
There's ones that are good and bad because of that.

05:24.000 --> 05:35.000
I just listened to the crime city. That's the one that the guy that did the jinx is doing or has done two years ago and I'm just kind of finding it out.

05:35.000 --> 05:47.000
But it's a really like super produced podcast series about Providence, Rhode Island, which is like, I didn't know it was like this super mobbed up town.

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
It's like the third, you know, most mafia city after New York and Chicago, but it's like the tiny, it's a tiny little, I don't know.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
No, spent a little time there, buddy.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Very corrupt politician.

05:59.000 --> 06:16.000
It's a really interesting, I mean, they really, this is an amazing story because they're they're able to tell the story of Providence, Rhode Island and its relationship with crime through the shoes of its own mayor who who runs as an anti corruption, anti crime Republican candidate

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
ends up taking Democratic help from the mob and it's just great.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
That thing of like how how dirty are you willing to get to clean up your town?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
So is it like a one one shot story?

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
It's not like like a it's not like it is.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
I mean, I assume.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Okay, I don't know if it's like the wire like they'll finish the ready.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
Then they do a different story and then they'll be like also Providence had a problem with its water treatment plants and everyone will go.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Where's Stringer Bell?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I just listened to this podcast called crazy.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
No, Dirty John and it's a similar.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
It's a six episode one shot true crime podcast that makes you hate old people.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
That's what it did to me.

06:56.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh, God, I mean, well, yeah, I bet that was I listened to that dirty John was because the mom is subjecting her children to that's like the depths you must sink.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Like I don't want to get too spoilery.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
That's the thing.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
But like the depths you have to sink to like do that to your family.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
That's what I hate about old people when you're doing it because you're lonely.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
That still sucks, right?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Yeah, no, I mean, I'm sure Donald Trump is lonely when he doesn't have money.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
She was like she was a victim of domestic abuse and bad relationships.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
It seemed so it's like she's you know, she has like not like she's sick or whatever, but she's kind of in this cycle.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
So it's like not all it's you know, she's she needs help too.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
But it's still I mean, you got to watch it.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
I listen to it.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I listen to it in one night.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, you can listen to it on 1.5 speed without losing any quality.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
So do that.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Have you had if you listen to this one up and vanished?

07:52.000 --> 08:01.000
No, this is guy this kid that sounds like Chris Pratt and for the first the first episode is him explaining he doesn't know how to do a podcast and then he calls his grammar for help.

08:01.000 --> 08:17.000
It's it's it couldn't be more like if you if you if you wanted to create anti millennial propaganda, it's like he's just like he's just finding his way and we can make fun of him because the guy is probably a billionaire now because it's like a hugely popular podcast.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
But he's just like, yeah, I really wanted to do a true crime podcast because I like listening to them.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
And so then I found myself, you know, I picked a case and then I was like, wait, doesn't my grandma live around there and then he calls her and the time and and then.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
And then like they talk about it for a while spoilers for the next five minutes.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
If you're going to listen to 900 episodes of it, cover your ears.

08:37.000 --> 08:53.000
I'll be really quick goes through the thing just like just like basically kind of just cast the same aspersions that the public's been casting on Reddit onto the usual suspects who you know, helping drive that like, you know, shame onto their life.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
And then a random dude comes forward and says, I did it.

08:56.000 --> 09:11.000
And then the rest of the podcast is him advertising a tour he's going on and doing interviews with people about his podcast and whether or not it helped.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Missing Richard Simmons podcast.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah, I mean, it's it's better.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
It's better for people.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
I'd rather live in a world where people just had access to shit and we're just trying shit.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
I want to know what are good numbers, what are bad numbers, since we know the numbers, we don't have to say your numbers.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
But it appeared that we lost 80% of our listenership.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
It turned out that wasn't the case.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
The reason was because we were looking at apparently someone started using a different tracker for the for counting.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I have no idea how this works.

09:41.000 --> 09:51.000
But in effect, they split the numbers down the middle and we were looking at it's like if you hired someone to watch numbers and then two seconds into the job, you fired him and then assume that that was the numbers for the whole thing.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
And it turned out you hired another guy, but you didn't know his numbers.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
That's basically what happened.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
But it was a good chance for us to realize we give zero fucks.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah, that was the conclusion we drew.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
We're all two bumps.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
And not in a punitive, aggressive way for you.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Like, obviously, I'm here and I'm excited mostly about you.

10:11.000 --> 10:22.000
And so is Chris Peruff, our director and Zach, our audio guy, like we, it's you that we really care about.

10:22.000 --> 10:22.000
I'm pointing at the camera for you shitty audio listeners.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
Sorry, I'll tell you guys later during a Myundi's commercial that I love you more than them.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
But no, there's no acrimony here.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
This is the experiment that I wanted to do.

10:32.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm gesturing like a, you know, between me and the camera because I always, you know, it's just part of my like weird, can you monetize the internet?

10:40.000 --> 10:51.000
Hobby, the only answer so far being, you know, yeah, if you're, if you're, if you're Marc Maron, if you're Marc Maron or porn.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
But I want, yeah, anyways, I'm not going to bore you with that.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
I'm going to bore you with other shit.

10:57.000 --> 11:06.000
So listen, you guys, huge, huge mass shooting today.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah, don't be desensitized to it.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I know you think the world record was broken.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
They've subdivided them into categories.

11:14.000 --> 11:20.000
Fox was all about this is the biggest church shooting in 20 years.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Just look, yes, go numb.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Don't go so numb.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
You stop watching television about this.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
The records are still bound to be broken.

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
The magazine industry for a while was just time life and then they had to fragment into Ninja Quarterly and stuff.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Let's look at church shootings.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
This is the biggest one in 20 years.

11:41.000 --> 11:50.000
And oh, that Chelsea handler, you naughty girl, you didn't wait long enough to say Republicans are bad.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
You're so naughty.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
That, that hurt me.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I hope it's clear being sarcastic.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
It's crazy how people have paid attention to they know now the details before the news even really reports it.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
So they knew that he wasn't a Muslim.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
They knew that he wasn't black.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
They knew that he was from the United States.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
He was probably a member of the community because the news reported it like a shooter.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
And just now just saying a shooter makes everybody know, fuck.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
It's funny.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
First of all, how that was noticeable and it's funny.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Second of all, how I was like those are the details I wanted.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah, what color was he?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Yep.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
What, what is this about?

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
Which of the Lord of the Rings factions, you know, is this in service of, there's no factions in Lord of the Rings.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
There's two factions.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Game of Thrones.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I didn't want to say Game of Thrones.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Mafia.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Good fellas.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
He's right.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
But, but it's like, why do I want that information anyway?

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
I wanted to, I was at the church shooting, I was like, please don't let it be 26 black people shot by a white dude

12:54.000 --> 13:03.000
because, but not, but then again, that then your brain gets divided down the middle into, and now you're,

13:03.000 --> 13:12.000
now you've become like some weird, fucked up twin sociopath, because neither of you has a soul anymore,

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
because one of you is still making calculations like, well, at least it was a white guy,

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
because if it wasn't, that would be even worse for some Rube Goldberg society machine.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
It's like, why, when did I get tricked into hoping different people were dead or alive in the first place,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
let alone what religion they are, what they were wearing on their head?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Why am I hoping this is a redneck?

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
Because I do think that the first thing you think is, I want to know who and why, because I want to know if I'm next.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Yeah.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
So I think that's like a natural place to go.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
We feel like we're, we feel like we're taking a temperature.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
We feel like these news stories that are, they feel like we're watching a, like our country has the flu,

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
and we want to, we want to know, it's like when I get too high and I start checking my pulse,

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
it's so stupid, but it's just a, it's just a, and even, one time I was at the emergency room,

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
because I thought I was having a heart attack in my 20s, and like, the dude said,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
notice that I kept checking my, he said, could you do me a favor stop doing that?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Like, well, why?

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
He's like, well, could you pushing down in your carotid artery, so you're really fucking up the data?

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
Like, what are you going to do if you notice your pulse stops, you're going to call a doctor?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Right.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Right.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
So I drove all the way to a clinic, because I got too high, jumped in the car, drove to a clinic,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and was like, wow, I'm having a heart attack.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
I'm having a heart attack.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
And then right before I got in the car, I was like, you don't have insurance, nigga?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
And that sobered me right the fuck back up.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
I, yeah, you mean like that your focus went off of your diet under your finances?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Yeah.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
I was like, yeah, if even if you die, it's better than going in there and creating like a $2,000 bill.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah, no way there you're like, I got to eat less lasagna.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
All right, whatever.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
You're right.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
That is where we are.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
We are at this point where we hear bad news and we definitely break it down to its core

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
so we can figure out whether or not we need to go get that go.

15:05.000 --> 15:12.000
And not only are we doing, but really it's like this guy who's sitting on his couch checking his pulse because he got too high.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
That guy isn't prudent.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
He's not health conscious.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
He has no plan.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
And he doesn't really even want to go to the hospital.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
On top of everything else, he's not even committed to hypochondria.

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
Because the reason he's going like this is because, you know, the alternative is just go, well, I'll just go to the hospital just in case.

15:30.000 --> 15:37.000
I'll just risk, you know, bankruptcy, you know, I'll put myself out there.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
I'll put more energy into something than my anxiety.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
But it's like, so we're just, we're in a hammock of anxiety right now.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
We got too high on, let's say capitalism, I don't know.

15:48.000 --> 16:02.000
And now we're pushing down on our carotid artery with the fingers of xenophobia and white guilt and pushing and pushing and waiting for the right signal through those fingertips to do what?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Something.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Dig a bunker.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
What am I going to do?

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I think it's supposed to rationalize and then you stop freaking out.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Like that's the hope.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
You're like, oh, it turns out he was a bad person.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I'm a good person.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I'm fine.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I don't have to worry.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
You know, I think that's what's quote unquote supposed to happen, but it doesn't really work.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I think we're also hoping whatever the process is, it'll take four years.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Right.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
And we did it.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
We're a quarter or the way there.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Because then we could just pull that lever so hard.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
And yeah, it also has something to do with the fact that I don't know.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
I remember when those beheadings started back in the, I think it was even before, no, after 9-11.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
But you know, the old days, that guy in the orange jumpsuit and he got his head cut off.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I talked about it on the podcast before.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
It was like, I did.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
I haven't done it since because fucking ISIS got way too good at cinematography and I knew

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I wasn't going to.

16:53.000 --> 17:01.000
But it's like, back then when radical like terrorists groups were like doing beheading videos,

17:01.000 --> 17:08.000
it was always like all fucked up and like some weird Fisher Price pixel cam and they'd do some weird alpha mat on it to disguise their base.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
But it would sort of be like a dude hovering in a cookie cut out or whatever.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
And I always like, I would click on that stuff and it did have something to do with wanting to know.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
I have no idea what data I would get from that stuff.

17:20.000 --> 17:36.000
It's something to do with coping with death because what could be a worse nightmare than you're doing, you're some civil engineer or something and you're overseas and you get pulled into a, I mean, it's that thing where you realize it could happen to anybody.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Yeah.

17:37.000 --> 17:45.000
So we start coping with strangers' deaths on the internet by going, okay, god damn it, there's a reason this wouldn't be me.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Or there's a reason why when this happens to me, I'll know what to do.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Or there's a reason why when it happens to me, it won't hurt that much.

17:53.000 --> 18:06.000
I think that was part of, I watched a beheading video because I think I kind of wanted to know, I wanted to see or hear some primate impulse that made me go, oh, I bet it doesn't even hurt that bad after the first.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Would you decide?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
It looks like it's bad.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
It looks like it's a bad way to go.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I don't even think they're using the right tools for the job.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Well, yeah, their audio was out of sync.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
They didn't even have a bounce sheet.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
But then ISIS started doing fucking iMovie and it was like, this is so unsettling.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Yeah.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
But they're like, they're clearly, and they're like.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
I mean, even the name ISIS is so much cooler than the past Taliban, like the past terrorist names.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
It's like the name that we used to put terrorist organizations in loops.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Yeah, literally.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
It was Archer.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Remember, Archer was battling ISIS.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I think they were ISIS.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
They were ISIS.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I don't remember actually.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
And I had a bunch of Archer gear because I'm a super, super nerd.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
And I can't wear any of that shit because it had ISIS all over.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
They ruined it.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
They fucked up Archer.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
Well, if you're in ISIS and you're watching, leave us alone.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Your job has become so easy.

18:57.000 --> 19:07.000
Although, I gotta say, we are really outpacing ISIS at this point. It feels like it's scarier to be in the United States than it would be in the Middle East at times.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Hell.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Yeah, I mean, it's getting hectic.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah, I don't know what the statistics are, but I know for sure we, yeah.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
I do know that a kid stands a bigger chance of getting killed like in a poor neighborhood in America than they do in the Middle East.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Has always been like one of those weird statistics.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Man.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Well, you got it.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Yep, we did it.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
We did it.

19:27.000 --> 19:38.000
I always get so terrified when I look at like Middle Eastern statistics and like low rent Eastern European countries, because I know that rich people look at those statistics or look at those facts.

19:38.000 --> 19:46.000
And they go like, oh, well, you know, like it's like, well, it's like when you get a job and you're, you don't like the job.

19:46.000 --> 19:56.000
And so you like start like, you're showing up late and then your boss yells at you and there's like a tinge of like, oh, no, but then you find you keep finding your limits.

19:56.000 --> 20:04.000
Like, and it's like, you know that like the the monopoly guys running things, they look at us.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Maybe I shouldn't say us.

20:05.000 --> 20:14.000
Maybe I should say you and like, I'm just like a piece of privileged drift would like floating like slightly on top with Trey Parker or something.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
But but but I they look at the sea of taxpayers, voters, whatever the fuck they see us as.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
And they go, these people are so spoiled.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
They don't know how good they have it.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Like in Czechoslovakia, they blah, blah, blah.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
And it was fine.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
And in Iran, when a woman blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
And it's like, you know that they're just going, they're looking at that with Cha-ching.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Oh, God damn it.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
It's what the market will bear idea of like, yeah, you know, make sure everybody gets a couple of gap sweaters.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Don't take away their gap sweaters.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
If you do that, they will riot.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
It's that idea of how much can you take before you really start to get upset?

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
I thought we had a much better threshold right now feels like, damn, we can take an awful lot.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Yeah, I think cell phones really changed it a lot.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I think we could slide right into the fucking shitter, man.

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
Like, we're not, we ain't got nothing to fight with.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I feel so vulnerable.

21:12.000 --> 21:19.000
I feel, I just like, I spent all weekend just like, like, just like playing Minecraft.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
You know, I was about to mine holding my lover, but really, let's be real.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
I was playing Minecraft, but then also holding my lover.

21:26.000 --> 21:35.000
And like, like, just, I just like filled with all of these like, dude anxieties because the church shooting, I was enjoying myself.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I went to take a shit.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I look at the phone and Jesus fucking Christ never stops.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
I don't get a goddamn break from these people dying.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
And then I'm like, I was just like, I just thought I just, I just, I just want to be able to protect Cody.

21:47.000 --> 22:02.000
I just, I just, but you can feel this very like dark, cold, monolithic thing setting in that is all numbness and comfort and fear.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
It's, it's where you, you can feel the fringes of your empathy.

22:08.000 --> 22:16.000
Like, they're just like disintegrating, like because the solution that we use to connect to each other, we have these tendrils in it.

22:16.000 --> 22:29.000
And, and then if that solution is just acidified, then like the parts of us where we're not, we all expect like this thing to be like some movie where people are turned into something.

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
But it's like the first thing that happens is your, your connections to each other are amputated and survival.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Yeah.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
And, and it doesn't even have to be a conspiracy on the part of any bad guys.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
It's just like, this is what's happening to us.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
It's like necrotizing, like we're going numb, we're, we're, we're going cold.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
And we're like, and that gives way for me, like bouts of euphoria because I think your system's shutting down.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
It's going like, well, my lungs don't matter that much.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
So now my brain has all this glucose left over to remember my mom.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Like a soldier in a World War II movie, you know, when they go like, it's cold, it's dark.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
And then they got like the smile on their face.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
They're like, give me a sheepdog, Tony.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
And it's like, I bet that's based on real shit because I bet when you're dying, like your brain just kind of pulls back

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
and then has these like bursts of, of like, yeah, but it's not that bad.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Like, look at Super Mario Odyssey is awesome.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
You know, like I feel these waves of like, it's going to be okay.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Yeah.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
And it's because I'm dying.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm dying like as a person who like ever thought they cared about other people or trusted them.

23:32.000 --> 23:42.000
Like I'm becoming an animal, I'm becoming a person that just once I do all I worry about now is like, can I protect Cody?

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
Can I or the last moments of my life going to be spent failing her?

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
And so that's, that's like part of the go get a gun white boy thing.

23:51.000 --> 23:58.000
And then I don't know, it's like, I assume the trajectory keeps going where pretty soon I'm pushing Cody out a window or something and

23:58.000 --> 24:05.000
going, lots of nutrients in here because there's that, that, that news doesn't loosen.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It's not like I'm finding out.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
I care really.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It's like, it's like I'm shrinking back, right?

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
I'm just going like, well, I just want to be with my girlfriend.

24:13.000 --> 24:21.000
I just want to, I read a study that said people act and think more conservatively when they feel threatened.

24:21.000 --> 24:27.000
And Fox News is very dedicated to making people feel threatened every day of their lives.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
So it's kind of like, it's this pipeline that's conservatizing people.

24:31.000 --> 24:39.000
One of the problems is for a while, researchers had basically no way to induce liberalness or whatever, because you can make someone feel

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
more conservative or whatever, but you can't make them feel more liberal.

24:41.000 --> 24:48.000
But then they discovered recently that if you take them through a thought experiment where they suppose they're invincible and invulnerable

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
and, you know, can't be stopped by bullets and stuff, then they get more liberal.

24:52.000 --> 25:00.000
So it's like feeling comfortable and safe makes you, makes you more willing to share and kind of be, be liberal.

25:00.000 --> 25:08.000
But feeling that you're going to be dying from terrorists and stuff makes you want to get guns and ban illegals.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
So if you wanted to self-destructive species, you know, that's the algorithm you'd use.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
You'd say, well, what's this kryptonite?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Fear?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
That's not good.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Lack.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
Like, oh, it's like when the people used to say like, oh, the dogs could smell fear.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
Like, well, he's going to have a real nose fall here because he's growling at me.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
What do you want me to do?

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Like, act like I'm that scared of your dog so he likes me?

25:32.000 --> 25:41.000
And a classic example is this last weekend, like, I kind of fell for it too to the extent that I went through an hour-long rabbit hole,

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
kind of debunking it in my own head because it was like, there was this, you know, refuse fascism organization.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
And they got a full page ad in the New York Times, I think.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And then who knows what happened first?

25:54.000 --> 26:04.000
It doesn't really matter because the Internet is an anonymous carnival of fear and lust and just the world,

26:04.000 --> 26:15.000
everything that humanity had a chance to bloom into gets sheared off as it slides through the two inch diameter tube of the Internet.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
And we're all realizing that now, all too late.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
We're all realizing that Silicon Valley is cigarette companies.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Like, for the mind that they're through no fault of their own 20 years later.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Through a lot of fault of their own.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Through a lot of fault of their own.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
Well, they didn't, I mean, they weren't like Philip Morris going like, research shows.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Oh, fuck it.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Yeah, they were.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Yeah.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
They were like, hey, do you want to do something about these fake accounts?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
No, that will mean we get less signups.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Okay.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
All right.

26:42.000 --> 26:53.000
You're saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, so, so like it, it's this thing happened where I meet me trying to parse through this.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Even though I'll probably get details wrong.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
It's like, it's kind of, it's not me trying to report to you.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
It's more me going, let me get this straight.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Is this what happened?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
I could be very wrong.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
But it seemed like what happened is that first the maybe the right started going like, what's this thing?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
What's this refuse fascism?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
They got a page in the New York Times.

27:12.000 --> 27:31.000
Oh, and then there's like this really lame 90 IQ false flag flyers started going out where, but then it gets really confusing because the false flag flyers, you know, a false flag flyer would be like, if you were white and you were scared of black panthers, you would go, you would make something that said like, you know,

27:31.000 --> 27:40.000
Huey P. Newton says, get a gun and go to Pershing Square tomorrow, you know, and like, but you're white and you're doing that because you hate the black panthers.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
So, but then, but then it gets more complicated because I don't know if I've ever seen this before, but like, it's the internet.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
So flyers are free.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
You don't have to stop eating pizza to go, we pay something on the wall.

27:49.000 --> 27:57.000
You can just keep fucking with shit at a Pepe airbrush this and also the, you know, Antifa knows that as well.

27:57.000 --> 28:17.000
They're going round and round and and and it just turns into this swirl of there's just all these fake flyers where it says, hey, Antifa, don't forget to wear your red baseball cap and polo shirt tomorrow so that the cops think that it's Donald Trump supporters who are attacking when

28:17.000 --> 28:27.000
when we start raping white women and then the it was just like and then the like, like, like people would troll and go, like, yes, that's right, we're going to rape all the white women tomorrow.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
We're going to kill all the white people tomorrow.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Don't forget.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
And just like, but you can't you can't tell who's doing that.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
I went to like three Antifa, you know, Beverly Hills.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
I was like, that sounds funny.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
Like I was at the tip of Beverly Hills, fake, you know, like, like, like, like, like everything was fake.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
Everyone was faking someone else and everyone was like spreading disinformation.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
And and so then the weekend happened.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
And I was actually legitimately scared.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
I thought, you know, I know a lot of this is fake, but that doesn't.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
All it all it took for that guy in Las Vegas to do what he did is apparently he had extra guns or something.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I don't even we still don't understand why he did what he did.

29:05.000 --> 29:14.000
But also he was not dissuaded by the fact that it was a honky tonk concert that was with Jeff Davis's friend that he was shooting out instead of his original plan.

29:14.000 --> 29:22.000
But like, like, so in that world, like, is there an ironic thing going on here where if you're not crazy, but you are just filled with rage,

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
at least you do have like a right brain aspect to it so you don't do things like the Boston Marathon thing.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
Like, because when you put those things together, don't you aren't you just scared to leave the house now?

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
Because you go like, well, everyone's yelling at each other so much on the internet.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
They're like saying, I'm going to kill you.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Come get me.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I'm going to fucking kill you.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
I'll be there tomorrow.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
I'm the sharks.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
You're the jets.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Like, but then like, basically nothing happens.

29:46.000 --> 29:55.000
And then the next day, it was just like, I looked at the hashtag that they were, you know, November 4th, it begins or whatever.

29:55.000 --> 30:09.000
And it was, it was like, essentially 100% just like people, probably I'm guessing in not in California, like probably in, I'm not going to keep on bashing like red states.

30:09.000 --> 30:17.000
I feel like, like as if everyone that lives in a red state is like some kind of yokel or, or if even, even if being yokel is a crime, if you're a yokel, it doesn't want everyone to die.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
You're on my side.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Yokel away.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I told you not to bring up them yokels, man.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I told you it's going to be trouble, man.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Well, it begs the question.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
Can you be an international yokel?

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
Must you be so localized in your yokeling?

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
I'm pretty sure those people in those German pants are also yokel.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
What happened to the cosmopolitan yokels?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Why so provincial all the time?

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Maybe that's responsible for your yokelry.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Maybe you need to get a passport.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Yokelry sounds like an old iced tea slang word.

30:50.000 --> 30:58.000
Obviously somebody's like, like, like, like, like that was just hating on locals, which means if you're hating on locals, then that means you're a transient.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
So you're either a rock band or you're a comic.

31:00.000 --> 31:09.000
So someone wanted to bash on whoever lived wherever they were, which they weren't going to be tomorrow, and they had to rhyme the word local.

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
Pretty unimaginative Louis Anderson.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I'm sure you made that up.

31:18.000 --> 31:34.000
All right, so but so then it was just a bunch of, you know, well, you know, it's probably fucking Russian AIs, but I or it was whatever, but like it's people that you're picturing because you see the American flag emoji and the thing and you see the you see the the the little tiny itty bitty little

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
thumbnail with a guy you think maybe looks like he's kneeling over a Bork Harkus with a fucking blow gun.

31:40.000 --> 31:48.000
And they're just they're just all patting themselves on the back and high fiving about how they didn't show up.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah, which is crazy.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
So that terrified me because that means you can just we just invented the or didn't invent it, but that's a bunker buster.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
That's a societal bunker buster.

31:58.000 --> 32:06.000
I can now decide to take out any group by like if I if I hate Native Americans, you know what, let's leave them for a while.

32:06.000 --> 32:18.000
If I if like if I hate my car mechanics, if I hate car mechanics, so I could go home and I could now just create a bunch of fake accounts and say and not even fake accounts.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
It's too much work.

32:19.000 --> 32:34.000
Just make a fire that's it with a car mechanic logo, a Jiffy Lube workers union with a fist and there's a big knife with a across a woman's throat and it just says don't forget tomorrow's rape day Jiffy Lube style.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And then I just send it out, send it out.

32:36.000 --> 32:47.000
And then and then I go like and then and then like I send it out a million channels and go like, guys, I'm really concerned about this is no one finding this stuff except for me.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
I mean, this is crazy.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I can't believe this is some shits going down.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
You know that 20% of the people are going to go.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Yeah, that's right.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
I'm doing that.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
And then another 20% of the people are going to go.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Yeah, I heard another thing at work.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
And then you just wait two days and one of two things happens.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
Jiffy Lube people are like these people are trying to fucking kill us.

33:04.000 --> 33:10.000
Let's go kill them or nothing happens and it's a win-win because you just then you just go.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Oh, chicken chicken.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
This is this is crazy.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I'm terrified about this.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
We're losing.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
We're losing the meme war.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Right.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
It's there's not.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
I mean, it's weird to talk about it like that, but there's not really another way to push it.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
I mean, I remember in 2004 2008, like Republicans know how to message.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
They say, you know, we're going to call this free handouts.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
We're going to call this not taxing, not tax cuts for the rich.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
And they've done that for more than 10 years, probably way longer, but they are so good at that.

33:38.000 --> 33:45.000
And then, you know, and then so they've evolved and now their online discourse is all in service of this great dishonesty.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
And it just works really well.

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
And then on our side, we, you know, we're shitting our pants and blaming each other and smearing the shit on the other person and saying, you're doing this to me.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
And like, it's not we're losing the meme war.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
It's really bad news.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
You can't any time you go on in a big part of its Russia bots, I'm sure.

34:03.000 --> 34:12.000
But anytime you go on Twitter, it's just like conservatives dominate the discourse when by all accounts, there's probably more liberals on Twitter than conservatives.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
This is the thing that's driving me crazy because having read Steve Silverman's book, we had him as a guest on the show.

34:16.000 --> 34:25.000
The only neurotypical that the autistic community says is allowed to to neuro-splain for them because he spent years writing this big, thick book.

34:25.000 --> 34:32.000
It's a history of autism in America or its diagnosis, which starts in the 70s because they were still cattle prodding people back then.

34:32.000 --> 34:39.000
But the history of the autistic spectrum in the United States, it runs parallel to the history of the Internet.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
It starts with ham radio.

34:41.000 --> 34:54.000
It goes through sci-fi culture and all this stuff because there once upon a time, there were people who in situations of like a party where there's like real punch and Cheetos

34:54.000 --> 35:03.000
and like eye contact, they weren't like, they didn't have as much going up to the plate as they did at home on the ham radio.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
It's Morse code or these things.

35:05.000 --> 35:16.000
It's like the Internet gets created on the backbone of like the silent minority of like geniuses in our country.

35:16.000 --> 35:33.000
People who because they're smart and because as Spock knows, it's more logical to just pick a lane in terms of whether you're good or evil and stick with that and then abide by logic within that lane

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
and raise your eyebrow at the approach of how to protect your species and things.

35:39.000 --> 35:47.000
But at least you've decided, yeah, but if a human gets in a fight with a shark, I'm not going to root for the shark because I'm not a crazy person.

35:47.000 --> 35:53.000
Those people, and yeah, that's what I mean by those people.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
Who do you mean by those people?

35:56.000 --> 36:12.000
Those people gave us the Internet and it's, you know, in there, like 13-year-old Dan Harmon's like starting to talk to people for the first time on a monochromatic monitor and I get to lose my virginity at 16, which is something that never would have happened.

36:12.000 --> 36:25.000
I don't think to this day if it weren't for these like Internet chats combined with, well, let's get together in real life at the local flood ruckers and let's like look at each other where name tags and we can like sneak out to the car and try some stuff.

36:25.000 --> 36:32.000
We can hack our bodies by coming with anyone.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
That's actually normal operations.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
If it came fireworks, that would be a hack.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
That's a real hack.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Something is herpes, that's a hack.

36:41.000 --> 36:55.000
And so it was a place to hide, the Internet was a place where smart people went to hide from their moms, from the laundromat operator.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
For people who couldn't understand complex thought.

36:57.000 --> 37:16.000
From people who, let's even put it even more objectively and say, from people whose IQs were distributed along different parts of, different receptors and transmitters, people who fare better at a party, in a backyard, in a trailer, at the bar, on a snowmobile.

37:16.000 --> 37:25.000
I just rattled off a bunch of things that you associate with right wing people, but in a penthouse, a cocaine or a G, I don't know what is a left wing thing, in a sushi bar.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
In a catwalk with David Bowie.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Get him off the catwalk, what's he doing?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
He's going too far.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
You kicked David Bowie out of this catwalk.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
It's like a CK1 commercial.

37:41.000 --> 37:55.000
So then MySpace and then Facebook and then your mom's on the Internet and then your mom is the Internet, but at the same time, so is your boss, so is your wife, so is your kids, so is your job, so is your job prospects.

37:55.000 --> 38:09.000
When I moved to LA, I went to Kinko's to produce my screenplays so we could be Schrabbing and I could hand them out at parties because we had email, but it's just not how you looked up old friends and said, are you alive?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
This is crazy.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Now it's just like the Internet is the real world.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I'm not telling you anything you don't know.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
The world that we're in right here is fake.

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
That's why there's no audience.

38:23.000 --> 38:41.000
And now it's the worst timing because we need the Hawkman and the Flash Gordon of the political spectrum, which is the smart people and they excelled at the Internet because they never had those specific kind of like tendrils.

38:41.000 --> 38:54.000
So their logic was like where they were actually able to say, hi, my name's Tom, like I'm not that good at talking at the party, but I now am good because I know where to point and click.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Now everyone's pointing and clicking.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
That hasn't changed Tom into a social butterfly and it hasn't made him empathic.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Right.

39:01.000 --> 39:11.000
And now you have a black woman on Twitter saying, hey, I'm mad about this and we got to do this on Wednesday.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
And who's kids are these?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
You got to get our shit together.

39:13.000 --> 39:29.000
And then you have like this odd, well-intended white person going, well, I don't think that pound for pound there's any, I think technically what you're saying is as racist as saying this other thing.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Thank you, Spock, thank you so much.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
This is the exact right time for this.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
This is perfect.

39:34.000 --> 39:45.000
Logic is exactly what we need it right now because logic and it's great conveyors, bullets, tips of spears, arrows, fire, set to your home.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
These things that don't involve understanding other people.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Let's add to all of that.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
It worked 20 years ago.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Now it doesn't.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Your mom's on Facebook now.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
She's an idiot.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
She's being talked to.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
Why are we wrapped about her all the time?

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
Your mom thinks that headlines are truth.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
I almost do.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
I still can't quite get past it.

40:10.000 --> 40:17.000
There's an instinctive thing where I see like a font type that's like bigger than other type underneath it and a byline and a thing.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
And it's like designed in a way that looks like something that used to be called a newspaper.

40:21.000 --> 40:30.000
And I go, ah, newspaper. And then I have to then go, ah, fake newspaper.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
But your mom is like newspaper.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
She never even gets that far.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
And then she just clicks forward to all her friends.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
They're terrified.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Their porcelain birds are rattling.

40:43.000 --> 40:56.000
A 44-year-old philanthropist genius iconoclast, Dan Harmon, is cradling his girlfriend with his rippling biceps while his Iron Man Mark III suit is being assembled in the corner by Jarvis.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And I'm scared.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Your mom is gone.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Egon's gone. Bye-bye.

41:04.000 --> 41:13.000
I feel like she's just, it didn't matter if she started Democrat or fucking, like the Jill Stein voter.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
Your mom at this point is fucking like under the bed.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
And we're doomed.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Sort of.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Sort of.

41:23.000 --> 41:30.000
One of the things that they are good at is the old everything sucks and here's how we're going to fix it and everything sucks and here's how we're going to fix it.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
And we are incredibly bad at we're fixing things.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
We don't have time to tell you what we're doing.

41:36.000 --> 41:43.000
If you look at when Obama left office, everyone had to come to his aid afterwards to discuss the things that he had done in office.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
And the list is 500, 600 things long that he never talked about.

41:47.000 --> 41:56.000
There's this crazy thing that Democrats have where they practice the humility in order to get the job of charity done and then they don't toot their own horn.

41:56.000 --> 42:02.000
There's this kind of legislation that the right benefits from, but you never hear Democrats rub it in their face.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
Half you broke motherfuckers are on ACA.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
You're the people on heroin. You're the people laid off.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
You're the people that this program was set up for.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
The middle class is liberal.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
It's the poorest of the poor that needed ACA that needs Planned Parenthood and all those projects.

42:16.000 --> 42:22.000
But you never hear the Democrats cut to the chase and say, I'm talking to you.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
I'm talking to just one person who gets $5 coffee.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
I'm talking to your broke ass who needs things like EDD and free college.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
We don't toot our own horn because sometimes we're too busy actually doing the job.

42:34.000 --> 42:41.000
There's a little bit of hope and faith in there that says they'll figure out that we're the ones behind these great programs.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
She never pushed her agenda. The current Democrats aren't pushing their agenda.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
Right now the Democrats look like they're failing us, but the truth in the press.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
The truth is we've stopped all these bands. We've stopped all this crazy ass behavior.

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
There are incredible Democratic leaders. They happen to be female, which is why they're not getting any play.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Then they happen to be African American, Hispanic, and Asian.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Gross.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
I know, right?

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
Here's the thing though. We do send you the people that you're thinking aren't going to be able to do the job.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
One of the great things that this party does is send in an old black woman to get some shit done

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
because the Republicans think they can defeat her and they'll be asleep at it.

43:17.000 --> 43:25.000
That's part of the problem is that it looks really dark, but on the ground we sort of know we're out here.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
We're out here physically going door to door and figuring out how we can stop these people.

43:30.000 --> 43:38.000
We may not brag about it and we may not have a marketing budget, but the truth of the matter is there's been some heroes.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
There's probably a million of them.

43:41.000 --> 43:48.000
By definition, heroes end up getting suffocated.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
They weren't trying to breathe though. I don't need to be Morgan Freeman about it.

43:53.000 --> 44:03.000
Some of us knew that when we got on that burning ship that was headed towards the town that it was going to go down with us on it.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
We don't give a fuck about that. We don't mind that.

44:06.000 --> 44:13.000
There's nothing more hardcore, more ride or die about saying, I did this for the group and you can suck these balls.

44:13.000 --> 44:21.000
The dude who just did it for his family and ripped off a country so that his kids could have 100 million 50, 60, 70 years from now,

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
that's not really a baller. That's not really a tough person. That's not a G.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
A G is when you're like, I'm fucking down a ride. I know this is going to get my head shot off.

44:30.000 --> 44:37.000
It's like a chryspostatic shit where you're like, somebody got to start this motherfucking party. We have those people. We just don't talk about them.

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
That's the thing is that I had to confront my cowardice and my comfort level being threatened when I was like, I was like,

44:42.000 --> 44:48.000
I'm not going to church went and took photos at the, you know, Pershing Square and stuff.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
I was like, somebody's going to set off a fucking lunchbox bomb or something.

44:52.000 --> 45:01.000
And as like my therapist is going, that's okay. You're a pacifist. If you find out you're a pacifist because baseball bats come out, you're a pussy.

45:01.000 --> 45:08.000
It's too late to find out you're a pacifist. It's not. It's when everyone finds out they're a pacifist.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
But it's like, and she's like, look, you got to stop.

45:13.000 --> 45:22.000
Because I was saying like, for 20 years, I talked like Noam Chomsky, you know, read half of one of his books. And I'm like, so left of left of left of anarchist like power to the people.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
And there's no such thing as race. It's just a division that's vertical. They're trying to distract you from the horizontal divisions.

45:28.000 --> 45:40.000
And we need to fucking like, but really it was a fucking dodge because it was saying, I was going like, yeah, red, red election, blue election.

45:40.000 --> 45:48.000
Wake me up when politics gets real because there's going to be people in the street beating the fuck out of each other. That's how you know when it's real.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
Bye bye. I'm going to like, like, I'm fucking like, I was such a dodge. I didn't know it.

45:53.000 --> 46:03.000
But it was and it's like, no, they're there. Dan, they're tomorrow. People are going to get like, as far as you know, you have a feeling someone's going to get their brains beaten in.

46:03.000 --> 46:09.000
Something's going to blow up. Something's going to get thrown. Start on fire. You could be there with a blanket. Put it out.

46:09.000 --> 46:16.000
Help the person. You could be the person that they beat up because you look a little bigger than the lady next to you.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
You could just go there and walk the walk like what you're talking about.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
For the Black Lives Matter march is what we wanted were white people around us.

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
We wanted white people in the crowd because we knew that ain't nobody going to get killed when there's assets.

46:31.000 --> 46:39.000
When we love being a ring of white people around a bunch of black people, when it means that the black people are going to come over and play Balder Dash on Wednesday,

46:39.000 --> 46:46.000
and we can teach them what a fucking trying to think of a mojito is.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
That's not white people.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
What a white cocktail is.

46:53.000 --> 46:59.000
You got a full menu and you pick mojito.

46:59.000 --> 47:05.000
I'd love to know about these suburban enchiladas. Is that what you white people call them?

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
A Chandler's Fizz. I had to make one up.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
But we don't want to...

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
That's the other thing on Twitter. It's like white people standing next to black people. It's always the funniest thing when black people are like,

47:19.000 --> 47:29.000
you know, let's face it, I screen grabbed it because I was like, this is classic.

47:29.000 --> 47:35.000
There was a woman of color, if you believe Twitter avatar, saying something like,

47:35.000 --> 47:45.000
she's just saying like, you know, it's worse on us than it is on you.

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
Liberals are all waking up to this idea.

47:51.000 --> 47:57.000
And then just this fucking flood. Not a Nazi in sight. Not a conservative in sight.

47:57.000 --> 48:05.000
Not a pepe. No alt-right needed. Just because the clot that floods to that wound was all liberal white people going like,

48:05.000 --> 48:11.000
wait a minute, this is not what I signed up for when I decided to care about you people.

48:11.000 --> 48:17.000
A little gratitude wouldn't hurt here. You know, they didn't say those things literally, but the way they expressed that is just logic, logic, logic, logic.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
They go, actually, I don't think that's true.

48:21.000 --> 48:29.000
And it's like, we can't give them this. That's bad advertising for the revolution.

48:29.000 --> 48:39.000
True, it's a power. Down with the thing. Get the pitchforks in the church. Hey, after we finish this, maybe we'll have a beer together.

48:39.000 --> 48:47.000
I don't know, man. It's not a good time to, you want to yes and you're throng.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
That's how Frankensteins get chased, you know?

48:51.000 --> 48:59.000
Nobody goes like, kill the monster and Jews later.

48:59.000 --> 49:05.000
Kill the monster. That's a way to talk to a fellow monster killer.

49:05.000 --> 49:11.000
You have to admit, Yoshi, you're pretty stereotypical.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
I'm Japanese.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
Yeah, it is. Remember how fun it used to be to be dark?

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
Fuck no. Jealous for all my life. Tell me about it.

49:25.000 --> 49:31.000
Oh, you mean cynical. It used to be like, fuck this fucking new taco shop.

49:31.000 --> 49:39.000
Gen X, David Cross generation baby, Janeane Garofalo, flannel shirt, hands in the pockets, look at the floor.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
I don't fucking care. Spin doctors don't look like kiss because we're fucking real.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
That's right. It was a blast. You could talk shit on.

49:45.000 --> 49:51.000
We don't wash our hair. You could say, I don't like this juice. This juice is natural. I don't like this fucking wallpaper. I don't like this. I don't like that.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
If I've heard of it, it sucks. That's right. Good sign.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
You've never heard of this fucking band because they meet in an alley. It's only like four dudes and they don't even cut vinyl.

50:00.000 --> 50:07.000
Well, I'll listen to them while you're telling me about them. But if I find out someone told you about them, I'm fucking, I'm not going to be your friend anymore.

50:07.000 --> 50:14.000
Yeah, they suck now because they make money at this shit. So we hate them. It used to be, we had a great run of that.

50:14.000 --> 50:22.000
And like you said, there was a ton of comics that came out of that era of being able to like really make fun of the world and where we were from a very elevated place.

50:22.000 --> 50:33.000
And now we don't want to be dark. Like if that's how you made your money, you're not really into like, don't think suck. I think it's, that's how hard it is.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
It's so hard.

50:34.000 --> 50:40.000
Well, it starts with Muppet movies, frankly. It starts with shit like that where it's like, oh, you can't hate on the Muppets.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Yeah.

50:41.000 --> 50:48.000
There's a, there's a hip comedy person in that movie. Like, come on, we all grew up on the Muppets. It's always, it's always infantilization.

50:48.000 --> 50:56.000
Like, oh, come on. Good Night Moon is the bomb. Like the Good Night Moon movie brought to you by General Electric.

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
We make cluster bombs. We also bring good things to life.

51:01.000 --> 51:11.000
We'll tell you one of those two things during this production of Good Night Moon with Ted Danson as the moon.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
It will be Goldberg as a starfish.

51:15.000 --> 51:29.000
And then because you don't want to be on the side of bad shit, which the Republican right wing, the fear mongering side, the, the, the, the skexies.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Skexies.

51:31.000 --> 51:49.000
They have that advantage. They detach themselves from Gestalt. They don't feel like if they make the case that racism is okay in order to get what they want,

51:49.000 --> 52:02.000
that they don't worry about the, like, reverse Midas touch of, oh, I'm going to protect my daughter, make sure she can go to good schools by, by hitting these talking points.

52:02.000 --> 52:13.000
And these talking points, it's like, it's almost like that, that linguistics is where, is where the atomic fission is, is that liberals think words are magic.

52:13.000 --> 52:22.000
We think that if you say abracadabra and you really believe in it, if you believe you're invincible, if you believe that Tinkerbell can come back to life, then she can.

52:22.000 --> 52:31.000
But no one wants to risk anything. No one wants to run up on stage and bring Tinkerbell back to life. The Republicans get to go, Tinkerbell's already dead.

52:31.000 --> 52:37.000
Who thinks that we should hang that person for doing it? And it's really easy to raise your hand.

52:37.000 --> 52:46.000
Yeah, demagoguery. I mean, it worked in Rome, right? Like, it's, it's a very tried and true tradition. It's very effective.

52:46.000 --> 52:55.000
And so it's like, well, what are you supposed to do when you're, when, when, when the, how are you supposed to not become the thing you hate, if the thing you hate is hating?

52:55.000 --> 53:06.000
You can't. That's what I think. I mean, we, I'm not saying join the hate, but like, I don't, how do you beat demagoguery other than being more popular than a demagogue and being always, isn't actually being a demagogue lame and aren't I cool and isn't there parties here?

53:06.000 --> 53:13.000
Like, I don't know. There's not, you can't be a spoil sport and say demagoguery sucks. This demagogue is, is not cool.

53:13.000 --> 53:22.000
Because nobody wants to be told what to do. And if they, you know, it's like, unless by a demagogue, but, but, but the, but okay, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I hit rock bottom.

53:22.000 --> 53:30.000
I'm coming back up. I'm not going to do this to you. And thank you for being here in lieu of Duncan Trussell, who's like also like, I put him in the same drawer as you.

53:30.000 --> 53:39.000
You're like, you're guys that like, you know, it's like what I'm doing is easy. It's like heavy and like I curl up in a ball, I suck my thumb and I sink to the bottom of the pool.

53:39.000 --> 53:49.000
And I associate that with like transformation, but I'm reliant on people. If you were down there going like, I would be like, we'd be dead.

53:49.000 --> 53:55.000
Like I'd be dead anyway, because like, but you're up there going like, yeah, but come on, fucking float piece of shit.

53:55.000 --> 54:01.000
I know our numbers are bigger. I know that there's more of us trying to save the world.

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
Oh, I thought you meant the podcast numbers. Well, now that I know that our numbers are bigger. Yes.

54:05.000 --> 54:19.000
But, but, but I do think I think that the key is it's like, if the question is how do you, how do you beat hate? If, if you don't want to hate it, because if you hate it, you hate and then hate, hate, hate and it spreads.

54:19.000 --> 54:28.000
And then we were also sick of hearing about, you forgot the Rust Belt. You should be friendly to a hillbilly today on the internet. You should do like, there's something in between there.

54:28.000 --> 54:44.000
My therapist was getting at like, it's like, we, we have to, we have to be ourselves even more than we thought you ever had to be like the definition of being honest.

54:44.000 --> 55:00.000
What we didn't realize that it was spoiled, along with a sea of like, badness that we could counter by, for instance, in the 90s culture going, yeah, but I don't want to buy prel.

55:00.000 --> 55:20.000
Right. Because it's got a logo. But, but like, it was that easy to revolt back then. It's getting harder and harder and harder to revolt against hatred. It's becoming increasingly clear that, that the only way we're ever going to beat it is with genuine love.

55:20.000 --> 55:39.000
And we are constantly running up against these moments anecdotally, where we're, the trolls aren't smart, but they, because they're dumb, and because we want to beat them and strangle them out of existence, we just keep finding out that we are full of more hate than we thought.

55:39.000 --> 55:55.000
And it's not like, it's like, we have to actually learn how to love. We, and it doesn't mean like, just see some grody piece of shit that you don't like being around, and pretending that you like them or respect them.

55:55.000 --> 56:05.000
Politeness is a big problem right now, or it's, or it's, or it's rather it's, it's not a problem anymore, because we've, that market has crashed.

56:05.000 --> 56:16.000
But if, if, if, if we're living in the 1929 right now, the things leading to it that you would be learning about in history, culturally, one of the things would be politeness.

56:16.000 --> 56:30.000
And I, I'm sorry, but we were always like the road comics were always right about that, that the PC thing. I know that the bad guys right now are still harping on that PC culture.

56:30.000 --> 56:39.000
We don't have the language to separate these things, but the truth is we started building a, we had a grain of sand in our oyster called, like, classism.

56:39.000 --> 56:48.000
And we started fucking swirling it around in our little mucus pouch and coating it with secretions of how do you do, ma'am, and nice to see you.

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
And yes, I believe you're an equal. And now we got a big fat, grody pearl of, it's just a bad metaphor.

56:53.000 --> 57:02.000
It's a great metaphor. It's incredibly valuable and very smooth. Very valuable though. But it's a pearl of, very disruptive. Like it's, it's, it's a pearl so big that the oyster has burst open.

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
What is the pearl? It's a, it's, it's, it's the Ragnarok.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
Okay. Right. Cause the grain of sand was classism and it kind of just built and snowballed.

57:13.000 --> 57:21.000
It's the unspoken shit that we weren't dealing with in the first place. You know, we went from the 70s. I hate to, I hate to Gen X bully everybody.

57:21.000 --> 57:32.000
But Brandon and I will tell you, we had nailed it around 1979. As we crossed into the 1980s, we were just about to break dance our way into true equality.

57:32.000 --> 57:40.000
It was in all the papers. Gangs were break dancing to settle their disputes. We had replaced shoelaces with velcro.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Oh yeah.

57:42.000 --> 57:49.000
Michael Jackson had not yet been assailed by a conspiracy of liars. No, I'm kidding.

57:49.000 --> 57:57.000
What changed though? Because we did kind of backslide, especially in TV and stuff, right? Didn't represent like, was it representation getting a lot better?

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
And then just something happened and it kind of just got sent back 20 years. Like what happened?

58:01.000 --> 58:08.000
I don't know. We went to commerce is what happened. We had Wall Street crashes. People were pitted against one another that had never been pitted against one another before.

58:08.000 --> 58:16.000
Right. So at one point in America, you did have, you did have people started to equalize and sort of make money regardless of who you were.

58:16.000 --> 58:23.000
Everybody was on the up. And then we broke some deals that we had, which were we weren't going to lay off the people in the middle of the country.

58:23.000 --> 58:29.000
We weren't going to do that to the manufacturing base. We were going to help those people learn computers. We were going to help those people learn automation.

58:29.000 --> 58:40.000
We weren't going to break unions and we weren't going to take your house from you. We broke those three deals, which made the average American suddenly be very poor and then they were ripe for the picking.

58:40.000 --> 58:49.000
We started a war on the poor in the 80s. We decided to do that. We decided to deregulate. We decided to economically, it starts with economic policy, tax breaks.

58:49.000 --> 58:59.000
You know, in order to do this, we're going to need to have the government not do as much. Okay, well, let's make, let's just have a war on the poor.

58:59.000 --> 59:07.000
Well, there's a lot more of them than there are of us. Are there, when you divide them up by every little tiny itty bitty thing that you can divide them by?

59:07.000 --> 59:20.000
Are there really more of them? No. Let's get them back away from Archie Bunker where people are talking about the shit and let's go right into Night Rider where the black guy is talking in rhymes while he fixes kit between adventures.

59:20.000 --> 59:27.000
And it's not a deliberate, I'm sorry if Glenn Larson is watching and he's like, God damn it, that was a progressive choice.

59:27.000 --> 59:39.000
They wanted that to be a big titted woman and I fucking moved society forward. I'm sorry Glenn Larson. I'm not, I'm sure that's true and I'm not saying, I'm just saying like it's kind of, it's about the ethos.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
It's like you see that happening on TV. That's the only thing I know about society. It's like, yeah, I don't know.

59:45.000 --> 59:55.000
Also, it's an ongoing war. So what you, what we're paying attention to right now is the viciousness that is coming in, but we're not really paying attention to how many years we have successfully held them back.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So if you're looking at it from, I have to always remind myself from a civil rights perspective, we did a great job after the 70s and we were able to hold these very evil forces back through the 70s, through the 80s, and then it got dicey in the 90s.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And now we're not all the way back, but we have lost a battleground.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:26.000
We had racism as a thing that we had figured out to be, you should be ashamed of. That actually took a lot of doing. You and I were both born after that transaction occurred.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yes.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:45.000
So we don't even understand what it might be like to be in 1961 and be like, well, yeah, but black people are different and hating them is how I pay my rent. A good person might be feeling that way.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:57.000
We don't understand how that concept works because we were born into a world where we had decided at some summit called the fucking work of all of the civil rights movement that, okay, racism is officially bad.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000
The villains have shown their true colors. We know how this works. Here we go. Welcome children of the 70s to the dawn of the age of Aquarius.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Racism is bad. And then we're like, racism is bad, which racism is bad.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And then our neighbor didn't return our lawn mower. And I'm like, that guy's racist. Or like it just got too comfortable.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:39.000
It's like racism got so bad. So we agreed that racism was bad to the point where idiots, hateful idiots, terrible, lynch mob oriented, authoritarianistic, sheeple, if you will, red pillars even, could just know that racism was bad

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
and just write a letter to TV guide and call them racist when they wanted TV guide to change the way they did things.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And then that also coincides with that population suddenly gets money. They've been monetized since World War Two. They're able to spend.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
We realize as a country that we can actually make money off of these people so that being racist becomes inefficient.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And then that also coincides with women also becoming wealthier. So what they do at the top is they sort of go, look, I don't have to just underpay you.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I could underpay your wife too. And they begin to split us. And neither one of us are doing better.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And what do you guys got kids? Whoa, what'd you do that for? Why are you going to make another American for you fucking gross people?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Right.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Like, oh, what do you mean? Where are you going? You're going to get an abortion? Whoa, I never said you could do that.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
They criminalize being a woman, which is the same tactic that they used with Mexicans and Asians and blacks.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Criminalizing a woman is a great way to criminalize being poor. If you criminalize the woman in every family, the poor families are going to crumble before the families they can get a nanny.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Right.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
God damn it, we figured it out.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:52.000
But the good news is they left a bunch of holes in this recent attack, which is that because it's based on policy and because it's based on the sweeping legislation,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:01.000
what we can do is on a grassroots effort, hand to hand, talk to one another, no internet, just talk to your neighbor, get involved, do those things, and they won't see that.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:10.000
One of the things that I always say is when I was working for Planned Parenthood, volunteering in the neighborhoods, I never bumped into a Republican.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
That's how I know we can succeed.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:22.000
On forensic files, they always use, whenever they don't have DNA or thumbprints or anything, it's like geographic forensics always.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:31.000
They're like, criminals are lazy. Everyone's lazy. Not criminals. People are lazy. Criminals are people. If you were going to rob someone, how far from your house would you go?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And they're like, oh, these are the three houses that were robbed. They ring a doorbell. You're under arrest. God damn it.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I always said, if you want to find your mistress, if you're a wife and you want to find your husband's mistress, just take a walk up the block.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Because men are fucking lazy and they're not going to go that far.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Yeah. Google his office and then look what hotel is.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:13.000
So laziness. Hatred appeals to you by saying you won't have to do much. And so that's the thing is like, I haven't pierced that membrane where it's like, something about love makes you like, it's like the way that I feel about Cody,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:21.000
feeling that about strangers is the, that's the solution. It's the way that we could beat them.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I don't need you to do that. I mean, I don't need to rub your toes on my nipple and call me daddy, but it's all going to come out in her TBS show anyway, so get used to it now.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Call me daddy on TBS.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:51.000
At least my fucked up shit's up here. It's going to be me and Elijah Wood left with everybody. I don't know. I'm trying to figure out who the last straight white guy's going to be that's like standing side by side with me. That's all of male Hollywood.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I was like, is it going to be, who's it going to be?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Ashton Kutcher.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I think Jerry O'Connell.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
That's hilarious.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:05.000
He seems, but he seems like a nice guy is not cutting it anymore. Like we had a conversation at my friends, my neighbor's house.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
He's a great guy.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I imagine this conversation is going on all over LA. Everybody pops open a beer and then everyone starts going like, well, who's next?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Who do you think and who's last and who's things and like the anecdotes that are coming out at these fireside chats among Hollywood elites?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
It's pretty amazing. And yet not amazing at all because here's the thing.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I don't incriminate myself by saying this because I never worked anywhere near him, but really if you worked in Los Angeles, you knew everything that we learned about Kevin Spacey.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And I'm not saying that to further vilify him and high road anybody. I'm saying that to self-account and say, this stuff that is coming to light is stuff that I think the biggest...

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
It occurred increasingly to me that actually this has been a Hollywood problem and it's rooted in a gender problem.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It's a magnification of the gender problem where the Hollywood problem is, which is...

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
This is about labor abuse in Hollywood. This is about prostitution.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
It's about the fact that Hollywood has had a free pass as a workplace.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It has not bound itself to the same laws as Jiffy Lube, which is crazy because the guy at Jiffy Lube has to be very careful what he says to Brenda from Marketing in the copy room, even though he's covered in oil.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And I'm not. We're privy to more fucked up shit. If you knew the stories at Jiffy Lube, you'd be like, I don't want that guy changing my oil.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:07:00.000
And it's not because we had a double standard. It's because everyone currently in Hollywood comes here as a pilgrim of fantasy and wonderment.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Everyone has read the stories and the biographies of their favorite people. They've picked sides. They've decided, well, I'm not a this guy fan.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I'm a this guy fan. And I hope to be like this guy one day. So I'm going to emulate him or her. And we're so focused. It's a community of workaholics.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:31.000
And every young squire that comes out is a workaholic is saying like, hey, can you abuse me? Because I want to be Dolly Parton one day.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I want to be Otto Preminger. I want to be I want to run Hollywood. I want to work for everything so focused on the work that we we are indoctrinated into a society that says, and then plus all that fucked up shit happens at the rat party.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And we don't treat it the same way you would at a Christmas party for your for your tax company.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Right. And it's kind of natural because it's like we are making a movie. It's not like we're we're selling paper reams at like Scranton or whatever.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Like, like, it's going to be this thing that we we all have to do and then it'll be over, you know, like you kind of get sucked into this.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:17.000
It's like a tour kind of thing or we'll just we'll just make it happen. I guess it is kind of it feels different, I guess, than just if it's like, yeah, if it's Brenda from accounting or something.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Also, Brenda from accounting has never gone through a casting process. That's part of the very nature of our business is is beef and battle and the way you look and and the way you look on film.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Well, you didn't you didn't talk right to that person at that party. Every every story you hear about your favorite people, no matter how pristine they are.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000
All of those stories, if you really break them down, you hear the story of this is how Barbara Streisand got her big break.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
It's it's not she lifted a rock and threw it at a lion that was attacking.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Right.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Bud Friedman, I don't know. I'll look it up later.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000
The it's it's it's a conversation. It's like a quippy one liner.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Yeah, it's and that is that makes it like there's no oil to change in between those conversations where you can go, hey, you suck at changing oil or your your Jiffy lubes are not showing a profit.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:26.000
It's like, no, you're these movies are great. And then this studio was doing great. And like all these people are either getting famous or not famous based on legends of how charismatic they were.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And if you already don't have a society based on reason and respect, and there's an industry based on charisma, right?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
It shouldn't shock us to be realizing that there's a lot of potato bugs under that rock.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:50.000
You cannot hold these these huge rooms full of 20 somethings and then have a bunch of men making decisions based on that and expect that to work out.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And it's not just sexual. It's like, like, how many, you know, it's like, like, like the fucking the goddamn it's weird how people talk to each other sometimes like casting directors, assistants talking to someone who's dropping off a package.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000
It's even weird like you you would witness it and go like that was a little odd. Yeah.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:19.000
But it's not like we're all out here being mean to each other either. It's like you're either that or you're like this paladin that's like all gleaming and charming and whatever.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I'm being a dead horse. But what would be awesome is if we had men turning and men, which men should do because men who abuse women abuse men.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:36.000
If we would actually weed these people out, it would go a lot farther than waiting for 15 women to actually have to take this guy down.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
It would go something like this. And I pull out this little list.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Alan Alda.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And that's the thing is that people say, did you know in Hollywood about these guys? And the truth of the matter is, yeah, we all know, not just in Hollywood, you know, if you work at a Jiffy Lube, if you work at a McDonald's, wherever you work, you know the dude that's standing next to you that's being a jerk.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.000
It's just that we're not manning up. And that is the definition of manning up.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Because you don't want to be a pack of dogs and you bring back a wolf and then the wolf come in and bite the other dog. You should have killed that wolf.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Yeah, it's like, it feels like prison or mafia culture, too, though, where you're like, because I'm listening to this, that Providence Rhode Island podcast.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:30.000
There's a lot of guys with these really sexy Rhode Island accents. Even the fucking guy that's hosting the show is like, they sound manlier than me because it's like, I don't know, they just sound like, they sound like this and they, I don't know, I'm trying to do it.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:42.000
That's how they sounded to me. It was, what are you going to do? You know, it's just the way it was. It's like, you know, a guy's got a problem, you know, I got a bigger problem, you know, you take care of the problem.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:58.000
But it's like, it's like guys are like, like, oh, like, we're really like susceptible to that. It's like, we go like, oh, oh, so I don't want to be on the wrong side of that, not because we're not necessarily because we're like, oh, I'm like, Dobby and Harry Potter, I'm born to serve.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:14.000
It's like, it's actually the other part of you. It's the alpha part of you. I think that has the train coupling for that. Because you go, oh, that's, that sounds refreshing, a society that is built on, on callous hands and, and horse sense.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Because I just think about the times when I had a conversation with anybody, strangers in bars, grandfathers who were marines and, and like, listening to, you know, watching movies about these guys, it's like, there's this, there's this boner you get filled with.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:52.000
It's a heart boner. It's like, it's like, like, where you go like, oh, yeah. That's the, that's a man. And I don't know, it's like, I'm just saying cliches, but it's like, it's, it's important to realize that too, that it's like, it's a part of it.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It's not, it's, it's not like, you're a, you're a beta, if you're afraid of an alpha, you actually more have to own the little alpha inside your beta, because being a, if you were truly committed to being a beta,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I think, you know, okay, let's all be betas. In other words, let's think of the other person first.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Yeah.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000
It's the little baby alpha in you. It's the, that, that, that chimpanzee that's like, I'm a beta because I can't afford to be an alpha right now.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:29.000
But that guy really, hey, I really like the cut of his jib. He really gets shit done. I love that. You see how he just reached out and just grabbed that problem and just shoved it into a car.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Right.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Just cut its head off with a table saw and just dabbed his lips with a napkin. I don't know how manhood works. I'm making it up.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I can't, I can't riff manhood drugs.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
A real man dabs his lips with a napkin.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And calls it a napkin. That's my favorite part.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Well, Pat, Pat, Patton Oswalt has this. Did you see his comedy special?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Yes, of course.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
He tells the story about the, the power lifter guy.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Yes.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And, and then the guy coming up and it just like Patton Oswalt is, you know, Patton Oswalt is how I picture myself when I'm thinking and talking.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:12.000
So like, if you ever, like, that's, like, that's my, that's, that's my inner, that's my avatar.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:24.000
But he's telling a story like we know that Patton Oswalt doesn't want to hurt anybody, but he's telling this story about this time he saw this one guy lift another guy and drop him and he exploded into blood.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And then the guy went back to his friends as if he hadn't done anything.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And it's like, like, there's something eerie about the compatibility there.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Like we, I'll speak for myself.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Like, I'm just like, yeah, I, at the end of the day, the reason why I would punch a Nazi or run from one has everything to do with what I think a man is supposed to do.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:58.000
It doesn't even, it's like, the reason why I'm anti fascist more than I'm a scared of communism is because my grandpas lied about their age to go into the Marines and fight fascism.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And I feel embarrassed in front of their ghosts because I never helped them lay cement in the driveway.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I was like, I'm going to go, I got, I think I got homework.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Yeah, no, that's, that's not, you know, the deal, manhood comes in so many different ways, but none of them are violent.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
That's what a dumb person does.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
There, there is nothing to do with being a man that is using your fists to hurt another person.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Well, right, like the black guy in that story just lifts the other guy up and drops him and explodes like a tarantula.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And he also did something that got the guy away.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
He didn't stand and engage the dude and box the dude and wrestle the dude.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
When he came up, showed him his strength and he dropped him and walked away.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
That, that is awful.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
But he did try what a man is supposed to do.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Really, what a man is supposed to do.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
It's supposed to have a command of English that lets the other man know I'm not interested in fighting you.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I'm not going to be no bitch.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000
But I'm also not interested in fighting you because what a man understands is that there's women, there's people around.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
They're going to be scarred by whatever you're about to do, the two of you.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
And you don't want to do that to people.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:10.000
It's not manly to fight. It's manly to figure out a way to get the fuck up out of there so you can get back to your 60, $70,000 year job.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
You're a man.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Go to work, file the papers, do the surgery.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Don't be out on the streets like gladiators.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
We, we luckily have evolved to a point where you never have to hit another man.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
You never have to hit one.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You can get in your car, you can drive off.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And when cops show up because they're armed men whose job it is to suppress shit like that,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
they will ask you, what the fuck were you thinking?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Don't strike another man.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
You're a grown ass man.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
They're not going to side with you.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
No, no one is ever going to look at you and go, I'm so glad you punched that Nazi.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And if they are, they're not right, dude.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
That's not a man.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
A man figures out a way to buy the Nazi's house, flood his bathroom.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:03.000
You don't want to be the man that, that is fist to cuffing it.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
You want to be the man that's like, ha ha, motherfucker, no more mat for you.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
We're only asking, I'm only asking these questions because of to bring it back to the other thing,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
the internet thing.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
It's like we were also raised in a culture where information will set us free,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.000
where the bad guys are ziplipped and they don't like communication

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
and that they do their work in the darkness and the good guys shine spotlights

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
and they go in the 80s movies, the nerd who takes power always does it by going like,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
can I get everyone's attention?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I'm a nerd and I just wore a mask to trick a woman into letting her eat me out.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So let's put a pin in that.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
That movie's problematic.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000
But the, the, the, the, it's all, every single movie like that from the 80s,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
there's always the scene where the cafeteria's attention is directed

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and forget about like the teenage, teenage culture.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
It's even also just like every hero myth that we have so far was always about,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
we got to get the word out.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Oh, look, look out the window.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Look, all the people, they got the word.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Right.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Or the tape plays and then you hear the wiretap of the senator going,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
you think I care about these animal people?

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
And everyone goes like, wow, I heard the truth.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
The movie's over.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
No more lies.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Wow.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Those lies were building up for 90 minutes and 20 years.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Now, enter an era where you can't, no more lies.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I heard it over the loudspeaker going home and now we're just like every morning

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000
we get up and we're like, uh, stop with the truth and the lie truth

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
and the truth lies and the, and the, like, like it does it.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So now what, now we're all thinking about punching people because I was like,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
there ain't no muckrake in going on.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
If you, if you like prove that Baloney's made sloppy now,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
no one's going to give you a Pulitzer.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Maybe they will, but maybe the Pulitzer people have their shit together.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I'd say it just doesn't feel like a recourse to heroism anymore to go like,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
aha, look, look how dark the world is.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I found some darkness over in this corner with my flashlight.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Everyone's going to go like, no shit.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Yeah.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
That's what I'm saying.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
That's what used to be.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Why don't you conserve those batteries?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
It used to be fun.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
We were pointing out shit that was really interesting because it was dark and now,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
no, now we don't want to, we don't want to see that darkness.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
We're dealing with our own darkness.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Fuck.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
All right.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
But, but, but we're going to learn how to love.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
We are going to learn how to love and, and, and, and I'm going to love people.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
It's easier like by loving myself and like not thinking of myself as like the

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
end all be all things.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
That's like my therapist is like, I'll just drama like, oh, you were an anarchist

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
and now you're a pussy and like, like, like, like it all has to do with you.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
It's like, it's like you're too, it's just like be other people.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Yeah.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
It's like, like, like feel, you're an obscure person.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
You're just a regular guy.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Like, like, like, like you're going through changes.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Society is going through changes.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
You're moving along with it.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Like you don't have to like have, you don't have to be the best at something,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
the worst at something.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And this doesn't have to represent everything.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
It's like, you're just a dude.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Just like fucking.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And now the challenge is don't use that as an excuse to like avoid processing.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Like now you have to go, I'm afraid of this.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I like this.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
This makes me sad.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
This makes me angry.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I could be wrong.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I was wrong yesterday, blah, blah, blah.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And it's like kind of a challenge to narcissists.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Because Facebook was a great friend that showed up and had a bunch of stories to

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
tell and it got really cool.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
And then as we all built it up and Twitter is the same as we all built it up and

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
gave it all this information so that it could love us more.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
We discovered that it became bipolar.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And now when you listen to your old friend Twitter, your old friend Facebook,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
they're really only focusing on the roughest of the rough.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And that is not reality.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I took a week off.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I didn't, didn't log in, didn't clock in, didn't use my laptop for anything

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
other than writing.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And the world did not change.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Nothing happened.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
My brain got better.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I started to see more shit out there, but that's part of the problem.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Is that that new TV of the laptop is, and the computer is sort of got you able

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
to see the bad that you wouldn't have seen before.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And it's not that bad.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It's really not that.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I know it looks and sounds so scary when you, when you look at it.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
But the truth of the matter is kids are still going to school safely every morning.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Doctors are still saving lives in surgery.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Puerto Rico's fucked up.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
But for the most part, America still has like, it still has itself.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Don't normalize.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I'm not normalizing.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
You black people are always normalizing.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Well, that's one of the things is like, yeah, if you were, if you're black, you've been

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
on the shift for like four years.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
We've been inundated with lynchings and shootings and hanging.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
And what you would, for a second, you really had to be like, good God, if I walk outside

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
of my house, I'm going to get murdered.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
The truth of the matter is they, they're hyping you, man.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
They're trying to make you feel like there are more police shootings than ever.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
They're trying to make you feel like there's all this other shit going down and it's, it's,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
there's not.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000
And if there is, it's because like you said, we're in the middle of sort of a change and

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
it looks a little rough right now, but it's, it's not like what we're looking at.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
But those mass shooting statistics are spiking, right?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Like there's a, I don't know about spiking.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
They're, they're going out, but there's been a, the thing is like, it's not mass shootings though.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
It's, it's, it's regular sized shootings that kill most of the people.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Right.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I mean, there's, there's, there's a shooting with about four, four plus victims every single

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
week and has been basically for two years or something.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Like those, that's what adds up, you know?

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
It's a mass tragedy.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
It's a mass tragedy, but like at the end of the day, if you're talking about loss of life,

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
it's not just mass shootings that we have to worry about.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
It's, you know, car accidents and mass shootings and heart attacks.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Right.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Healthcare.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
All right.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
How long have I been indulging myself?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Oh, Jesus.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
All right.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Let's do one rap cause I want to do one without the audience.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Is there a beat?

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Can I get a beat?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:06.000
But now I was thinking with the, you just do this while I, while I talk, don't, don't

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
let anything I say distract you from beat picking.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:20.000
But, but I was thinking like, like beat picking an advantage of the, of the, of the, of the,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
of the no audience format could be that.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Sorry.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
We, we, we did, uh, I could put headphones on.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
We're not going to do that this week.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I could put headphones on and hear the beat.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
You could do it too.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Like we hear the metronome.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000
We hear the beat, but then we wrap into the live stream and then somebody out there, like

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
these guys are really good at like they take the stuff and then they can add music and

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
they'd have them cleaner audio.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I hear what you're saying.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I did a thing.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I did a thing at the top of last week's podcast of the booth that was, I just did the, I just

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:57.000
riffed this like a Harmontown thing and, and, and this audio engineer, Harry, like he, uh,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000
he, he added like all this, he like produced it and it was like, it sounds fucking amazing.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.000
It's like, I don't know how he put me on tempo and like, uh, we didn't start with it because

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
it's like, it's very gospel and there was a horrible church shooting.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And it's like, I was like, I don't know if I'm being overcooked, but I was just like,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I don't know.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I don't even want to get those dots connected.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
We could probably, we could play it now that you set it up, you know, you already, you

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
already like created deniability.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Right.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
All right.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.000
So by the time, you know, by the time this goes out, the, we'll all be over the church

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
shooting.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Oh yeah.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
The beat.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Okay.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Okay.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
You ready?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Yo.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Yo.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Yo.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Yo.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Yo.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Yo.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Yo.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Yo.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Yo.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Yo.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Yo.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Yo.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Yo.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Bro.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Yo.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Yo.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Yo.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Trees.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Leaves.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Roots.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Sleeves.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Dirt.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Earth.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Pebbles.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Base.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Chick.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Chick.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Chick.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Travel.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Wrapping at you.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
With my lips.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I fucked your mama so hard.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I sunk her to these ships.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Trafalgar.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Water.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Lou.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
It was her end.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I fucked your mama so hard.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
She made my penis bend.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
She's like a pussy prism.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:31.000
She made my dick contort and refract and reflect of the world's worst things.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I made your mama sing.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
She said, la, la, la, la.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I love Dan's penis.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I'm committed to your mom.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I'm gonna take her to the prom even though I'm 44 and she's 50.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
We thought that it would be nifty.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
It's not nostalgia.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
It's not the school we went to.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Picking one at random and seeing what they do when a middle aged couple walks in the

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
door and pretends that it's their prom and gets on the dance floor.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Will they police us?

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Will they try to stop the beat?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
I don't know.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Let's find out.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
The truth is in the street.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Obama and Trump need to go back to school.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I'm just an angry rapper and I'm going.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Okay, God damn it.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I can't do this.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
All right.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
That wasn't good.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:31.000
That was a solid rap.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Going to the prom but I'm 44.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I'm sure we're all lateral thinkers but no one wants to hear from the rapper right now

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
that says Obama and Trump need to go back to school.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I was with you.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Too high resolution.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Who are you rooting for?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I liked it because I was like, I got to see him justify this.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Because they didn't learn the delegates.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I just want to beat.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Who's the guy?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I like the, not just the angry, it's not angry, the gruff rappers.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
DMX.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Yeah, like the guys are like, are they like growl while they're rapping?

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I want to be a growl rapper but the reason I want to be is because, is the same reason

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I can't because I think that takes more.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
You need more science to drop that much science.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I mean, you do have to know your rhyme pretty well to growl throughout.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:32.000
DMX was super good at it because he would just stop and he would start his shit off

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
with like, get at me.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I'm coming for you.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Turn on the lights.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Pull my pants down.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000
And then would rap.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And then Buster Rhymes.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Classic.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Yeah.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Like a dungeon dragon.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
He would get revved up like a little 70s like windup toy.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Ghostface killer.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I think it was above all my favorite because he would start like slick Rick kind of like.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.000
He was like, I'm ghostface killer and I'm here to say he doesn't even ever said that.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
But he would like.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
I come to kill in a ghostface way.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Ghostface killer was like, like by the time he got to the end of a thing, I felt like,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
like I always imagine that he'd be going like this, like I do.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Because he'd be like, I'm gonna do it.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Like he's like yelling, like shouting.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Like he can't, he can't, he can't fucking take it anymore.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And then like, just like, yeah.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Oh man, I would love to see people who aren't you doing the Kiki Baby dance.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Yeah.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
It would be amazing.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I mean, it's amazing when you do it.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
It would be cool.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It would be, it would be helpful if the hip hop community started adopting my ways.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I'm sure that's already happening.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I do want to go to like a, just like a hut on a back road in Atlanta and find like,

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:52.000
just jet black Armenians doing your dance and rap and rap it in your same pattern.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I told you, man, you can't talk about that, man.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
You're not depressed like damn, man.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
No, dude, spit again.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Spit again.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
You're not on the spectrum.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Right.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Right.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I saw you shaking hands with people and hugging them and shit.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
You're not on the spectrum.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Yo, if you're going to stim when you rap, it should be because you need to stim to get by.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
It shouldn't be because you like, it's like, this is about what our culture is.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I'm not self-diagnosing.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
My therapist keeps telling me I don't have autism.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
How are you going to be a damn Harmon rapper and your DJ name is Stroblight?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
You know you would have a seizure and freak out.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
That's so offensive.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
You're thinking of epileptics.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I'm black, man.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
What y'all going to do, man?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Come at me, epileptics.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Come at me.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I dare you, epileptics.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Calling autistic people epileptics is like calling Samuel L. Jackson Lionel Richie.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
In that no one's going to write a letter?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Is that how they're saying it?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Did you ever see this YouTube clip of Sam Jackson is doing press for some movies doing

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:03.000
and then the morning show host, he said something that makes it clear that he

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
confused him with, I think, Morgan Freeman?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
It's either Morgan Freeman or Wesley Snipes.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
It's one of those.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I don't remember anything about it except just awkward because it was like Jackson didn't let it go.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
How could he?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Even if he wanted to be a team player, how are you supposed to bounce back from that

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
after 1995?

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
He was like, no, we're going to talk about this now.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Then the morning show guy was like, OK, all right, come on now.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I was like, well, you literally dehumanized me.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
You confused me.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
It would be one thing.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I mean, yes, if you were a valet parker and you were like, oh, I forgot which one had the

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
orange because same hair color, but you booked him on your show and you thought he did a

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
different movie.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
We've got to stop doing television now.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.000
We have to stop and take a little time out here.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Especially if you get your fame off of me.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
If the reason that you're famous is because you interview celebrities.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
What am I milking today?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Well, you're milking this cow.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
How's it feeling being this cow?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I'm not this cow and that cow.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Well, whatever.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Come on.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Let's not disrupt the farm.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Milk is milk.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
That's what Ghostface would say.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Milk is milk.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Throw your hands up.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
You can't.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
You can't.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
You can't riff an impression of Ghostface.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000
You can do it if you go by Casinos.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000
What was it?

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Yeah, all right.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I was trying to think of one of his rhymes.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
But did you see the Eminem thing, by the way?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I did.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I mean, everybody did.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I did.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I'm not going to give it the four stars that everybody else is giving it, but I do appreciate

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
the effort.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I mean, I want to hear the detraction.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
It could have been better.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
It could have been better.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
It's off beat.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
The rhyming?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Yeah.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
It's not clear.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
But don't you think he's, what if he's actually really making it up on the spot?

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
What if he's out of practice?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Yeah.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
It's not the old, okay.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000
So normally he'll do like a A, A, A, A, A, A, A rhyme pattern where he's just rhyming

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
word after word after word, right?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And he didn't do that.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
That's classic Eminem.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
He didn't do that.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
He did more of like a yell, speak, spoken word poetry.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And when you're as lyrically talented and you can flow like he is, like he can, you

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
sort of expect him.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
It'd be like, you know, it'd be like, it's like when Prince would come out and he would

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
just do an acoustic set.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
You'd be like, nah.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Nah.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Yeah.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
But the combination, I guess, is like the stakes are so much higher because it's like,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
like, oh, he's just, oh, he's saying I hate Trump.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.440
And it's like, that's like controversial, which is a fucked up thing.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.640
He's like two years late.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.320
There's a lot of rappers that had already dissed Trump right out the gate.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.320
So that was the other issue.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.320
Yeah.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:53.160
But he, what I'm saying is that he knows the weight of the train he's driving to what,

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:57.400
to what station and what wall it's going to go through and whatever, like you and I

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.400
are talking about it.

01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.640
I don't know about these other guys.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:03.680
So he knows that he's whether, whatever he thinks about himself, I'm just saying like,

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.320
that would affect, that would affect me too.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.320
Why am I arguing with you?

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.320
I asked your opinion.

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:11.320
It's your privilege.

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.800
I was just, yeah, like, like, why do we do that to people?

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:15.800
We go like, what did you think?

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.320
And then you go like, oh, I didn't like it.

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:20.480
And you're like, whoa, tell me why you didn't like it.

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.480
And then they tell you why.

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:23.320
And you're like, well, I don't know about that, though.

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.320
I'd also like to say you didn't address the technical.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.320
That's my only beef.

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.320
Right.

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.320
Actually, truly, I wasn't really, there was some rhymes in there where I was like, holy

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.920
shit, that's pretty awesome.

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:38.600
But truly, the reason why I did think it was awesome is because as a fragile white dude

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:45.400
who loved Eminem and who is probably his age and who like just feels helpless and Eminem's

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:51.080
got, you know, like, it's like, well, he's not a, it's not a role model.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:56.640
And he's not, nor even in hip hop or whatever, it was like, he, he reappears.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:57.640
I always thought he was talented.

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.600
I guess he's, I feel like he's like the Quentin Tarantino of rapping or something.

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.520
No, he's pretty, he's pretty high up there.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:06.480
I feel like always in his corner, I'm like, I wish people, I wish, I wish, and then,

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.680
and then, and I was just happy to see him again.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:09.680
And he looked good.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:10.680
Yeah.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:11.680
I don't know about that beard.

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:13.960
That beard was a little.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:21.040
And he was like fervently fucking like anarchically political in his messaging in a way that was

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:25.080
just like straight up that, that is, I was, the reason I was excited about it was because

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.200
of all those things.

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.200
And he didn't fuck up.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.200
And like, right.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:36.080
He didn't like say north, south, east, west dog is your friend best.

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:42.320
I don't know why you got scared that he was going to fuck up because he was freestyling.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:43.320
Right.

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.320
I mean, he wasn't.

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.320
No.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.320
Well, now I hate it.

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.320
No, no, no.

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:48.320
It's still incredible.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.320
I thought he was freestyling.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.320
No.

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.320
The freestyle.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.320
Why was he going?

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.320
Can I tell you what's fucked up?

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.320
Hold on.

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.320
Hold it.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.320
Like he was like.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.320
Here's the most fucked up thing.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:00.920
Like our generation freestyling is off the top of the dome.

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:06.240
Younger kids think freestyling is when you don't have a musical track and you are you're

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.840
doing your song acapella.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:12.640
So it's almost like, remember remix used to be this is a new version of that song with

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.320
the same lyrics.

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:20.160
And now remix is just a longer version of a song or a different beat that isn't quite

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.160
the same.

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.160
You fucking kids.

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.640
Here's what freestyling used to be.

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:24.640
Hit it.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.640
Yeah.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:26.640
Yeah.

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:27.640
Yeah.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.520
Y'all about to be taken back to what freestyle used to be.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.520
Yeah.

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.920
When people got confused and they run.

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:32.920
Peas and carrots.

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.920
Soups and plates.

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920
What?

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.920
I tried to fuck your mama, but it's her I hate.

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.640
I'm a hateful person and I hate your mom.

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:41.080
So why did I fuck her?

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.040
My name is Tom.

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.240
Mr. Cruz is what they call me.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:47.240
I'd like to tell you about Scientology.

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:53.200
You get your beatings clear, get them off your back and then you give me $5,000 back.

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.200
God.

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.640
L. Rod Hubbard is the man to beat.

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:59.640
I want to fuck your mama's titties gonna put my dick in her feet.

01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:00.640
Okay.

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.280
Now that is often that's freestyle.

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.680
Then I thought I'd throw it to you, but now they're like, I'm gonna do my song that you

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.040
guys all know about, but I'm gonna do it acapella.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.040
So now I'm freestyling.

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.040
All right.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.040
There's also.

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.040
Yeah, that's it.

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.040
Well, I also heard a distinction.

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.200
I was talking to open mic about about the M&M thing and we're talking about freestyling

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.680
and like what what is the I was talking about.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.440
What are the rules?

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.720
Like what's the religion surrounding freestyling?

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:31.640
Like, like when M&M and the Slim Shady album, what the fuck was it where he's like, he's

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:35.720
freestyling and it's like, like, like, like how much are you allowed to edit?

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:38.800
If you got busted editing, would it be like a Millie Vanilly scandal?

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.160
You know, you cannot edit.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.360
If it's on your album, it's like a freestyle track.

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.560
Does it is it like a scandal if someone like leaks the thing and you're like taking 10

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:48.800
minutes and going, wait, I should rhyme sugar with sugar.

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.800
Yeah.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:50.800
Yeah.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.920
That's just but Mike was saying that like, for instance, there's then there's another

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:59.400
distinction where it's like rappers like Jay-Z will, they pride themselves on not writing

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:02.480
anything down, but they don't mean they're freestyling, they just mean they don't use

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.480
pen and paper.

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:06.600
They just like play themselves like an instrument, like they'll and they'll they're like Pink

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.600
Floyd about it.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:11.360
Like they'll they're just doing it in layers and passes and like going off the off their

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.720
head, but they're refining it.

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:15.920
There's people who are going off their head and then there are people who have memorized

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.680
freestyle rhymes.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:21.760
I imagine if you constantly freestyling, then you're going to know mouth rhymes with south.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760
Right.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.760
You know, it's going to happen.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:29.040
You know, through the A, through the E, through the D, work our way to the shuns, TIO ends,

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.120
and then we get, we get freakier with that.

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:35.440
So everybody's going to be like, I went today to see some pay and I went my way and then

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.440
they're going to move on to it.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.040
It's easy to see to be me.

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.560
It's so easy to be he.

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.000
And then that's what I try to do.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.480
So the complexity is always like, can you do what Eminem is super complex in that he

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.640
goes a, a, a, a, a for the whole first line, which is bananas when he said, and that's hard

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:56.280
to freestyle because you got, you need a dictionary, which he also just thinks phonetically or

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.280
something.

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:00.800
That's what impresses me about like good, like when people are like, oh, they don't even,

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.160
they're like, they like hear in sound.

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.840
So it's like, I stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it and sold it back to her.

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.000
It's like, that doesn't rhyme.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Yeah, it does.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.120
Like I would, it doesn't rhyme to me, but it right.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:16.680
It does when you say it, if you think in rhymes also like kids nowadays don't rhyme anymore.

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.320
So somebody will, somebody will say basket and somebody will say, kick it.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.680
It's the IT that you were supposed to be rhyming off.

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:23.680
But back in the day.

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:27.320
When you run out of your magic words, you got to do, you back in the day, you, you had

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320
to rhyme.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.120
Words had to rhyme and it couldn't be a party chant all of a sudden.

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.560
Like just cause you didn't rhyme, it couldn't suddenly become a hook.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.120
That's what happens when you strip language down.

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.240
You got rid of the word Eskimo.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.520
Now how are you going to rhyme?

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:44.560
Give me some O. Can't rhyme in you it.

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:47.680
You fucked yourself millennial freestylers.

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.680
Into it.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.240
I never met an Inuit that wasn't into it.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:58.320
I never met an Inuit that wasn't into it.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.320
Okay.

01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:04.020
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, what, so, it was hour 20, and then I talked for what another fucking

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:05.020
hour?

01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:06.020
40 minutes.

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:07.020
Yeah.

01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:10.960
Oh wait, so, so not to put you on the spot, but D&D or not.

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.600
Well, we have 15 minutes.

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.340
Do you want to?

01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:17.800
Um, not to put me on the spot.

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:23.960
It's totally up to you though because like it's if you if you don't feel like doing it

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.400
Nobody's gonna be like I hate Spencer for not feeling like playing D&D for 15

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.960
No one on Reddit would say anything like that and no one would tweet me about it either

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.240
Right now there's a dude on Reddit pulling up his pants and wiping his boner away

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:39.560
He's drafting a positive and a negative response

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:45.640
If we do it, he's mad if we don't two children just got beat do we defeats Truman?

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:48.720
I wasn't gonna hurt you until I found out no D&D

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:56.080
Stop drinking your dinner nine paragraphs out of why they shouldn't have played D&D. It's like it's great

01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:01.800
It's a lot of fun. We have a great fan base and I enjoy them and appreciate their patronage

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:09.160
But if we if we if we wrapped up right now, we'd be I wouldn't hate that I wouldn't hate trying I

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.880
Yeah, I just think that we what happens what has happened in the past should we throw

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.000
Let's let's if you if you want to if you want to leave it to me

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.240
And then you don't have to you won't be sapped of your of your power because I can say Spencer

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:27.240
I'd to me I would play D&D and here's why I would say it because we've done everything else that we usually do in this space tonight

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.960
And I thought the fun experiment was doing without an audience

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:37.080
So if we then don't play a little D&D, I think that's a mistake, right? Well, like I didn't want to do that awesome rap

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.240
That was I forced that

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.560
Yeah

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.080
Sometimes you put on the high heels even though you're a feminist

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:48.240
I feel like you asked me what I wanted to do and when I was answering the question you answered what you wanted to do

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:54.840
Yeah, Spencer. He did the same thing to me. Yeah, why don't you guys go to a fucking Black Panther matter rally? Damn it

01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:02.600
I just the problem that I perceive is that what happens is when we have a very drastically shortened session

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:09.560
Right no one remembers what happened and everyone forgets further about what happened in the session before that and then it becomes harder

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:14.440
The next time we show up to actually but you know, we could do it. It's fine. I

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.320
just I mean

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.040
like I

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:22.520
Was just moments ago. I was like ready to not play

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.880
Why don't we then I got the sense of like you're not gonna accept this

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:33.240
Observation this is me as guest comptroller and we love you Jeff Davis. Please hurry back

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:39.760
Maybe we do a recap of last week and just do a couple opening lines. I'm fine with that. All right

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.640
All right, I get to sit down

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.560
So let's bring up Steve Levy

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:55.120
It's the Levy show Steve Levy show who's clapping for him

01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:02.320
It's the Levy show if you get the fire Marshall is watching if he hears the applause. He's gonna burst in with an axe

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.760
It's the Levy show what's up Levy show

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.320
How are you Steve I'm good

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:22.500
Any love life updates? Oh shit. I guess if there are you can't say so yeah, let's let's check in later

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:26.900
Oh, give me some time. Maybe there's things. Maybe not hmm

01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:29.820
Give me a month or two

01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:33.020
All right, you know. Yeah, we all know what that

01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:40.700
But somebody says give me a month or two. Yeah, you want some time. Hmm. Yeah, that's like the best place

01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:46.500
We just have like an extreme crush and like you just like someone else isn't charged you whether you're happy or sad

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:52.100
Yeah, it's like what cavemen must have felt before they knew the Sun wasn't a tortoise wheel

01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:56.580
It's like the littlest thing that they do that makes you so happy, right?

01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:03.940
Yeah, like returning a text instead of letting it lay there like a fucking fart because you finally said something fucking weird and creepy

01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:06.100
All right, and all your bullshit is like

01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:14.040
Like you should not be that happy about that. Yeah, I'm like like yeah any mention of a

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:15.560
Favorite movie

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:20.520
It is great. I'm not being sarcastic like those are the moments and it's like you're it's like it

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.000
For me, it's never disingenuous. It's like that's like your body is flooded with that chemical

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.560
It doesn't make the love that that that ends up happening later less genuine

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:37.040
But that's definitely a drug that you're on that it's like amazing to be on where it's like another person is

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.040
It's just a god

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:46.400
Yeah, and you're and you're just struggling every day with like whether to overdo it underdo it

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.720
I'm just gonna fucking be me man. I'm gonna fall in love

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.760
Yeah, they're constantly coming back to the realization. You just got to be yourself

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:57.680
She doesn't like it, but it's like every every breath and every yeah everything is a potential landmine

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.480
It's great. Where are we Spencer? Clinton? It's a great question

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.960
So do you want us to play the music? I don't think we have that capacity

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:10.400
Yeah, we do play the music

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:14.400
Shit

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:19.360
I'm surprised. Hell. Yeah last time on Harmon Time

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:25.940
You guys had gone back to the keep to turn in your mission and you turned in the mission and then

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.400
You decided to go get your pay for the mission. So you went to the commissary and got paid

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:38.240
As part of your debriefing you had left Patchens with the church and had agreed to meet up with him

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.160
So you went to the tavern to meet up with him, but he didn't show up

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:48.480
So diarrhea junior went to go look for him and he found him and what did he find?

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:55.720
Patchens was mad at our group and didn't want their help because they had caused problems for Patchens in the past

01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:00.280
And he just wanted to tell them that he was leaving and leaving he did

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.280
but uh the gang

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:08.840
Conspired or transpired. They talked about what they should do. They were like, ah

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:16.200
You should probably see what's up and then Jeff summoned a horse and he fell off the horse because it disappeared

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:22.360
And chased after Patchens and he found Patchens and was like wait right here

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.760
It was ambiguous whether or not you two are with him at the time

01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:33.680
What will happen who will do what we'll see how we'll be

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.600
Arm in time now

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.480
Actually now

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:49.160
All right, so any any questions Brandon you you don't have any clue so

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.760
All questions would be acceptable

01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:57.240
I'd assume or if you have none that makes sense too because what what questions could you have if you have no knowledge to begin with?

01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:04.840
But I'm just happy to be Jeff once you're getting better and better at those that's they're very exciting, right?

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:10.480
It's not like I was really good at it for a while and then completely stopped having to do it and lost practice

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:16.720
And I'm getting back into the group now. I'm reaching new heights that I never achieved. I think you are right

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:19.520
That's what you said. Yeah

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.360
Well, if if we're not with Patchens

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:29.440
I assume I kind of picture it as like Jeff got on his phantom horse that he summoned he rode for a burst and then it

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:32.600
Doesn't last that long. Yeah, and then he kind of sprinted off

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:36.960
And then he sprinted ahead of us and he said he said wait here to Patchens and I assume like

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:45.400
You know, we would be now the rest of us me and diarrhea would be coming up to where they are if you want. Yeah, that sounds good

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:50.800
Yeah, let's say I'm gonna bring back some food. I left the guy where he's supposed to be you guys come up to meet him

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.800
I'll bring back some snacks

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:56.520
You're gonna Chad's gonna go get snacks. I love this plan. I'm into

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.160
Alright, well, don't go

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:06.880
Alright, I mean, I don't want to who doesn't like snacks. Well, I just we we haven't been all together yet

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:12.240
So if you if you go off, I'm just scared that we're gonna get separated again to coming right back

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:17.320
I promise okay, do I get snacks nearby like perhaps within your shot?

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:22.680
I feel like we got the guy. It's everything's about to go down. We're gonna be hungry. Okay, if we go anywhere

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:27.480
We're gonna follow the road in the direction that Patchens was heading so great

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:34.960
And if and if we're not that means something's gone wrong in which case it would be important more important to find us

01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:39.000
So we're not with Patchens, but Carlos and I are running toward him, right?

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.840
It's best. Well, you met up with Chad who is getting snacks

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:47.880
Let's say 50 feet from Patchens who is told to wait there. So you're now approaching Patchens

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.880
Okay, great Chad is presumably getting snacks if I understand Patchens

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.800
Hey guys, I heard you didn't want us to help you right and

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.920
Here you are. Well, we owe you help

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.600
Yeah, I

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:13.760
Mean, that's probably true. I don't I honestly feel like everything I've done with you has only put my life into jeopardy

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:19.920
And I don't I'm worried that that would happen more with your help rather than you know, it would be alleviated

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.920
I guess that's where I'm coming from

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:23.280
Patchens

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:31.240
What church do we belong to the church of the silver flame? What does flame do burns? What does burning feel like?

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:33.800
Terrible is it good?

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:39.040
Well, it depends on the context, right, but you love your church

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:43.160
The the silver flame is the flame of truth flame is a

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:50.320
Reaction between heat and things that it overtakes the process can be damaging it can be

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:54.400
helpful to things around it it all depends on who's getting burnt and

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.560
What use is getting gotten out of it?

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:01.880
The truth burns away at lies

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:08.440
Everything gets challenged. I failed you like I I came upon you and needed your help and

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:13.800
You helped us and I owe you and I know that I suck at it

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:19.600
Like I've been holed up in the church, you know looking for an opportunity to do something right instead of the bureaucratic

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:25.600
Bullshit they send us out on and we encountered you and I believe that the silver flame somehow made us

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.280
You know intersect and so I I understand you

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:40.400
Not thinking that we're gonna be good at it, right, but we did try and I've never betrayed you

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:45.840
I've just failed you. I've never lied to you. Yeah, I mean, that's that's the problem as I'm explaining it

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.840
Yeah, you're just saying why I shouldn't

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:53.440
Go along with you. Well, there's there's not there's no control group to this experiment where you're doing awesome on your own

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:56.360
And I don't want to turn it into a fight. We don't know that that's the case

01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:03.040
I might be awesome. Hey, man. We love you've been there from the beginning. You're like our Scooby again

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.920
That's never that's not the question. The problem is not these guys don't love me enough

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:12.160
The problem is that their love is potentially lethal, but what if somebody owes you something?

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:17.800
What if we owe you like like just because you don't want to accept our debt to you doesn't mean that we don't owe you

01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:19.800
That's the problem. You have a

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:21.800
Diplomacy uh

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Diplomacy I

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:30.920
Do have it at the box is checked, but there's no there's no okay. Then do you have charisma? I

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:38.120
Have like a 16 charisma that says ability modifier plus three. All right

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:44.600
Your words touched him. He's like, you know what? I'm almost certain this will get me killed

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:49.800
But you can come if you want to join the adventure of Patchen's Jim

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:57.320
Yeah, we got it. Well, we usually take a vote on party matters and

01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:03.160
All right, fuck you. I'm leaving. I'm kidding. It was a joke without these snacks. Hey everybody

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:13.200
I got a little jerky and I got these beat chips. What kind of jerky bison so

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:19.280
Yeah, I'm bison jerky. Okay, great. This tastes really fresh. It's almost like it's a fine line between

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:22.040
bison jerky and

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:29.440
Did you just come upon a bison actually yes, oh, yeah, yeah, and I'm glad that you are enjoying it. That's good

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:33.560
Yeah, this is great. Let us all eat from my snack bucket

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.040
You eat from the snack

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:43.440
That happens really nailed it Chad so Patchen's before we help you

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:46.520
We're gonna need to know more about this Jim, right?

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:49.440
It's Jim

01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:52.120
Important people at the church told me to keep it safe

01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:56.560
And they said my whole job was to keep it just safe and that was my whole job at the church

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:01.080
And it was a special position that was different than the normal hierarchy

01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:07.200
But that was it was an important position and so they sent me to Roan a quiet town to lay low

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:10.200
And then it seemed like it wasn't so quiet anymore

01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:15.560
So I'm trying to lay low some more and then I got jacked and I don't know who jacked it but

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:23.840
You know Roan is nearby the town of Dorneester and Dorneester is a town full of thieves and ruffians and that's

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:26.320
We were right by it when I got attacked

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.840
we got attacked I suppose and

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:31.000
That's that's where I was headed

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.400
I don't know what's gonna happen

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:37.080
But that's why I don't necessarily want to take people with me because I don't know that it'll do anything

01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:40.120
But I got to do what I got to do. Otherwise, I'm gonna get murdered

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:47.360
Well, the men that assailed us were hired hands for sure. They were disguised as banditos, but they were actually, you know professional mercenaries

01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:54.440
So it sounds like you're on the right track. What did the gem do? Are we allowed to know that? What? What did the gem do?

01:52:54.440 --> 01:53:00.360
Yeah, it's a church treasure. He was just put in charge of keeping it hidden like yeah, but it was like a

01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:06.400
Princess Leia. It doesn't have any magical properties. It didn't glow. It didn't do anything when I shook it

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.880
I don't it's like a big gem

01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:13.440
He doesn't know anything they picked an obscure turd of a man and put him in the middle of nowhere where they thought

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.040
No one would ever find or look for the gem and they were right

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:21.160
Do you stumble down to it fucked it up? Do you think the crazy vampire lady has any connection?

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:25.040
It was a totally random thing. No, they weren't there for he was sleeping with the gem

01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:30.480
Excuse me for a second passions. This guy is a you know, he wasn't doing anything. He's just sleeping

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:35.680
We had our dumb adventure that we have botched and then we took him told him

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:38.440
He had to come with us to town and on the way there we got robbed

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:45.640
Maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I think everything's connected here. I you share that with I mean that's also

01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:47.920
schizophrenics and

01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:52.440
Yeah, I'm owning it. I just alienated one in 20 of our listeners

01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:59.820
Everything is connected. Yes, but to the town past Rowan

01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:07.320
Yeah, that's that's what someone who didn't think everything was connected would say so we were just saying let's go the the dot

01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.880
We're connecting is that the men that has sailed us were

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:13.680
They were they were they were hired. This is like a

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:22.320
Somebody with the money to make other people do bad things like hired a gang of people to disguise themselves and wail us

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:26.840
I don't think they were affiliated with the vampires because the vampires weren't looking for patches or his gem

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:28.840
That was an unrelated story

01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:31.920
And and and this is a new one

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:40.240
No one's touched my murbles. Are they too spicy? What is a murble? I set them next to the bison jerky you

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:47.640
You didn't try them. I'll eat it. I worked really hard on this. I'm not gonna eat it. You you made it. Yeah

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.640
I said snacks didn't I?

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:58.160
Patches I'm gonna tell you right now if shit goes bad and you try the excuse of like we're bad at doing what we do again

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:04.480
You can but not if you don't tell us everything you know right now if you know

01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:09.400
More information than you've already shared with us about people who might be looking for that gem

01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:14.360
You know, it's it's gonna be way less on us when we fuck up again

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:21.680
I truly don't know. I feel like my job was not to know for safety's sake. I got that impression and I'm willing to believe you

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:28.200
Yeah, I mean it seems like they just buried this gem deep into the in obscurity. They didn't want anyone to ever think about it

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.200
And you did a great job. That's why I feel like we owe you

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:36.760
Yeah, I feel like the church has these two different functions. There's like the function of of of

01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:41.280
Co-operating with the way the world already works, which isn't good

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:47.240
And then there's the function of purifying the world and I feel like the people that put you in charge of that gem are

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:50.640
You know, they're more lateral

01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:54.600
They're more punk rock. You know what they are more punk rock

01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.480
Who was it that put you in charge of that gem?

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:01.320
Just some Bishop

01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:09.640
Trader no, no and not that other guy avatavis man. I don't even know his name. He was such as a Robert's character

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:11.640
Oh, it was Roberts

01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.400
The mysterious Roberts, all right

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:22.880
Well, I pick up a murbal to patch ins onward and then I take a bite of it and it's

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:28.400
It tastes really funky. It's kind of gooey and warm in the middle

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:35.400
And I'm like, what what are you? What did you want me to eat? What is this thing too salty? What is it too salty?

01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:38.680
I knew I knew I knew too salty. I'm so sorry. I did the best I could

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:45.480
Is it me? Is it a plant? What's the thing about myrrh? It's kind of meaty planty. It's like seaweed

01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:50.000
I eat I eat a murbal and I let the dungeon master tell me how it tasted. Oh

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:56.800
It tastes like it might be too salty. I should probably I should probably get some experience points for it

01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:01.440
Yeah, you get some experience points because I didn't you know what you did there

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:08.360
Dm'd for yourself. Yeah, it's a big improvie. Yeah, sorry. It's fine

01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:13.640
I mean, we're all just trying to do our thing and it's great, but it's true

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.960
Q music

01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:18.680
the the

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:25.520
No, it's Tom Tom Tom Howard. Who's the who's the composer?

01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:29.640
Did the swelling music Howard rings? No, no

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:36.720
The Lord of the Rings guy that Howard Howard shore Q Howard shore as we don't literally Q Howard shore

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:38.720
Oh, we'll get the will be in big trouble

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:46.720
As we as we as we journey off as we do whatever Spencer says we're doing you travel for for a couple days

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:52.320
And you reach a crossroads and you can see the way to door nester and also a sign that points to door nester

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:55.920
You hear you hear more not more. Can we just do a quick though?

01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:03.360
While we're if we're walking that far just like the audio of the dialogue rises and falls do a little montage of sound bites of stuff

01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.360
We're talking about what we're walking

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:11.440
Like balls. I just think that you know if if my doctor gonna come eight in a package

01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:14.520
Why do buns come six in a package right? I?

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.480
Guess it's because somebody might come over

01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:23.440
Okay, all right end of my time. All right

01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:26.960
I figured that one out you travel for some time and you come to the crossroads

01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:33.200
You see the sign marking door nester and you can see kind of down this hilly path of rolling hills

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:39.840
You can see door nester kind of nestled next to a forest and and you can also see what looks like a graveyard

01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:43.120
This is door nester. Oh boy

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:49.160
You hear the sound of hoofbeats pounding as a horse rides up to you and on that horse I

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:57.240
Hope we're getting that that's great and on that horse is a familiar face. It's Geffen that guy

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.320
Armor and stuff. Oh boy. What up Geffen?

01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:09.120
We see you again. This is crazy coincidence, huh? Yeah. Wow. What are you guys doing? Well?

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.120
We

01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:20.240
Snacks tell me about the snacks we've we've we've we're on it. We're we're headlong into an operation in which

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:30.120
Who we tell what matters more than before he points to is his temple a couple times and he winks

01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:31.520
He's like I got you well

01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:32.760
I'm just out on rounds

01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:38.920
See we're checking with affiliate churches to see how everyone's doing the nearby town of door nester has been pretty fucked up

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:45.960
We believe they're all on pot or something. Hmm. Well, you see you're going there to do what like crack some heads

01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:47.800
Yeah, they're a rough and rowdy brunt bunch

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.680
We don't try to force abstinence on the public

01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:56.840
But if our congregants are getting fucking suited out of their skulls, I'm gonna crack some of their skulls suited

01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:58.680
So they're

01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:04.280
Specifically having a lot of sex now. They're getting lifted shifted higher than the ceiling bro fucking suited out of their skulls

02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:07.440
God talking that

02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:13.360
Sneaky-weakie that's sticky icky. You know what I'm saying. That's what we think higher than a hawks nuts

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.840
If rumors are to be believed

02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:21.760
Higher than a giraffe's pussy. I have to confirm. Yeah, absolutely

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:25.440
This is the man we've been waiting to hear from well

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:30.280
It looks like you'll get there before us, but Geffen if I if I could have a word with you there

02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:32.280
Maybe some way you could help us

02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:34.900
Okay, just keep your ears peeled for

02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:39.720
Anybody who may have hired a gang of

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:41.680
brigands

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.520
to

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:46.200
Go out and do bad things on the road

02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:49.280
Right

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.280
I'm on it

02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:59.720
Okay away. You have a beautiful horse. Yep. Well, it's always good get Geffen to get there first

02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.120
He sure did it's nice or will

02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.640
All right

02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:08.760
That's not a compelling cliffhanger, but that's there's a good time to stop right

02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:14.280
Well one man's non-compelling cliffhanger is another man's perfect

02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:20.560
day-new mall I look I see a dandelion and

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:25.240
And I say look gentlemen, huh the dandelion

02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:28.160
It grows its whole life

02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:33.560
Just to give way to chaos in hopes that its life wasn't spent in vain

02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:40.040
The three of us proceed forth from here to the wind and wherever it takes us

02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:42.640
But we'll always be together

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.480
Through purpose like the roots of the dandelion

02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:50.360
to brotherhood to the fellowship of

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.360
Patchen's gem

02:01:53.360 --> 02:02:00.000
To the fellowship of Patchen's gem to the fellowship of Patchen's gem. We shouldn't make that our public name

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.680
But to the fellowship of Patchen's gem

02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:09.440
Yeah, no, we won't say it to anybody else. Yeah, it's our secret

02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:15.320
Sort of a surprise right right, and it's a little gay, but but that's a good way in a good way

02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:21.200
Yeah, no, I I'm sure a thousand years from now that'll be what I said will be bad

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:25.360
Cliffhanger

02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:30.120
It doesn't work to just yell things without an audience does it cuz yeah, we can't

02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:37.040
Oh, yeah, no play the guy play the gospel version because we teed it up

02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:54.840
Ladies and gentlemen, that's been Harmontown. Thanks so much for listening
