WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
Yeah, paying that hair Dave Kline, get up on stage and do that right now for the homoship.

00:24.000 --> 00:40.000
Oh shit, he's drunk. Yeah, from Hollywood, California, go down comics.

00:40.000 --> 01:00.000
Let's hear for Dave Kline everybody.

01:00.000 --> 01:11.000
Let's bring out Rob Schwab everybody.

01:11.000 --> 01:37.000
Rob are you with us, Schwab Schwab?

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
It's gonna be a good show. The stage is fully vacuumed.

01:45.000 --> 02:08.000
Let's bring out the mayor, Mr. Dan Hunter.

02:08.000 --> 02:17.000
That's how you start a show. Start a show. All right.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Dan doesn't give it, tonight is losing a Spencer. I think he was gaining a maniac.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Spencer couldn't be here tonight.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah, same page club.

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
And I had a free evening. Hello, Dan.

02:41.000 --> 02:55.000
We have guests in the control room and you came out and there are professional people of their own merit who had to turn to me to ask,

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
am I supposed to go out with a bit? And I had to say to grown men and women, no, don't, no.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
That's not anything to measure yourself by. No, that's not what our show is.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah, you'd be ripping me off.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
All right, don't start.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
Did you see Dave Kline banging his head with the hair? Yes, well, that was amazing.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
I did. And also people I think could probably say with more expertise than us that that was some awesome headbanging.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
It seemed legit. We have guests tonight that could weigh in on that.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah, I don't have a lot to talk about before we start meeting our new friends.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
How was your week? I haven't seen you in a while, Dan. How was your week?

03:45.000 --> 03:55.000
Did you have any fun anecdotes? If you thought Rob would be less disruptive sitting over at that table, he's only going to try harder over there.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm trying to keep the show going. Dan, do you have any anecdotes or anything?

04:02.000 --> 04:11.000
Anecdotes? Do you have an anecdote? What happened?

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
The kids loved me. I saw that Zootopia. You see that Zootopia?

04:19.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, people like that Zootopia, Dan. Have you seen that Zootopia? The whole city is animals.

04:29.000 --> 04:38.000
It's crazy, like everyone, even all the dogs, they're animals. Everybody's an animal.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
The dogs are animals too? The dogs are animals. The cops are rabbits. It's crazy.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
You've got to check out the Zootopia. I'm telling you, Zootopia is really bringing in the bucks too.

04:51.000 --> 05:02.000
China loves it. You should make a Zootopia.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Hi, Jeff. How are you doing, Rob? I'm doing okay.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
What's wrong? You seem a little down on that response.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Oh, thanks for asking, Jeff. Only, Jeff.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, I shit in the box, finally.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
You shit in the box? Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Did I miss an episode? Oh yeah, you weren't in that episode.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
What box did you shit in? Oh, the one that's next to the toilet.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
You became a Zootopia. You became a cat person. You pooped in a box now.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
What do you mean you pooped in a box? Speaking of boxes, someone's handing you Dan Harmon a box.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
I had to give a stool sample to... Oh, I did hear that.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah, and then I had to FedEx it to Texas.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
I was alarmed to find out that they want you to FedEx your poop.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
It's better than driving it there.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
What do you got there, a box? It's full of Rob shit.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Hey, you got FedEx at the Texas?

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
Someone in the front row handed Dan a very mysterious large black box.

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
So a lot of you ladies are thinking, do I need to look like that in order to be a Harmontown listener? No, you don't.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
There's something wrong with her and not you.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
First of all, she's an artificial construct.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
I can't see it. Second of all, she's probably racist.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
She's certainly the beneficiary of systemic racism.

06:44.000 --> 06:52.000
I can't see what you're... What the fuck is in the box?

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
It's fucking liquor. It's liquor.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, turn it around so everyone can see it.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Tell them like an eight-year-old. Turn it around.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Did you hand this to me?

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
It should be your choice because...

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You're wearing a very exciting outfit right now.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
That's why I wanted them to know that it was his choice to come up.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
I want curtains made out of everything you're wearing.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
These are from Walmart.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
For real? Well done.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
They're the women's variety and I asked them to translate the size to a men's size.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
She's told me and I'm like, well, do you think they'll have that size over there?

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
She said those pants aren't going anywhere.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
So I bought the pants.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
This stuff is clearly very sexist.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I have asked... Still haven't seen it.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I found out about this company. They're from Germany.

07:52.000 --> 08:00.000
They produce high-end liquor that they then pour over the model depicted's body

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
and then put it into the bottle.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Wow.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
You come a long way, baby.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
I mean, we can do shots. We can wait till later.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
These shots come pre-body-shotted.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
I don't know if they do a whole vat or if they do it bottle for bottle.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Do you think they really do it? Is there an oversight committee to make sure that actually happens?

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
Every article I've ever read said this company claims and then says what they claim.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
So there's no validity to the rumors that these women are in windowless rooms glued to the floor by their own shit?

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
She said... Each one of them says outright, yes.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
It was a wonderful opportunity for me.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah, that's what chickens say.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
When you talk to them, oh, do you like being a McNucket? They're like...

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
As for the racial thing, every variety is done with a woman of a different ethnicity.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
So I believe the rum was a black woman and then...

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
See, that's racist.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Well, I mean, it's our modern definition of racist because it acknowledges...

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
But at least it's inclusive. If there was all white women...

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
It is...

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
If you're old enough, you realize he's right.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
In Don Draper's time, it'd be like, oh, the bourbon is a brunette.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah, the G actually stands for gentlemen.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
So this is like a gentleman...

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
G spirits, it stands for gentlemen.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
So it's like a gentleman's club in a bottle.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
And then they put the picture of the girl on the bottle so that no matter how drunk you get,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
you never have to forget what an asshole you were for buying that vodka.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
So Dan, I'm assuming you have vodka that was poured off a redhead?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Am I guessing correctly there?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
And that would be like a Negroni?

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
She's clearly Icelandic or...

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I know you don't represent the company, but I'd like to pitch an alternate name for their product.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
The opposite of Purell?

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Just the opposite of it.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Just a bottle of stuff that comes with three germs.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Alright, well thank you, what's your name?

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Absolutely, Dan Myron Handleman. I've always wanted to meet you guys.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
So you're an assassin?

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
No, no, my dad was a comedian from the 60s named Stanley Myron Handleman.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Well, John Wilkes Booth was an actor.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
But three names means you're going to shoot somebody.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
I am no actor, sir. I am no actor, I can promise you.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Well, John Myron Handleman?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Dan Myron Handleman.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
You guys are awesome.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Let's hear it for Dan Myron Handleman, everybody.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I assume...

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
We already have done too much show. It's already been too much entertainment.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
I'm grateful because I was saying in the green room, I'm writing a little bit of a line.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I've been working all day, I stayed up all night.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
So hard. You've got to slow down, man.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
You're going to fucking trigger me.

11:20.000 --> 11:27.000
We're going to bring out our vacuum cleaner.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I wanted to address...

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
You were saying you were writing a line today?

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
It's one of those nights where I'm like, I stayed up all night because I tried to work on my book

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
and I found out last week because of the episode I got the forwarded emails that the publishers are listening.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Uh-oh.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
So when I'm joking about not working on the book, it's like, yeah, sounds like you at least know the book is due.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
For real?

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
So I'm just like, okay, if you're listening at double day, I stayed up all night.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
And if the show sucks, it's on you.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm sure the book will be great.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
But, uh...

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
You need one of them ghost writers. You need to get a ghost writer to take care of it, Dan.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I hear that's what they do.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Ghosts can't write.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah. No, no, no. I heard it. I heard it in a book.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Uh, the, uh...

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
I peaked with the vacuum cleaner.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Uh, I...

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
He's gonna...

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Because Rob, I don't know if you're aware of this, where Spencer sits, where you're sitting right now,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Dan never faces that way. His back will be too the entire night.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I know.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
And Dan, Rob is going to be throwing darts at you the entire time.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Whatever. It doesn't... It's just...

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Cool it, guys.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
What I'm trying to tell you is that I've been...

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I stayed up all night. I've been working all day.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
I shot Great Minds Today with Paul F. Tomkins, who's wonderful.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And, uh...

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I...

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Around four o'clock, I start drinking on that set, because I'm like, like...

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
So I'm a little... I'm just writing the line.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
This isn't gonna be like the Chicago show, but, like, I'm on the bubble.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
So we're at the mercy of our guests being...

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Like, you might descend into some sort of haze or madness?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
No, I just might... I'm not... I'm not as facile.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I'm not, like, uh...

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Like, it's good that that guy was a... He was a good guy.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
He took the mic. He could have, like, started stabbing people.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
But it's like, we're cool.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
I'm just saying, like, this is one of those nights when Uncle Dan maybe needs a little...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
He's gonna lean on you a little bit.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And lean on tonight's guest.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
So I only wanted to say, you may notice me talking a little slower.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
It's sounding a little bit more like a game show host,

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
because I'm overcompensating for my brain's desire to slur

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
and go, like, what is there about the Packers?

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
I just wanted to say a couple of things before we bring out our friends.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Uh...

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I have to say, this is...

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
One thing that amazes me about you, among your many skills and talents...

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
I know what you're gonna say.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
This is what amazes people about Denzel Washington's character in the movie Flight.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
And it shouldn't amaze you. It should concern you.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
You never slur.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
I called highly functional alcoholism. It's not funny.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I didn't say it was funny. I thought it was amazing.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
It's not a superpower. It's a kryptonite.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
So...

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Last week, I told you about the Avengers Academy game.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Most of you tweeted me,

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
this information is readily available to anyone under 30 who just Googled it.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
The kid that I was talking about, who I was like, kid, come on, take it easy.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
That was Dave Franco, who plays Tony Stark in that Avengers video game.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
And Black Widow, who I...

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
That was my friend, Allison Brie.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Oh, yeah?

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
That's Avengers Academy game. It's star studded.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Run. Don't walk to the App Store.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
You can enjoy it on a whole new level.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Dave Franco?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Dave Franco.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah, come on.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Did he, like, did he contact you upset?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
No!

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
You came down pretty hard on Tony Stark.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
You came down pretty hard.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
No, no. People just tweeted me.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
It was actually in the Rick and Morty writers room,

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
because I was talking about this game, and I was saying the same spiel,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
and then somebody said, that's Dave Franco.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And I was like, oops.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Because I don't want no beef with no Franco gang.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
These guys are like, they're the new bald ones.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Yeah, they're the new bald ones.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
You know what? You don't want to mess with that.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
And as you all know...

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
There's another Franco in the chamber we haven't met yet.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
The bald ones got so strong that they sprouted Adam,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
who is not even a real bald one.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
He's just like a rapey creep who went off and...

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Is that the guy? Isn't that the Gamergate guy?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
He's not even a real bald one, right?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Who cares?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
You guys are like...

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Dan, I'm sorry.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
What are these mystery bottles of alcohol here?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
What is this?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
That's for our next guest.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Oh, okay.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Let's bring her out.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Well, I have to get back to my...

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Vamp for a while while I pour myself a drink so I can...

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Hey, why don't you give me one, too?

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Why don't you give me one, too, while you're up there?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Jeffery, could you please give me one?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
I'd like one, too.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I got a whole table.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And I got a whole table here.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
The other thing I wanted to say was that our friend...

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Some of you in LA, we go to the drawing room afterward.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
Some of you may have encountered our friend Mario,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
the bartender there, who I've quoted in the past.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
I've quoted him like one of his funny jokes.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
I think he was passing on to me because we were talking about race and things.

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
And he said, you know, the only thing you could call a white person

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
that'll really offend them is racist.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
He told it better.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
He passed away a couple of nights ago,

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
and he had already survived a total cardiac arrest

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
and was hanging in there and stuff, and now he's gone.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
And I don't know, why do I bring it up to make the podcast sad?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I don't know.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
For anybody that's ever met him, some of you must have gone to the drawing room after our show.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
He's the large Cuban fellow.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
To know him was to at least like him, and to know him a little bit better

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
was to absolutely love him.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
He left his giant hole in a lot of people's lives.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I didn't realize how much that was going to affect me.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I found out about it, and I was really sad.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
And the next day, I said, I've known him more than half my life,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
and he's always been a source of happiness and grievance.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
If you care to donate a dollar or 50 cents or a nickel or whatever,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
just so that he can have a nice funeral because he went through a lot of medical expenses.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
If you go to my Facebook page, there's a little GoFundMe if you want to drop a nickel.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Have you ever met him?

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
He bought me so many free drinks that I really owe him in many folds.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
My favorite memory of him besides that joke was just the bathroom,

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
the men's room at the drawing room is unlike anything you've ever...

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
It's like an episode of Locked Up Abroad.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
And I remember coming in one day, and he was so...

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
He had this boyish smile on his face, and he's like, go in the bathroom.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And I went in the bathroom, and it was like,

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
oh, there was like a plate of stainless steel mounted above the sink.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
And I came out, and he's like, it's a mirror no one can break.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
He had gotten out a time life book, and he cared about...

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
He was like, what are the lost boys? He's like, I'm going to make Wendy proud.

18:56.000 --> 19:03.000
That bathroom was... Everyone goes in there to prove God doesn't exist.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
I don't know how it happened when it was decided.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
God is dead in that bathroom, and Mario cared enough.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
There's a species of insect that I think only lives in that bathroom.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Dino's theory is that when you go to the drawing room, men's room,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
and you're peeing at the urinal, there's this mysterious, not quite gnats,

19:24.000 --> 19:31.000
but not quite fly bug that seems designed to just get in your face

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
while you're trying to pee, inadvertently causing your pee to go everywhere,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
which seems to be what they live on.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
So Dino thought he had figured this biosphere out,

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
that this is like a species of insect that only lives in the drawing room bathroom.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
And that might be the reason why...

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
He kicked Vince Vaughn out of there one time.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
Vince Vaughn was being a complete ass, and Mario kicking Vince Vaughn out of there

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
with just such subtlety, it was so nice.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
If he really hated you, he would just go, bro, you got to go, man, time to go.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
And then if someone was like, fuck you, he would just reach behind the refrigerator,

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
and there was a seven-iron golf club there, and he would just slowly come around the bar,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
and the whole bar would clear out. It was great.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
Well, like, anyone who wasn't, you know, 97 yards away...

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I don't know what to say.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I thought I was going to, like, riff a golf joke.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Oh, no.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
You can only hit a seven-iron 97-yard?

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
I don't know, man. I cat-ed when I was like, fuck you.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
What did Vince Vaughn do?

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
He left.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
No, you mean, why did he get kicked out?

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
Yeah, he was in a shit.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
I wanted to riff a bad Vince Vaughn movie.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
He got kicked out for Clay Pigeons.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, whatever.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
All right.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Okay, our next guest is touring across children's colleges and clubs.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Whatever.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
She's a new friend of mine as of her podcast girl, Agai, which I was on.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
She's an old friend of Jeff's because she hosted...

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
She's currently hosting.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
The ABC Who's Line.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
CW.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Oh, it's CW now.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
C, my confusion is warrants.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah, season four.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
All right.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Well, let's get to the bottom of Ayesha Tyler, everybody.

21:23.000 --> 21:35.000
We're going to get to the bottom of you.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
Very exciting.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Would you like...

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Very exciting.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
Would you like vodka dripped lovingly over a Caucasian avatar?

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
I had a nickel for every time I drank vodka that had previously run over a Caucasian pussy.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
I swear to God, I'd have millions of dollars.

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
They should just call this unknown epithelial's vodka because that's...

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Look at her.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
She's sensationally fucking intellectual.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
I wonder where she went to college.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Ayesha, if they poured...

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Meet a white guy, you.

22:13.000 --> 22:19.000
If they bottled a drink or a cocktail or some sort of concoction off of your body, what would you...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Black Thunder!

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Actually, I brought my own alcohol with me.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
You asked, like, where are these mystery bottles?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
It was like moonshine.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
It isn't moonshine.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Actually, this is coincidental.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
I really just brought it because I know you guys are alcoholics, but I brought my own...

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
My own line of cocktails coming out late in the year, and it's pre-made cocktails.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
I know you guys are, like, men who don't know how to run like a washing machine or start your car.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Very true.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
And so you're just drinking straight vodka and a glass because what do I do?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Yeah.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
So I brought you...

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I have a line of cocktails coming out Cocherge and Stone.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
This is an old-fashioned.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
In a bottle, all you do is pour it into a glass and it's a drink.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
No way!

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I'm gonna save so much time.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
And this is a gin old-fashioned, and also just pour it out.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
And so...

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
A gin old-fashioned?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
A gin old-fashioned.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
A gin old-fashioned is just spirits, bitters, and something sweet.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
I don't want to be high maintenance, but could I get this trickled off of Eva Mendes?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
I will.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I'm a bit of a stickler.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Eva actually is doing my Manhattan, but...

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Racist.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
But just so you know, I masturbated and then stirred my fingers in this before I put it in the bottle.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Okay.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
It's sold.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It's delicious.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
Infused with the juices of my personal joy, ladies and gentlemen.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
Every sip is like sex with a black woman, confusing and delightful.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
You don't know if you got it right, but it's okay, cause you leave.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I'll get it right by my damn self.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Alright, sorry.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
And you always know whether whoever you're watching should go into that house.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Yes, exactly.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I don't know.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
I'm talking about what's wrong with you.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
That just, the end of it.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Oh, it's okay, baby.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
It was fine.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
You're just, you're adorable.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
You got good credit, baby.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Just leave some money.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
Nobody cares if you was good or you was bad.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
Why is having sex with me like having sex with the mom from what's happening?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Do you become that person?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
No, yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh, spenders say, oh, baby, slap that ass.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
I'm making some cornpone.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Why am I a racist?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Your show makes people racist, Dan.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
I don't care.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
You knew that already.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
I don't care if the woman is white, black or whatever.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
I would like just once in my life to be having sex with a woman of any ethnicity.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
And she, me too.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
And she, oh, I thought, I thought he was finished.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I thought he was finished.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
A woman of any ethnicity period.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Or on her period.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
What's it like?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
What's it like having sex?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
What a vagina is like.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Awesome.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Why is having them, having them, being in them.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Both awesome.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
Are you, do you think being, having sex with a black woman is complicated?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Do you think it is complicated sex?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
It's just, it's just, it's the same pussy.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
I mean, that's the thing that people have this idea that like I'm going to have sex

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
or something exotic and then magically unicorns are going to come out of my ass or my credit

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
score is going to go up or down depending.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Or all of a sudden I'm going to understand my iPhone because I had sex with somebody

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
from the Asian subcontinent.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
No.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
So, vagina is vagina and dick is dick.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
And sorry about that.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Talk to God if you believe in him or science like me.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
Since we're talking about sex and since race came up and I don't see the world through

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
this lens, I had no idea you were black until we had this conversation.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Right.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
It's exciting, isn't it, Dan?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
You have a black friend now.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Enjoy.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
One that you didn't cast on your show.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Hi.

25:42.000 --> 25:51.000
I like you for you, Dan.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Have you, tell me, you tell me to step back and step forward whenever.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
I'm listening.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
This is the same place.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
It's the same place.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
Hey, like the, I already know this is going to go terribly wrong, you guys.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
It's just all of you ready.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
Everybody, avert your eyes in three, two.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
What does your hair feel like?

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
No, no.

26:14.000 --> 26:24.000
I wanted to yes and the, I didn't want to let you down.

26:24.000 --> 26:35.000
I had this thesis recently and I was like, you know how porn is like, oh my God.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
It's too late, guys.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
It's too late.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Christ.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
It's like, when you have this porn world.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
Pull out, Goose, pull out.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Where everything gets.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Dan, Rob is now match gaming you over here.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
All right, fine.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
You love this, Rob.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
No, I don't.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
I don't love it.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
All right.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
By the way, the worst vacuum job I've ever seen.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
There's glitter and human remains of finger.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
All right.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Ask the question.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
I'm curious.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Well, I want to talk about porn tropes.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I love this stuff.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
Well, I wanted to talk about race in porn because at first glance, here's the thing about porn

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
in general that I've been, this is my new thing.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Post divorce.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Yes.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Because I'm just like, okay, an apologetic.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Pre divorce.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
You're watching it.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Just post divorce.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
You can talk about it.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Yeah.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Pretty much.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
You know, out of respect to, yeah.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
To the dead.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.600
But it was, you know, I've sort of become not obsessed, but just sort of fascinated with

27:42.600 --> 27:47.000
this thing that like, you know, the porn industry represents all of this money.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
We have this like bed of lava underneath us that is all this sexuality.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Yes.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.500
Like if you compare, you could name anything, video games, Matt Damon, anything that you

27:59.500 --> 28:01.200
thought was worth money.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.200
Right.

28:02.200 --> 28:06.600
Nothing would compare to the general just swath of the fact that forever, ever since

28:06.600 --> 28:10.720
we've been able to make porn, we've always had this like sea of porn underneath our

28:10.720 --> 28:11.720
society.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.360
But then everything that's above that sea, right, if like that's under like a little

28:14.360 --> 28:20.200
kind of a hardened cooled crust of magma, above that, everything is still suffused with

28:20.200 --> 28:21.200
that energy, right?

28:21.200 --> 28:24.920
Like almost everything we find valuable, whether it is pornographic or not pornographic is

28:24.920 --> 28:27.480
all shot through with pornographic value, right?

28:27.480 --> 28:28.480
Matt Damon.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.120
Everyone wants to fuck Matt Damon.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.120
Ladies want to fuck him.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.120
Gay guys want to fuck him.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.120
Straight guys want to fuck him.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.320
And hopefully they turn into him after they fuck him.

28:35.320 --> 28:38.200
Everybody wants to, you know what I mean?

28:38.200 --> 28:39.640
Everything in culture is suffused with sex.

28:39.640 --> 28:40.640
Absolutely.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.640
Yes.

28:41.640 --> 28:44.200
Because it's like, you can't escape the core of the earth is like affecting everything.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.840
If you shut that off, we'd know.

28:45.840 --> 28:51.600
If you shut porn off, we'd know the, the more to say porn is an expression of the core of

28:51.600 --> 28:52.600
each of us.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.080
That's all collectively we regarded as the sewer.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.200
So we treat the performers in it like shit.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.440
The industry is not regulated.

28:59.440 --> 29:05.320
It doesn't, even though it represents the, the, the billion, a million, all of the dollars.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.960
No one knows where to put the camera.

29:06.960 --> 29:12.480
It's always like, a lot of eye line problems, a lot of eye line problems.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.440
If they're lining up, they're like, I'm going to line up this shot.

29:15.440 --> 29:18.600
But I'm worried that when we push in on her vulva, we're jumping the line.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.720
Are we jumping the line?

29:20.720 --> 29:22.880
We were looking right to left and now we're left to right.

29:22.880 --> 29:25.400
Is this going to work for the double penetration?

29:25.400 --> 29:27.720
I think we need to move.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.240
When you are doing her from behind, look camera left.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.280
Otherwise, the whole thing is wrecked, guys.

29:32.280 --> 29:34.160
Guys, we, we got continuity problems.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.040
This guy's balls are all over the place.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.040
Yeah.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.040
Come on.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.040
One shot.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.040
They're up.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.040
One shot.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.040
They're down.

29:42.040 --> 29:45.960
Guys, it makes no linear sense.

29:45.960 --> 29:52.800
Is absolutely unmistakable that there is no grace or diplomacy in the handling of the

29:52.800 --> 29:58.720
concept of ethnic phenotyping in pornography.

29:58.720 --> 30:02.560
Your intellectualism is dazzling.

30:02.560 --> 30:08.800
But this is an industry where you type in redhead, babysitter, scuba diver.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.400
You type in really specific shit.

30:11.400 --> 30:16.040
And so just as in normal casting of network television, where as I've encountered where

30:16.040 --> 30:22.640
it's like, you have to steer around the fact that, well, we, we categorize people and all

30:22.640 --> 30:23.640
the stuff.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.200
So you better believe we do in porn.

30:25.200 --> 30:29.000
So you're, so you are typing who knows who you are.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
People are typing and therefore porn is being made where it's like, you don't want the stuff

30:34.000 --> 30:38.160
representing your species consciousness of race on one hand.

30:38.160 --> 30:42.200
But on the other hand, I was trying to make the point on a previous episode where it's

30:42.200 --> 30:52.560
like, how much more racist is like, is porn is porn than politics, religion, whatever

30:52.560 --> 30:59.560
the fuck you call the fact that the disproportionate incarceration, like it's like actual racism

30:59.560 --> 31:05.360
versus just like this dopey like river of like two black dudes, one white chick.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.280
And then it's like the guys come in and go, did someone order a black guy?

31:08.280 --> 31:09.280
And the woman's like, no way.

31:09.280 --> 31:13.960
And she's like, well, they're so big and he's like, that's because they're black.

31:13.960 --> 31:17.600
And she's like, I learned a lesson.

31:17.600 --> 31:21.360
And you're watching and you're going, I don't want, I don't want anyone to think that this

31:21.360 --> 31:22.680
is how I think about race.

31:22.680 --> 31:26.400
But at the same time, I don't want anybody to think that this is how I think about race.

31:26.400 --> 31:31.640
And in a minute, I'll feel super guilty about it.

31:31.640 --> 31:36.320
Because sexuality transcends politeness, diplomacy, all these things.

31:36.320 --> 31:42.240
Well, maybe the, maybe the word isn't transcend, maybe the word is subsumes or subverts, right?

31:42.240 --> 31:46.400
Because you're at your basest when you're consuming porn and porn and it's creation

31:46.400 --> 31:52.880
is it is the, is the, a very base expression, sorry, vivid, you're not making art.

31:52.880 --> 32:00.160
And so, you know, people are looking for satisfaction of their basest instincts of their basis inclinations.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.240
And they're also looking for those things to be satisfied in a very narrow window.

32:03.240 --> 32:07.720
No one's masturbating all afternoon unless they want like bed sores and a, you know,

32:07.720 --> 32:10.320
at the end of a relationship.

32:10.320 --> 32:14.520
And stereotypes will not be conquered during porn.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.520
No, no, no, no.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.600
No one, no one is really trying to learn anything.

32:17.600 --> 32:24.160
Anything you walk in the door with will only be magnified, probably won't be conquered.

32:24.160 --> 32:29.280
Except in the sense maybe that you're like, well, I'm being a little bit of a hypocrite

32:29.280 --> 32:34.680
if I am, for instance, like being an actively racist person in the outside world.

32:34.680 --> 32:35.680
But I don't know.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.680
I see both sides of the issue.

32:36.680 --> 32:37.680
What is the question though?

32:37.680 --> 32:40.120
Because you're just trying to get permission to look at more two black dudes, one white

32:40.120 --> 32:41.120
chick porn.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.120
Is that why you're here?

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
Oh no, I have permission.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.560
Well, if you did before you do now, some of you guys are black.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.560
No, no.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.560
I was just very curious about, because I talked to our friend DeMorge, who like he had a very

32:51.560 --> 32:55.840
interesting counterpoint, which was like, but I can't tell, I mean, obviously there's

32:55.840 --> 32:57.400
no binary answer to this.

32:57.400 --> 33:06.400
But as far as I could, I could like parse his very, very like almost densely like a different

33:06.400 --> 33:07.400
perspective point.

33:07.400 --> 33:14.880
Like yeah, but in all those moments when race is allowed to just be a thing like a Ben and

33:14.880 --> 33:19.960
Jerry's flavor, in those moments, the problem's being reinforced and blah, blah, blah.

33:19.960 --> 33:24.160
Like, well, that's, yes, if I'm getting him right about that, then okay, yes, but that's

33:24.160 --> 33:28.920
why I say, okay, yeah, porn is not the place where racism is going to be solved.

33:28.920 --> 33:33.960
However, ironically, I think it is less racist in porn than it is in the Oval Office, than

33:33.960 --> 33:39.040
it is in church, than it is anywhere you would go where people would say, we're, we're, we're,

33:39.040 --> 33:42.760
we're, because it's like just dopey people going, yeah, but at the end of the day, I

33:42.760 --> 33:44.800
come three times, I get paid $300.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.800
Right, right.

33:45.800 --> 33:46.800
Like, like, they can't have $300.

33:46.800 --> 33:50.720
You're talking about how you perceive, you, would you, $300?

33:50.720 --> 33:54.920
Rob, don't get distracted by the bookkeeping here.

33:54.920 --> 33:55.920
I'm done.

33:55.920 --> 34:00.640
But are you talking about, before we move on to headier topics, are you, are you saying

34:00.640 --> 34:04.320
that you feel like porn is more racist in its, in its construct and casting, or porn

34:04.320 --> 34:06.920
is more racist in the way that we perceive it?

34:06.920 --> 34:11.360
Because I would actually argue, and it's just came to me now, that porn may be both most

34:11.360 --> 34:15.920
racist and least racist in the way that we consume it, because we may treat people in

34:15.920 --> 34:19.640
one way, in the real world, the way we interact with them, we hire them, we don't hire them,

34:19.640 --> 34:21.560
we associate with the people that we want to associate with.

34:21.560 --> 34:25.400
But I bet you, there are a lot of white guys out there, and all their friends are white,

34:25.400 --> 34:29.360
and they've never had sex with a black girl, but that's the only porn they watch, is a

34:29.360 --> 34:33.400
white guy railing the shit out of a black girl with his micro penis.

34:33.400 --> 34:38.520
And it might, and it might even be part and parcel, it might even feed back into his hatred.

34:38.520 --> 34:45.280
Right, it might feed back into it, or it might just, it may be, it's interesting, like maybe,

34:45.280 --> 34:50.000
maybe he subscribes to the idea that all black men are, you know, virile, large penises.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.640
But, and I guess that's the line, it's like, like, I absolutely 100% agree with that.

34:54.640 --> 35:00.240
The penises are huge, like, baby's arms, every single one, prehensile baby's arms.

35:00.240 --> 35:04.640
Every black man can pick up a cup of coffee with his penis, bring it to his mouth.

35:04.640 --> 35:09.360
Actually, they're actually exactly like baby's arms, they have elbows, they have, they have,

35:09.360 --> 35:18.040
they have, they have, but they only bend one way, which is why most of them can't be quarterbacks.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.040
They'll all end up in the manager's office eventually.

35:20.040 --> 35:26.480
Google it, yes, I think, I think, I think same page, I think the, I think the interesting

35:26.480 --> 35:30.920
thing is it's like where you draw, I, I guess I was just doing an academic distinction where

35:30.920 --> 35:34.960
it's like, you know, for all intents and purposes, it's like the things you're seeing on screen,

35:34.960 --> 35:39.880
those, like, it's, when you're on the set, I find it hard to imagine the, when the stuff

35:39.880 --> 35:44.560
I'm watching, I'm like, I don't think that, I don't think that anyone is being made to

35:44.560 --> 35:47.000
feel less than human on that set.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
Well, aside from the fact that they're important, except for the fact that there's a stranger's

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
hand inside their anus.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.680
Other than that, they feel totally human and validated.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.240
I am validating you now.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.720
Do you feel validated?

35:57.720 --> 35:59.240
Your anus is immaculate.

35:59.240 --> 36:05.520
But then when you have a conversation about media as a phantom signal, that's not an industry

36:05.520 --> 36:09.160
and not a community of people, then of course, 100% agree.

36:09.160 --> 36:15.280
Of course you, it will only feed back if you're, if you're jerking off to the idea of gang

36:15.280 --> 36:17.960
bang this, and it's not going to make you not a misogynist.

36:17.960 --> 36:22.000
There's a million of things that porn reinforces that make you hate all of humanity, not based

36:22.000 --> 36:26.160
on color, just based on, you know, that we're all like these terrible, you know, creatures

36:26.160 --> 36:27.160
in pants.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.160
You know what I mean?

36:28.160 --> 36:29.160
Yeah, porn will make you hate yourself.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.680
It doesn't matter what color you are.

36:30.680 --> 36:35.760
This episode is brought to you by Pornhub, which I actually love what they're doing.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.960
And our good friends over, they're really, they're really like doing a lot of great

36:38.960 --> 36:39.960
stuff over there.

36:39.960 --> 36:47.240
They're, they're, I'm not kidding, they're, they're really breaking, they're really breaking

36:47.240 --> 36:48.240
ground.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.320
Here's something that they're doing that I actually, yeah, the comments section is

36:51.320 --> 36:52.320
really great.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.480
They're releasing press releases on St. Patrick's Day.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.480
That's nice.

36:55.480 --> 36:59.440
They'll go, here's how many people searched for leprechaun porn.

36:59.440 --> 37:03.400
It's subtly, it does what the Kinsey, you know, research did.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.400
Yeah, the Kinsey study, yeah, with the spectrum.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.400
Yeah, the Kinsey study.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.400
It just is a subtle reminder.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.120
It just goes, hey, everybody's a freak.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.120
Yeah, that's it.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.120
That's how weird you are.

37:10.120 --> 37:15.240
On April Fool's Day, they changed their, their front page to Cornhub, and it was all, it

37:15.240 --> 37:17.000
was all just cobs of corn.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Classic.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.680
And the, and the captions were like, hot buttered cob getting it from both sides from a napkin.

37:23.680 --> 37:27.640
And there was a guy who was like, finally, yeah, there was one guy who was like, oh,

37:27.640 --> 37:31.120
fuck it's April Fool's, no.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.440
But it was, you know, to approach it.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.940
Classic Pornhub.

37:35.940 --> 37:40.040
I would say, I would say, I don't want to open this kettle and then close it, but I would

37:40.040 --> 37:41.040
say.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.320
It's been open for hours, damn.

37:43.320 --> 37:51.040
Pornhub shares with Christianity, the, or any religion, let him talk, let him talk.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.040
Let him talk.

37:52.040 --> 37:56.360
The fact that it could use more smart, proud people involved in it.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.360
Okay.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.360
All right.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.360
Let's bring out some more difference.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.360
Just leave that there.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.960
It gets a bad rap because everyone's like, I don't know, I don't, I'm not involved with

38:03.960 --> 38:04.960
that.

38:04.960 --> 38:05.960
It's just a lot of alcoholism.

38:05.960 --> 38:06.960
Yes.

38:06.960 --> 38:07.960
Before we, before.

38:07.960 --> 38:08.960
So how long we've been working in porn?

38:08.960 --> 38:10.060
Oh, it's so long.

38:10.060 --> 38:12.000
I'm, I'm, I'm too.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.680
Like you're on a 900 shows, you write books, you do everything.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.320
Like you're, you're all over the.

38:18.320 --> 38:23.140
I, the thing about it is I think when people say like, I'm busy or I'm a workaholic people,

38:23.140 --> 38:24.440
like it's funny to people.

38:24.440 --> 38:28.200
Or even if you make the joke about being a high functioning alcoholic, people think

38:28.200 --> 38:29.480
it's really cute.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.800
And then you're like, no, I have a real problem.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.760
I need help.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.760
Like, like I do.

38:34.760 --> 38:40.440
I it's clear to me that I could use like several meetings about my work. I've just started approach that therapy where I'm like

38:40.440 --> 38:43.720
I left the drinking thing behind I finally have enough

38:44.160 --> 38:46.160
Tell me how that went for you. I

38:46.480 --> 38:50.920
Have enough faith in a therapist because she's like look if you want to drink for the rest of your life go ahead

38:50.920 --> 38:55.920
You can I come to her, please? Yeah, I'll give you a number. She sees everybody half the people in this room

38:57.600 --> 38:58.880
But

38:58.880 --> 39:02.880
She was like but you have yet to acknowledge your workaholism

39:02.880 --> 39:09.400
And that was like a real threshold for me because I would always go like she would go like you're she wouldn't say you're a

39:09.400 --> 39:12.080
Workaholic that's conversations not going to go anywhere. She's like you

39:12.480 --> 39:16.120
How is she would say this stuff and I would go like are you implying?

39:16.120 --> 39:19.760
I'm a workaholic because I'm not because I'm not getting enough done right yeah

39:19.760 --> 39:26.160
Yeah, no because I think about a workaholic is in it like in your construct you you not not only are you never busy enough

39:26.160 --> 39:32.400
You're never effective enough. That's like a little like the aeroboros little like you're only as valuable as what you did

39:32.400 --> 39:37.360
Oh, there's always gonna be more work. There's always gonna be more. Shut up mom. Here's the thing

39:39.120 --> 39:41.120
We're all going to die right

39:42.080 --> 39:44.080
We're all going to die

39:47.760 --> 39:48.960
And

39:48.960 --> 39:53.320
That affects people differently right some people think we're all gonna die. So what's the point?

39:53.320 --> 39:57.640
We're all gonna die. So let me get wasted my particular approaches. We're all gonna die

39:57.640 --> 40:02.920
So I I I should be doing more shit like I'm not doing enough shit like when I'm lying on my deathbed

40:02.920 --> 40:06.400
I'll be like why didn't I do all the shit? Yeah, we did half the shit. Yeah, you know

40:06.400 --> 40:08.400
I think that's a really simple

40:08.400 --> 40:14.480
Response I might I'm gonna die and one of the perfect sense right? Yeah, one of my shit grow your hair really long and bang it around

40:15.600 --> 40:19.080
Fucking you're on fire you and that was you stole my outfit

40:19.720 --> 40:24.640
Just real real quick one of the women in either hair or makeup at whose line

40:24.640 --> 40:29.880
Yeah, you I just walked out of the room and I was like, we're just talking about stuff and podcasts

40:29.880 --> 40:33.720
Oh, yeah, I'd love to get each on and they're like, don't you dare ask her to do another thing?

40:34.840 --> 40:38.640
I also have like shitty boundaries, too. I'll like show I mean I just I want to do

40:39.880 --> 40:45.320
She does enough stuff like like leave like give her some the most frightening thing to me

40:45.320 --> 40:50.880
And I am I don't know if this is this way for either of you is like looking at my calendar and having like a free day

40:50.880 --> 40:56.400
Like most people well frightening, but also to me. It's like running your tongue over a place where a tooth supposed to be

40:56.400 --> 41:00.640
Yes, it's like fucking orgasm, but also like I'm dying, right? Yeah. Yeah

41:03.120 --> 41:05.120
Saturday and nothing and then you just like

41:05.840 --> 41:10.440
Like I'll just run around until it's like raw and bleeding the coolest

41:10.440 --> 41:15.680
I mean I knew I knew I was your like like like like I don't know

41:16.320 --> 41:17.840
We do look alike

41:17.840 --> 41:23.560
I could have fraternal twin when I saw like what you talked about your thing about

41:24.560 --> 41:30.680
When you saw Rocky or that your whole thing about boxing when oh, yeah, it's like it

41:31.000 --> 41:35.960
Doesn't matter how many times you get hit. It's it's not how hard you hit

41:35.960 --> 41:41.040
It's so hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, which is a code from Rocky Balboa

41:41.080 --> 41:44.840
It has nothing to do with how much of a badass you are like I'm the biggest

41:44.840 --> 41:48.000
I'm the baddest on my dick is so huge although my dick is enormous. It's

41:48.640 --> 41:53.520
It's just like your tin like you're how tonight how tenacious you are because the fact of the matter is you're gonna fail no matter

41:53.520 --> 41:55.160
What there is no avoiding failure, right?

41:55.160 --> 41:59.520
It is literally laying in the road waiting for you to pull up in front of it like an episode of The Walking Dead where you

41:59.520 --> 42:01.920
Pull up and there's a car in the middle of the road motherfucker you about to get shot

42:03.080 --> 42:07.440
It's more about like can't like how many times can I recover?

42:07.440 --> 42:11.000
Yeah, I mean and everybody who's successful isn't successful because they're magic

42:11.000 --> 42:15.680
They're successful because they just they're like a junkyard dog. Well, it's almost as if you

42:16.760 --> 42:24.280
Like will never be a good person until you've empirically proven it by subjecting yourself to acid test after that is true

42:24.280 --> 42:30.800
Yeah, there is something there is some like self satisfaction in the like I'm the toughest person out here

42:30.800 --> 42:35.800
You cannot break me and even if you say okay, you have the job then I'll get fired

42:35.800 --> 42:41.360
Right, right, right like this is all gonna end at any minute. So I've got so many jobs that even if I got fired from nine of them

42:41.360 --> 42:48.480
There's a tenth one at like, you know serving that frozen shit at juice press juicery like I'm gonna have one job left

42:48.960 --> 42:50.960
Which brings me to why I'm here

42:52.360 --> 42:55.200
No, I just I like literally I have a week off this year

42:55.200 --> 43:00.320
I've one week off for all of 2016 and I decided I was gonna direct a movie in that hole

43:00.320 --> 43:08.480
In that in that ten-day hole. I'm serious. I was I was like fuck it like why wait until next year the year after to make

43:08.480 --> 43:15.600
Myself my life a living hell so I have a Kickstarter campaign because as you know people love giving money to black people and they love even more given

43:15.600 --> 43:17.600
money to women so

43:17.600 --> 43:21.520
Everyone's like you're a Hollywood lady. You you know just go get your Hollywood friends to give you money

43:21.520 --> 43:23.720
I don't know when's the last time you saw a black female film director

43:24.400 --> 43:27.120
Meep meep meep mop

43:27.120 --> 43:30.280
Wait, oh, that was radar sweeping

43:31.280 --> 43:34.940
Or a really shitty cricket impression. That's the black people think cricket

43:37.080 --> 43:43.040
That's how that's how that's how dejected they are these people don't have crickets

43:44.960 --> 43:48.480
Will you please go to Aisha's Indie go-go page

43:49.960 --> 43:51.960
Give black people a chance

43:52.560 --> 43:54.560
To hear crickets

43:54.560 --> 43:59.040
I'm so poor for $45 a month you can send I eat you to a farm

44:00.800 --> 44:05.600
Crickets live we should get understand how crickets actually sound I grew up in city. I'm there. I'm well

44:05.600 --> 44:10.080
I'm I'm I just I want our other guests to know that we haven't forgotten about no

44:10.080 --> 44:12.720
No, we haven't forgotten about that anyway, that was all I wanted to say was

44:13.280 --> 44:18.440
We should get to let's get specific and then bring them out about your because this is your your arm in town

44:18.440 --> 44:23.840
Did you kick start the movie harm to him? No, I would never be caught dead kick-starting. No, I

44:32.680 --> 44:36.200
What I did do is you know what white privilege smells like snickerdoodles we

44:37.560 --> 44:40.540
We kick started an Amalisa the

44:41.680 --> 44:43.680
Warm cookies

44:43.680 --> 44:48.480
That's brute by Faber J. No you groups you you we can't start we kick started an Amalisa

44:48.480 --> 44:55.880
We raised 400 grand overnight because that's what we asked for and then we raised that and then some and then proceeded to find out

44:55.880 --> 45:00.000
The movie cost eight nine million dollars right right and we couldn't tell any of them

45:00.000 --> 45:04.960
We basically have a long story short like I felt like we fucked up like a kick-starting

45:04.960 --> 45:11.840
So I haven't gone back since like I want like I think that that's a really sacred thing like it's a bond you're making

45:11.840 --> 45:15.720
Well, you're like a bond of kind of honor and and you know

45:15.720 --> 45:19.280
You're making a promise to people that you're gonna do but I also think that it's not free money

45:19.280 --> 45:22.640
It's a weird way you're taking more energy than you would

45:24.400 --> 45:29.760
And you're putting into updates and stuff because you're you owe you owe people a relationship to the project

45:29.760 --> 45:33.520
You owe people a connection to what you're doing. That's ongoing and people I think well

45:33.520 --> 45:35.840
I'm just giving you money. We'll know like if you donate

45:35.920 --> 45:41.760
Let's say you donate 30 bucks and you get a t-shirt the t-shirt probably costs like 15 or 16 bucks to make and like seven or

45:41.760 --> 45:45.600
Eight bucks to send to you. So really this is just about us hanging out. You know, I mean

45:45.600 --> 45:49.200
It's just about us getting enough money to make this little thing. I donated

45:50.000 --> 45:52.560
$2,000 and I was supposed to hang out with Dan

45:54.800 --> 45:58.480
We just bring it and I still hasn't I still haven't gotten it

45:58.480 --> 46:04.000
Are you sure I haven't gotten a t-shirt or a copy? Are you sure? What's the $2,000?

46:04.400 --> 46:09.360
What's the name of my hard-earned money? What's the name money that I let me finish?

46:09.360 --> 46:16.240
My money my money that that's so hard to come by lately. Aisha. It's so

46:17.360 --> 46:19.360
and Dan

46:19.520 --> 46:21.520
Dan

46:21.920 --> 46:24.480
What's the name of the film what's the name of the Kickstarter so people can locate? Oh, absolutely

46:24.720 --> 46:30.880
The movie is called axis and you can just go to Kickstarter and put in and type in black lady

46:30.960 --> 46:35.120
I'm the only one on Kickstarter. By the way, I don't know where what black Kickstarter is access

46:35.120 --> 46:40.080
Isha Tyler, yeah, you can find it just my socials, you know, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr

46:40.160 --> 46:45.120
Isha Tyler and you think you could you're so much of a workaholic. You think you can direct a movie in one week

46:45.360 --> 46:50.400
Yeah, I do I do out of your minds. How about how long is the film? It's gonna be 90 minutes

46:50.480 --> 46:54.160
But here's what's cool about it. So here's what's the cool thing about it. Thank you guy who loves film

46:54.560 --> 47:00.480
Um, I love film too. I don't want someone to make it in a week. No, here's here's what's cool about this concept

47:00.480 --> 47:06.960
Come on. Let me tell you some things about goodwill hunting. You you think they spent months on that piece of shit?

47:08.880 --> 47:10.880
How do you like them apples

47:14.000 --> 47:17.360
I don't know if you guys saw the movie lock, but they shot that movie in five days

47:18.000 --> 47:22.480
So the way that we're doing this movie so that we kind of uh, you know, a lot of my friends are doing it for free

47:22.640 --> 47:24.640
Most people are doing it for a free or very cheap

47:24.720 --> 47:29.840
We're rehearsing it for the next two months and then shooting the entire movie every day

47:29.840 --> 47:32.640
Like a play all the way through from beginning to end

47:32.960 --> 47:37.280
That way we can adjust and pivot every night what worked what didn't go back and fix that the next day

47:37.360 --> 47:39.360
And by the end we'll have shot the movie

47:39.360 --> 47:42.000
Nine times in a row and then we'll choose the best takes

47:42.000 --> 47:45.680
Well, all bets are off now because did you see louis thing? Thank you. Thank you

47:46.960 --> 47:48.960
I'm a problem solver

47:49.600 --> 47:52.560
I should have known there would be applause there. I started talking

47:52.720 --> 47:55.920
But did you see louis ck's thing or it was at hoarse and pete what's it called?

47:55.920 --> 48:02.000
Uh, I mean a very experimental on the surface of it where you're like, I I should full disclosure. I have not seen it

48:02.080 --> 48:04.720
I'm I'm quoting my girl describing it, but he hasn't actually watched it

48:04.880 --> 48:08.560
She watched it and she's like it's like he's shot in a black box theater or something

48:08.640 --> 48:12.240
I thought she got hopelessly addicted to it. It turned from comedy to drama

48:12.240 --> 48:18.240
I mean louis ck is out there like doing whatever the fuck enters his head

48:18.720 --> 48:21.760
Taking full advantage of the new nothing where he kind of did it on his own

48:21.840 --> 48:24.720
So he could do whatever he wanted because he didn't have a studio going. I just don't

48:24.720 --> 48:26.720
I don't understand

48:27.040 --> 48:29.040
Why he has feelings

48:29.600 --> 48:34.000
Could he be good at his job? He's not likable. People like dogs. Yeah, exactly

48:34.560 --> 48:35.600
I don't want him to be human

48:35.600 --> 48:38.720
I want him to look like something that I might want to eat off a plate with syrup

48:38.720 --> 48:44.560
So if we could just could we have two black guys come in and just like fuck them with this big black dicks

48:44.640 --> 48:46.640
But then not stay no conversation

48:47.360 --> 48:51.360
Because they're fun because they're fun. They like their job is kevin heart available

48:51.360 --> 48:57.200
All right, so let's I I would like you to stay but you can leave any time

48:57.840 --> 49:00.720
I'm gonna sit here because you need a black friend. Let's do this. Let's bring out

49:04.560 --> 49:06.560

52:06.560 --> 52:13.280

52:14.240 --> 52:16.240
Oh, because geordi from star trek, right?

52:16.480 --> 52:20.160
That I was the only one that made that connection in this room. I didn't even know where you're talking

Yeah, I'm here for you. Here we go. Here we go empire followed by force awakens. I completely right seriously, right?

53:22.160 --> 53:27.680
The other ones are just like a bunch of I like star wars. I like the first one. I don't think empire's better than star

53:29.520 --> 53:31.520
Proctor this conversation. What?

53:32.400 --> 53:33.600
What?

53:33.600 --> 53:35.360

Two snow troopers out there. They said I know I took a snow trooper before I got you got more gear out front

53:41.600 --> 53:46.000
So being a guest on this show. It's great getting stuff. I love that

53:46.000 --> 53:51.520
Watch all of it. Are you is that your thing Dan? Not anymore. No, I haven't I haven't watched the new force

53:52.960 --> 53:56.880
I cried twice during the trailer and like eight times during the movie and I'm not even fucking around

53:56.880 --> 54:01.520
I cried I cried during the 20th century fox logo

54:02.720 --> 54:06.320
At phantom menace and my tears were punished

54:06.960 --> 54:13.520
Yeah, and shoved back into my tear ducts and I was burnt and then you had notes and then you had notes on your tears

54:13.520 --> 54:18.640
Yeah, and I was like, well, I can't I think Dan and I went to see phantom menace on a rainy

54:19.760 --> 54:24.640
Saturday afternoon at the vista theater when we the word was coming down the

54:26.160 --> 54:31.200
The grapevine that it was not a good movie and uh, and I called him up and I said

54:32.000 --> 54:34.880
Let's get it over with and it was like dead man walking

54:34.880 --> 54:41.520
We were walking we were standing in the rain and we we watched it and you know, I was like like Dan

54:41.520 --> 54:47.200
You know tearing up during like 20th century fox and a long long time ago and then the crawl started

54:47.280 --> 54:51.760
And it was like I'm like going oh my god. I made it again. It's a difficult time for the rebellion. I'm like, oh my god

54:51.920 --> 54:58.320
Here we go. Here we go. The embargo of the two tweets is the doing a thing with the the sanctions or the myanomar

54:58.560 --> 55:00.560
The crawl kept going

55:03.520 --> 55:10.240
Weird weird crawl but no problem on the upside the makeup department on this movie is on fire

55:10.240 --> 55:12.960
Making dots on Amidala's face

55:13.600 --> 55:17.280
Jeff fell asleep during force awakens. Yeah, I think I mentioned here

55:17.280 --> 55:21.120
I I did fall asleep and then I had a dream where I felt watched it in my dream and I fell asleep on my dream

55:21.120 --> 55:25.760
So you still haven't seen it at one point at one point. We're watching phantom menace

55:26.640 --> 55:30.640
At one point we're watching phantom menace and dan puts his hands

55:30.880 --> 55:36.000
He puts his face in his hands going. Oh my god. It's the worst movie ever made

55:36.000 --> 55:43.680
I I I I could tell you the frame. Yeah, I know I know and I'm like god damn it. Don't ruin this for me

55:44.080 --> 55:45.680
I'm holding on

55:45.680 --> 55:50.560
You know and rock because rock because I I went because we had an agreement. He was like, let's not prejudge

55:50.560 --> 55:54.960
I'm like, I'm not fucking here to prejudge. No, no, you realize they were made for children, right? Yeah, I don't

55:55.840 --> 55:58.960
All right, why you haven't gone to force awakens, which is like the most

55:58.960 --> 56:06.480
Stupendous filmic palette cleanser of that entire franchise. I could fix everything. Oh, so this one's for grown-ups. Yes

56:07.440 --> 56:12.400
All right, well, I'll give it a look see everything that you wanted to have happen in that universe

56:12.400 --> 56:16.000
It's out on blu-ray. Everything is great. Yeah, and then also

56:16.800 --> 56:21.520
Like I feel like there's another part of you like we're all we're all this person like I cut

56:22.320 --> 56:27.120
Six grade to see empire strikes back like I didn't go to school that day or the next day

56:27.120 --> 56:30.480
That's how much that franchise affected me. So even the shitty ones

56:30.560 --> 56:35.600
I feel like they're like the last three fries in the bottom of the pack. You just fucking eat them anyway

56:37.280 --> 56:40.400
They're not good black and they taste like feet, but you do it

56:42.880 --> 56:44.880
Because you love fucking

56:46.400 --> 56:48.400
Yeah, you're a shitty fan Dan

56:48.800 --> 56:50.800
I'm so in love right now. I know

56:50.800 --> 56:57.360
Have you have you seen the new trailer for the for the new one that's coming out?

57:01.200 --> 57:03.200
And I what I mean like

57:04.560 --> 57:06.720
The trailer is pretty cool. The trailer is pretty cool, right?

57:07.600 --> 57:09.600
Yeah

57:09.760 --> 57:14.160
And I watched and I went god damn it. Well, what else am I gonna do with the rest of my life?

57:14.240 --> 57:17.120
I gotta see this one. What are you gonna do with the rest of your money because I'm giving

57:17.120 --> 57:22.080
All things in the world. What do you do with the rest of tonight? I think you guys understand that me not bothering to click

57:22.320 --> 57:26.560
On force awakens has nothing to do with me deciding that it's good or bad or anything

57:26.640 --> 57:30.480
And we need you to be one of us. No, it's it's it's one of us

57:30.560 --> 57:36.960
It's the liberation of agnosticism after a lifetime of being battered around this fucking liberation

57:38.080 --> 57:40.080
Gnosticism

57:40.160 --> 57:43.680
It's the liberation. I'm on your I got Dan side

57:43.680 --> 57:49.280
I'm just kind of like like I I will watch that movie the day it crawls into bed with me and goes

57:49.360 --> 57:52.400
It's time to watch it because that's what star wars did

57:52.960 --> 57:55.840
Because I was three and I couldn't go anywhere. That'll help delay with your book

57:55.840 --> 57:58.800
What if matt daemon crawls into bed with you with the force wiggins over to my house?

58:00.400 --> 58:05.520
I just like like like look come on. You can't tell me come on force awakens not for grown-ups

58:05.920 --> 58:10.800
It's it's for grown-ups with kids. You know what? You know how it's for grown-ups. It's for grown-ups the way

58:10.800 --> 58:14.960
Okay, remember the first star trek movie the reboot with chris pine that one was for kids

58:14.960 --> 58:19.600
It was like a stupid fucking sequence where he goes through like a zoo except the water pipe black black black black

58:19.680 --> 58:24.000
And like it's like wow wow and then the second one you don't remember that the first star trek the first star

58:24.080 --> 58:29.680
I love the star trek. No, remember the fucking sequence where they get stuck in the like the little like pipe little water system

58:29.680 --> 58:34.080
They're like in the sewage and they're floating through the remember you didn't like that literally like a sound of like a

58:35.440 --> 58:39.200
Like you don't remember that no, I don't remember that and then the second one

58:39.200 --> 58:43.760
The star trek into the darkness or whatever that one was called. That was for grown-ups

58:43.760 --> 58:45.680
That was the one that was for grown-ups. Oh ironically

58:45.680 --> 58:49.360
I didn't watch that one because I was waiting for the world to react to the way they did the first one

58:49.520 --> 58:52.640
I really like the first one because it was so such a clever way of rebooting

59:00.320 --> 59:06.080
I can't just enjoy them die inside come back. Here's a movie go watch Diary of a teenage girl. It's really good

59:06.080 --> 59:12.000
I'm a grown-up now. Oh, no, you're I watch movies about teenage girls having sex with their parents

59:13.680 --> 59:16.000
Do you guys know what I did spoiler alerts?

59:17.040 --> 59:23.280
Last night. We're all friends. I I just that movie is two black guys away from being a classic

59:26.640 --> 59:30.720
I just know I did something last night that I think I might be the only person to have done

59:30.720 --> 59:36.080
I did acid and watched Easter Parade with Judy Garland and Fred Astaire. I

59:36.320 --> 59:41.520
Want you to know it was for real and it was fucking swinging man. I want you to know Jeff

59:42.080 --> 59:48.640
That is that was super heterosexual. Oh, no, then oh so then I said now the movie's over

59:49.200 --> 59:52.640
It's one it's one a.m. I'm still on acid and the lamp is like, hey

59:53.040 --> 59:58.960
Look at my lamp is like moving and walking around the room. I'm like, you know, I've never done. I'm tired, but I'm still high

59:58.960 --> 01:00:05.280
Yeah, so I go to I get in bed and I get my iPad and I've never watched because you guys

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.560
I just met Roger water. You guys are huge Floyd fans. Yeah

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.080
And we never really talked about we I've heard you guys talk about it on your show. It's a pink Floyd guy

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.160
Thank you. Yes

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.040
Yes, and you just saw Gilmore playing you guys have both seen it thousands of times. Yes. Yes, you guys are big pink

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:21.520
Floyd friends

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:25.200
I have never done the dark side of the rainbow where you watch the sink. Oh, it's good

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.760
I I was watching that in my in my bed a little bit on acid still where you watch

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.000
Uh, was it a vase synced up to dark side and I was like

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.200
Freakin out

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.320
Freakin I also I would freak out if I wasn't on acid. That's crazy. Yeah, it's not it's fun

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:47.680
But how who is the first person that noticed that Eric Simmons?

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.280
Stand up Eric

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.200
Is he here tonight? Is he here tonight? Eric Simmons is here tonight

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.080
Eric Simmons is here

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.560
Eric Simmons first person to

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.880
watch

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.080
the, uh,

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.360
Wizard of Oz

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.160
But here he is Eric. How did they Eric come on stage?

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.720
It's dhs. Can we get Eric up on stage?

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.840
Eric Simmons

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.240
Eric Simmons, you did it Eric Simmons. How you doing Eric?

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.400
Oh Eric, how you doing? Look at all those snacks Eric

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.440
You got some smokers

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.080
Oh, look at all those treats Doritos

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.120
Some Fritos and a Coke Eric

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.440
Eric look at all those Doritos Eric

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.760
Eric you seem a little young to have been the first person to have ever watched

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.080
Eric is 76

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.200
How did you know to time it?

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:55.280
To hit play when the lion roars, especially without dvds or yeah, how did you get your fan, huh?

01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.560
My dad's a big fan. Your dad's a big fan. Who's your dad? Eric Simmons. Mr. Simmons

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880
Richard Simmons

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.520
Richard Simmons

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:11.600
Richard Simmons is here. Can we bring Richard Simmons up? Where's Richard Simmons, but he's revealed himself on home towns

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.440
Richard Simmons

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.080
It's it's your trauma. Eric. Did you just leave our show and go buy a bunch of snacks? What happened?

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:25.280
There's a you don't have to go far. Oh, you can buy friends riveted by Star Wars. Can I can I turn this into entertainment?

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.280
Please

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.880
Please do this

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.320
Eric thank you for joining us. Sorry. It was compulsory

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.520
Sorry, you got bullied for liking

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.080
No, I like him. I like Eric Simmons

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.160
Eric Eric are you? This is not Eric

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.680
It's it's definitely not Eric. It's your name. That's the name

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.800
Eric, are you a fan of the Star Wars franchise in any capacity? Yes, I appreciate it

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.520
So we've got a group of people up here. We all feel differently about different phases of the

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.920
operation

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:08.640
Uh, I think, you know, maybe it's a little trite of me or maybe in my little little heart. I just want

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.920
entertainment to happen on this podcast at some point

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.640
Eric, would you just tell us like in your mind what the perfect

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.880
Where the perfect Star Wars movie would be set in terms of timeline?

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.800
Tatooine

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.800
and then

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.800
And then just to explain to you then

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.800
I we're gonna do it. I'm gonna do the movie

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.040
So you want plot points?

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.560
And Ayesha is gonna be a new form of Jedi and it's not gonna be... That's what the kick started for, right?

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.360
So make Ayesha a Jedi

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.960
Apparently I'm gonna be in a porn with two black guys

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:53.600
You know what? Eric, the floor. I'm going to just stop this. It is right after the second prequel when General Grievous dies

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.760
Oh, gosh, dude, that was so inside. We have to go Google everything now

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.960
Which was matrix revolutions. What was that?

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:05.840
The second prequel is Dark Knight Emerges

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.160
Dark Knight Reloaded. Electric Boogaloo

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.360
You're saying the sequel to Phantom Menace, right?

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.920
If you want a serious answer, I really like what JJ's done with it now

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.480
Okay, you've seen Force Awakens and you like it. Yes, but look, I'm gonna ask a bigger question here, right?

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.800
I feel like it's cool now to hate everything and that's not new. It's been cool for like 10 or 15 years to hate everything

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:39.280
And so like just basic ingenuousness, right? Like I love this franchise. Yeah, that wasn't my favorite

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.480
That's not fair. That's not fair. What you're doing is not fair. And if you notice Eric's opening his snacks right now

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:50.480
That's not fair. You know that Dan wants chips. I don't know if it's unfair that you hate chips, but it's unfair that I'm saying that you get inside

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.480
Oh, chips!

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.640
I haven't seen Batman versus Superman. I loved Batman versus Superman

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.520
And I feel like everybody hated Batman versus Superman because they just wanted to hate Batman

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.880
You just pulled the I just like like Eric Simmons everybody. Oh, he's not leaving. He's just giving me chips

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.520
All right. No Eric. Who's your who's your favorite? Who's your favorite star?

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.960
He has not blinked

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.960
This is a mess

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.360
I love it

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Eric Simmons

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.680
Eric Simmons, I'm calling you out

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.880
Oh, is he using he's using the force calling you out Eric Simmons Eric knowing can hear that but you

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.640
Eric

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:46.640
I'm kind of worried about your physical safety Eric Simmons Eric. No one can hear that but you Eric Simmons

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.360
Your cool ranch Jedi powers

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.600
Will not save you now

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.800
Eric Simmons, what are you doing later?

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.480
Probably getting drunk and watching Daredevil

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:13.920
That's a good show. That's the number one answer

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.320
It is a confusing time for the narrative

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:37.280
Eric Simmons has been summoned to the stage only to find out that he himself

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.400
Is within and weaving the narrative of the new Star Wars movie

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:55.200
Meanwhile princess Aisha has been honing her craft as a Jedi on the swampy ice planet of water sun

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.280
With with fleet fleet flop the Jedi master

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.040
One of 700 needless wipes

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:16.400
Does anybody not find it difficult that like the one thing the one issue with the entire Star Wars construct the the whole like

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.360
The whole UI

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.760
Sometimes shit is alien and sometimes it's not

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:36.160
Like it would seem even Aisha herself is unaware that the new movie is happening around her

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.240
People just run out of ideas like your name is bloop. Your name is clean plop. That's

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.600
And then you're Dan. Do you know what I'm saying? Like that's not

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:51.360
discouraged by her abilities as a padwan flip-flop calls the Jedi council

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.360
powers but via crystal holograms

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.760
I'm gonna look that up

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.760
No one returned

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.920
Planned by clinical depression flip-flop proceeds to palm springs

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920
to work on his book

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:30.160
At risk of depression meanwhile, the empire is up to something

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.280
And also

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.760
And lord scrotum what news from the fuckface

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.760
According to data analysis, there is a

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.360
Your data analysis grows weary on me

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:08.240
My lord, I'm only doing my best analysis of the data your best is worst

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.760
In the eyes of the Jedi

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:21.760
My lord, please your lord is well, it's me. It's our go ahead. Keep going. Sorry. I got you. I got to a cycle

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.480
Of refuting everything. That's okay. You're it's all right. It's it's Monday

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.640
I'm just saying that the data is saying that Eric Simmons is on planet after

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.080
As he should be

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.080
All will be revealed according to plan

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.720
Ah, shall I activate the set piece?

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.640
Send the new toy to the new environment

01:09:48.640 --> 01:10:10.640
We will do the 14th of 700 wipes

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.000
You've been conditioned to think this was impossible so it's amazing

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.760
Meanwhile it has nothing to do with the story

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.160
It wouldn't matter if this didn't happen

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.640
Meanwhile, I'm tangled in your tauntaun mean

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.320
Meanwhile in air city

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:50.400
The one black guy in the entire galaxy is just kicking it with a 40 ounce or of cold 45

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.720
I believe you're speaking about me

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.400
Handsome lazy love

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.640
Here's your cold 45 Billy D

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.560
I don't know what that is. I live a long time ago

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.480
In a galaxy far far away

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.840
Come see my city

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.480
You're crushing all of our childhood dreams right now

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.680
If you guys have played ball

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.600
I'm smearing them into dog poop. Look, excuse me, Lando

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.680
Lobot, yes. Hello everyone. Uh Lando

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:59.280
He's lobot. He doesn't know he's lobot, but he's lobot. I'm lobot dad

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:07.040
I'm just thirsty. I'll get you some drinks. Wow. Yeah, pretty cool. Wow. That should be explored for 20 minutes. Yes

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.400
Didn't you have an idea for a y

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:19.840
Slash z wing non fighter. Yes, we should augment that

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.640
Into something new

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:30.800
Oh, it might result in an x or y wing actual fighter

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.360
That's how it happens. Here's your movie in five days. I don't think lando

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.760
I don't think lando made those ships finishing my movie tonight guys. Put it on wax. All right. I've touched the nerve

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.480
Now

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.520
I'll do that. Are there are there any uh, Latino characters in the new movie in the new one or any

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.520
So many

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.160
There are po dameron. Who isn't po dameron like south american or something?

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.680
No, I think he's from like south america, right?

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.640
Is from miami latino is he?

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.320
Oh

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.160
Guatemalan, isn't he?

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:17.920
Your authoritative. This is very seductive. He's possibly gay. He's cuban. He's possibly gay. I have a pillow with po dameron's face on

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.920
Oh

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.120
I wake up to every morning. Thank you. I should I dropped a

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.160
Po dameron before I came on stage

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:32.400
My friends when I was in high school had a theory that shubhaka was the only latino in uh, and uh

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.160
Because his name is chewy, which is a nickname for Jesus

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.440
And he's brown

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.600
And he's a mechanic eric simons

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.480
Eric simons

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.480
Eric simons, do you care to comment?

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.480
No

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:56.160
Because that is good for you. What I like about eric is that eric? I feel like eric is like I really could be at home

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.480
Watching daredevil now

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.240
No, no, I regret all of my life choices that resulted in this moment

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.800
I might regret getting up and using the bathroom at the very moment

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.360
Yeah, but you got right you could be in the back. No, I made you had to give away half your doritos, bro

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:19.360
Do you want the cool ranch taco bell Dorito? I have not had said Doritos Locos taco. That's pretty good

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:30.000
Real quick real quick it is a difficult challenge time for everyone that's talking taco shell

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.400
Has the flavor of cool ranch

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:39.360
But it doesn't have the substance and texture of an actual dorito. So you bite into it. You're like this is a thin

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:47.120
Substitute for an actual cool ranch Dorito and I could have just bought all the fillings for a taco and stuck some real

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.280
Fucking Doritos into that

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:56.240
Dorito not just fired. All right. I'm gonna clean up this stage. I'm gonna send eric simons back to the scene with his ship

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.640
eric simons everybody

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.320
Thanks, eric

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.320
He fought like a lion

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.640
also

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:11.040
Jordy and fred welcome to these the special give-and-take episode doesn't make you want to listen. I love this right now

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.640
eric simons is a fox

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.400
Looking good

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:22.400
Now Jordy man with half a bag of doritos in his hand. I just noticed that you've been holding a mysterious box yourself the entire time

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:27.680
What are those your story your snowtroopers? No, these are not my snowtroopers. Okay, so now and it's not your turd

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.240
Okay, so I know you pooped in a box

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.040
Okay, so I'm a big fan of this movie called sergeant peppers a lonely heart club

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.680
Never heard of it. Never heard of it. It's with um the bg's and peter frampton and they sing beatle songs. It's fantastic

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.680
I don't think it's fantastic in the way they intended

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.240
But it's a wonderful film if you haven't seen it check it out

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:52.240
Anyways, I was searching on ebay for some memorabilia from this movie and I found um some shoes

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.880
That allegedly were george berns's shoes. No, okay now

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:03.200
No, they were like three thousand dollars or something like that. So I'm like I sure as hell can't I'm not gonna buy george berns shoes

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.280
For three thousand dollars unless I'm incredibly high and drunk at late at night, which hasn't happened in a while

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.960
um

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.160
So one day I tweeted about them then one day I found a box backstage that was sitting there for weeks

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.240
And I just was too afraid to open backstage when you guys on the road on the road. Yes. Yeah on the road

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.120
I found this box right now. I found it. I thought well someone brought it. Hey someone brought you a gift

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.080
I'm like, okay put it over with a pile of gifts because I'm just so loved by everybody

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.600
I get so many gifts. I just get so many gifts. Yes. Just so many with the other be actually called no in origin

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.200
But you know, and maybe it's you know, there's anthrax in here and whatever is heard

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.320
Maybe it's an aborted baby from some of those are the best who knows

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.760
Um, anyways, so I opened it up and lo and behold

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.640
I found of the white italian loafers. No

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.560
Those are those the ones that you wanted. These were the ones that I wanted

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.360
And I got so excited that I queued up sergeant peppers lonely hearts club in on tour bus on tour

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.720
We watched the whole thing watched a thousand times. I was trying to pause it

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:03.120
I'm like and I finally found a shot with him with him dancing with the with white shoes on but they weren't these shoes

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.840
So I was like, oh my god

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.080
So and they said butterfield and butterfield on them and everything so I called and I found out they were actually

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.560
George Burns's shoes from oh god, you devil to

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.640
Yes, even better. No, three the third one. So

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360
Oh god, you devil. Yeah

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.200
Yeah, he's dancing. He's dancing in these shoes at a wedding reception as a devil

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.880
Because those look those look a little later like in terms of design than the sergeant peppers for me

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.040
Yes, yes, sir. Well italian loafers, uh, and I'm just that these are not a gift

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.360
These are just these were a gift for me. So no one can have these but I'm willing to let anyone try them on

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360
Who's the size?

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.480
There's a size of Cinderella if someone can put these on

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.120
someone a size seven and a half

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.560
Eric Eric Simmons. Are you a seven and a half? Eric Simmons. No, I mean you could

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:57.440
That's not if I when a guy's feet in that small he starts to become hot. Yeah, but it's definitely not Jeff's because

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.680
I've heard things about Jeff Jeff Bryan Davis. You can't even put your hands in those shoes. You giant

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.000
He's a little George burn shoes, but he was well and out

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.480
It is a frustrating time for the legion of shoes certified

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.240
so

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.240
That's why he had the cigar because he had small feet

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.600
um

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.640
but

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.640
If anyone's willing to try these on

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.080
Seven and a half who's gonna come on up. We have a young

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.520
I can't wait. Can I do that on your show? Can I invite someone up? Oh, yeah

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.720
Invited Erica. I think you might have noticed this. It's a fucking free-for-all. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.360
And uh, obviously this is in Cinderella. I'm not going to take you home and get weird

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.880
What is your name madam? Although seeing you maybe he might be everybody. This is really exciting actually

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.920
Hi, Stephanie. Someday my prince will come

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.560
Oh

Have you never seen them on a feet until I've never seen no one's one of them except for George. Yeah

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.760
This is no good for video or audio

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:06.560
Wow, what are you doing? Yeah, can you just do a handstand so everybody can see yes podcast get

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.600
A little higher, sweetie. Now Stephanie. Do you know who George Burns is even?

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.640
You don't know

Even better. She has no idea

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.160
He's one of he's one of the greatest comedians in in american comedy history. Uh, uh

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:30.960
He's testing you. She's testing you. Well, it's the best stuff is when it was him and uh

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.960
His wife Gracie who died before him and he always said that she was the funny one

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.880
Good night. Gracie. Say good night. Gracie. Good night. Exactly. Say good night to the folks. Good night to the folks. Yeah

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.320
Fantastic. So you do know him. You know that joke

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.320
All right, thank you Stephanie. You might not know this about George Burns, but he had a terrible fungal infection in both of his feet

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.320
And

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:59.440
Actually what ended is why he didn't want to wear him and he was the last person to wear those shoes

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:06.080
So he actually he actually died of foot herpes. It was just I guess that was a the only known case of foot herpes

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:11.920
The only fatal the only fatal which is the name of this drink made in italy

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.960
Made in italy

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.280
Sure after you touch George Burns. Yes

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.200
Exactly have a drink. Thank you Stephanie. All right

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.840

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.920
Yes, Jeff what moot you you brought those just to show and tell was that just to show off?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.440
Well, I just wanted them to be immortalized on on I've talked about these shoes for years

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:37.280
But I wanted them to be immortalized on mortalized arm and town. I'm so I'm a few years

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.680
That's cool. Are you a collector?

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:45.040
I am I wanted to get like a what do you call the box a shot shadow box or something that spins

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:49.600
Yeah, and but I mean would just take up too much room in my house. Well, you've got Kurt Cobain's jacket, too

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.760
No, I have his jeans. Oh, it's jeans. No, I have his jacket. You have his jacket. He has jacket

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.800
I was gonna say the worst possible thing I could say

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.880
So we get Billy Zane's pants. Oh, yeah

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.600
Also, if you listen to their podcast

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.040
Yeah, if you listen to if you listen to hour of goon

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:10.720
You will find out that these guys have an abiding obsession and love a deep love. I would say of Billy Zane

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:16.800
Oh, you guys really love that. Who the fuck doesn't love Billy Zane? No, are you in Billy Zane? Where is he?

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:21.520
Where isn't he? That's no, but where is he though Jordy and Fred?

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:27.520
Can you get us Billy Zane because your friends with Billy Zane? Yeah, we can get Billy Zane as long as I'm here with him

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:32.160
Yes, yeah, no, you're not coming without Billy Zane. Dan doesn't want him on the show

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.560
What you don't want Billy Zane on the show? Dan's anti Billy Zane

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:44.240
Dan is not interested in Billy Zane. Yes, he is. Yes, he is. I'm the most interested person in Billy Zane that has ever been

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:51.040
Second most. There was an article in salon about how much more interested I am in Billy Zane than Billy Zane

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:58.480
There's like a point counter point and he's like wait, what's my favorite ice cream? I'm like rocky road butch

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.160
And he's like did you say bitch or butch and I'm like

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:08.080
Oh, and he's like that's what I would have said and I'm like, yeah, because I'm zany

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.240
It's like I've been unseemed and I'm like, yeah, I think he's doing fine. Is he okay? I think he's doing fine

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.560
You should get on a snapchat. Yeah

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.440
I'm like worried about Billy Zane like you see people and you're excited about them and then you just want to know what they're doing

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:25.280
He's got TV show. He was on community. No, he's on that great show. He's on the show on Netflix

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.680
He's on the show where all the guys go down and they die in Mexico

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.520
Oh, yeah

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:33.520
Hello. Yeah

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.880
Wasn't there it was a challenging time for the people of

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.680
Amazon prime

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.400
People on the planet of amazon prime be joyless. You guys didn't get the cute other guy

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:49.760
Why did you do a star wars movie with you guys? We weren't with you the whole time? No, you weren't you were with me?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.880
Dan, I think the problem was because we're all sitting in a straight line and it was no like we can't see each other

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.680
I think it was too much going on at once and everybody was so excited

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.320
Well, I don't want to fight about it. Jeff is validating you. The guy who invented the the pink Floyd thing was up here

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.720
So it was just there's a lot of people, you know

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.760
Well, okay, that's how you guys feel

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:12.480
Do you guys do you guys would you guys ask dan and aisha?

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:16.640
The brunch question. Oh, oh, okay. Okay. Oh, should I start?

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.800
Then I'll lead and then it is a difficult time for the brunch question. Okay

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:26.720
Now we can we can dad leave it leave it. So, uh, you know, I'm at home, right?

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:32.080
And this guy likes to eat brunch all the time. He never eats at home for some reason the fred over here. It's delicious

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.720
Never eats at home. This is drink. I know I'm listening

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:40.080
I'm telling you fucking brunch and me and you there you go. Really? Oh dude. You may be a delicious drink by the way

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.080
I feel very strongly about brunch

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:46.720
Thank you. Good. And I would like you involved with this very so he invites me to brunch and I can't get over this

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:52.240
At this this predicament that's in my head constantly. So he invites me to brunch and I sit down and we wait

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.560
We have small talk and then I'm panicking

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.480
I start sweating because a waitress is coming over to ask what we want to drink, right?

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.040
And I want them to ask him first, but for some reason they always ask me first. Maybe it's a long it's the hair

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.160
It's the hair. That's what I was saying

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.440
Authoritative hair. Yeah, I'm the you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah, it's the hair

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.880
and

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.840
Since it's brunch, which I think is a bullshit fucking word anyways

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.440
It's like I don't know why it's that breakfast or lunch they go. Well, what do you want to drink?

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:21.680
I'm I'm totally in confused. Do I get orange juice or do I get iced tea because it's going to dictate what I have

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.160
If we're having breakfast or if we're having lunch

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.360
So you don't have an orange juice with so so he orders a nice tea, right? He orders the iced tea

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.840
So I'm thinking I'm in the clear for lunch

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:38.480
So I order I order a nice tea too and then I order the tuna melt and he throws his curveball and orders a breakfast burrito

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.880
So now I'm like

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.040
Right fucking right

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.520
That's like what the fuck?

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.880
And now

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.480
Now we're having breakfast and he's having lunch and I can't fucking do this

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.640
I feel terrible

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.480
I can't do it

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:59.280
Fuck kind of relationship business. I don't understand. It's all in my head though. He doesn't give a shit. I do

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.080
I

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.520
He has an issue with the fact that I get a fucking Arnold Palmer while I'm getting a

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.160
Breakfast burrito. That's why I fucking hate brunch make it breakfast make it lunch 11 o'clock sucks

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.760
But then he'll have orange juice at like three in the afternoon. What's that about?

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:20.960
Are you are you got if if if if if if you guys are looking for a person to tell you you're sane?

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.920
You've got the wrong guy, but if you if you want me to tell you it's okay that you're out of your fucking mind

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.560
I'm on your side, but that doesn't

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.760
What we're asking

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.680
Makes no sense to me and I'd like to think my

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.040
Fred Fred put did I not explain it out of you guys?

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.400
Be syncopated you get it you're pissed too, right?

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:51.120
You get weird when somebody orders breakfast at the same time you eat lunch. That's the whole thing

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.800
Take Dan to brunch like what's the worst case scenario? Can we explore the worst case scenario?

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:03.120
Absolutely, that's why we're trying to break it down as a virtual reality scene. Okay, so who's who?

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:08.080
I could be the waiter. I could be Geordie. I could be Fred. I guess you'll be the waiter. I'll be me

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.840
Or we can I could be the waiter

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.960
I'm going to do the corollary. I'm just gonna hold and do the corollary. So I'm just standing by

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:22.560
For post script. I won't do I won't do a ton of blocking. I'm just standing up to like getting this out. Wait. Is aisha

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I'm doing the post credits coda. Okay standing. I'm just standing down

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.800
Oh, good to know because obviously nobody fucking understands brunch at all

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.640
On this stage

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.800
I have I have brunch

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.800
I listen to your show and I I'm I see only podcast I yell

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.320
I'm in my car and I'm yelling at my car stereo going like look who gives a shit or or

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.560
Too bad, I'm totally on Geordie's side on certain things. I'm totally on Fred's side

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.960
Dude brunch is MMA. All fight styles are invited

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.880
If you want to drink orange juice, it's okay. If you want, I see it's okay

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.840
If you want to get fucked up at nine in the morning

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.720
That's true

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.800
That is why brunch was invented. You're sober. You've had 17 coffees

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.320
I'm about to fucking masturbate at the table because I'm wasted

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.920
Hey, wait, what wait, what was the end?

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.040
Okay, okay. I love you. Aisha voice of the people

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.200
Plus a little five percent nugget there. That's

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.640
What was that brunch is whatever you want it to be. Yeah, I heard that part. I heard that part

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.680
We are just what that is. Yeah, but what about sharing a meal with someone?

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.920
No, you and I are at the same table. That's all the sharing that you get from me

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.600
But there's the eggs and tuna on the same thing doesn't match. I had pancakes and a bottle of vodka

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:01.520
And a piece of pie because you were drunk you ordered breakfast at the long time

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:05.280
USA

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.560
What I have

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:22.080
I'd like to apologize to Fred and Jordy. It's not normally like this you guys

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.880
I mean, well, I'm happy right now. No, actually

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.880
I I take I take that back. It's always like this right like if you're like a straight missionary style position

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.160
And then in the middle someone slips a finger into your bum

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.560
You just go look that wasn't what I was expecting

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.640
But hey, you know, that's how you get down

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:45.600
I'll drink my iced tea and you have your tuna melt and everything's gonna be okay. So yeah, if you have an iced tea, I can have a tuna melt

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.880
Yes, exactly. Okay matches with the tuna melt, but not your juice

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.160
In the in the interest of orange juice and tuna melts definitely do not

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.720
Hey, Aisha, Aisha, do you want to get brunch after the show?

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.720
These guys are saying, you know, I do

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.920
Let's just do the maybe I'm okay. Let's let's just do the virtual scene. I'll be the way

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:10.000
We're brunch. I just want to because I you know, you don't know like these guys may have a so okay

Are we sitting at the table? Dan? You should be at the table. Yeah, Dan. Be at the table. Can I be I'll be the waiter

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:21.360
I'll be a new one. I'll be the waiter be a neutral waiter sketches race. I

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.040
I question Aisha Tyler's ability to be an impartial waiter

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.080
I'll be the way our server. I'm gonna be the waiter. Where are we having brunch you guys?

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.960

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:56.000
He's all right. That's fine. He looks like he looks like Jason Zedekis, but like tough guy mode

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:02.160
Well, that's not no, I didn't I didn't want that to happen. We're not going to start talking about you

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:22.320
This place is too wet to ever take your order. I can't come to you. The service is usually good here. Can we get some water?

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:28.320
I'm building a diorama in my home. Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor come into the kitchen right now. I want to talk to you. I'm making my own kombucha

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.320
I can't serve you

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.960
The other day my husband went down on me and it confused me. I can't serve you

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:39.840
I'm black or cisgender. I'll be right back

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:46.960

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:50.320
Oh, we're doing good. How are you? Welcome to brunch at the 101 cafe

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:54.880
I've worked through some personal issues and um, I'm prepared to serve you so

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.560
But not serve you like a servant. Just serve you in an egalitarian. We're on an equal level

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:06.160
Uh, we never I'm going to graduate school. What would you like? We'll tip well. Okay. Go ahead and order quickly

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:12.400
I've got to just let the brunch starters. I'm gonna go for uh, I'll have a water and a bloody Mary

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.160
A water and a bloody Mary great

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:18.800
It's always important to order an alcoholic beverage and a bit of hydration at the same time. Good choice. What would you like?

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:24.320
Um, what are you gonna get to drink? Don't let him validate your choices make make your own choices

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:31.600
Brunch is your own. Whatever you want. You're hyzen you're hyzenberging this principle right now. Whatever you want is okay

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.240
I believe I'm gonna go with the arnold palmer. Nicely played a robber palmer. Is it robber palmer?

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:40.480
Well, that's one arnold drumming. That's one where I have on red lipstick and I dance poorly to shitty music

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.480
But I'll bring you an alder and palmer

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.280
Do you guys have a full bar?

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:52.080
Unfortunately, no, but I can get you some really shitty mimosa's in a pitcher. Oh, it's beer and wine champagne

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.080
Uh, we've got champagne

01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:00.160
Uh, one wine cooler this guy's got a bloody Mary and my yeah, I got a bloody Mary. Oh, yeah, we have bloody Mary's too. Yeah, okay

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.680
So you have a pitcher of bloody Mary's pitcher mimosa's

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.320
Pitcher of kombucha that I made in my car

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.120
But I can't get a cocktail

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:16.160
Where do you think you are? Was that kombucha run across your body into? Yes, right through in my vagina and into

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.800
Yes, I'll take a

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:25.040
Uh, uh mimosa. All right a mimosa. Mimosa. Yeah, clearly. You've never had a mimosa. Well, I was

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.360
You're allowed you're allowed to get vodka hit this guy over here. Okay. No, I'm a guy

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.200
I'm a guy over here in the mood. So in my brain nobody in a guy at the next table is criticizing us the whole time

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.800
He's having a bloody Mary. I eat your stand down

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.720
I have seen study in 45 minutes. Can we do this?

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:49.600
So can I give you what's going on in my brain right now? Yes. Um, you've gotten your drinks. You have your drinks

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:56.240
Here we go. Okay. Now. What would you like? Well Dan ordered a mimosa. So there's orange juice in that. So maybe this is breakfast

01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:01.120
Here's your here's. I'm thinking this. I'm thinking this. Are you happy with my brain right now?

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.160
So I think you got orange juice bloody Mary is breakfast

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.080
That's so why don't I bring you the orange juice? I think we're having breakfast

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:14.560
Oh, no, thank you. Sure. Do you like would you like some orange juice? I feel like the star wars characters at the other

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.560
Table are talking about us

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.640
You can have anything you want

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:24.560
Okay, so bring me an orange. It's a difficult time for the premise of the brunch conversation all in the same glass

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.960
You want the arnold palmer with the orange juice in the same glass? Yes, I don't think you're gonna like that

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.800
I'll bring you an arnold palmer and an orange juice and if you'd like to make an oj

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:39.120
Iisha we're trying to do a sociological study of the brunch conversation

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:45.920
Hey, I'm standing by there's star wars guys at the other table that you guys are missing is if he wants an orange juice

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.960
And a bloody Mary and an arnold palmer and a beer and a punch in the nuts

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.480
He can have all of those things because it's brunch. That's the nature of brunch. All things are possible

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.960
I just figure this out

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:04.400
That's what I'm saying. I should nail it all order pancakes and french fries and burger

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:11.360
But more dessert. This is why I'm in the back making kombucha. Are you away just right now?

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:17.040
Are we are we gonna take our orders? Honestly, where is this girl? Like what is this? Go Fred. What do you want?

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:22.320
I'm gonna have the breakfast burrito. Oh delicious. That's breakfast and lunch at the same time. What would you like?

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.360
That's what you know what? I just got the solution. Okay

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.720
I'll chicken and waffles

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:33.760
That's it sir. There we go. A winning choice. I'll have chicken and waffles. I believe in you deeply

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:41.040
I just figured it out right now. I got it. Sir, what would you like for breakfast? I'd like a 12 year old's private

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:51.540
But...

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.880
I like 12 year olds

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.400
Back to the tape

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:06.720
I've actually said I figured it out. I'm sorry. An english muffin

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:13.360
So I've been thinking as brunch is prison, so it's actually brunch is freedom brunch is freedom my friends

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:19.400
Brunch is the only free meal of the week. It's the only meal within you can fully express

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:27.360
I never thought without judgment or recrimination. I the world is yours. Hey, I never thought I would say twiz. I'm

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:32.360
World is mine. Wait. He says twiz. Um, you don't remember twiz. Um, the world

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.360
Thank God

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.960
But but but I never like

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:45.760
Brunch brunch as the meal that where you're free insinuates that the other meals you have you're constrained

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:53.080
What I don't understand why people thought I love brunch so much. Why I don't really rules my so do we has everyone been eating so do we

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:55.320
constrained me

01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:03.560
Yes, well here's what's that way everyone hates me. Yeah, right from listening to the hour of getting an egg McMuffin at noon

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:11.640
When you when someone's trying to do breakfast all day dinner the implication is I'm breaking the rules, right? Yes

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.800
You're right. Oh god. I had pancakes dinner. I'm out of control. I eat zero for dinner

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:21.200
I'm alone and nobody loves me, but I think I think from this from listening to their show anything at brunch

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:26.040
You can eat anything. I'm listening to from listening to Fred and Jordy show. I think what you find out is that

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:33.560
Jordy you have a little bit more social anxiety about like am I am I stepping on somebody's toes? Am I doing this wrong, right?

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:39.240
Really, I thought I'm gonna let you decide it. This is going to be either breakfast or lunch

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.600
Jeff is like I'm gonna put this back on the rails

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.320
No, I just

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.200
Honestly, and I am going to dignify this evening

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:52.760
Honestly, actually the thing that I wanted to talk about just to kind of switch gears like this whole show's been about

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.400
self yes

01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.240
To a fault is that not the essence of when I told people that I was coming on the Harmontown

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:09.760
There were a couple girls that actually said oh Jeff Davis. Oh, he's great, but one specifically said, you know, he's hung like a horse

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:17.680
Jeff Bryan Davis, that's true. That's really true. Yeah, and and the girl actually said she goes he was so big

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:20.840
barely could fit and

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.120
Said that she could do cheated pull-ups by the pool

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360
using your dick

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360
That's what she told me

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.960
And so I was telling you right

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:39.360
I would see you in your suits and I and I realized that you

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:44.640
That you weren't pretty tight suits. I feel like that's what I wanted to talk about Dan

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.640
Is this been talked about on the show?

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.080
No, no, Jeff's a huge dick. Yes

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.680
No, it hasn't been talked about as such

01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:01.000
I could go on to argue that every fucking episode

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.800
One way or another keeps coming back around to it

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.160
Since we're all doing one of the fuck we want tonight. I mean, I got but I

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.400
Feel like I would remember somebody somebody doing pull-ups in a pool

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.720
This is what was being told to me. So I just wanted to bring it up and it does it

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.600
It's not ringing a bell right now. Okay? Well, we know who we're talking about

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:33.400
Yeah, I think you I showed you a picture and I said this is the one I listened to your last podcast

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.120
And you're like, I hope Jeff doesn't hear this so you could bring it up. I didn't think you would listen

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.520
I'm a fan of your goddamn show

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:45.160
Stop trying to turn this into something respectable

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:52.880
I love your show and just stop it. Just when I heard it that level I was like, wow

01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.400
Oh shit, you guys know this

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
No, you're adorable. Huh?

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.480
No, this is no

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.960
You guys are you uncomfortable? They're gonna be like zombies coming after you after this is over the problem

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.560
The problem is my dick is it's quite long, but it's shaped exactly like a treble cliff

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.520
So

01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:20.520
Sex is almost impossible

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.960
But it's nice because it's always a math problem. How is this gonna work?

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:30.640
Everybody turns into a blind person using braille. Okay, it's always in the key of D. Carry the one

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:32.640
I

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:45.560
My shame to admit I don't understand the D key of D. Right. No. Yeah, that I get

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:56.520
I thought it was like is is key of D like a Motown

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:06.200
The opposite of races I allow for the possibility of Motown people we don't even know

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:15.680
I'm constantly anticipating their existence. And now the opposite of races. Well, there might be a lady named T of D

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.800
Order order in the court order

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.480
May I may I ask to deflect off of this shit?

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.080
Can I can I bring up when I did please stop talking about my penis?

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:33.840
I feel super uncomfortable when I did our of talking about my big dick when I did our of goon

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.040
We were just we just did all name-droppy stories and shit like that

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:42.280
But you Jordy had a story about going to the playboy mansion. Can you can you say that story?

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:48.560
The yeah, yeah, you like that story fucking. It's it's the greatest rock story. I've ever heard I think okay

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.400
Well, I want to hear the story. It's really not that now you got built it up

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:58.440
It's really all before it could there be a fight between two characters in it. Well, he's a swords

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:04.320
I had just talked about Dan and one of them used to be on girls

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:09.320
I had just talked about the story of Dan and Rob getting high with Adam Corolla and meeting

01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.480
Hasselhoff and that weird conversation

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:19.700
And so that was my like my offering of my playboy mansion story and then Jordy goes I because I went there once I think and

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.040
Just lay that on this because it's it's not a long story. It's just a fucking goodie

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:30.840
Okay, I'm a terrible storyteller, but I'll see if I can figure it out years ago when I used to do a lot of bad things

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.200
Dave Navarro and I

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:41.200
Sorry, he's on my podcast next week. Yeah, and he's told the story is actually in his book

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:46.280
So it's not like I'm revealing anything. No, it's he's a normal human being and people like you

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:50.560
Prevent him from being part of stories like this

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.560
Yes, our story is anyway, he's amazing and he's on my podcast and back to you

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.080
Anyways, we got a limo. We're gonna go to a playboy mansion my first time there

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.240
He was probably there a million times who knows but I was excited. Oh, we're gonna play with mansion

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:05.120
We did some narcotics and we were drunk and very

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.960
Very nervous because of the narcotics narcotics we were taking we get a limo when we hit traffic

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:16.080
And like we just want to get the fuck out of the car and get it took us like three hours to get the playboy mansion

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:20.960
With traffic as food as we got there was like stop start stop start stop start what mansion has herpes, okay?

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:27.000
I know yes, it does the shoes. Yeah, this is herpes. Yeah, and it was crawling out of our skin to get finally get to this place

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.100
As soon as we get to the playboy mansion, we get up there boom, you know walk in we're all excited

01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:35.980
There's girls everywhere. We go we make just make a beeline to the bathroom right to the bathroom and

01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:39.960
Oh, yeah, go make a beeline to the bathroom at the time. I had long dreadlocks

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:46.520
He he ties off his arm with one of my dreadlocks and does for some reasons because there was

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.280
Yeah, figure out why

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:54.200
Figure out why it's like in the restaurant. So you're like sir if you're going to come in here

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:59.200
For some reason he grabs my dreadlock and ties off one of his arms. I'm like, what are you doing? Oh, you're doing?

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:03.240
Oh, okay, cool. Yeah, he boots up using your dreadlock as a tie

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:08.340
He is my tie what kind of heroin addict doesn't bring their own thing like they at least a shoe

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:13.760
Well when you're friends with me, I mean come on you got I got him coming out of my head. It's ready made

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.120
Yes, yes, yes, anyway pivoting just pivot pivot and that that's all it's about

01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:22.680
I proceed to put some unknown substance up my nose, you know baking soda

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.120
baking soda that way pixie pixie stick gravy and then

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.960
We are immediately filled with more panic, you know, so we go we just look at each other go

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.960
We got to get the fuck out of here immediately

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:39.400
So we left the thing got right back in the limo waited for another two hours going down the hill down the home

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:42.400
Got back in and went home. That was it

01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.680
That was it what did you leave out? Oh

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.240
You're talking about the girl who lost her purse and shit in the toilet that

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.160
And he also said you guys sprayed the ceiling. Oh, yes

01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:03.400
He went everywhere because I kind of didn't want to I mean the story's common knowledge it's good, but I don't want your dreadlocks

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.440
And boop and then not talk about I was thinking about how he sprayed the blood on the training and all that other stuff

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:16.840
Jordy Jordy, I always say this to to the young to the young heroin addicts out there when you use your friends dreadlock to tie off at the

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.400
Playboy mansion

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:23.760
Untie before you take the needle out. Otherwise the blood's gonna go over the fucking well

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.400
Yeah, cuz I actually wanted to stay he dragged me out because I was still stuck to his arm

01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:32.980
So you can understand the struggles of brunch at this hug's not drugs

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.160
Exactly you you have like PTSD

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.880
Well guys both

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:45.980
Say no comment if I thought but you guys are rock and roller. So you have you both done heroin?

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:48.400
Never

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:53.080
That's not ironic. You've never done. I've never done. So you've I've done everything at one point

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.720
Yeah, I mean I'm in a heroin

01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.060
But everything at one point. Yeah, I mean everything. I'm not nothing that never heroin

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.760
I mean come on. This is a good question actually first of all, let me just say as a disclaimer because I have a daytime show

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.000
Don't do drugs. Um, I don't do drugs during the daytime. You'll go to sleep

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
You won't watch your show ruins your night

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:19.200
But I do feel like it's interesting because for me when I was growing up and I did stuff

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:24.720
Because that's what you do when you're a teenager and a young adult that heroin was the line for me

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.160
And and it was interesting. I was afraid of it

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:32.280
I'd friends it did it and I'd friends it that shot up and I remember thinking like oh everything else

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:35.280
I can kind of like play with but that's the thing I could never

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:37.760
Exactly needles

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.320
There's no needles yeah, no needles that was like the thing that you thought that you thought like if you watch like I don't know

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:50.320
Cristiana for any of the movies about hair. Oh, yeah, I'm just very fancy that

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:56.120
Like there were a few of those movies that you felt like that if I try that I'm like I'm I'm all in right like

01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.680
I won't pull back. So is that why you didn't try it?

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:04.440
That's exactly it. I just always thought that was a line that I didn't want to be a part of and you guys knew each other the whole time

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.200
It's you you the I didn't know him snored a heroin

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:12.520
Not that night that night. We were doing that. I want to talk about this now because it's a fascinating leg

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:17.160
We got you know, I mean I've tried it, but that was the end of it. It's like try that. Oh, that's a lot of fun

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:20.680
Don't do heroin. That's a lot of fun. Maybe I shouldn't do that. I might

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.440
And then Dan don't do heroin. I'm sober. I don't I don't do drugs or

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:35.120
In life at this moment, I'm sober also, but

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:42.600
I'm sorry, but a valuable line of questioning like so so can we talk like you see you and Dave is also clean as well right now

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:50.720
Yes, yes, how did you encounter heroin and you you you snorted it you never you never I never shot it up. No

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.720
I don't talk. Can you talk?

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.280
I'm curious because I'm 43 and I was like always like I'm never gonna

01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:01.360
Well one time it was like it was I thought it was cocaine and it was like a pulp

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:07.040
It was an accident. That's how I did meth. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's who yeah, I thought it was cook

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.440
I thought it was somebody was like here's a key load of it. I was like it's so shiny

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:15.040
another time oh boy another time somebody

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:21.960
Another time someone handed me something goes hey try this out like what is it? I go it's not heroin as it goes

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.880
No, you'll like it. It's good. And then I went and did I came back to never do anything someone just know you'll like it

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:32.960
It's good. I won't eat a salad if someone's like no, you'll like it. It's good. It's not for me

01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:39.600
It was it was it was not my thing. I was what I wanted to stay up and like not have a hard on and like be really in

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:45.320
Panic and not sleep forever. Thank your friends be really horny. Yeah, that was my thing

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:48.520
Yeah, not feel good and go to sleep. I want to feel more terrible than I already do. Yeah

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:52.600
Have your smoke track

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:57.660
I smoke I smoke crack

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.200
I smoke crack with a hurry Christian once, okay, I thought it was

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.400
No, no, no

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.120
I just I just

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:24.160
I just gave you guys a real hour of good wait what? Oh, we're audience guy. That's amazing

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:30.480
Do you meet a harry harry christian that wants to smoke crack

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.760
You think I'm kidding. I'm not

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:46.360
He was a little more harry not so much christian. You know what I mean a lot of harry Fred

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:51.960
Was it you that you told the story about going to wilt chamberlain's crib? I did I went to wilt chamberlain's house

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.960
He was already dead

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:57.600
So you murdered it will chamberlain's house. I also

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.520
Encyclopedia brown

01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:06.000
He was already dead. Yeah, you're describing the open of a mystery

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:11.360
No, he's I did I went to will chamberlain's house. So he was dead

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.800
He was not alive at this point. This is yes. I did. Yes. That's murder. She wrote

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:20.400
Parties at his old house

01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.960
People are throwing parties at will chamberlain's house after he had died

01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:30.320
Okay, all right, okay, and like all this stuff with it's still there is his clothes

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:36.000
And he had an orgy room an absolute fact with a waterbed God

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.920
He was like a circular room with the mirrors and a waterbed in the center and some of them was too many two-way mirrors

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:47.600
Well, that was what and I did do drugs there, but what can't you know you're at the time?

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:51.920
You saw some something happening in the pool outside

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:56.800
Yeah, actually at the pool he had a you should get this kind of place

01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:02.520
It had a swimming pool that you could enter from inside the house. You don't know that I don't have that that is true

01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:06.320
Or from what we hear about him he should but he had a

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.400
Swing pool that you could get in and it had a you know a grotto and everything and there was a

01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.880
The grotto is where the herpes is there was a girl

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:19.560
There were two girls that were kind of going at it and there was a third guy. There was a third person a guy who was

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:22.160
Going down on the girls and he was on his cell phone

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:26.960
In the phone going down on the girls at the same time

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.280
Was it old school phone? Was it iPhone? Oh, he has he can pour champagne on

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:44.000
If I got to the point where I was eating that much pussy, I would cast that wide a nut I'd be like hello wait

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:48.600
We'll tell you

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:52.200
That was a good party for some pancakes and a breakfast burrito

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:59.080
Is calling they're like hey J.J. Abrams wants you to eat a pussy

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:02.720
On the Batman set

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.960
Well, okay, but I was a pussy

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:13.120
I guess I guess I'm obsessed with this like the reason why I'm asking is because

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:25.160
We're older we've done everything that we want you have done something that you have done something that I've never done you've you've you've

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:33.680
Broach to breach this threshold where you it didn't involve needles which the rest of us go like oh needles

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:37.440
That's where I'll draw the line, but it's not true. It starts with

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:45.840
Heroin is like a thing you can snort. I I I the reason why I actually am interested in hearing you talk about us to know where to get it

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:53.840
No, that's no where to get it is is because we you know because like like we the legacy is like Nancy Reagan going

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:59.600
Everybody say no, but the thing is like you're like like we're hanging out like it would be valuable

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:05.520
Actually, if you go here's what the high is like here's what happens after that

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.600
Well, whatever like it doesn't have to be

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:14.720
I guess PSA I mean yeah, but if you're gonna go there like to for heroin or crack or whatever

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:18.480
That wasn't the first thing that you were doing something led to that. It was like, okay

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.040
I'm drunk now. I got to do this and I got to do that not take it to the next

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:27.800
So yeah, it's always yeah, so who knows the first time I did I think it was itchy and like I you know was constipated

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:29.400
And then I

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:36.200
So what is what I talked about this with Dave too, which was like the difference between someone who try look lots of people

01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:39.480
Never ever try drugs or drink recreationally never have an issue, right?

01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:45.800
Some people fall into that well and they have to dig their way back out and everybody who hasn't fallen into that well and

01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:50.680
Worries about it wonders. What was the thing that made you fall all the way down?

01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.560
And I guess the question I asked him was what like what was that feeling?

01:54:55.560 --> 01:55:03.040
What was that thing and he said look I just think some people are predisposed to falling and some people are not and and and

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.720
Maybe the question also was like what was the appeal?

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:08.240
What was the moment? What was the thing that you thought?

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:12.160
Okay, I'm gonna go all the way in versus the rest of us and I think there are a lot of people like

01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:14.880
Oh, I got high in high school or I smoked up every once in a while in the weekends

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.720
Or I have a medicinal marijuana card and I get a brownie every once in a while, but I'm not you know

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:21.400
Yeah, okay that guy right there loves dope

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:27.760
But you didn't go all the way in I think that's what's interesting you did go all the way in because they're sober now

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.320
No, no, no, he just stopped working, you know

01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:34.920
Yeah, but mostly booze booze is the thing that took me down

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:37.760
I'd like the drugs are just so I could do drink more and

01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:40.520
Yeah, I just hit a wall and said I can't do this anymore

01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:43.080
And I thought it would be really difficult to not do that

01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:48.120
You do a program thing or do you just do it on your own that that needs to know where your meeting is

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.600
Yeah, I could take you yeah well

01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:54.080
By saying I'm not supposed to talk about it. You can figure it out by the name

01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:01.720
But I mean I wouldn't trade all the years of partying for the world it was fantastic and a lot of fun

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.320
But it's also a lot of fun not doing that too

01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:07.840
Do you find because I I felt like that asshole

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:12.420
I felt like that cousin or that aunt or that grandmother with Dave when we had this conversation where I was like

01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:19.860
Almost asking the question of like tell me what not to do. Do you know what I mean like I'll do it all. Yeah, well

01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:22.380
Yeah

01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:24.460
I think drugs and alcohol are fantastic

01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:31.980
They're fucking wonderful, but it's just it's now it's the time not at some point it worked and then it didn't work

01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:36.420
Well, you get older and then if you feel shittier and then like it's just you know

01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:40.260
You want to go out and do cool shit and it's just not I wasn't able to do that

01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:45.180
That's the bummer right like in your 20s. You can just go all night and rally on 45 minutes

01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:49.100
And then you turn 35 and you're like, oh should I have that second glass of red wine? Oh

01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:53.500
Think I'm having a heart attack like that literally is the thing like all of a sudden you're like

01:56:54.620 --> 01:57:01.340
Actually the reason why I cuz I had done the cocaine's in the past and and why those canes

01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:07.460
No, but why I stopped was actually I thought I had tonight is really bad because it was making my ears ring terribly

01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:13.940
And I and I honestly was like you I was doing so much coke that your ears were ringing. Yeah, you're rich

01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:19.100
No, but I honestly that like that that was like I was like this is

01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:21.820
Is your dealer a Christian a guy?

01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:23.900
Oddly no

01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:26.380
Mine really was cuz I got those bells, you know

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:29.140
but anyways, I mean, but but it was like

01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:35.620
That there you go more than like anything else like I was like I can't even I'm like laying here

01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:40.620
I'm feeling like I just want to do a fucking concert and it's like I can't deal so

01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:45.780
See, let's do that. No more. I just have a hard enough time. So I just smoke a lot of weed without drugs

01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:47.780
You know what I mean? I mean, it's like

01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:54.580
About like what knowing like what that what this the essential knowledge of knowing that you're gonna die does to you

01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:56.020
Right like it we were talking about this in the show

01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:59.940
It does different things to different people for some people it does the thing where you think well

01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:04.940
I'm just gonna burn this place to the ground. I don't care like I'm gonna wreck my body. I'm I'm gonna wreck my soul

01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:08.000
I'm gonna go crazy. That's so much fun. Yeah, that's not like a good time

01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:12.460
That sounds great. Some people you're friend. They're like, I'm vegan and I'm gonna

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:19.820
It's getting fucked up on reality, right? Yeah, you can't see me. I'm hiding and you're seeking me, right?

01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:27.020
I mean like everybody kind of has this different response. I'm gonna get wasted. I'm gonna only drink green juice and sleep 10 hours a day

01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:29.020
I'm going to

01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:33.340
Jump out of planes. I mean like all of that is a response to mortality rain juice

01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:39.220
You mean water? Green juice green juice. Like your friend, like your friend that's a vegan that always drinks their fucking green juice

01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:45.060
Some people can't just do things normally like even like if and I if I don't put that stuff in my body anymore

01:58:45.060 --> 01:58:48.820
I have a house full of Star Wars toys that I can start buying or I got like you know

01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:51.460
It's like it's it's just artists that do this

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:57.260
Do you think it's just or not just artists but like a certain kind of artistic mentality or you like I've got to go crazy on something

01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:05.140
At the booze music art obsessive compulsive behavior, you know, it's other things and he's got a channel in it into one

01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:12.060
One area, you know like I feel that there's a need to say I got to exhaust everything that I get into

01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:17.380
Yeah, because like we're all gonna die. I think that could be a good thing that I think you're gonna do it do it, right?

01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:28.900
Yeah, the whole time we're talking I just look it over these two just like looking to the like yeah, right, okay?

01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:32.140
listen

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:39.020
If there's kids listening and there are I don't let there be there always are I

01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:41.620
Is that your demographic?

01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:49.020
When the 80s we had an institutionalized policy which turned out to be very flawed where you just had this unilateral

01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:56.500
Policy the the thing that we've never said is drugs exist people take them to feel good

01:59:56.780 --> 02:00:01.140
You may have a different experience than anyone else has like

02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:09.060
They are out there in the world and therefore it's up to you to know when you personally are

02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:16.740
Right are being hurt by them or are being simply consumed by them because your best friend might have a hollow leg

02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:18.740
So so true so true

02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:25.300
No, but I totally agree or like the idea that like not there's this is not a like a

02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:29.700
Validation of drug use I mean drugs are bad we even when they're good

02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:36.540
They're still bad, but the idea is like know yourself and your and your sense of your place in the world and realize that like

02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:41.820
No matter how many drugs you do you still have to be on this planet you still got to figure out who you are

02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:43.820
you still got to live here and

02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:45.740
The drugs are only gonna

02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:51.500
Like push that away for a moment like they don't fix the the essential nature of being human

02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:56.780
Which is shit is fucked up and you've got to be here and that shit is painful and find a way through it

02:00:56.780 --> 02:01:02.220
That doesn't involve exterior, you know, right influences and honestly gotta live like that's a deal

02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:08.580
It's good. Honestly, you're missing a lot a lot of brunch. Yeah, and go to brunch and the stakes have never been higher at those
