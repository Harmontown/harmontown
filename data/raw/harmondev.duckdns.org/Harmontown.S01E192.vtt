{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:24.000\nYeah, paying that hair Dave Kline, get up on stage and do that right now for the homoship.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:40.000\nOh shit, he's drunk. Yeah, from Hollywood, California, go down comics.\n\n00:40.000 --> 01:00.000\nLet's hear for Dave Kline everybody.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:11.000\nLet's bring out Rob Schwab everybody.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:37.000\nRob are you with us, Schwab Schwab?\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:45.000\nIt's gonna be a good show. The stage is fully vacuumed.\n\n01:45.000 --> 02:08.000\nLet's bring out the mayor, Mr. Dan Hunter.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:17.000\nThat's how you start a show. Start a show. All right.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:23.000\nDan doesn't give it, tonight is losing a Spencer. I think he was gaining a maniac.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nSpencer couldn't be here tonight.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:32.000\nYeah, same page club.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:41.000\nAnd I had a free evening. Hello, Dan.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:55.000\nWe have guests in the control room and you came out and there are professional people of their own merit who had to turn to me to ask,\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:03.000\nam I supposed to go out with a bit? And I had to say to grown men and women, no, don't, no.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:10.000\nThat's not anything to measure yourself by. No, that's not what our show is.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:17.000\nYeah, you'd be ripping me off.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nAll right, don't start.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:25.000\nDid you see Dave Kline banging his head with the hair? Yes, well, that was amazing.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:30.000\nI did. And also people I think could probably say with more expertise than us that that was some awesome headbanging.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nIt seemed legit. We have guests tonight that could weigh in on that.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nYeah, I don't have a lot to talk about before we start meeting our new friends.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:45.000\nHow was your week? I haven't seen you in a while, Dan. How was your week?\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:55.000\nDid you have any fun anecdotes? If you thought Rob would be less disruptive sitting over at that table, he's only going to try harder over there.\n\n03:55.000 --> 04:02.000\nI'm trying to keep the show going. Dan, do you have any anecdotes or anything?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:11.000\nAnecdotes? Do you have an anecdote? What happened?\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:19.000\nThe kids loved me. I saw that Zootopia. You see that Zootopia?\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:29.000\nYeah, people like that Zootopia, Dan. Have you seen that Zootopia? The whole city is animals.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:38.000\nIt's crazy, like everyone, even all the dogs, they're animals. Everybody's an animal.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:44.000\nThe dogs are animals too? The dogs are animals. The cops are rabbits. It's crazy.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:51.000\nYou've got to check out the Zootopia. I'm telling you, Zootopia is really bringing in the bucks too.\n\n04:51.000 --> 05:02.000\nChina loves it. You should make a Zootopia.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:08.000\nHi, Jeff. How are you doing, Rob? I'm doing okay.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nWhat's wrong? You seem a little down on that response.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:15.000\nOh, thanks for asking, Jeff. Only, Jeff.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:19.000\nWell, I shit in the box, finally.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nYou shit in the box? Yeah.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:27.000\nDid I miss an episode? Oh yeah, you weren't in that episode.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:33.000\nWhat box did you shit in? Oh, the one that's next to the toilet.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:38.000\nYou became a Zootopia. You became a cat person. You pooped in a box now.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nWhat do you mean you pooped in a box? Speaking of boxes, someone's handing you Dan Harmon a box.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:46.000\nI had to give a stool sample to... Oh, I did hear that.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nYeah, and then I had to FedEx it to Texas.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:54.000\nI was alarmed to find out that they want you to FedEx your poop.\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:01.000\nIt's better than driving it there.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:07.000\nWhat do you got there, a box? It's full of Rob shit.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nHey, you got FedEx at the Texas?\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:17.000\nSomeone in the front row handed Dan a very mysterious large black box.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:25.000\nSo a lot of you ladies are thinking, do I need to look like that in order to be a Harmontown listener? No, you don't.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nThere's something wrong with her and not you.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.000\nFirst of all, she's an artificial construct.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:37.000\nI can't see it. Second of all, she's probably racist.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:44.000\nShe's certainly the beneficiary of systemic racism.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:52.000\nI can't see what you're... What the fuck is in the box?\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nIt's fucking liquor. It's liquor.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:59.000\nWell, turn it around so everyone can see it.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:03.000\nTell them like an eight-year-old. Turn it around.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nDid you hand this to me?\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:14.000\nIt should be your choice because...\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nYou're wearing a very exciting outfit right now.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:20.000\nThat's why I wanted them to know that it was his choice to come up.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.000\nI want curtains made out of everything you're wearing.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nThese are from Walmart.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nFor real? Well done.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:34.000\nThey're the women's variety and I asked them to translate the size to a men's size.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nShe's told me and I'm like, well, do you think they'll have that size over there?\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nShe said those pants aren't going anywhere.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nSo I bought the pants.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:47.000\nThis stuff is clearly very sexist.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nI have asked... Still haven't seen it.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nI found out about this company. They're from Germany.\n\n07:52.000 --> 08:00.000\nThey produce high-end liquor that they then pour over the model depicted's body\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:05.000\nand then put it into the bottle.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nYeah.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nWow.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:13.000\nYou come a long way, baby.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nI mean, we can do shots. We can wait till later.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:21.000\nThese shots come pre-body-shotted.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:26.000\nI don't know if they do a whole vat or if they do it bottle for bottle.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:30.000\nDo you think they really do it? Is there an oversight committee to make sure that actually happens?\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:35.000\nEvery article I've ever read said this company claims and then says what they claim.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:42.000\nSo there's no validity to the rumors that these women are in windowless rooms glued to the floor by their own shit?\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:47.000\nShe said... Each one of them says outright, yes.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nIt was a wonderful opportunity for me.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nYeah, that's what chickens say.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:56.000\nWhen you talk to them, oh, do you like being a McNucket? They're like...\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:03.000\nAs for the racial thing, every variety is done with a woman of a different ethnicity.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.000\nSo I believe the rum was a black woman and then...\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nSee, that's racist.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nWell, I mean, it's our modern definition of racist because it acknowledges...\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nBut at least it's inclusive. If there was all white women...\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:24.000\nIt is...\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nIf you're old enough, you realize he's right.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:31.000\nIn Don Draper's time, it'd be like, oh, the bourbon is a brunette.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:35.000\nYeah, the G actually stands for gentlemen.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nSo this is like a gentleman...\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nG spirits, it stands for gentlemen.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nSo it's like a gentleman's club in a bottle.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:50.000\nAnd then they put the picture of the girl on the bottle so that no matter how drunk you get,\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:54.000\nyou never have to forget what an asshole you were for buying that vodka.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:59.000\nSo Dan, I'm assuming you have vodka that was poured off a redhead?\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nAm I guessing correctly there?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nAnd that would be like a Negroni?\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:08.000\nShe's clearly Icelandic or...\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nI know you don't represent the company, but I'd like to pitch an alternate name for their product.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nThe opposite of Purell?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:19.000\nJust the opposite of it.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:24.000\nJust a bottle of stuff that comes with three germs.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nAlright, well thank you, what's your name?\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:30.000\nAbsolutely, Dan Myron Handleman. I've always wanted to meet you guys.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nSo you're an assassin?\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:37.000\nNo, no, my dad was a comedian from the 60s named Stanley Myron Handleman.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:40.000\nWell, John Wilkes Booth was an actor.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:43.000\nBut three names means you're going to shoot somebody.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:47.000\nI am no actor, sir. I am no actor, I can promise you.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nWell, John Myron Handleman?\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nDan Myron Handleman.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nYou guys are awesome.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:55.000\nLet's hear it for Dan Myron Handleman, everybody.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nI assume...\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:04.000\nWe already have done too much show. It's already been too much entertainment.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:10.000\nI'm grateful because I was saying in the green room, I'm writing a little bit of a line.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nI've been working all day, I stayed up all night.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:16.000\nSo hard. You've got to slow down, man.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:20.000\nYou're going to fucking trigger me.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:27.000\nWe're going to bring out our vacuum cleaner.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nI wanted to address...\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nYou were saying you were writing a line today?\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:37.000\nIt's one of those nights where I'm like, I stayed up all night because I tried to work on my book\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:43.000\nand I found out last week because of the episode I got the forwarded emails that the publishers are listening.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nUh-oh.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:52.000\nSo when I'm joking about not working on the book, it's like, yeah, sounds like you at least know the book is due.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.000\nFor real?\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:59.000\nSo I'm just like, okay, if you're listening at double day, I stayed up all night.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:04.000\nAnd if the show sucks, it's on you.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nI'm sure the book will be great.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nBut, uh...\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:13.000\nYou need one of them ghost writers. You need to get a ghost writer to take care of it, Dan.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nI hear that's what they do.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nGhosts can't write.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:20.000\nYeah. No, no, no. I heard it. I heard it in a book.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:24.000\nUh, the, uh...\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:29.000\nI peaked with the vacuum cleaner.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nUh, I...\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nHe's gonna...\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:35.000\nBecause Rob, I don't know if you're aware of this, where Spencer sits, where you're sitting right now,\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nDan never faces that way. His back will be too the entire night.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nI know.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nAnd Dan, Rob is going to be throwing darts at you the entire time.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nWhatever. It doesn't... It's just...\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nCool it, guys.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nWhat I'm trying to tell you is that I've been...\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nI stayed up all night. I've been working all day.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nI shot Great Minds Today with Paul F. Tomkins, who's wonderful.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nAnd, uh...\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nI...\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:03.000\nAround four o'clock, I start drinking on that set, because I'm like, like...\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nSo I'm a little... I'm just writing the line.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:10.000\nThis isn't gonna be like the Chicago show, but, like, I'm on the bubble.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nSo we're at the mercy of our guests being...\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nLike, you might descend into some sort of haze or madness?\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nNo, I just might... I'm not... I'm not as facile.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nI'm not, like, uh...\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:21.000\nLike, it's good that that guy was a... He was a good guy.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:25.000\nHe took the mic. He could have, like, started stabbing people.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nBut it's like, we're cool.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:32.000\nI'm just saying, like, this is one of those nights when Uncle Dan maybe needs a little...\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nHe's gonna lean on you a little bit.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nAnd lean on tonight's guest.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:40.000\nSo I only wanted to say, you may notice me talking a little slower.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nIt's sounding a little bit more like a game show host,\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:46.000\nbecause I'm overcompensating for my brain's desire to slur\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:49.000\nand go, like, what is there about the Packers?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:53.000\nI just wanted to say a couple of things before we bring out our friends.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nUh...\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nI have to say, this is...\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:00.000\nOne thing that amazes me about you, among your many skills and talents...\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nI know what you're gonna say.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nThis is what amazes people about Denzel Washington's character in the movie Flight.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:08.000\nAnd it shouldn't amaze you. It should concern you.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nYou never slur.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:15.000\nI called highly functional alcoholism. It's not funny.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nI didn't say it was funny. I thought it was amazing.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nIt's not a superpower. It's a kryptonite.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nHa-ha-ha-ha-ha.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:26.000\nHa-ha-ha-ha-ha.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nYeah.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nSo...\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:34.000\nLast week, I told you about the Avengers Academy game.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nMost of you tweeted me,\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:41.000\nthis information is readily available to anyone under 30 who just Googled it.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:46.000\nThe kid that I was talking about, who I was like, kid, come on, take it easy.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.000\nThat was Dave Franco, who plays Tony Stark in that Avengers video game.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:53.000\nAnd Black Widow, who I...\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nThat was my friend, Allison Brie.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nOh, yeah?\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:00.000\nThat's Avengers Academy game. It's star studded.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nRun. Don't walk to the App Store.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nYou can enjoy it on a whole new level.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:06.000\nDave Franco?\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nDave Franco.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nYeah, come on.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:12.000\nDid he, like, did he contact you upset?\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nNo!\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nYou came down pretty hard on Tony Stark.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nYou came down pretty hard.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nNo, no. People just tweeted me.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nIt was actually in the Rick and Morty writers room,\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:24.000\nbecause I was talking about this game, and I was saying the same spiel,\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nand then somebody said, that's Dave Franco.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nAnd I was like, oops.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:32.000\nBecause I don't want no beef with no Franco gang.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nThese guys are like, they're the new bald ones.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nYeah, they're the new bald ones.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:41.000\nYou know what? You don't want to mess with that.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nAnd as you all know...\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nThere's another Franco in the chamber we haven't met yet.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:47.000\nThe bald ones got so strong that they sprouted Adam,\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nwho is not even a real bald one.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nHe's just like a rapey creep who went off and...\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nIs that the guy? Isn't that the Gamergate guy?\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nHe's not even a real bald one, right?\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nWho cares?\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nYou guys are like...\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:01.000\nDan, I'm sorry.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nWhat are these mystery bottles of alcohol here?\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nWhat is this?\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nThat's for our next guest.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:06.000\nOh, okay.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:07.000\nLet's bring her out.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nWell, I have to get back to my...\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nVamp for a while while I pour myself a drink so I can...\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nHey, why don't you give me one, too?\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nWhy don't you give me one, too, while you're up there?\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nJeffery, could you please give me one?\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nI'd like one, too.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nI got a whole table.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nAnd I got a whole table here.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:29.000\nThe other thing I wanted to say was that our friend...\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:33.000\nSome of you in LA, we go to the drawing room afterward.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nSome of you may have encountered our friend Mario,\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:40.000\nthe bartender there, who I've quoted in the past.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nI've quoted him like one of his funny jokes.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:48.000\nI think he was passing on to me because we were talking about race and things.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:55.000\nAnd he said, you know, the only thing you could call a white person\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:58.000\nthat'll really offend them is racist.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:01.000\nHe told it better.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:06.000\nHe passed away a couple of nights ago,\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:13.000\nand he had already survived a total cardiac arrest\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:18.000\nand was hanging in there and stuff, and now he's gone.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nAnd I don't know, why do I bring it up to make the podcast sad?\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nI don't know.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:29.000\nFor anybody that's ever met him, some of you must have gone to the drawing room after our show.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nHe's the large Cuban fellow.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:36.000\nTo know him was to at least like him, and to know him a little bit better\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nwas to absolutely love him.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:41.000\nHe left his giant hole in a lot of people's lives.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:44.000\nI didn't realize how much that was going to affect me.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nI found out about it, and I was really sad.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:49.000\nAnd the next day, I said, I've known him more than half my life,\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nand he's always been a source of happiness and grievance.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:57.000\nIf you care to donate a dollar or 50 cents or a nickel or whatever,\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\njust so that he can have a nice funeral because he went through a lot of medical expenses.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:05.000\nIf you go to my Facebook page, there's a little GoFundMe if you want to drop a nickel.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nHave you ever met him?\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:13.000\nHe bought me so many free drinks that I really owe him in many folds.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:18.000\nMy favorite memory of him besides that joke was just the bathroom,\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:22.000\nthe men's room at the drawing room is unlike anything you've ever...\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nIt's like an episode of Locked Up Abroad.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:28.000\nAnd I remember coming in one day, and he was so...\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:32.000\nHe had this boyish smile on his face, and he's like, go in the bathroom.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nAnd I went in the bathroom, and it was like,\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:40.000\noh, there was like a plate of stainless steel mounted above the sink.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:46.000\nAnd I came out, and he's like, it's a mirror no one can break.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:52.000\nHe had gotten out a time life book, and he cared about...\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:56.000\nHe was like, what are the lost boys? He's like, I'm going to make Wendy proud.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:03.000\nThat bathroom was... Everyone goes in there to prove God doesn't exist.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:08.000\nI don't know how it happened when it was decided.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:13.000\nGod is dead in that bathroom, and Mario cared enough.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:17.000\nThere's a species of insect that I think only lives in that bathroom.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:20.000\nDino's theory is that when you go to the drawing room, men's room,\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:24.000\nand you're peeing at the urinal, there's this mysterious, not quite gnats,\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:31.000\nbut not quite fly bug that seems designed to just get in your face\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:37.000\nwhile you're trying to pee, inadvertently causing your pee to go everywhere,\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:40.000\nwhich seems to be what they live on.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:43.000\nSo Dino thought he had figured this biosphere out,\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:48.000\nthat this is like a species of insect that only lives in the drawing room bathroom.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:52.000\nAnd that might be the reason why...\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nHe kicked Vince Vaughn out of there one time.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:58.000\nVince Vaughn was being a complete ass, and Mario kicking Vince Vaughn out of there\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:01.000\nwith just such subtlety, it was so nice.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:05.000\nIf he really hated you, he would just go, bro, you got to go, man, time to go.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:09.000\nAnd then if someone was like, fuck you, he would just reach behind the refrigerator,\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:14.000\nand there was a seven-iron golf club there, and he would just slowly come around the bar,\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:17.000\nand the whole bar would clear out. It was great.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:21.000\nWell, like, anyone who wasn't, you know, 97 yards away...\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nI don't know what to say.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nI thought I was going to, like, riff a golf joke.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.000\nOh, no.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nYou can only hit a seven-iron 97-yard?\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:33.000\nI don't know, man. I cat-ed when I was like, fuck you.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nWhat did Vince Vaughn do?\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:39.000\nHe left.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:42.000\nNo, you mean, why did he get kicked out?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:47.000\nYeah, he was in a shit.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nI wanted to riff a bad Vince Vaughn movie.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nHe got kicked out for Clay Pigeons.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nYeah, whatever.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nAll right.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:58.000\nOkay, our next guest is touring across children's colleges and clubs.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nWhatever.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:05.000\nShe's a new friend of mine as of her podcast girl, Agai, which I was on.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:10.000\nShe's an old friend of Jeff's because she hosted...\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nShe's currently hosting.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nThe ABC Who's Line.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:15.000\nCW.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nOh, it's CW now.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nYeah.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nC, my confusion is warrants.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:19.000\nYeah, season four.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nAll right.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:23.000\nWell, let's get to the bottom of Ayesha Tyler, everybody.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:35.000\nWe're going to get to the bottom of you.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:40.000\nVery exciting.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nWould you like...\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nVery exciting.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:48.000\nWould you like vodka dripped lovingly over a Caucasian avatar?\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:54.000\nI had a nickel for every time I drank vodka that had previously run over a Caucasian pussy.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:58.000\nI swear to God, I'd have millions of dollars.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:04.000\nThey should just call this unknown epithelial's vodka because that's...\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\nLook at her.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nShe's sensationally fucking intellectual.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:10.000\nI wonder where she went to college.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nAyesha, if they poured...\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nMeet a white guy, you.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:19.000\nIf they bottled a drink or a cocktail or some sort of concoction off of your body, what would you...\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nBlack Thunder!\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:23.000\nActually, I brought my own alcohol with me.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nYou asked, like, where are these mystery bottles?\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nIt was like moonshine.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nIt isn't moonshine.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nActually, this is coincidental.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:33.000\nI really just brought it because I know you guys are alcoholics, but I brought my own...\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nMy own line of cocktails coming out late in the year, and it's pre-made cocktails.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:42.000\nI know you guys are, like, men who don't know how to run like a washing machine or start your car.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nVery true.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:46.000\nAnd so you're just drinking straight vodka and a glass because what do I do?\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nYeah.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nSo I brought you...\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nI have a line of cocktails coming out Cocherge and Stone.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nThis is an old-fashioned.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nIn a bottle, all you do is pour it into a glass and it's a drink.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nNo way!\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nI'm gonna save so much time.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.000\nAnd this is a gin old-fashioned, and also just pour it out.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nAnd so...\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nA gin old-fashioned?\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nA gin old-fashioned.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:05.000\nA gin old-fashioned is just spirits, bitters, and something sweet.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:09.000\nI don't want to be high maintenance, but could I get this trickled off of Eva Mendes?\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nI will.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nI'm a bit of a stickler.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:18.000\nEva actually is doing my Manhattan, but...\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nRacist.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:24.000\nBut just so you know, I masturbated and then stirred my fingers in this before I put it in the bottle.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nOkay.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nIt's sold.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nIt's delicious.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:33.000\nInfused with the juices of my personal joy, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:40.000\nEvery sip is like sex with a black woman, confusing and delightful.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:45.000\nYou don't know if you got it right, but it's okay, cause you leave.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nI'll get it right by my damn self.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:48.000\nAlright, sorry.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:53.000\nAnd you always know whether whoever you're watching should go into that house.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:54.000\nYes, exactly.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:55.000\nI don't know.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nI'm talking about what's wrong with you.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nThat just, the end of it.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nOh, it's okay, baby.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nIt was fine.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nYou're just, you're adorable.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nYou got good credit, baby.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nJust leave some money.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:09.000\nNobody cares if you was good or you was bad.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:13.000\nWhy is having sex with me like having sex with the mom from what's happening?\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nDo you become that person?\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nNo, yeah.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:18.000\nOh, spenders say, oh, baby, slap that ass.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.000\nI'm making some cornpone.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nWhy am I a racist?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nYour show makes people racist, Dan.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nI don't care.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nYou knew that already.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:28.000\nI don't care if the woman is white, black or whatever.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:33.000\nI would like just once in my life to be having sex with a woman of any ethnicity.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nAnd she, me too.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:37.000\nAnd she, oh, I thought, I thought he was finished.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:38.000\nI thought he was finished.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nA woman of any ethnicity period.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nOr on her period.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:44.000\nWhat's it like?\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:45.000\nWhat's it like having sex?\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nWhat a vagina is like.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nAwesome.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nWhy is having them, having them, being in them.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nBoth awesome.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:56.000\nAre you, do you think being, having sex with a black woman is complicated?\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nDo you think it is complicated sex?\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nIt's just, it's just, it's the same pussy.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:04.000\nI mean, that's the thing that people have this idea that like I'm going to have sex\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:09.000\nor something exotic and then magically unicorns are going to come out of my ass or my credit\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:13.000\nscore is going to go up or down depending.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:16.000\nOr all of a sudden I'm going to understand my iPhone because I had sex with somebody\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.000\nfrom the Asian subcontinent.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nNo.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:21.000\nSo, vagina is vagina and dick is dick.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nAnd sorry about that.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:25.000\nTalk to God if you believe in him or science like me.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:32.000\nSince we're talking about sex and since race came up and I don't see the world through\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:35.000\nthis lens, I had no idea you were black until we had this conversation.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\nRight.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nIt's exciting, isn't it, Dan?\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nYou have a black friend now.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nEnjoy.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nOne that you didn't cast on your show.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nHi.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:51.000\nI like you for you, Dan.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:55.000\nHave you, tell me, you tell me to step back and step forward whenever.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nI'm listening.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:57.000\nThis is the same place.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nIt's the same place.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:02.000\nHey, like the, I already know this is going to go terribly wrong, you guys.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nIt's just all of you ready.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:08.000\nEverybody, avert your eyes in three, two.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nWhat does your hair feel like?\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:14.000\nNo, no.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:24.000\nI wanted to yes and the, I didn't want to let you down.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:35.000\nI had this thesis recently and I was like, you know how porn is like, oh my God.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:36.000\nIt's too late, guys.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:37.000\nIt's too late.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nChrist.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:43.000\nIt's like, when you have this porn world.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:49.000\nPull out, Goose, pull out.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nWhere everything gets.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:54.000\nDan, Rob is now match gaming you over here.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nAll right, fine.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nYou love this, Rob.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.000\nI don't love it.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nAll right.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nBy the way, the worst vacuum job I've ever seen.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:08.000\nThere's glitter and human remains of finger.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:09.000\nAll right.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:10.000\nAsk the question.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nI'm curious.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:12.000\nWell, I want to talk about porn tropes.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:13.000\nI love this stuff.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:17.000\nWell, I wanted to talk about race in porn because at first glance, here's the thing about porn\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:21.000\nin general that I've been, this is my new thing.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nPost divorce.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nYes.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nBecause I'm just like, okay, an apologetic.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nPre divorce.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nYou're watching it.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nJust post divorce.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nYou can talk about it.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:30.000\nYeah.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.000\nPretty much.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nYou know, out of respect to, yeah.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:36.000\nTo the dead.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:42.600\nBut it was, you know, I've sort of become not obsessed, but just sort of fascinated with\n\n27:42.600 --> 27:47.000\nthis thing that like, you know, the porn industry represents all of this money.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:52.000\nWe have this like bed of lava underneath us that is all this sexuality.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.000\nYes.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:59.500\nLike if you compare, you could name anything, video games, Matt Damon, anything that you\n\n27:59.500 --> 28:01.200\nthought was worth money.\n\n28:01.200 --> 28:02.200\nRight.\n\n28:02.200 --> 28:06.600\nNothing would compare to the general just swath of the fact that forever, ever since\n\n28:06.600 --> 28:10.720\nwe've been able to make porn, we've always had this like sea of porn underneath our\n\n28:10.720 --> 28:11.720\nsociety.\n\n28:11.720 --> 28:14.360\nBut then everything that's above that sea, right, if like that's under like a little\n\n28:14.360 --> 28:20.200\nkind of a hardened cooled crust of magma, above that, everything is still suffused with\n\n28:20.200 --> 28:21.200\nthat energy, right?\n\n28:21.200 --> 28:24.920\nLike almost everything we find valuable, whether it is pornographic or not pornographic is\n\n28:24.920 --> 28:27.480\nall shot through with pornographic value, right?\n\n28:27.480 --> 28:28.480\nMatt Damon.\n\n28:28.480 --> 28:30.120\nEveryone wants to fuck Matt Damon.\n\n28:30.120 --> 28:31.120\nLadies want to fuck him.\n\n28:31.120 --> 28:32.120\nGay guys want to fuck him.\n\n28:32.120 --> 28:33.120\nStraight guys want to fuck him.\n\n28:33.120 --> 28:35.320\nAnd hopefully they turn into him after they fuck him.\n\n28:35.320 --> 28:38.200\nEverybody wants to, you know what I mean?\n\n28:38.200 --> 28:39.640\nEverything in culture is suffused with sex.\n\n28:39.640 --> 28:40.640\nAbsolutely.\n\n28:40.640 --> 28:41.640\nYes.\n\n28:41.640 --> 28:44.200\nBecause it's like, you can't escape the core of the earth is like affecting everything.\n\n28:44.200 --> 28:45.840\nIf you shut that off, we'd know.\n\n28:45.840 --> 28:51.600\nIf you shut porn off, we'd know the, the more to say porn is an expression of the core of\n\n28:51.600 --> 28:52.600\neach of us.\n\n28:52.600 --> 28:55.080\nThat's all collectively we regarded as the sewer.\n\n28:55.080 --> 28:57.200\nSo we treat the performers in it like shit.\n\n28:57.200 --> 28:59.440\nThe industry is not regulated.\n\n28:59.440 --> 29:05.320\nIt doesn't, even though it represents the, the, the billion, a million, all of the dollars.\n\n29:05.320 --> 29:06.960\nNo one knows where to put the camera.\n\n29:06.960 --> 29:12.480\nIt's always like, a lot of eye line problems, a lot of eye line problems.\n\n29:12.480 --> 29:15.440\nIf they're lining up, they're like, I'm going to line up this shot.\n\n29:15.440 --> 29:18.600\nBut I'm worried that when we push in on her vulva, we're jumping the line.\n\n29:18.600 --> 29:20.720\nAre we jumping the line?\n\n29:20.720 --> 29:22.880\nWe were looking right to left and now we're left to right.\n\n29:22.880 --> 29:25.400\nIs this going to work for the double penetration?\n\n29:25.400 --> 29:27.720\nI think we need to move.\n\n29:27.720 --> 29:30.240\nWhen you are doing her from behind, look camera left.\n\n29:30.240 --> 29:32.280\nOtherwise, the whole thing is wrecked, guys.\n\n29:32.280 --> 29:34.160\nGuys, we, we got continuity problems.\n\n29:34.160 --> 29:36.040\nThis guy's balls are all over the place.\n\n29:36.040 --> 29:37.040\nYeah.\n\n29:37.040 --> 29:38.040\nCome on.\n\n29:38.040 --> 29:39.040\nOne shot.\n\n29:39.040 --> 29:40.040\nThey're up.\n\n29:40.040 --> 29:41.040\nOne shot.\n\n29:41.040 --> 29:42.040\nThey're down.\n\n29:42.040 --> 29:45.960\nGuys, it makes no linear sense.\n\n29:45.960 --> 29:52.800\nIs absolutely unmistakable that there is no grace or diplomacy in the handling of the\n\n29:52.800 --> 29:58.720\nconcept of ethnic phenotyping in pornography.\n\n29:58.720 --> 30:02.560\nYour intellectualism is dazzling.\n\n30:02.560 --> 30:08.800\nBut this is an industry where you type in redhead, babysitter, scuba diver.\n\n30:08.800 --> 30:11.400\nYou type in really specific shit.\n\n30:11.400 --> 30:16.040\nAnd so just as in normal casting of network television, where as I've encountered where\n\n30:16.040 --> 30:22.640\nit's like, you have to steer around the fact that, well, we, we categorize people and all\n\n30:22.640 --> 30:23.640\nthe stuff.\n\n30:23.640 --> 30:25.200\nSo you better believe we do in porn.\n\n30:25.200 --> 30:29.000\nSo you're, so you are typing who knows who you are.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:34.000\nPeople are typing and therefore porn is being made where it's like, you don't want the stuff\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:38.160\nrepresenting your species consciousness of race on one hand.\n\n30:38.160 --> 30:42.200\nBut on the other hand, I was trying to make the point on a previous episode where it's\n\n30:42.200 --> 30:52.560\nlike, how much more racist is like, is porn is porn than politics, religion, whatever\n\n30:52.560 --> 30:59.560\nthe fuck you call the fact that the disproportionate incarceration, like it's like actual racism\n\n30:59.560 --> 31:05.360\nversus just like this dopey like river of like two black dudes, one white chick.\n\n31:05.360 --> 31:08.280\nAnd then it's like the guys come in and go, did someone order a black guy?\n\n31:08.280 --> 31:09.280\nAnd the woman's like, no way.\n\n31:09.280 --> 31:13.960\nAnd she's like, well, they're so big and he's like, that's because they're black.\n\n31:13.960 --> 31:17.600\nAnd she's like, I learned a lesson.\n\n31:17.600 --> 31:21.360\nAnd you're watching and you're going, I don't want, I don't want anyone to think that this\n\n31:21.360 --> 31:22.680\nis how I think about race.\n\n31:22.680 --> 31:26.400\nBut at the same time, I don't want anybody to think that this is how I think about race.\n\n31:26.400 --> 31:31.640\nAnd in a minute, I'll feel super guilty about it.\n\n31:31.640 --> 31:36.320\nBecause sexuality transcends politeness, diplomacy, all these things.\n\n31:36.320 --> 31:42.240\nWell, maybe the, maybe the word isn't transcend, maybe the word is subsumes or subverts, right?\n\n31:42.240 --> 31:46.400\nBecause you're at your basest when you're consuming porn and porn and it's creation\n\n31:46.400 --> 31:52.880\nis it is the, is the, a very base expression, sorry, vivid, you're not making art.\n\n31:52.880 --> 32:00.160\nAnd so, you know, people are looking for satisfaction of their basest instincts of their basis inclinations.\n\n32:00.160 --> 32:03.240\nAnd they're also looking for those things to be satisfied in a very narrow window.\n\n32:03.240 --> 32:07.720\nNo one's masturbating all afternoon unless they want like bed sores and a, you know,\n\n32:07.720 --> 32:10.320\nat the end of a relationship.\n\n32:10.320 --> 32:14.520\nAnd stereotypes will not be conquered during porn.\n\n32:14.520 --> 32:15.520\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n32:15.520 --> 32:17.600\nNo one, no one is really trying to learn anything.\n\n32:17.600 --> 32:24.160\nAnything you walk in the door with will only be magnified, probably won't be conquered.\n\n32:24.160 --> 32:29.280\nExcept in the sense maybe that you're like, well, I'm being a little bit of a hypocrite\n\n32:29.280 --> 32:34.680\nif I am, for instance, like being an actively racist person in the outside world.\n\n32:34.680 --> 32:35.680\nBut I don't know.\n\n32:35.680 --> 32:36.680\nI see both sides of the issue.\n\n32:36.680 --> 32:37.680\nWhat is the question though?\n\n32:37.680 --> 32:40.120\nBecause you're just trying to get permission to look at more two black dudes, one white\n\n32:40.120 --> 32:41.120\nchick porn.\n\n32:41.120 --> 32:42.120\nIs that why you're here?\n\n32:42.120 --> 32:43.120\nOh no, I have permission.\n\n32:43.120 --> 32:46.560\nWell, if you did before you do now, some of you guys are black.\n\n32:46.560 --> 32:47.560\nNo, no.\n\n32:47.560 --> 32:51.560\nI was just very curious about, because I talked to our friend DeMorge, who like he had a very\n\n32:51.560 --> 32:55.840\ninteresting counterpoint, which was like, but I can't tell, I mean, obviously there's\n\n32:55.840 --> 32:57.400\nno binary answer to this.\n\n32:57.400 --> 33:06.400\nBut as far as I could, I could like parse his very, very like almost densely like a different\n\n33:06.400 --> 33:07.400\nperspective point.\n\n33:07.400 --> 33:14.880\nLike yeah, but in all those moments when race is allowed to just be a thing like a Ben and\n\n33:14.880 --> 33:19.960\nJerry's flavor, in those moments, the problem's being reinforced and blah, blah, blah.\n\n33:19.960 --> 33:24.160\nLike, well, that's, yes, if I'm getting him right about that, then okay, yes, but that's\n\n33:24.160 --> 33:28.920\nwhy I say, okay, yeah, porn is not the place where racism is going to be solved.\n\n33:28.920 --> 33:33.960\nHowever, ironically, I think it is less racist in porn than it is in the Oval Office, than\n\n33:33.960 --> 33:39.040\nit is in church, than it is anywhere you would go where people would say, we're, we're, we're,\n\n33:39.040 --> 33:42.760\nwe're, because it's like just dopey people going, yeah, but at the end of the day, I\n\n33:42.760 --> 33:44.800\ncome three times, I get paid $300.\n\n33:44.800 --> 33:45.800\nRight, right.\n\n33:45.800 --> 33:46.800\nLike, like, they can't have $300.\n\n33:46.800 --> 33:50.720\nYou're talking about how you perceive, you, would you, $300?\n\n33:50.720 --> 33:54.920\nRob, don't get distracted by the bookkeeping here.\n\n33:54.920 --> 33:55.920\nI'm done.\n\n33:55.920 --> 34:00.640\nBut are you talking about, before we move on to headier topics, are you, are you saying\n\n34:00.640 --> 34:04.320\nthat you feel like porn is more racist in its, in its construct and casting, or porn\n\n34:04.320 --> 34:06.920\nis more racist in the way that we perceive it?\n\n34:06.920 --> 34:11.360\nBecause I would actually argue, and it's just came to me now, that porn may be both most\n\n34:11.360 --> 34:15.920\nracist and least racist in the way that we consume it, because we may treat people in\n\n34:15.920 --> 34:19.640\none way, in the real world, the way we interact with them, we hire them, we don't hire them,\n\n34:19.640 --> 34:21.560\nwe associate with the people that we want to associate with.\n\n34:21.560 --> 34:25.400\nBut I bet you, there are a lot of white guys out there, and all their friends are white,\n\n34:25.400 --> 34:29.360\nand they've never had sex with a black girl, but that's the only porn they watch, is a\n\n34:29.360 --> 34:33.400\nwhite guy railing the shit out of a black girl with his micro penis.\n\n34:33.400 --> 34:38.520\nAnd it might, and it might even be part and parcel, it might even feed back into his hatred.\n\n34:38.520 --> 34:45.280\nRight, it might feed back into it, or it might just, it may be, it's interesting, like maybe,\n\n34:45.280 --> 34:50.000\nmaybe he subscribes to the idea that all black men are, you know, virile, large penises.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:54.640\nBut, and I guess that's the line, it's like, like, I absolutely 100% agree with that.\n\n34:54.640 --> 35:00.240\nThe penises are huge, like, baby's arms, every single one, prehensile baby's arms.\n\n35:00.240 --> 35:04.640\nEvery black man can pick up a cup of coffee with his penis, bring it to his mouth.\n\n35:04.640 --> 35:09.360\nActually, they're actually exactly like baby's arms, they have elbows, they have, they have,\n\n35:09.360 --> 35:18.040\nthey have, they have, but they only bend one way, which is why most of them can't be quarterbacks.\n\n35:18.040 --> 35:20.040\nThey'll all end up in the manager's office eventually.\n\n35:20.040 --> 35:26.480\nGoogle it, yes, I think, I think, I think same page, I think the, I think the interesting\n\n35:26.480 --> 35:30.920\nthing is it's like where you draw, I, I guess I was just doing an academic distinction where\n\n35:30.920 --> 35:34.960\nit's like, you know, for all intents and purposes, it's like the things you're seeing on screen,\n\n35:34.960 --> 35:39.880\nthose, like, it's, when you're on the set, I find it hard to imagine the, when the stuff\n\n35:39.880 --> 35:44.560\nI'm watching, I'm like, I don't think that, I don't think that anyone is being made to\n\n35:44.560 --> 35:47.000\nfeel less than human on that set.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:51.000\nWell, aside from the fact that they're important, except for the fact that there's a stranger's\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nhand inside their anus.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.680\nOther than that, they feel totally human and validated.\n\n35:54.680 --> 35:56.240\nI am validating you now.\n\n35:56.240 --> 35:57.720\nDo you feel validated?\n\n35:57.720 --> 35:59.240\nYour anus is immaculate.\n\n35:59.240 --> 36:05.520\nBut then when you have a conversation about media as a phantom signal, that's not an industry\n\n36:05.520 --> 36:09.160\nand not a community of people, then of course, 100% agree.\n\n36:09.160 --> 36:15.280\nOf course you, it will only feed back if you're, if you're jerking off to the idea of gang\n\n36:15.280 --> 36:17.960\nbang this, and it's not going to make you not a misogynist.\n\n36:17.960 --> 36:22.000\nThere's a million of things that porn reinforces that make you hate all of humanity, not based\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:26.160\non color, just based on, you know, that we're all like these terrible, you know,

many people searched for leprechaun porn.\n\n36:59.440 --> 37:03.400\nIt's subtly, it does what the Kinsey, you know, research did.\n\n37:03.400 --> 37:04.400\nYeah, the Kinsey study, yeah, with the spectrum.\n\n37:04.400 --> 37:05.400\nYeah, the Kinsey study.\n\n37:05.400 --> 37:06.400\nIt just is a subtle reminder.\n\n37:06.400 --> 37:08.120\nIt just goes, hey, everybody's a freak.\n\n37:08.120 --> 37:09.120\nYeah, that's it.\n\n37:09.120 --> 37:10.120\nThat's how weird you are.\n\n37:10.120 --> 37:15.240\nOn April Fool's Day, they changed their, their front page to Cornhub, and it was all, it\n\n37:15.240 --> 37:17.000\nwas all just cobs of corn.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:18.000\nClassic.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:23.680\nAnd the, and the captions were like, hot buttered cob getting it from both sides from a napkin.\n\n37:23.680 --> 37:27.640\nAnd there was a guy who was like, finally, yeah, there was one guy who was like, oh,\n\n37:27.640 --> 37:31.120\nfuck it's April Fool's, no.\n\n37:31.120 --> 37:33.440\nBut it was, you know, to approach it.\n\n37:33.440 --> 37:35.940\nClassic Pornhub.\n\n37:35.940 --> 37:40.040\nI would say, I would say, I don't want to open this kettle and then close it, but I would\n\n37:40.040 --> 37:41.040\nsay.\n\n37:41.040 --> 37:43.320\nIt's been open for hours, damn.\n\n37:43.320 --> 37:51.040\nPornhub shares with Christianity, the, or any religion, let him talk, let him talk.\n\n37:51.040 --> 37:52.040\nLet him talk.\n\n37:52.040 --> 37:56.360\nThe fact that it could use more smart, proud people involved in it.\n\n37:56.360 --> 37:57.360\nOkay.\n\n37:57.360 --> 37:58.360\nAll right.\n\n37:58.360 --> 37:59.360\nLet's bring out some more difference.\n\n37:59.360 --> 38:00.360\nJust leave that there.\n\n38:00.360 --> 38:03.960\nIt gets a bad rap because everyone's like, I don't know, I don't, I'm not involved with\n\n38:03.960 --> 38:04.960\nthat.\n\n38:04.960 --> 38:05.960\nIt's just a lot of alcoholism.\n\n38:05.960 --> 38:06.960\nYes.\n\n38:06.960 --> 38:07.960\nBefore we, before.\n\n38:07.960 --> 38:08.960\nSo how long we've been working in porn?\n\n38:08.960 --> 38:10.060\nOh, it's so long.\n\n38:10.060 --> 38:12.000\nI'm, I'm, I'm too.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:16.680\nLike you're on a 900 shows, you write books, you do everything.\n\n38:16.680 --> 38:18.320\nLike you're, you're all over the.\n\n38:18.320 --> 38:23.140\nI, the thing about it is I think when people say like, I'm busy or I'm a workaholic people,\n\n38:23.140 --> 38:24.440\nlike it's funny to people.\n\n38:24.440 --> 38:28.200\nOr even if you make the joke about being a high functioning alcoholic, people think\n\n38:28.200 --> 38:29.480\nit's really cute.\n\n38:29.480 --> 38:31.800\nAnd then you're like, no, I have a real problem.\n\n38:31.800 --> 38:33.760\nI need help.\n\n38:33.760 --> 38:34.760\nLike, like I do.\n\n38:34.760 --> 38:40.440\nI it's clear to me that I could use like several meetings about my work. I've just started approach that therapy where I'm like\n\n38:40.440 --> 38:43.720\nI left the drinking thing behind I finally have enough\n\n38:44.160 --> 38:46.160\nTell me how that went for you. I\n\n38:46.480 --> 38:50.920\nHave enough faith in a therapist because she's like look if you want to drink for the rest of your life go ahead\n\n38:50.920 --> 38:55.920\nYou can I come to her, please? Yeah, I'll give you a number. She sees everybody half the people in this room\n\n38:57.600 --> 38:58.880\nBut\n\n38:58.880 --> 39:02.880\nShe was like but you have yet to acknowledge your workaholism\n\n39:02.880 --> 39:09.400\nAnd that was like a real threshold for me because I would always go like she would go like you're she wouldn't say you're a\n\n39:09.400 --> 39:12.080\nWorkaholic that's conversations not going to go anywhere. She's like you\n\n39:12.480 --> 39:16.120\nHow is she would say this stuff and I would go like are you implying?\n\n39:16.120 --> 39:19.760\nI'm a workaholic because I'm not because I'm not getting enough done right yeah\n\n39:19.760 --> 39:26.160\nYeah, no because I think about a workaholic is in it like in your construct you you not not only are you never busy enough\n\n39:26.160 --> 39:32.400\nYou're never effective enough. That's like a little like the aeroboros little like you're only as valuable as what you did\n\n39:32.400 --> 39:37.360\nOh, there's always gonna be more work. There's always gonna be more. Shut up mom. Here's the thing\n\n39:39.120 --> 39:41.120\nWe're all going to die right\n\n39:42.080 --> 39:44.080\nWe're all going to die\n\n39:47.760 --> 39:48.960\nAnd\n\n39:48.960 --> 39:53.320\nThat affects people differently right some people think we're all gonna die. So what's the point?\n\n39:53.320 --> 39:57.640\nWe're all gonna die. So let me get wasted my particular approaches. We're all gonna die\n\n39:57.640 --> 40:02.920\nSo I I I should be doing more shit like I'm not doing enough shit like when I'm lying on my deathbed\n\n40:02.920 --> 40:06.400\nI'll be like why didn't I do all the shit? Yeah, we did half the shit. Yeah, you know\n\n40:06.400 --> 40:08.400\nI think that's a really simple\n\n40:08.400 --> 40:14.480\nResponse I might I'm gonna die and one of the perfect sense right? Yeah, one of my shit grow your hair really long and bang it around\n\n40:15.600 --> 40:19.080\nFucking you're on fire you and that was you stole my outfit\n\n40:19.720 --> 40:24.640\nJust real real quick one of the women in either hair or makeup at whose line\n\n40:24.640 --> 40:29.880\nYeah, you I just walked out of the room and I was like, we're just talking about stuff and podcasts\n\n40:29.880 --> 40:33.720\nOh, yeah, I'd love to get each on and they're like, don't you dare ask her to do another thing?\n\n40:34.840 --> 40:38.640\nI also have like shitty boundaries, too. I'll like show I mean I just I want to do\n\n40:39.880 --> 40:45.320\nShe does enough stuff like like leave like give her some the most frightening thing to me\n\n40:45.320 --> 40:50.880\nAnd I am I don't know if this is this way for either of you is like looking at my calendar and having like a free day\n\n40:50.880 --> 40:56.400\nLike most people well frightening, but also to me. It's like running your tongue over a place where a tooth supposed to be\n\n40:56.400 --> 41:00.640\nYes, it's like fucking orgasm, but also like I'm dying, right? Yeah. Yeah\n\n41:03.120 --> 41:05.120\nSaturday and nothing and then you just like\n\n41:05.840 --> 41:10.440\nLike I'll just run around until it's like raw and bleeding the coolest\n\n41:10.440 --> 41:15.680\nI mean I knew I knew I was your like like like like I don't know\n\n41:16.320 --> 41:17.840\nWe do look alike\n\n41:17.840 --> 41:23.560\nI could have fraternal twin when I saw like what you talked about your thing about\n\n41:24.560 --> 41:30.680\nWhen you saw Rocky or that your whole thing about boxing when oh, yeah, it's like it\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:35.960\nDoesn't matter how many times you get hit. It's it's not how hard you hit\n\n41:35.960 --> 41:41.040\nIt's so hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, which is a code from Rocky Balboa\n\n41:41.080 --> 41:44.840\nIt has nothing to do with how much of a badass you are like I'm the biggest\n\n41:44.840 --> 41:48.000\nI'm the baddest on my dick is so huge although my dick is enormous. It's\n\n41:48.640 --> 41:53.520\nIt's just like your tin like you're how tonight how tenacious you are because the fact of the matter is you're gonna fail no matter\n\n41:53.520 --> 41:55.160\nWhat there is no avoiding failure, right?\n\n41:55.160 --> 41:59.520\nIt is literally laying in the road waiting for you to pull up in front of it like an episode of The Walking Dead where you\n\n41:59.520 --> 42:01.920\nPull up and there's a car in the middle of the road motherfucker you about to get shot\n\n42:03.080 --> 42:07.440\nIt's more about like can't like how many times can I recover?\n\n42:07.440 --> 42:11.000\nYeah, I mean and everybody who's successful isn't successful because they're magic\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:15.680\nThey're successful because they just they're like a junkyard dog. Well, it's almost as if you\n\n42:16.760 --> 42:24.280\nLike will never be a good person until you've empirically proven it by subjecting yourself to acid test after that is true\n\n42:24.280 --> 42:30.800\nYeah, there is something there is some like self satisfaction in the like I'm the toughest person out here\n\n42:30.800 --> 42:35.800\nYou cannot break me and even if you say okay, you have the job then I'll get fired\n\n42:35.800 --> 42:41.360\nRight, right, right like this is all gonna end at any minute. So I've got so many jobs that even if I got fired from nine of them\n\n42:41.360 --> 42:48.480\nThere's a tenth one at like, you know serving that frozen shit at juice press juicery like I'm gonna have one job left\n\n42:48.960 --> 42:50.960\nWhich brings me to why I'm here\n\n42:52.360 --> 42:55.200\nNo, I just I like literally I have a week off this year\n\n42:55.200 --> 43:00.320\nI've one week off for all of 2016 and I decided I was gonna direct a movie in that hole\n\n43:00.320 --> 43:08.480\nIn that in that ten-day hole. I'm serious. I was I was like fuck it like why wait until next year the year after to make\n\n43:08.480 --> 43:15.600\nMyself my life a living hell so I have a Kickstarter campaign because as you know people love giving money to black people and they love even more given\n\n43:15.600 --> 43:17.600\nmoney to women so\n\n43:17.600 --> 43:21.520\nEveryone's like you're a Hollywood lady. You you know just go get your Hollywood friends to give you money\n\n43:21.520 --> 43:23.720\nI don't know when's the last time you saw a black female film director\n\n43:24.400 --> 43:27.120\nMeep meep meep mop\n\n43:27.120 --> 43:30.280\nWait, oh, that was radar sweeping\n\n43:31.280 --> 43:34.940\nOr a really shitty cricket impression. That's the black people think cricket\n\n43:37.080 --> 43:43.040\nThat's how that's how that's how dejected they are these people don't have crickets\n\n43:44.960 --> 43:48.480\nWill you please go to Aisha's Indie go-go page\n\n43:49.960 --> 43:51.960\nGive black people a chance\n\n43:52.560 --> 43:54.560\nTo hear crickets\n\n43:54.560 --> 43:59.040\nI'm so poor for $45 a month you can send I eat you to a farm\n\n44:00.800 --> 44:05.600\nCrickets live we should get understand how crickets actually sound I grew up in city. I'm there. I'm well\n\n44:05.600 --> 44:10.080\nI'm I'm I just I want our other guests to know that we haven't forgotten about no\n\n44:10.080 --> 44:12.720\nNo, we haven't forgotten about that anyway, that was all I wanted to say was\n\n44:13.280 --> 44:18.440\nWe should get to let's get specific and then bring them out about your because this is your your arm in town\n\n44:18.440 --> 44:23.840\nDid you kick start the movie harm to him? No, I would never be caught dead kick-starting. No, I\n\n44:32.680 --> 44:36.200\nWhat I did do is you know what white privilege smells like snickerdoodles we\n\n44:37.560 --> 44:40.540\nWe kick started an Amalisa the\n\n44:41.680 --> 44:43.680\nWarm cookies\n\n44:43.680 --> 44:48.480\nThat's brute by Faber J. No you groups you you we can't start we kick started an Amalisa\n\n44:48.480 --> 44:55.880\nWe raised 400 grand overnight because that's what we asked for and then we raised that and then some and then proceeded to find out\n\n44:55.880 --> 45:00.000\nThe movie cost eight nine million dollars right right and we couldn't tell any of them\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:04.960\nWe basically have a long story short like I felt like we fucked up like a kick-starting\n\n45:04.960 --> 45:11.840\nSo I haven't gone back since like I want like I think that that's a really sacred thing like it's a bond you're making\n\n45:11.840 --> 45:15.720\nWell, you're like a bond of kind of honor and and you know\n\n45:15.720 --> 45:19.280\nYou're making a promise to people that you're gonna do but I also think that it's not free money\n\n45:19.280 --> 45:22.640\nIt's a weird way you're taking more energy than you would\n\n45:24.400 --> 45:29.760\nAnd you're putting into updates and stuff because you're you owe you owe people a relationship to the project\n\n45:29.760 --> 45:33.520\nYou owe people a connection to what you're doing. That's ongoing and people I think well\n\n45:33.520 --> 45:35.840\nI'm just giving you money. We'll know like if you donate\n\n45:35.920 --> 45:41.760\nLet's say you donate 30 bucks and you get a t-shirt the t-shirt probably costs like 15 or 16 bucks to make and like seven or\n\n45:41.760 --> 45:45.600\nEight bucks to send to you. So really this is just about us hanging out. You know, I mean\n\n45:45.600 --> 45:49.200\nIt's just about us getting enough money to make this little thing. I donated\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.560\n$2,000 and I was supposed to hang out with Dan\n\n45:54.800 --> 45:58.480\nWe just bring it and I still hasn't I still haven't gotten it\n\n45:58.480 --> 46:04.000\nAre you sure I haven't gotten a t-shirt or a copy?

Oh, absolutely\n\n46:24.720 --> 46:30.880\nThe movie is called axis and you can just go to Kickstarter and put in and type in black lady\n\n46:30.960 --> 46:35.120\nI'm the only one on Kickstarter. By the way, I don't know where what black Kickstarter is access\n\n46:35.120 --> 46:40.080\nIsha Tyler, yeah, you can find it just my socials, you know, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr\n\n46:40.160 --> 46:45.120\nIsha Tyler and you think you could you're so much of a workaholic. You think you can direct a movie in one week\n\n46:45.360 --> 46:50.400\nYeah, I do I do out of your minds. How about how long is the film? It's gonna be 90 minutes\n\n46:50.480 --> 46:54.160\nBut here's what's cool about it. So here's what's the cool thing about it. Thank you guy who loves film\n\n46:54.560 --> 47:00.480\nUm, I love film too. I don't want someone to make it in a week. No, here's here's what's cool about this concept\n\n47:00.480 --> 47:06.960\nCome on. Let me tell you some things about goodwill hunting. You you think they spent months on that piece of shit?\n\n47:08.880 --> 47:10.880\nHow do you like them apples\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:17.360\nI don't know if you guys saw the movie lock, but they shot that movie in five days\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:22.480\nSo the way that we're doing this movie so that we kind of uh, you know, a lot of my friends are doing it for free\n\n47:22.640 --> 47:24.640\nMost people are doing it for a free or very cheap\n\n47:24.720 --> 47:29.840\nWe're rehearsing it for the next two months and then shooting the entire movie every day\n\n47:29.840 --> 47:32.640\nLike a play all the way through from beginning to end\n\n47:32.960 --> 47:37.280\nThat way we can adjust and pivot every night what worked what didn't go back and fix that the next day\n\n47:37.360 --> 47:39.360\nAnd by the end we'll have shot the movie\n\n47:39.360 --> 47:42.000\nNine times in a row and then we'll choose the best takes\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:45.680\nWell, all bets are off now because did you see louis thing? Thank you. Thank you\n\n47:46.960 --> 47:48.960\nI'm a problem solver\n\n47:49.600 --> 47:52.560\nI should have known there would be applause there. I started talking\n\n47:52.720 --> 47:55.920\nBut did you see louis ck's thing or it was at hoarse and pete what's it called?\n\n47:55.920 --> 48:02.000\nUh, I mean a very experimental on the surface of it where you're like, I I should full disclosure.

Yeah, I don't\n\n55:55.840 --> 55:58.960\nAll right, why you haven't gone to force awakens, which is like the most\n\n55:58.960 --> 56:06.480\nStupendous filmic palette cleanser of that entire franchise. I could fix everything. Oh, so this one's for grown-ups. Yes\n\n56:07.440 --> 56:12.400\nAll right, well, I'll give it a look see everything that you wanted to have happen in that universe\n\n56:12.400 --> 56:16.000\nIt's out on blu-ray. Everything is great. Yeah, and then also\n\n56:16.800 --> 56:21.520\nLike I feel like there's another part of you like we're all we're all this person like I cut\n\n56:22.320 --> 56:27.120\nSix grade to see empire strikes back like I didn't go to school that day or the next day\n\n56:27.120 --> 56:30.480\nThat's how much that franchise affected me. So even the shitty ones\n\n56:30.560 --> 56:35.600\nI feel like they're like the last three fries in the bottom of the pack. You just fucking eat them anyway\n\n56:37.280 --> 56:40.400\nThey're not good black and they taste like feet, but you do it\n\n56:42.880 --> 56:44.880\nBecause you love fucking\n\n56:46.400 --> 56:48.400\nYeah, you're a shitty fan Dan\n\n56:48.800 --> 56:50.800\nI'm so in love right now.

What are you gonna do with the rest of your money because I'm giving\n\n57:17.120 --> 57:22.080\nAll things in the world. What do you do with the rest of tonight? I think you guys understand that me not bothering to click\n\n57:22.320 --> 57:26.560\nOn force awakens has nothing to do with me deciding that it's good or bad or anything\n\n57:26.640 --> 57:30.480\nAnd we need you to be one of us. No, it's it's it's one of us\n\n57:30.560 --> 57:36.960\nIt's the liberation of agnosticism after a lifetime of being battered around this fucking liberation\n\n57:38.080 --> 57:40.080\nGnosticism\n\n57:40.160 --> 57:43.680\nIt's the liberation. I'm on your I got Dan side\n\n57:43.680 --> 57:49.280\nI'm just kind of like like I I will watch that movie the day it crawls into bed with me and goes\n\n57:49.360 --> 57:52.400\nIt's time to watch it because that's what star wars did\n\n57:52.960 --> 57:55.840\nBecause I was three and I couldn't go anywhere. That'll help delay with your book\n\n57:55.840 --> 57:58.800\nWhat if matt daemon crawls into bed with you with the force wiggins over to my house?\n\n58:00.400 --> 58:05.520\nI just like like like look come on. You can't tell me come on force awakens not for grown-ups\n\n58:05.920 --> 58:10.800\nIt's it's for grown-ups with kids. You know what? You know how it's for grown-ups. It's for grown-ups the way\n\n58:10.800 --> 58:14.960\nOkay, remember the first star trek movie the reboot with chris pine that one was for kids\n\n58:14.960 --> 58:19.600\nIt was like a stupid fucking sequence where he goes through like a zoo except the water pipe black black black black\n\n58:19.680 --> 58:24.000\nAnd like it's like wow wow and then the second one you don't remember that the first star trek the first star\n\n58:24.080 --> 58:29.680\nI love the star trek. No, remember the fucking sequence where they get stuck in the like the little like pipe little water system\n\n58:29.680 --> 58:34.080\nThey're like in the sewage and they're floating through the remember you didn't like that literally like a sound of like a\n\n58:35.440 --> 58:39.200\nLike you don't remember that no, I don't remember that and then the second one\n\n58:39.200 --> 58:43.760\nThe star trek into the darkness or whatever that one was called. That was for grown-ups\n\n58:43.760 --> 58:45.680\nThat was the one that was for grown-ups. Oh ironically\n\n58:45.680 --> 58:49.360\nI didn't watch that one because I was waiting for the world to react to the way they did the first one\n\n58:49.520 --> 58:52.640\nI really like the first one because it was so such a clever way of rebooting\n\n59:00.320 --> 59:06.080\nI can't just enjoy them die inside come back. Here's a movie go watch Diary of a teenage girl. It's really good\n\n59:06.080 --> 59:12.000\nI'm a grown-up now.

Mr. Simmons\n\n01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880\nRichard Simmons\n\n01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.520\nRichard Simmons\n\n01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:11.600\nRichard Simmons is here. Can we bring Richard Simmons up? Where's Richard Simmons, but he's revealed himself on home towns\n\n01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.440\nRichard Simmons\n\n01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.080\nIt's it's your trauma. Eric. Did you just leave our show and go buy a bunch of snacks? What happened?\n\n01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:25.280\nThere's a you don't have to go far. Oh, you can buy friends riveted by Star Wars. Can I can I turn this into entertainment?\n\n01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.280\nPlease\n\n01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.880\nPlease do this\n\n01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.320\nEric thank you for joining us. Sorry. It was compulsory\n\n01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.520\nSorry, you got bullied for liking\n\n01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.080\nNo, I like him. I like Eric Simmons\n\n01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.160\nEric Eric are you? This is not Eric\n\n01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.680\nIt's it's definitely not Eric. It's your name. That's the name\n\n01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.800\nEric, are you a fan of the Star Wars franchise in any capacity? Yes, I appreciate it\n\n01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.520\nSo we've got a group of people up here. We all feel differently about different phases of the\n\n01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.920\noperation\n\n01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:08.640\nUh, I think, you know, maybe it's a little trite of me or maybe in my little little heart. I just want\n\n01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.920\nentertainment to happen on this podcast at some point\n\n01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.640\nEric, would you just tell us like in your mind what the perfect\n\n01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.880\nWhere the perfect Star Wars movie would be set in terms of timeline?\n\n01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.800\nTatooine\n\n01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.800\nand then\n\n01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.800\nAnd then just to explain to you then\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.800\nI we're gonna do it. I'm gonna do the movie\n\n01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.040\nSo you want plot points?\n\n01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.560\nAnd Ayesha is gonna be a new form of Jedi and it's not gonna be... That's what the kick started for, right?\n\n01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.360\nSo make Ayesha a Jedi\n\n01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.960\nApparently I'm gonna be in a porn with two black guys\n\n01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:53.600\nYou know what? Eric, the floor. I'm going to just stop this. It is right after the second prequel when General Grievous dies\n\n01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.760\nOh, gosh, dude, that was so inside. We have to go Google everything now\n\n01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.960\nWhich was matrix revolutions. What was that?\n\n01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:05.840\nThe second prequel is Dark Knight Emerges\n\n01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.160\nDark Knight Reloaded. Electric Boogaloo\n\n01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.360\nYou're saying the sequel to Phantom Menace, right?\n\n01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.920\nIf you want a serious answer, I really like what JJ's done with it now\n\n01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.480\nOkay, you've seen Force Awakens and you like it. Yes, but look, I'm gonna ask a bigger question here, right?\n\n01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.800\nI feel like it's cool now to hate everything and that's not new. It's been cool for like 10 or 15 years to hate everything\n\n01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:39.280\nAnd so like just basic ingenuousness, right? Like I love this franchise. Yeah, that wasn't my favorite\n\n01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.480\nThat's not fair. That's not fair. What you're doing is not fair. And if you notice Eric's opening his snacks right now\n\n01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:50.480\nThat's not fair. You know that Dan wants chips. I don't know if it's unfair that you hate chips, but it's unfair that I'm saying that you get inside\n\n01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.480\nOh, chips!\n\n01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.640\nI haven't seen Batman versus Superman. I loved Batman versus Superman\n\n01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.520\nAnd I feel like everybody hated Batman versus Superman because they just wanted to hate Batman\n\n01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.880\nYou just pulled the I just like like Eric Simmons everybody. Oh, he's not leaving. He's just giving me chips\n\n01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.520\nAll right. No Eric. Who's your who's your favorite? Who's your favorite star?\n\n01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.960\nHe has not blinked\n\n01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.960\nThis is a mess\n\n01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.360\nI love it\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nEric Simmons\n\n01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.680\nEric Simmons, I'm calling you out\n\n01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.880\nOh, is he using he's using the force calling you out Eric Simmons Eric knowing can hear that but you\n\n01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.640\nEric\n\n01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:46.640\nI'm kind of worried about your physical safety Eric Simmons Eric. No one can hear that but you Eric Simmons\n\n01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.360\nYour cool ranch Jedi powers\n\n01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.600\nWill not save you now\n\n01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.800\nEric Simmons, what are you doing later?\n\n01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.480\nProbably getting drunk and watching Daredevil\n\n01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:13.920\nThat's a good show. That's the number one answer\n\n01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.320\nIt is a confusing time for the narrative\n\n01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:37.280\nEric Simmons has been summoned to the stage only to find out that he himself\n\n01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.400\nIs within and weaving the narrative of the new Star Wars movie\n\n01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:55.200\nMeanwhile princess Aisha has been honing her craft as a Jedi on the swampy ice planet of water sun\n\n01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.280\nWith with fleet fleet flop the Jedi master\n\n01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.040\nOne of 700 needless wipes\n\n01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:16.400\nDoes anybody not find it difficult that like the one thing the one issue with the entire Star Wars construct the the whole like\n\n01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.360\nThe whole UI\n\n01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.760\nSometimes shit is alien and sometimes it's not\n\n01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:36.160\nLike it would seem even Aisha herself is unaware that the new movie is happening around her\n\n01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.240\nPeople just run out of ideas like your name is bloop. Your name is clean plop. That's\n\n01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.600\nAnd then you're Dan. Do you know what I'm saying? Like that's not\n\n01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:51.360\ndiscouraged by her abilities as a padwan flip-flop calls the Jedi council\n\n01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.360\npowers but via crystal holograms\n\n01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.760\nI'm gonna look that up\n\n01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.760\nNo one returned\n\n01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.920\nPlanned by clinical depression flip-flop proceeds to palm springs\n\n01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920\nto work on his book\n\n01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:30.160\nAt risk of depression meanwhile, the empire is up to something\n\n01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.280\nAnd also\n\n01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.760\nAnd lord scrotum what news from the fuckface\n\n01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.760\nAccording to data analysis, there is a\n\n01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.360\nYour data analysis grows weary on me\n\n01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:08.240\nMy lord, I'm only doing my best analysis of the data your best is worst\n\n01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.760\nIn the eyes of the Jedi\n\n01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:21.760\nMy lord, please your lord is well, it's me.

No, I made you had to give away half your doritos, bro\n\n01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:19.360\nDo you want the cool ranch taco bell Dorito? I have not had said Doritos Locos taco. That's pretty good\n\n01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:30.000\nReal quick real quick it is a difficult challenge time for everyone that's talking taco shell\n\n01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.400\nHas the flavor of cool ranch\n\n01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:39.360\nBut it doesn't have the substance and texture of an actual dorito. So you bite into it. You're like this is a thin\n\n01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:47.120\nSubstitute for an actual cool ranch Dorito and I could have just bought all the fillings for a taco and stuck some real\n\n01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.280\nFucking Doritos into that\n\n01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:56.240\nDorito not just fired.

It's fantastic\n\n01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.680\nI don't think it's fantastic in the way they intended\n\n01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.240\nBut it's a wonderful film if you haven't seen it check it out\n\n01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:52.240\nAnyways, I was searching on ebay for some memorabilia from this movie and I found um some shoes\n\n01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.880\nThat allegedly were george berns's shoes. No, okay now\n\n01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:03.200\nNo, they were like three thousand dollars or something like that. So I'm like I sure as hell can't I'm not gonna buy george berns shoes\n\n01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.280\nFor three thousand dollars unless I'm incredibly high and drunk at late at night, which hasn't happened in a while\n\n01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.960\num\n\n01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.160\nSo one day I tweeted about them then one day I found a box backstage that was sitting there for weeks\n\n01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.240\nAnd I just was too afraid to open backstage when you guys on the road on the road. Yes. Yeah on the road\n\n01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.120\nI found this box right now. I found it. I thought well someone brought it. Hey someone brought you a gift\n\n01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.080\nI'm like, okay put it over with a pile of gifts because I'm just so loved by everybody\n\n01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.600\nI get so many gifts. I just get so many gifts. Yes. Just so many with the other be actually called no in origin\n\n01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.200\nBut you know, and maybe it's you know, there's anthrax in here and whatever is heard\n\n01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.320\nMaybe it's an aborted baby from some of those are the best who knows\n\n01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.760\nUm, anyways, so I opened it up and lo and behold\n\n01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.640\nI found of the white italian loafers. No\n\n01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.560\nThose are those the ones that you wanted. These were the ones that I wanted\n\n01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.360\nAnd I got so excited that I queued up sergeant peppers lonely hearts club in on tour bus on tour\n\n01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.720\nWe watched the whole thing watched a thousand times. I was trying to pause it\n\n01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:03.120\nI'm like and I finally found a shot with him with him dancing with the with white shoes on but they weren't these shoes\n\n01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.840\nSo I was like, oh my god\n\n01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.080\nSo and they said butterfield and butterfield on them and everything so I called and I found out they were actually\n\n01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.560\nGeorge Burns's shoes from oh god, you devil to\n\n01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.640\nYes, even better. No, three the third one. So\n\n01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360\nOh god, you devil. Yeah\n\n01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.200\nYeah, he's dancing. He's dancing in these shoes at a wedding reception as a devil\n\n01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.880\nBecause those look those look a little later like in terms of design than the sergeant peppers for me\n\n01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.040\nYes, yes, sir. Well italian loafers, uh, and I'm just that these are not a gift\n\n01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.360\nThese are just these were a gift for me. So no one can have these but I'm willing to let anyone try them on\n\n01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360\nWho's the size?\n\n01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.480\nThere's a size of Cinderella if someone can put these on\n\n01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.120\nsomeone a size seven and a half\n\n01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.560\nEric Eric Simmons.

Yeah, but it's definitely not Jeff's because\n\n01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.680\nI've heard things about Jeff Jeff Bryan Davis. You can't even put your hands in those shoes. You giant\n\n01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.000\nHe's a little George burn shoes, but he was well and out\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.480\nIt is a frustrating time for the legion of shoes certified\n\n01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.240\nso\n\n01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.240\nThat's why he had the cigar because he had small feet\n\n01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.600\num\n\n01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.640\nbut\n\n01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.640\nIf anyone's willing to try these on\n\n01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.080\nSeven and a half who's gonna come on up.

I'm the most interested person in Billy Zane that has ever been\n\n01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:51.040\nSecond most. There was an article in salon about how much more interested I am in Billy Zane than Billy Zane\n\n01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:58.480\nThere's like a point counter point and he's like wait, what's my favorite ice cream? I'm like rocky road butch\n\n01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.160\nAnd he's like did you say bitch or butch and I'm like\n\n01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:08.080\nOh, and he's like that's what I would have said and I'm like, yeah, because I'm zany\n\n01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.240\nIt's like I've been unseemed and I'm like, yeah, I think he's doing fine.

No, you weren't you were with me?\n\n01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.880\nDan, I think the problem was because we're all sitting in a straight line and it was no like we can't see each other\n\n01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.680\nI think it was too much going on at once and everybody was so excited\n\n01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.320\nWell, I don't want to fight about it. Jeff is validating you. The guy who invented the the pink Floyd thing was up here\n\n01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.720\nSo it was just there's a lot of people, you know\n\n01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.760\nWell, okay, that's how you guys feel\n\n01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:12.480\nDo you guys do you guys would you guys ask dan and aisha?\n\n01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:16.640\nThe brunch question.

And I would like you involved with this very so he invites me to brunch and I can't get over this\n\n01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:52.240\nAt this this predicament that's in my head constantly. So he invites me to brunch and I sit down and we wait\n\n01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.560\nWe have small talk and then I'm panicking\n\n01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.480\nI start sweating because a waitress is coming over to ask what we want to drink, right?\n\n01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.040\nAnd I want them to ask him first, but for some reason they always ask me first. Maybe it's a long it's the hair\n\n01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.160\nIt's the hair. That's what I was saying\n\n01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.440\nAuthoritative hair. Yeah, I'm the you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah, it's the hair\n\n01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.880\nand\n\n01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.840\nSince it's brunch, which I think is a bullshit fucking word anyways\n\n01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.440\nIt's like I don't know why it's that breakfast or lunch they go. Well, what do you want to drink?\n\n01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:21.680\nI'm I'm totally in confused. Do I get orange juice or do I get iced tea because it's going to dictate what I have\n\n01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.160\nIf we're having breakfast or if we're having lunch\n\n01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.360\nSo you don't have an orange juice with so so he orders a nice tea, right? He orders the iced tea\n\n01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.840\nSo I'm thinking I'm in the clear for lunch\n\n01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:38.480\nSo I order I order a nice tea too and then I order the tuna melt and he throws his curveball and orders a breakfast burrito\n\n01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.880\nSo now I'm like\n\n01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.040\nRight fucking right\n\n01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.520\nThat's like what the fuck?\n\n01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.880\nAnd now\n\n01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.480\nNow we're having breakfast and he's having lunch and I can't fucking do this\n\n01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.640\nI feel terrible\n\n01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.480\nI can't do it\n\n01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:59.280\nFuck kind of relationship business. I don't understand. It's all in my head though. He doesn't give a shit. I do\n\n01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.080\nI\n\n01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.520\nHe has an issue with the fact that I get a fucking Arnold Palmer while I'm getting a\n\n01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.160\nBreakfast burrito. That's why I fucking hate brunch make it breakfast make it lunch 11 o'clock sucks\n\n01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.760\nBut then he'll have orange juice at like three in the afternoon. What's that about?\n\n01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:20.960\nAre you are you got if if if if if if you guys are looking for a person to tell you you're sane?\n\n01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.920\nYou've got the wrong guy, but if you if you want me to tell you it's okay that you're out of your fucking mind\n\n01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.560\nI'm on your side, but that doesn't\n\n01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.760\nWhat we're asking\n\n01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.680\nMakes no sense to me and I'd like to think my\n\n01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.040\nFred Fred put did I not explain it out of you guys?\n\n01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.400\nBe syncopated you get it you're pissed too, right?\n\n01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:51.120\nYou get weird when somebody orders breakfast at the same time you eat lunch. That's the whole thing\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.800\nTake Dan to brunch like what's the worst case scenario? Can we explore the worst case scenario?\n\n01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:03.120\nAbsolutely, that's why we're trying to break it down as a virtual reality scene. Okay, so who's who?\n\n01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:08.080\nI could be the waiter. I could be Geordie. I could be Fred. I guess you'll be the waiter. I'll be me\n\n01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.840\nOr we can I could be the waiter\n\n01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.960\nI'm going to do the corollary. I'm just gonna hold and do the corollary.

If you want, I see it's okay\n\n01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.840\nIf you want to get fucked up at nine in the morning\n\n01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.720\nThat's true\n\n01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.800\nThat is why brunch was invented. You're sober. You've had 17 coffees\n\n01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.320\nI'm about to fucking masturbate at the table because I'm wasted\n\n01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.920\nHey, wait, what wait, what was the end?\n\n01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.040\nOkay, okay.

That's all the sharing that you get from me\n\n01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.600\nBut there's the eggs and tuna on the same thing doesn't match. I had pancakes and a bottle of vodka\n\n01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:01.520\nAnd a piece of pie because you were drunk you ordered breakfast at the long time\n\n01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:05.280\nUSA\n\n01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.560\nWhat I have\n\n01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:22.080\nI'd like to apologize to Fred and Jordy.

Good choice. What would you like?\n\n01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:24.320\nUm, what are you gonna get to drink? Don't let him validate your choices make make your own choices\n\n01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:31.600\nBrunch is your own. Whatever you want. You're hyzen you're hyzenberging this principle right now. Whatever you want is okay\n\n01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.240\nI believe I'm gonna go with the arnold palmer. Nicely played a robber palmer. Is it robber palmer?\n\n01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:40.480\nWell, that's one arnold drumming. That's one where I have on red lipstick and I dance poorly to shitty music\n\n01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.480\nBut I'll bring you an alder and palmer\n\n01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.280\nDo you guys have a full bar?\n\n01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:52.080\nUnfortunately, no, but I can get you some really shitty mimosa's in a pitcher. Oh, it's beer and wine champagne\n\n01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.080\nUh, we've got champagne\n\n01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:00.160\nUh, one wine cooler this guy's got a bloody Mary and my yeah, I got a bloody Mary. Oh, yeah, we have bloody Mary's too. Yeah, okay\n\n01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.680\nSo you have a pitcher of bloody Mary's pitcher mimosa's\n\n01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.320\nPitcher of kombucha that I made in my car\n\n01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.120\nBut I can't get a cocktail\n\n01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:16.160\nWhere do you think you are? Was that kombucha run across your body into? Yes, right through in my vagina and into\n\n01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.800\nYes, I'll take a\n\n01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:25.040\nUh, uh mimosa. All right a mimosa. Mimosa. Yeah, clearly. You've never had a mimosa. Well, I was\n\n01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.360\nYou're allowed you're allowed to get vodka hit this guy over here. Okay. No, I'm a guy\n\n01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.200\nI'm a guy over here in the mood. So in my brain nobody in a guy at the next table is criticizing us the whole time\n\n01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.800\nHe's having a bloody Mary. I eat your stand down\n\n01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.720\nI have seen study in 45 minutes. Can we do this?\n\n01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:49.600\nSo can I give you what's going on in my brain right now? Yes. Um, you've gotten your drinks. You have your drinks\n\n01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:56.240\nHere we go. Okay. Now. What would you like? Well Dan ordered a mimosa. So there's orange juice in that. So maybe this is breakfast\n\n01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:01.120\nHere's your here's. I'm thinking this. I'm thinking this. Are you happy with my brain right now?\n\n01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.160\nSo I think you got orange juice bloody Mary is breakfast\n\n01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.080\nThat's so why don't I bring you the orange juice? I think we're having breakfast\n\n01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:14.560\nOh, no, thank you. Sure. Do you like would you like some orange juice? I feel like the star wars characters at the other\n\n01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.560\nTable are talking about us\n\n01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.640\nYou can have anything you want\n\n01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:24.560\nOkay, so bring me an orange. It's a difficult time for the premise of the brunch conversation all in the same glass\n\n01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.960\nYou want the arnold palmer with the orange juice in the same glass? Yes, I don't think you're gonna like that\n\n01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.800\nI'll bring you an arnold palmer and an orange juice and if you'd like to make an oj\n\n01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:39.120\nIisha we're trying to do a sociological study of the brunch conversation\n\n01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:45.920\nHey, I'm standing by there's star wars guys at the other table that you guys are missing is if he wants an orange juice\n\n01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.960\nAnd a bloody Mary and an arnold palmer and a beer and a punch in the nuts\n\n01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.480\nHe can have all of those things because it's brunch. That's the nature of brunch. All things are possible\n\n01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.960\nI just figure this out\n\n01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:04.400\nThat's what I'm saying. I should nail it all order pancakes and french fries and burger\n\n01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:11.360\nBut more dessert. This is why I'm in the back making kombucha. Are you away just right now?\n\n01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:17.040\nAre we are we gonna take our orders? Honestly, where is this girl? Like what is this? Go Fred. What do you want?\n\n01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:22.320\nI'm gonna have the breakfast burrito. Oh delicious. That's breakfast and lunch at the same time. What would you like?\n\n01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.360\nThat's what you know what? I just got the solution. Okay\n\n01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.720\nI'll chicken and waffles\n\n01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:33.760\nThat's it sir. There we go. A winning choice. I'll have chicken and waffles. I believe in you deeply\n\n01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:41.040\nI just figured it out right now. I got it. Sir, what would you like for breakfast? I'd like a 12 year old's private\n\n01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:51.540\nBut...\n\n01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.880\nI like 12 year olds\n\n01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.400\nBack to the tape\n\n01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:06.720\nI've actually said I figured it out. I'm sorry. An english muffin\n\n01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:13.360\nSo I've been thinking as brunch is prison, so it's actually brunch is freedom brunch is freedom my friends\n\n01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:19.400\nBrunch is the only free meal of the week. It's the only meal within you can fully express\n\n01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:27.360\nI never thought without judgment or recrimination. I the world is yours. Hey, I never thought I would say twiz. I'm\n\n01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:32.360\nWorld is mine. Wait. He says twiz. Um, you don't remember twiz. Um, the world\n\n01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.360\nThank God\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.960\nBut but but I never like\n\n01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:45.760\nBrunch brunch as the meal that where you're free insinuates that the other meals you have you're constrained\n\n01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:53.080\nWhat I don't understand why people thought I love brunch so much. Why I don't really rules my so do we has everyone been eating so do we\n\n01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:55.320\nconstrained me\n\n01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:03.560\nYes, well here's what's that way everyone hates me. Yeah, right from listening to the hour of getting an egg McMuffin at noon\n\n01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:11.640\nWhen you when someone's trying to do breakfast all day dinner the implication is I'm breaking the rules, right? Yes\n\n01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.800\nYou're right. Oh god. I had pancakes dinner. I'm out of control. I eat zero for dinner\n\n01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:21.200\nI'm alone and nobody loves me, but I think I think from this from listening to their show anything at brunch\n\n01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:26.040\nYou can eat anything. I'm listening to from listening to Fred and Jordy show. I think what you find out is that\n\n01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:33.560\nJordy you have a little bit more social anxiety about like am I am I stepping on somebody's toes? Am I doing this wrong, right?\n\n01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:39.240\nReally, I thought I'm gonna let you decide it. This is going to be either breakfast or lunch\n\n01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.600\nJeff is like I'm gonna put this back on the rails\n\n01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.320\nNo, I just\n\n01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.200\nHonestly, and I am going to dignify this evening\n\n01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:52.760\nHonestly, actually the thing that I wanted to talk about just to kind of switch gears like this whole show's been about\n\n01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.400\nself yes\n\n01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.240\nTo a fault is that not the essence of when I told people that I was coming on the Harmontown\n\n01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:09.760\nThere were a couple girls that actually said oh Jeff Davis. Oh, he's great, but one specifically said, you know, he's hung like a horse\n\n01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:17.680\nJeff Bryan Davis, that's true. That's really true. Yeah, and and the girl actually said she goes he was so big\n\n01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:20.840\nbarely could fit and\n\n01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.120\nSaid that she could do cheated pull-ups by the pool\n\n01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360\nusing your dick\n\n01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360\nThat's what she told me\n\n01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.960\nAnd so I was telling you right\n\n01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:39.360\nI would see you in your suits and I and I realized that you\n\n01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:44.640\nThat you weren't pretty tight suits. I feel like that's what I wanted to talk about Dan\n\n01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.640\nIs this been talked about on the show?\n\n01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.080\nNo, no, Jeff's a huge dick. Yes\n\n01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.680\nNo, it hasn't been talked about as such\n\n01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:01.000\nI could go on to argue that every fucking episode\n\n01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.800\nOne way or another keeps coming back around to it\n\n01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.160\nSince we're all doing one of the fuck we want tonight. I mean, I got but I\n\n01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.400\nFeel like I would remember somebody somebody doing pull-ups in a pool\n\n01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.720\nThis is what was being told to me. So I just wanted to bring it up and it does it\n\n01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.600\nIt's not ringing a bell right now. Okay? Well, we know who we're talking about\n\n01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:33.400\nYeah, I think you I showed you a picture and I said this is the one I listened to your last podcast\n\n01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.120\nAnd you're like, I hope Jeff doesn't hear this so you could bring it up. I didn't think you would listen\n\n01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.520\nI'm a fan of your goddamn show\n\n01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:45.160\nStop trying to turn this into something respectable\n\n01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:52.880\nI love your show and just stop it. Just when I heard it that level I was like, wow\n\n01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.400\nOh shit, you guys know this\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nNo, you're adorable. Huh?\n\n01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.480\nNo, this is no\n\n01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.960\nYou guys are you uncomfortable? They're gonna be like zombies coming after you after this is over the problem\n\n01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.560\nThe problem is my dick is it's quite long, but it's shaped exactly like a treble cliff\n\n01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.520\nSo\n\n01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:20.520\nSex is almost impossible\n\n01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.960\nBut it's nice because it's always a math problem. How is this gonna work?\n\n01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:30.640\nEverybody turns into a blind person using braille. Okay, it's always in the key of D. Carry the one\n\n01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:32.640\nI\n\n01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:45.560\nMy shame to admit I don't understand the D key of D. Right. No. Yeah, that I get\n\n01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:56.520\nI thought it was like is is key of D like a Motown\n\n01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:06.200\nThe opposite of races I allow for the possibility of Motown people we don't even know\n\n01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:15.680\nI'm constantly anticipating their existence. And now the opposite of races. Well, there might be a lady named T of D\n\n01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.800\nOrder order in the court order\n\n01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.480\nMay I may I ask to deflect off of this shit?\n\n01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.080\nCan I can I bring up when I did please stop talking about my penis?\n\n01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:33.840\nI feel super uncomfortable when I did our of talking about my big dick when I did our of goon\n\n01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.040\nWe were just we just did all name-droppy stories and shit like that\n\n01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:42.280\nBut you Jordy had a story about going to the playboy mansion. Can you can you say that story?\n\n01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:48.560\nThe yeah, yeah, you like that story fucking. It's it's the greatest rock story. I've ever heard I think okay\n\n01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.400\nWell, I want to hear the story. It's really not that now you got built it up\n\n01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:58.440\nIt's really all before it could there be a fight between two characters in it. Well, he's a swords\n\n01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:04.320\nI had just talked about Dan and one of them used to be on girls\n\n01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:09.320\nI had just talked about the story of Dan and Rob getting high with Adam Corolla and meeting\n\n01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.480\nHasselhoff and that weird conversation\n\n01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:19.700\nAnd so that was my like my offering of my playboy mansion story and then Jordy goes I because I went there once I think and\n\n01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.040\nJust lay that on this because it's it's not a long story. It's just a fucking goodie\n\n01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:30.840\nOkay, I'm a terrible storyteller, but I'll see if I can figure it out years ago when I used to do a lot of bad things\n\n01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.200\nDave Navarro and I\n\n01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:41.200\nSorry, he's on my podcast next week. Yeah, and he's told the story is actually in his book\n\n01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:46.280\nSo it's not like I'm revealing anything. No, it's he's a normal human being and people like you\n\n01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:50.560\nPrevent him from being part of stories like this\n\n01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.560\nYes, our story is anyway, he's amazing and he's on my podcast and back to you\n\n01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.080\nAnyways, we got a limo.

So you're like sir if you're going to come in here\n\n01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:59.200\nFor some reason he grabs my dreadlock and ties off one of his arms. I'm like, what are you doing? Oh, you're doing?\n\n01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:03.240\nOh, okay, cool.

That was it\n\n01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.680\nThat was it what did you leave out? Oh\n\n01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.240\nYou're talking about the girl who lost her purse and shit in the toilet that\n\n01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.160\nAnd he also said you guys sprayed the ceiling. Oh, yes\n\n01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:03.400\nHe went everywhere because I kind of didn't want to I mean the story's common knowledge it's good, but I don't want your dreadlocks\n\n01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.440\nAnd boop and then not talk about I was thinking about how he sprayed the blood on the training and all that other stuff\n\n01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:16.840\nJordy Jordy, I always say this to to the young to the young heroin addicts out there when you use your friends dreadlock to tie off at the\n\n01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.400\nPlayboy mansion\n\n01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:23.760\nUntie before you take the needle out. Otherwise the blood's gonna go over the fucking well\n\n01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.400\nYeah, cuz I actually wanted to stay he dragged me out because I was still stuck to his arm\n\n01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:32.980\nSo you can understand the struggles of brunch at this hug's not drugs\n\n01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.160\nExactly you you have like PTSD\n\n01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.880\nWell guys both\n\n01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:45.980\nSay no comment if I thought but you guys are rock and roller. So you have you both done heroin?\n\n01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:48.400\nNever\n\n01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:53.080\nThat's not ironic. You've never done. I've never done. So you've I've done everything at one point\n\n01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.720\nYeah, I mean I'm in a heroin\n\n01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.060\nBut everything at one point. Yeah, I mean everything. I'm not nothing that never heroin\n\n01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.760\nI mean come on. This is a good question actually first of all, let me just say as a disclaimer because I have a daytime show\n\n01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.000\nDon't do drugs. Um, I don't do drugs during the daytime. You'll go to sleep\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000\nYou won't watch your show ruins your night\n\n01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:19.200\nBut I do feel like it's interesting because for me when I was growing up and I did stuff\n\n01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:24.720\nBecause that's what you do when you're a teenager and a young adult that heroin was the line for me\n\n01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.160\nAnd and it was interesting. I was afraid of it\n\n01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:32.280\nI'd friends it did it and I'd friends it that shot up and I remember thinking like oh everything else\n\n01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:35.280\nI can kind of like play with but that's the thing I could never\n\n01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:37.760\nExactly needles\n\n01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.320\nThere's no needles yeah, no needles that was like the thing that you thought that you thought like if you watch like I don't know\n\n01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:50.320\nCristiana for any of the movies about hair. Oh, yeah, I'm just very fancy that\n\n01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:56.120\nLike there were a few of those movies that you felt like that if I try that I'm like I'm I'm all in right like\n\n01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.680\nI won't pull back. So is that why you didn't try it?\n\n01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:04.440\nThat's exactly it. I just always thought that was a line that I didn't want to be a part of and you guys knew each other the whole time\n\n01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.200\nIt's you you the I didn't know him snored a heroin\n\n01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:12.520\nNot that night that night. We were doing that. I want to talk about this now because it's a fascinating leg\n\n01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:17.160\nWe got you know, I mean I've tried it, but that was the end of it. It's like try that. Oh, that's a lot of fun\n\n01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:20.680\nDon't do heroin. That's a lot of fun. Maybe I shouldn't do that. I might\n\n01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.440\nAnd then Dan don't do heroin. I'm sober. I don't I don't do drugs or\n\n01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:35.120\nIn life at this moment, I'm sober also, but\n\n01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:42.600\nI'm sorry, but a valuable line of questioning like so so can we talk like you see you and Dave is also clean as well right now\n\n01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:50.720\nYes, yes, how did you encounter heroin and you you you snorted it you never you never I never shot it up.

She wrote\n\n01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:20.400\nParties at his old house\n\n01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.960\nPeople are throwing parties at will chamberlain's house after he had died\n\n01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:30.320\nOkay, all right, okay, and like all this stuff with it's still there is his clothes\n\n01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:36.000\nAnd he had an orgy room an absolute fact with a waterbed God\n\n01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.920\nHe was like a circular room with the mirrors and a waterbed in the center and some of them was too many two-way mirrors\n\n01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:47.600\nWell, that was what and I did do drugs there, but what can't you know you're at the time?\n\n01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:51.920\nYou saw some something happening in the pool outside\n\n01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:56.800\nYeah, actually at the pool he had a you should get this kind of place\n\n01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:02.520\nIt had a swimming pool that you could enter from inside the house. You don't know that I don't have that that is true\n\n01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:06.320\nOr from what we hear about him he should but he had a\n\n01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.400\nSwing pool that you could get in and it had a you know a grotto and everything and there was a\n\n01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.880\nThe grotto is where the herpes is there was a girl\n\n01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:19.560\nThere were two girls that were kind of going at it and there was a third guy. There was a third person a guy who was\n\n01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:22.160\nGoing down on the girls and he was on his cell phone\n\n01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:26.960\nIn the phone going down on the girls at the same time\n\n01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.280\nWas it old school phone? Was it iPhone? Oh, he has he can pour champagne on\n\n01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:44.000\nIf I got to the point where I was eating that much pussy, I would cast that wide a nut I'd be like hello wait\n\n01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:48.600\nWe'll tell you\n\n01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:52.200\nThat was a good party for some pancakes and a breakfast burrito\n\n01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:59.080\nIs calling they're like hey J.J. Abrams wants you to eat a pussy\n\n01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:02.720\nOn the Batman set\n\n01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.960\nWell, okay, but I was a pussy\n\n01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:13.120\nI guess I guess I'm obsessed with this like the reason why I'm asking is because\n\n01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:25.160\nWe're older we've done everything that we want you have done something that you have done something that I've never done you've you've you've\n\n01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:33.680\nBroach to breach this threshold where you it didn't involve needles which the rest of us go like oh needles\n\n01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:37.440\nThat's where I'll draw the line, but it's not true. It starts with\n\n01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:45.840\nHeroin is like a thing you can snort. I I I the reason why I actually am interested in hearing you talk about us to know where to get it\n\n01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:53.840\nNo, that's no where to get it is is because we you know because like like we the legacy is like Nancy Reagan going\n\n01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:59.600\nEverybody say no, but the thing is like you're like like we're hanging out like it would be valuable\n\n01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:05.520\nActually, if you go here's what the high is like here's what happens after that\n\n01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.600\nWell, whatever like it doesn't have to be\n\n01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:14.720\nI guess PSA I mean yeah, but if you're gonna go there like to for heroin or crack or whatever\n\n01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:18.480\nThat wasn't the first thing that you were doing something led to that. It was like, okay\n\n01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.040\nI'm drunk now. I got to do this and I got to do that not take it to the next\n\n01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:27.800\nSo yeah, it's always yeah, so who knows the first time I did I think it was itchy and like I you know was constipated\n\n01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:29.400\nAnd then I\n\n01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:36.200\nSo what is what I talked about this with Dave too, which was like the difference between someone who try look lots of people\n\n01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:39.480\nNever ever try drugs or drink recreationally never have an issue, right?\n\n01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:45.800\nSome people fall into that well and they have to dig their way back out and everybody who hasn't fallen into that well and\n\n01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:50.680\nWorries about it wonders. What was the thing that made you fall all the way down?\n\n01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.560\nAnd I guess the question I asked him was what like what was that feeling?\n\n01:54:55.560 --> 01:55:03.040\nWhat was that thing and he said look I just think some people are predisposed to falling and some people are not and and and\n\n01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.720\nMaybe the question also was like what was the appeal?\n\n01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:08.240\nWhat was the moment? What was the thing that you thought?\n\n01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:12.160\nOkay, I'm gonna go all the way in versus the rest of us and I think there are a lot of people like\n\n01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:14.880\nOh, I got high in high school or I smoked up every once in a while in the weekends\n\n01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.720\nOr I have a medicinal marijuana card and I get a brownie every once in a while, but I'm not you know\n\n01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:21.400\nYeah, okay that guy right there loves dope\n\n01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:27.760\nBut you didn't go all the way in I think that's what's interesting you did go all the way in because they're sober now\n\n01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.320\nNo, no, no, he just stopped working, you know\n\n01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:34.920\nYeah, but mostly booze booze is the thing that took me down\n\n01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:37.760\nI'd like the drugs are just so I could do drink more and\n\n01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:40.520\nYeah, I just hit a wall and said I can't do this anymore\n\n01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:43.080\nAnd I thought it would be really difficult to not do that\n\n01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:48.120\nYou do a program thing or do you just do it on your own that that needs to know where your meeting is\n\n01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.600\nYeah, I could take you yeah well\n\n01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:54.080\nBy saying I'm not supposed to talk about it. You can figure it out by the name\n\n01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:01.720\nBut I mean I wouldn't trade all the years of partying for the world it was fantastic and a lot of fun\n\n01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.320\nBut it's also a lot of fun not doing that too\n\n01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:07.840\nDo you find because I I felt like that asshole\n\n01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:12.420\nI felt like that cousin or that aunt or that grandmother with Dave when we had this conversation where I was like\n\n01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:19.860\nAlmost asking the question of like tell me what not to do. Do you know what I mean like I'll do it all. Yeah, well\n\n01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:22.380\nYeah\n\n01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:24.460\nI think drugs and alcohol are fantastic\n\n01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:31.980\nThey're fucking wonderful, but it's just it's now it's the time not at some point it worked and then it didn't work\n\n01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:36.420\nWell, you get older and then if you feel shittier and then like it's just you know\n\n01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:40.260\nYou want to go out and do cool shit and it's just not I wasn't able to do that\n\n01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:45.180\nThat's the bummer right like in your 20s. You can just go all night and rally on 45 minutes\n\n01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:49.100\nAnd then you turn 35 and you're like, oh should I have that second glass of red wine? Oh\n\n01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:53.500\nThink I'm having a heart attack like that literally is the thing like all of a sudden you're like\n\n01:56:54.620 --> 01:57:01.340\nActually the reason why I cuz I had done the cocaine's in the past and and why those canes\n\n01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:07.460\nNo, but why I stopped was actually I thought I had tonight is really bad because it was making my ears ring terribly\n\n01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:13.940\nAnd I and I honestly was like you I was doing so much coke that your ears were ringing. Yeah, you're rich\n\n01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:19.100\nNo, but I honestly that like that that was like I was like this is\n\n01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:21.820\nIs your dealer a Christian a guy?\n\n01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:23.900\nOddly no\n\n01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:26.380\nMine really was cuz I got those bells, you know\n\n01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:29.140\nbut anyways, I mean, but but it was like\n\n01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:35.620\nThat there you go more than like anything else like I was like I can't even I'm like laying here\n\n01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:40.620\nI'm feeling like I just want to do a fucking concert and it's like I can't deal so\n\n01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:45.780\nSee, let's do that. No more. I just have a hard enough time. So I just smoke a lot of weed without drugs\n\n01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:47.780\nYou know what I mean? I mean, it's like\n\n01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:54.580\nAbout like what knowing like what that what this the essential knowledge of knowing that you're gonna die does to you\n\n01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:56.020\nRight like it we were talking about this in the show\n\n01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:59.940\nIt does different things to different people for some people it does the thing where you think well\n\n01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:04.940\nI'm just gonna burn this place to the ground. I don't care like I'm gonna wreck my body. I'm I'm gonna wreck my soul\n\n01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:08.000\nI'm gonna go crazy. That's so much fun. Yeah, that's not like a good time\n\n01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:12.460\nThat sounds great. Some people you're friend. They're like, I'm vegan and I'm gonna\n\n01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:19.820\nIt's getting fucked up on reality, right? Yeah, you can't see me. I'm hiding and you're seeking me, right?\n\n01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:27.020\nI mean like everybody kind of has this different response. I'm gonna get wasted. I'm gonna only drink green juice and sleep 10 hours a day\n\n01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:29.020\nI'm going to\n\n01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:33.340\nJump out of planes. I mean like all of that is a response to mortality rain juice\n\n01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:39.220\nYou mean water? Green juice green juice. Like your friend, like your friend that's a vegan that always drinks their fucking green juice\n\n01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:45.060\nSome people can't just do things normally like even like if and I if I don't put that stuff in my body anymore\n\n01:58:45.060 --> 01:58:48.820\nI have a house full of Star Wars toys that I can start buying or I got like you know\n\n01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:51.460\nIt's like it's it's just artists that do this\n\n01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:57.260\nDo you think it's just or not just artists but like a certain kind of artistic mentality or you like I've got to go crazy on something\n\n01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:05.140\nAt the booze music art obsessive compulsive behavior, you know, it's other things and he's got a channel in it into one\n\n01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:12.060\nOne area, you know like I feel that there's a need to say I got to exhaust everything that I get into\n\n01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:17.380\nYeah, because like we're all gonna die. I think that could be a good thing that I think you're gonna do it do it, right?\n\n01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:28.900\nYeah, the whole time we're talking I just look it over these two just like looking to the like yeah, right, okay?\n\n01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:32.140\nlisten\n\n01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:39.020\nIf there's kids listening and there are I don't let there be there always are I\n\n01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:41.620\nIs that your demographic?\n\n01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:49.020\nWhen the 80s we had an institutionalized policy which turned out to be very flawed where you just had this unilateral\n\n01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:56.500\nPolicy the the thing that we've never said is drugs exist people take them to feel good\n\n01:59:56.780 --> 02:00:01.140\nYou may have a different experience than anyone else has like\n\n02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:09.060\nThey are out there in the world and therefore it's up to you to know when you personally are\n\n02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:16.740\nRight are being hurt by them or are being simply consumed by them because your best friend might have a hollow leg\n\n02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:18.740\nSo so true so true\n\n02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:25.300\nNo, but I totally agree or like the idea that like not there's this is not a like a\n\n02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:29.700\nValidation of drug use I mean drugs are bad we even when they're good\n\n02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:36.540\nThey're still bad, but the idea is like know yourself and your and your sense of your place in the world and realize that like\n\n02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:41.820\nNo matter how many drugs you do you still have to be on this planet you still got to figure out who you are\n\n02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:43.820\nyou still got to live here and\n\n02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:45.740\nThe drugs are only gonna\n\n02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:51.500\nLike push that away for a moment like they don't fix the the essential nature of being human\n\n02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:56.780\nWhich is shit is fucked up and you've got to be here and that shit is painful and find a way through it\n\n02:00:56.780 --> 02:01:02.220\nThat doesn't involve exterior, you know, right influences and honestly gotta live like that's a deal\n\n02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:08.580\nIt's good.
