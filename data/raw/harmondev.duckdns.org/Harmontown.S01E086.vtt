00:00.000 --> 00:21.920
Hello, what and all, welcome once again, from Meltdown Comics, the NerdMelt Theater in

00:21.920 --> 00:25.920
Hollywood, California, Harmontown, is now in session.

00:25.920 --> 00:32.920
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:32.920 --> 00:44.920
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.520
A little nervous tonight, I don't know why.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.560
It's because that guy's got high standards.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.400
I could feel, I felt his needs when he walked in the door, the Woo guy.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.600
The Woo guy sounds like he's got very few needs.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.600
He's already that entertained.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.040
I'm looking at the other way around.

01:03.040 --> 01:07.880
I think he's acting that way because he feels like he's at a big time, it's time for him

01:07.880 --> 01:08.880
to be really entertained.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.360
Well, why don't you just entertain him?

01:10.360 --> 01:11.960
Why don't you knuckle down and do it?

01:11.960 --> 01:14.160
I will.

01:14.160 --> 01:22.080
Speaking of our lovable fans, I stopped for a drink at the pikes and as Aaron and I were

01:22.080 --> 01:31.520
walking back, we saw this dark, foreboding gang of street thugs, his kids, tufts, you

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
know?

01:32.520 --> 01:36.720
But then as they emerged through the street lights, more emo tufts.

01:36.720 --> 01:43.800
Oh, it's Harmontown fans, all of them, like five of them, but like, by my perception,

01:43.800 --> 01:49.800
all different combinations, like, so Anatoly was there, Matt Lansman, those are the two

01:49.800 --> 01:54.000
faces I saw, but for my social disorder caused me to just look at the sidewalk.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.640
Anatoly is wearing an Argyle sweater vest.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.200
You thought he was an emo tuft?

01:58.200 --> 02:01.080
I don't know, well, what's an emo tuft?

02:01.080 --> 02:02.480
I don't know what that is.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.480
You just invented it.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.480
It doesn't matter.

02:04.480 --> 02:09.360
It was a bunch of street tufts, a bunch of kids, I saw youthful posture, I saw a confident

02:09.360 --> 02:10.360
gate.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.600
Were they still in the weathered, or could you see that he was wearing a red Argyle

02:12.600 --> 02:13.600
sweater vest?

02:13.600 --> 02:14.960
No, I didn't see the red Argyle sweater.

02:14.960 --> 02:15.960
Okay.

02:15.960 --> 02:21.080
So, then it became clear it was like five Harmontown fans, all walking as like a throng.

02:21.080 --> 02:26.400
They were probably on their way to the pikey, I would guess, right, to get 7-Eleven, okay,

02:26.400 --> 02:30.080
to get five hour energies and blinky key chains or something.

02:30.080 --> 02:33.560
It's cool shit, like stuff that street kids do.

02:33.560 --> 02:39.240
But we walked past them and we were like, oh, Harmontown, Harmonians, that's what they

02:39.240 --> 02:40.240
were.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.120
We walked past them and then, but then something occurred to me, like it made me really laugh

02:44.120 --> 02:50.840
inside, that like, okay, so there's five guys, they're all like Harmontown fans.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.720
They probably met like hanging out here, I'm just going to hazard a guess, or there's probably

02:55.720 --> 02:59.840
groups of friends who did meet by coming to the show.

02:59.840 --> 03:06.960
What if five of them then robbed a bank?

03:06.960 --> 03:08.800
Or killed somebody or something?

03:08.800 --> 03:11.560
Are you worried about how this would reflect on you?

03:11.560 --> 03:17.040
I'm pretty delighted, I don't know, I'm just being like, how fun, how amazing would that

03:17.040 --> 03:18.040
be?

03:18.040 --> 03:19.040
How weird would that be?

03:19.040 --> 03:22.880
Remember after Columbine, when there's all this undue attention on Doom, the video game,

03:22.880 --> 03:26.760
you know, like there's always this ancillary thing, whatever, something happens.

03:26.760 --> 03:30.840
All friends get together in some way, they all have some common connection.

03:30.840 --> 03:36.480
Oh, those, they would be called the Harmontown robberies, because they all met, like,

03:36.480 --> 03:39.200
there would be pictures of them at the show.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.560
I think we can agree that's pretty unlikely, but I would like to plant that seed right

03:42.560 --> 03:43.560
now.

03:43.560 --> 03:49.840
It would be amazing, every group of people who ends up doing something historically horrible

03:49.840 --> 03:51.000
met somewhere.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.920
I think what we should do right now is, look, if the mood strikes any of you, commit a non-violence

03:56.920 --> 04:05.240
but high-profile crime, and wear an all-wear Harmontown hoodies, or do it with a bunch

04:05.240 --> 04:08.600
of people you've met at Harmontown so that's the thread, because then the cops and their

04:08.600 --> 04:12.720
statements, they're gonna see this word Harmontown, they're gonna circle it, they're gonna

04:12.720 --> 04:15.920
release a statement, and it's gonna be like the trench coat mafia, but it'll be like

04:15.920 --> 04:17.520
the Harmontown killers.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.320
No, not killers, robbers, burglars.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.840
But robbers, burglars, whatever.

04:21.840 --> 04:26.600
They're gonna be white-collar, non-violence, like, they're gonna rob from the rich.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.600
Are you worried about, you're worried about liability right now?

04:28.600 --> 04:30.960
I'm worried about being blown up by one of them.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.320
I worry about my own safety if it becomes violent.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.640
Speaking of violent crime, fantastic segue, great job.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.560
We did it.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.920
That's called accidental com-trolling.

04:42.920 --> 04:48.720
I often, you know, Twitter, there's, you know, you have 225,000 followers, you definitely

04:48.720 --> 04:54.240
every day someone says, someone tweets you and says, my baby daughter's getting a heart

04:54.240 --> 04:58.200
transplant or whatever, something heart-breaking and, you know, can you retweet and blah blah

04:58.200 --> 05:03.800
blah, and I kind of, so that I don't do it 24 hours a day, why am I qualifying this?

05:03.800 --> 05:04.800
What the fuck am I doing?

05:04.800 --> 05:10.200
I just like, there's all kinds of stuff like that, but those people like tweet at also

05:10.200 --> 05:15.560
Marc Maron or something like that, and I hope your daughter has a good heart transplant

05:15.560 --> 05:19.920
and all that stuff, but I also, if somebody's a big Harmontown fan, specifically somebody

05:19.920 --> 05:27.040
that I met on tour, this guy's brother tweeted me, and I promised him that I would mention

05:27.040 --> 05:28.200
it.

05:28.200 --> 05:35.480
His Twitter name, the brother, is mngravue, mng, with three Fs, said, Dan Harmon, my

05:35.480 --> 05:42.120
brother, a Armenian you met at your Portland stop, was jumped, beaten and stabbed and nearly

05:42.120 --> 05:44.680
died Wednesday in Seattle.

05:44.680 --> 05:50.720
Thursday in ICU, we watched the new episode, we loved the graceful exits for Troy Barnes

05:50.720 --> 05:51.720
and Pierce Hawthorne.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.160
Would you wish Jeff a get well at Harmontown, you're a hero to us, please, thanks.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.920
So of course, of course, Jeff, goddamn it, get well.

05:58.920 --> 06:12.640
He also said, thank you, Dan, when I responded to him, I said, I hope he's going to get better.

06:12.640 --> 06:16.880
Surgeons broke his sternum to fix his heart, so it would be a long recovery, and then he

06:16.880 --> 06:25.680
included a photo of us, like we met in Portland, not at the sternum.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.600
Yeah, that's what he said, sternum, they broke his sternum to fix his heart, and it was a

06:29.600 --> 06:36.760
link to a picture, and I clicked it very hesitatingly, and I'm like, well, I guess I deserve this.

06:36.760 --> 06:41.920
But it was the photo that we took together, the brothers, and I'm assuming from the hashtag

06:41.920 --> 06:49.400
tough ginger that the kid in question, Jeff, is probably the curly redhead on the right

06:49.400 --> 06:53.480
of the picture, and boy, there's not a lot of people who look like they deserve to be

06:53.480 --> 07:01.720
stabbed, but this kid looks the least like he deserves to be.

07:01.720 --> 07:07.840
We all thought you were going the other way on that one, I would have stabbed this cocksucker.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.200
It's like you're looking for something, like, oh, I can see why he got stabbed, look at

07:12.200 --> 07:18.360
that hat, this kid looks like he's just adorable, he looks like a little angel, so Jeff, if

07:18.360 --> 07:23.960
you're able to be listening to this, our prayers and good vibes are with you here at Harmon

07:23.960 --> 07:24.960
Town.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.040
Tell your doctors to stop breaking your sternum.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.520
No, they had to.

07:28.520 --> 07:29.520
Did they?

07:29.520 --> 07:30.520
They had to fix his fucking heart.

07:30.520 --> 07:31.520
Can you imagine?

07:31.520 --> 07:32.520
Jesus Christ.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.520
Wow.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.520
Maybe they broke his sternum.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.520
Maybe they broke his sternum, and they said that after the fact.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.520
They're like mechanics.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.520
You're going to make a heart omelette.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
You got to break a couple.

07:41.520 --> 07:46.520
Yeah, I don't know, man, your sternum is all in the way of your heart, you should have

07:46.520 --> 07:47.520
brought it in.

07:47.520 --> 07:48.520
More often.

07:48.520 --> 07:58.200
It makes sense because mechanics get away with almost literal murder because none of

07:58.200 --> 08:02.880
us know anything about cars, way less of us know anything about the human body.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.560
So how do you trust these fucking doctors?

08:04.560 --> 08:05.560
Fuck them.

08:05.560 --> 08:09.360
I'm sorry, Jeff, you should trust your doctors in intensive care.

08:09.360 --> 08:14.000
You should trust that they know what they're doing.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.320
All right, so I don't know, there's a couple things I wanted to talk about, but I think

08:19.320 --> 08:20.760
we should bring up our guests first.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.760
Let's do that.

08:21.760 --> 08:26.520
Because maybe we can talk about it with some of them if we're lacking for conversation.

08:26.520 --> 08:33.840
So Allie Ward and Georgia Hartstarch, they're known as Allie and Georgia, commonly, and

08:33.840 --> 08:36.520
I asked them in the last names in the green room.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.920
They're on the Feral Audio Network, would you figure that, Jeff?

08:39.920 --> 08:42.840
Did you know that Feral Audio is a network?

08:42.840 --> 08:45.080
I'd be jiggered if I knew that.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.040
Their podcast is called Slumber Party, and they did have a show on the cooking channel

08:49.040 --> 08:54.440
called Tripping Out, and they're known for making insane cocktails like the McNuggettini.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.440
What?

08:55.440 --> 08:56.440
You can ask them about it if you want.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.240
I'm fucking going to.

08:58.240 --> 09:03.440
Sometimes I just read the blurb that I get too, but here's why they're really coming

09:03.440 --> 09:07.520
out because they're going to start doing their podcast live, and their first live podcast

09:07.520 --> 09:13.680
is at the Hollywood Improv, Wednesday the 29th, and their first guest is Dan Harmon.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.960
That sounds exciting to me.

09:14.960 --> 09:15.960
Is he in town?

09:15.960 --> 09:16.960
Yeah.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.480
So let's bring them up.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.720
Allie and Georgia, come on out.

09:20.720 --> 09:21.720
Sit where you like.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.720
Do what you like.

09:22.720 --> 09:38.440
Sorry, I called one of you Hearthstark before.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.000
I get worse than that.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Nervous tonight.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
I don't know why.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
It's because of the woo guy.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I don't know.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.920
You said you were nervous before the guy wooed, and I just compounded it.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.480
I think it may be because we didn't do shows in so long.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.560
We went to Scotland, and we came back.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.240
Last week's show, I wasn't a blackout drunk.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.240
I won't listen to it.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.240
I don't.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.240
We talked about gender for three hours.

09:59.240 --> 10:04.040
I'd like to say a quick apology to all listeners that still listen to us after that show, because

10:04.040 --> 10:08.560
that show was...

10:08.560 --> 10:09.560
Allie and Georgia.

10:09.560 --> 10:14.840
Three unqualified lunatics talking about an issue they neither know anything about or

10:14.840 --> 10:17.440
have any fucking stake in the fucking...

10:17.440 --> 10:18.440
Wow.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.440
Nor an issue that is...

10:19.440 --> 10:23.360
I was going to say, you have double vaginas up here if you need to revisit any gender stuff.

10:23.360 --> 10:27.120
Well, we combined it's like maybe one and a half to three.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.800
But you guys said you enjoyed it, and you have vaginas, and we have all of those.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.840
I enjoyed those without vaginas talking about the people with vaginas.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.680
I don't think the lack of vagina was what disqualified us.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.920
It was a lack of intellectual assertion.

10:41.920 --> 10:42.920
We were just...

10:42.920 --> 10:45.840
It was rudderless, meaningless, garbage.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.880
Yeah, I just kind of blunder into that room and just go like, can you believe black men

10:49.880 --> 10:51.400
had the vote before white women?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.400
That's crazy.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.400
Good night.

10:53.400 --> 10:59.160
And then I go home and sleep like a baby, and then all races and all genders are like,

10:59.160 --> 11:00.160
what the fuck?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.160
What?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.040
And we're like, what do you...

11:03.040 --> 11:04.040
What did you mean?

11:04.040 --> 11:07.320
We're making this up, and we misspeak a lot.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.320
You say the wrong thing.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.320
You misquote something.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.320
That's going to happen.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.320
That's fine.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
It's going to happen to anybody.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
That doesn't bother me.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.080
I didn't...I mean, I never listened to our shows.

11:16.080 --> 11:20.120
I would never listen to that one again, simply from my own sense of well-being.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.360
I listened to almost all of them.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.360
There's some that I...

11:23.360 --> 11:25.120
It has mostly to do with alcohol intake.

11:25.120 --> 11:28.000
I feel like if I get off stage and I'm like, I don't even remember how that show went,

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
but I don't listen to it.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.040
Yeah, but you can have drunk vodka all day long and come up here and have an incredible

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
facility.

11:35.040 --> 11:39.520
You can be quite lucid even though I know, because I know you, that you're Steamboat Willie

11:39.520 --> 11:40.520
drunk.

11:40.520 --> 11:47.080
Yeah, but that night seemed to be extra special, like swirly and like...

11:47.080 --> 11:49.680
I think I had been drinking for two days or something.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.680
I don't know.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.680
Let's talk to the ladies.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.680
What?

11:52.680 --> 11:53.680
How'd you get anything different?

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
Yeah, well, had you read like an...

11:54.680 --> 11:56.840
I had you seen like a blurb about feminism or something?

11:56.840 --> 11:57.840
Like what precipitated it?

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
Well, no.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.840
Some guy sent us a book.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
I remember that vaguely.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.840
I remember that.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.840
Yeah, I remember that it was...

12:02.840 --> 12:03.840
It took a giant shit on him.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.840
That poor guy.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.840
That poor guy.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
Mine was simply on format.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
I didn't even read his stuff.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.400
I'm sure he's great, but his publisher can go second.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.400
I don't know.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
No, I have no idea how we got on the topic.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.400
I mean, you listened to it.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.400
I did.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.400
Yeah.

12:15.400 --> 12:19.400
I mean, I just, I learned not to send you a book, which is fine.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.400
I hadn't planned on it anyway.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.400
So, we're good.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.400
We're in the clear.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.400
And yeah, I learned that...

12:23.400 --> 12:28.000
Well, I revisited the thought that machines replace slavery, which is always...

12:28.000 --> 12:31.640
And then, of course, there's us with all of our dumb iPhones that are made essentially

12:31.640 --> 12:32.640
by slaves.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.640
And that's a whole other story.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.640
But whatever.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.640
So...

12:35.640 --> 12:36.640
God, I touched on that slavery.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.640
Can I just open up with Chicken McNuggettini?

12:39.640 --> 12:40.640
Sure.

12:40.640 --> 12:41.640
I would love for you to open up.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.640
Yeah.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.640
Tell me a little bit about this.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.640
Oh, no.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.640
Does that...

12:45.640 --> 12:46.640
Okay.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.640
Well, that's how we monetized our friendship.

12:47.640 --> 12:48.640
Yeah.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.640
Pretty much.

12:49.640 --> 12:50.640
Yeah.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.640
We, like, have this inside joke between the two of us.

12:51.640 --> 12:55.520
We were best friends and we'd go out at late at night and drink and we had hard jobs

12:55.520 --> 12:56.520
and...

12:56.520 --> 12:57.520
Yeah.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
We had...

12:58.520 --> 12:59.520
I was actually a writer at the LA Times.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.880
And so, I would be there until the lights turned off and I'd have to call the power

13:02.880 --> 13:04.560
room and be like, can you turn it back on?

13:04.560 --> 13:08.360
And I was a receptionist, so I had to say yes to white men a lot.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.360
Yeah.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.360
I was a white man.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.360
I had to be like, smile.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
And that's really hard, you guys.

13:12.360 --> 13:16.560
She would g-chat me and she'd be like, ugh, they asked me to fax something.

13:16.560 --> 13:21.840
I'm right in the middle of, like, the fourth episode of whatever, and she hated it.

13:21.840 --> 13:26.600
And so, we always had this joke where we wanted to go out for a McNuggettini after work because

13:26.600 --> 13:29.880
it would take care of dinner and a drink and dessert, and then we could just go back to

13:29.880 --> 13:30.880
bed and...

13:30.880 --> 13:31.880
Get it out of the way.

13:31.880 --> 13:32.880
And then suffer again in the morning.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.880
And so, we had this joke and I think we posted on each other's MySpace pages at the time.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.080
We had a McNuggettini, and then we're like, what if we actually did this, what would it

13:40.080 --> 13:41.080
taste like?

13:41.080 --> 13:43.800
And it was just this long standing joke between the two of us, and finally we're like, well,

13:43.800 --> 13:44.800
let's do it.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.680
It was like a Pegasus, that you're like, does it exist?

13:46.680 --> 13:47.680
Let's make it.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.680
So, how do you make it?

13:48.680 --> 13:53.200
Well, so then we had our friend Peter Tensio, who's the really funny comedy director, but

13:53.200 --> 13:54.200
he then didn't.

13:54.200 --> 13:58.960
Yeah, he was making things for super deluxe, and they paid him in packets of oatmeal, and

13:58.960 --> 14:03.040
he'd still worked with them, but now he directs Key and Peele, so we managed to get in on the

14:03.040 --> 14:04.040
ground floor there.

14:04.040 --> 14:08.720
And he made a video for us of us making this drink, and it involves, which is like all

14:08.720 --> 14:11.760
manner of horrible, just in every scale.

14:11.760 --> 14:17.200
It's a McDonald's milkshake chocolate, and then you add vanilla vodka to it, and you

14:17.200 --> 14:19.880
shake it lightly, and then you pour it into a martini glass.

14:19.880 --> 14:23.840
That's been rimmed in the McDonald's barbecue sauce, and then you pour it in.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.840
So, no actual McNugget?

14:24.840 --> 14:25.840
No, no.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.840
No, not done yet.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.840
Oh, you put one on the rim.

14:27.840 --> 14:31.840
It's perched on the side as a garnish is a McNuggettini.

14:31.840 --> 14:40.280
So wait, chocolate milkshake, vanilla vodka, no, I'm just barfing.

14:40.280 --> 14:46.600
With a rim of barbecue sauce, and I'm imagining like you would put an olive garnish or an

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
onion on a Gibson.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
Yeah.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.360
A chicken McNuggettini, resting gently across the...

14:51.360 --> 14:53.800
On the rim, so you slice it down the side a little bit.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.800
Yeah.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.800
Oh, I see, like a lemon.

14:55.800 --> 14:56.800
Yeah, a lemon.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.000
So then you drink it, and you have to get through the barbecue sauce, and then when

15:00.000 --> 15:04.160
you're done with it, you swipe the McNuggettini around the rim and eat it.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.560
And it's like, you know, when you dip french fries in like a milkshake, it's like, you

15:07.560 --> 15:08.560
know, have you ever...

15:08.560 --> 15:09.560
It actually sounds so bad.

15:09.560 --> 15:13.160
I've heard of worse foods than that, and there's a hilarious, like, Greg Prupp's

15:13.160 --> 15:15.840
seven pleas, if you have not done this.

15:15.840 --> 15:20.640
Go read, there's a New York Times restaurant review of Guy Fieri's Times Square.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.640
That's amazing.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.640
Times Square.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.640
Have you read this review?

15:23.640 --> 15:24.640
Yeah.

15:24.640 --> 15:25.640
Who had it?

15:25.640 --> 15:34.040
Absolutely, buys 15 machine guns, loads them up, and just blazes that restaurant to pieces

15:34.040 --> 15:35.280
in this review.

15:35.280 --> 15:40.000
It's an absolute assassination of this restaurant.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.840
I love that New York Times even went to Guy Fieri's...

15:42.840 --> 15:43.840
What's it called?

15:43.840 --> 15:44.840
Bros and tits?

15:44.840 --> 15:45.840
Yeah.

15:45.840 --> 15:46.840
Bros and tits and anus is who it is.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.840
Do you know what's weird about it?

15:47.840 --> 15:48.840
Yeah.

15:48.840 --> 15:52.840
It actually kind of made me want to go with it, like, that article made me be like, well,

15:52.840 --> 15:53.840
I got to see this.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.840
Cut your name in?

15:54.840 --> 15:59.040
Like, it sounds like a miniature golf course of food, just like things in rock scales and

15:59.040 --> 16:00.040
confusing.

16:00.040 --> 16:04.120
If on that menu or anywhere, if you'd said it's the chicken McNugget, teeny, and you

16:04.120 --> 16:10.000
said it's a McDonald's chocolate milkshake with vanilla vodka, a barbecue sauce rim

16:10.000 --> 16:16.800
glass, and a slice of chicken McNugget on the rim, that would sell like gross McDonald's

16:16.800 --> 16:17.800
hotcakes.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.800
Well, here's the first one.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.320
So have you sold this in Nessie?

16:20.320 --> 16:23.920
No, we haven't, because we have just a tiny bit of pride left.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
So we haven't ever sold it.

16:24.920 --> 16:29.440
But what happened was that this video went viral and we were like, oh, shit, because

16:29.440 --> 16:31.320
we didn't mean to be known for this.

16:31.320 --> 16:35.160
Like, I studied so hard in school, there's so many times where we'll do, like, we'll

16:35.160 --> 16:39.240
be doing something and that Allie will be like, Magna Colana, like, we'll be like,

16:39.240 --> 16:41.240
so, this is your penicillin.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.560
Yeah, this is, yeah, this was my accident, like, this was, this was my moldy dish after

16:45.560 --> 16:46.560
vacation.

16:46.560 --> 16:49.760
It was my, it was like this weird accident, it's like a baby that you're like, let's

16:49.760 --> 16:50.760
not abort it.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.200
And then we just have raised it and who occurred to go to college.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.880
So my parents are stoked that, like, I have a career.

16:55.880 --> 17:00.960
Now, when you both made these, this was a joint, like, collaboration on the, and...

17:00.960 --> 17:05.480
Yeah, so since then, it was like, 2009, we've made a fucking career out of this, we quit

17:05.480 --> 17:07.240
our jobs and like, this is our...

17:07.240 --> 17:11.600
We ended up, it went viral and then the New York Times contacted us and they're like,

17:11.600 --> 17:15.040
we'd like to do a feature story, can you fly out to New York so we can interview you.

17:15.040 --> 17:20.240
And we both collectively lost our shit and then Food Network offered us a contract, so

17:20.240 --> 17:21.240
we would...

17:21.240 --> 17:22.240
Because of that?

17:22.240 --> 17:27.960
Well, here's why, because it sounds just ridiculous enough to be awesome.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.160
Jeff, you're being impolite to our guests.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.400
No, I'm saying, no, I'm sharing their incredulity, right?

17:33.400 --> 17:36.960
I know, but well, you shouldn't share people's incredulity about their success, you should

17:36.960 --> 17:37.960
let them be incredulous.

17:37.960 --> 17:38.960
No, it's fucking ridiculous.

17:38.960 --> 17:43.320
And you should assure them that it's for a reason, so that's, that's just like taking

17:43.320 --> 17:44.320
their coat.

17:44.320 --> 17:48.880
I'm saying that I'm certain, I'm certain that they proved them they're, they're worthiness

17:48.880 --> 17:54.200
outside of that, that that's a hilarious thing to become family.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.200
They're world-class fellatrices.

17:55.200 --> 18:01.640
Well, I want to talk to you guys about, about podcasting because you've, for a very long

18:01.640 --> 18:06.120
time now in the Farrell Audio Network, which is an amazing network, you've been doing,

18:06.120 --> 18:12.880
I don't know how else, like, I don't know what the terminology is, like, in terms of

18:12.880 --> 18:16.520
sitcoms, there's single camera and multi-camera, which means there's an audience, like there's

18:16.520 --> 18:20.240
an audience here, there's not an audience, you guys have been doing the not an audience

18:20.240 --> 18:24.680
one for a while, have you, and now you're, you're gonna, are you just shifting gears

18:24.680 --> 18:28.400
entirely, bailing on the non-audience and doing the audience thing now?

18:28.400 --> 18:29.400
No way.

18:29.400 --> 18:35.040
No, I think we just want a more immediate form of validation, so we're going to, I mean,

18:35.040 --> 18:39.080
we've done it with an audience of Dustin, the producer, who's just out, like, right

18:39.080 --> 18:42.880
outside the pillow fort, and if we say something really disgusting, we'll hear him wince.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.960
Yeah, like, you get Dustin to laugh outside the pillow fort, like, you can hear his whole

18:46.960 --> 18:47.960
body.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.960
Well, how heavily did you edit?

18:48.960 --> 18:53.840
Because, like, I went through all these phases with this thing where we would record this

18:53.840 --> 18:57.280
and then I would sit with, you know, try to schedule a time with Dustin and go through

18:57.280 --> 19:01.520
it, and then we'd be sitting there in Pro Tools or whatever, Logic or Square Five or

19:01.520 --> 19:07.120
whatever the fuck kids use, and going like, oh, well, that was, that kind of doesn't really

19:07.120 --> 19:10.920
go anywhere, so let's, let's, let's bring up that laugh and do all those things, and

19:10.920 --> 19:14.600
we tried to minimize the dishonesty, and like, I was trying to keep it to 90 minutes, all

19:14.600 --> 19:15.600
that stuff.

19:15.600 --> 19:19.600
The more emails I got, or Tumblr messages about people that were just going, you know

19:19.600 --> 19:25.520
what, I, I listened to your podcast while I'm welding a mechanical bowl at work, I listened

19:25.520 --> 19:30.120
to your podcast while I'm driving to and from work, I, they, it became very clear that part

19:30.120 --> 19:35.160
of the format was that the, the, the people that really gobble it up, what they prefer

19:35.160 --> 19:42.440
more is a timely schedule than a finely edited masterpiece, and so we just stopped editing

19:42.440 --> 19:43.440
at a certain point.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.720
That makes total sense, and I don't like to listen to myself talk, so if I'm saying,

19:46.720 --> 19:50.320
if I'm on doing the podcast and I say something like racist or like shitty that I know is

19:50.320 --> 19:54.760
bad, I'm like, not that I ever did, Dustin, like, that, take that out, but like, I won't

19:54.760 --> 19:59.720
go back and listen to it, and our best, our best, like, episodes have been our solo episodes

19:59.720 --> 20:05.560
and we're, because we're best friends, we know fucking everything about each other,

20:05.560 --> 20:06.560
buttons to push.

20:06.560 --> 20:09.200
So the best episodes are when we're just totally candid and like,

20:09.200 --> 20:11.240
Have you guys ever been in like a, like an actual fight?

20:11.240 --> 20:12.240
So many.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.240
So many.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.240
Oh my God.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:17.640 --> 20:21.240
I locked her out of a hotel room in New Orleans, but I mean, that was the worst thing that

20:21.240 --> 20:22.240
ever happened.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.240
I broke into the hotel room in New Orleans.

20:23.240 --> 20:27.520
She busted through the fucking door, and I was like, oh, how did you get through a door?

20:27.520 --> 20:28.520
Did you kick her?

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
I was like, there's a monster.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.520
A monster outside?

20:30.520 --> 20:34.040
This is the thing, when they put the door, like, the lock thing on the door.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.640
When they, meaning Ally, who's locking her down.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.200
I watched your crime constantly.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.200
The little hingey one?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.200
Yeah, the hingey one.

20:40.200 --> 20:45.200
If you take a credit card or the room, whatever, and you slide it through, like, it'll open

20:45.200 --> 20:46.200
it up.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.200
Good to know.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.680
My favorite thing about that is, don't rape anyone.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.400
Everyone's groaning because you just armed a million.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.400
Yeah.

20:53.400 --> 20:58.760
But my favorite thing about that is that the idea that amidst of a drunken hotel fight,

20:58.760 --> 21:04.840
one person will do something as delicate as threading a needle, and then I'm sure you're

21:04.840 --> 21:09.360
right back to, fuck you bitch, I thought I was so smart, and really I should have just

21:09.360 --> 21:12.840
gone and sat down and had some water, and everything would have been fine, but I was

21:12.840 --> 21:13.840
like, I got her.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.840
So where did you pick that up?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.480
Like, watching Dog the Bounty Hunter?

21:16.480 --> 21:21.400
No, I watched, I obsessively watched shows about, like, people who have been, have murdered

21:21.400 --> 21:22.400
people.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.400
Like, obsessively.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.400
48 hours.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.400
Yes.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.400
Oh my God.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.400
All of that is front-line.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.400
Hence I locked the hotel room door when Jordan is drunk.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.480
Wait, so the little, the little hingy one with the little thing that slides in and kind

21:31.480 --> 21:33.680
of locks in, you can, you can put a credit card through that?

21:33.680 --> 21:36.920
You put a credit card and like, kind of slide the hinge off.

21:36.920 --> 21:37.920
Oh.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.920
It's so easy.

21:38.920 --> 21:39.920
Life hacking.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.920
This is why I put, yeah.

21:40.920 --> 21:41.920
This is why I put a...

21:41.920 --> 21:42.920
This is why I put a...

21:42.920 --> 21:45.920
Also, you get a Mountain Dew bottle, makes a great silencer.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
And it's also the thing...

21:47.920 --> 21:48.920
There's...

21:48.920 --> 21:49.920
Crazy.

21:49.920 --> 21:54.920
Yeah, you put a pillow inside a Mountain Dew bottle, it has to be Mountain Dew for some

21:54.920 --> 21:55.920
reason though.

21:55.920 --> 22:00.040
Like, if you hold certain buttons down and certain elevators and you just, you bypass

22:00.040 --> 22:01.720
all the other floors, if you want to go straight down.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.280
Whoa, I did not know this.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.120
Yeah, if you hold the door, open or close button, and hit a thing, and the floor you're

22:07.120 --> 22:10.640
going to, it just goes, fire departments use it to get in places.

22:10.640 --> 22:15.280
So now I tell the world that, so that the fire department, so people die.

22:15.280 --> 22:20.000
But if you hold it down a second too long, you end up on a special floor where the elevator

22:20.000 --> 22:22.400
master goes, who brought you here?

22:22.400 --> 22:25.640
We have no way of knowing.

22:25.640 --> 22:28.360
You have come up, but you can never go down.

22:28.360 --> 22:32.160
You're just in a shitty, like, adjustment bureau movie.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.160
What slumber party?

22:34.160 --> 22:35.160
Okay.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.160
Oh.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.160
What?

22:37.160 --> 22:38.160
Oh, sorry.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.160
I was asking about slumber parties.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.160
We're like, murderers, and slumber parties.

22:41.160 --> 22:46.080
Yeah, we have a slumber party podcast, so we get in pajamas because it's comfortable,

22:46.080 --> 22:47.080
and then we get people in a little...

22:47.080 --> 22:50.360
Slumber parties that no one until now has been able to see, like, you guys have actually

22:50.360 --> 22:51.360
pitched a tent.

22:51.360 --> 22:52.360
We do the pillow fort, we do the pajamas.

22:52.360 --> 22:55.600
You get in there, and you make the guests feel comfortable, and then you talk to them.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.120
And now you're going to start doing that in front of an audience, so there's challenges

22:59.120 --> 23:00.120
there.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
Right.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.120
Are there?

23:02.120 --> 23:03.120
Have you thought about them?

23:03.120 --> 23:04.120
No, no, actually.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.120
We haven't.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.120
No.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
Good thing I'll be your first guest.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.120
Thank you for being our first guest.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.080
Wait, so you're going to be the first live guest of the slumber party?

23:11.080 --> 23:12.080
Yeah.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.080
Are you going to wear PJs?

23:13.080 --> 23:14.080
Sounds like it.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.600
Can you wear, like, a little onesie or something?

23:16.600 --> 23:17.600
Yes.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
I have one.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.600
You do?

23:19.600 --> 23:21.200
I got one from Paramount for Christmas.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.200
It's like a red onesie.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.200
Can you wear that?

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
Slippers?

23:24.200 --> 23:25.680
Is it a union suit?

23:25.680 --> 23:26.680
It's a little button.

23:26.680 --> 23:30.000
Yeah, it looks like I want you to get off my moonshine.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.360
All right, should we shift focus and talk about constitutional law and Justin Bieber?

23:37.360 --> 23:38.360
Oh, yes.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.960
He's on that scissor.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.800
He's on that serp so bad.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.880
Jeff, what do you know about Justin Bieber?

23:45.880 --> 23:47.280
Very precious little.

23:47.280 --> 23:52.880
I do know that I was slipping channels and he is throwing the charges for egging his

23:52.880 --> 23:53.880
neighbors.

23:53.880 --> 23:58.800
Does anybody else in this audience have the immediate, do I have a personality disorder?

23:58.800 --> 23:59.800
Yes.

23:59.800 --> 24:06.520
Or within five seconds of those kairons, are you upset about search and seizure?

24:06.520 --> 24:12.280
Are you upset about, like, all I heard was everybody's laughing about, like, oh, I guess

24:12.280 --> 24:18.840
Justin Bieber egged his neighbor's house so the cops raided his house and found cocaine.

24:18.840 --> 24:19.840
What?

24:19.840 --> 24:23.080
Wait, back up a million steps in the fucking constitution.

24:23.080 --> 24:28.640
I know he's not American, but apparently either are we.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.640
What are you talking about?

24:29.640 --> 24:35.640
Oh, well, I guess he had surveillance cameras so they want to, that's self-incriminating.

24:35.640 --> 24:42.080
You can't, you can't, if I, I, I, look, I'm pretty sure if you search every house in

24:42.080 --> 24:45.680
California you're going to find some fucking cocaine.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.560
Let's just call that a given.

24:48.560 --> 24:53.920
Let's make the assumption that in the eyes of the fucking government, which is a shitty,

24:53.920 --> 25:00.280
joyless organization designed to govern, not to provide us with happiness, but to supposedly

25:00.280 --> 25:07.680
protect it, let's just assume that within the eyes of a faceless, inhuman organization

25:07.680 --> 25:13.160
like the government, every person's individual life is spent breaking the law.

25:13.160 --> 25:17.200
Let's assume that, that if you pull every car over, there's something nasty in their

25:17.200 --> 25:18.200
trunk.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.680
In any one's house, they got something that they're embarrassed about.

25:21.680 --> 25:26.560
That's why the founding fathers put a little concept in the goddamn constitution called

25:26.560 --> 25:28.080
fucking privacy.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.560
We have privacy.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.880
We have a right to be individuals.

25:32.880 --> 25:37.560
And when it comes to drugs, I think it's perfectly fine for a country with a gross national product

25:37.560 --> 25:43.040
to say, well, at our borders, we're going to try to, like, put a throttle on the amount

25:43.040 --> 25:47.040
of cocaine or heroin or whatever the, whatever the fuck their business is.

25:47.040 --> 25:51.520
So if you're living in a country that has less pantyhose or more potted ferns because

25:51.520 --> 25:55.920
your giant country made a social contract with some free trade agreement with some other

25:55.920 --> 25:57.960
country, hey, that's tough titties for you as an individual.

25:57.960 --> 26:05.080
You move countries or whatever, or you're trapped there and you have less pantyhose.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.200
So goes drugs.

26:06.200 --> 26:10.000
But I think the idea has always been that by the time a little bundle of cocaine gets

26:10.000 --> 26:15.400
into your front pocket at the local bar, you're allowed to have it.

26:15.400 --> 26:22.360
Like, you need to have done some fucked up shit before they're allowed to find that shit.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.280
And people can't kick in your door.

26:24.280 --> 26:27.120
Did they burst in or did they actually have access to the house?

26:27.120 --> 26:31.040
All I understood was that the kid egged a house.

26:31.040 --> 26:34.720
Obviously he's been a bit of an annoyance in his neighborhood.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.240
I have a feeling his neighbor is well hooked up.

26:37.240 --> 26:41.880
I picture his neighbor being like a guy like me, like a 41-year-old guy whose neighbor

26:41.880 --> 26:42.880
is Justin Bieber.

26:42.880 --> 26:50.240
Or has had it for 20 years and dines with cops and is like, fuck this fucking kid.

26:50.240 --> 26:54.600
You know what it kind of reminds me of is when you hear about people who were peeing

26:54.600 --> 27:09.080
in a bush, which is how we met, get arrested and then have sex crimes or what is it called?

27:09.080 --> 27:10.080
Thank you.

27:10.080 --> 27:14.880
They're on the sex offender registry because it's almost like a thing where they're like,

27:14.880 --> 27:17.080
come in for a free tour and then they try to sell you a condo.

27:17.080 --> 27:20.280
You're like, well, that's not really the same thing as that.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.400
And like, egging a fucking house, like if he really wanted to, he could have killed

27:23.400 --> 27:24.400
that guy.

27:24.400 --> 27:28.880
I saw a couple days ago, god, if Bieber just whacked somebody, that would be so good.

27:28.880 --> 27:32.880
What do you mean when you say if he really wanted to, he could have whacked that guy?

27:32.880 --> 27:38.280
I'm just saying like, egging a house is an innocent, simple way to get out your frustrations

27:38.280 --> 27:39.280
on this person.

27:39.280 --> 27:40.280
So why is this?

27:40.280 --> 27:41.280
Over a certain dollar amount of damage.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.280
Oh, I see what you're saying.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.280
Yeah.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.280
Yeah.

27:44.280 --> 27:48.440
Well, apparently there was $20,000 worth of damage, which is believable when you egg a

27:48.440 --> 27:49.440
rich person's house.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.680
And I saw this news item a couple of days ago, so I don't know what happened today, I guess

27:52.680 --> 27:53.680
today really.

27:53.680 --> 27:57.200
Oh, he's got, he's drinking copious amounts of cough syrup.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.200
Sweet.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.200
Which is so sad.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.200
Did people do that?

28:00.200 --> 28:01.200
Doesn't he have any cocaine on him?

28:01.200 --> 28:07.040
The impression that I got when I first watched it was that there was probably a bunch of

28:07.040 --> 28:12.040
people in his house, he throws parties, and people, maybe him included, maybe not, went

28:12.040 --> 28:15.680
and egged the neighbor's house, and then the cops came in like, hey, can we come in?

28:15.680 --> 28:16.680
Sure.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.680
And then there was somebody had cooked.

28:17.680 --> 28:18.680
Right.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.800
Now I think it was actually, I think it was on one of his entourage, little, little, little

28:21.800 --> 28:23.800
personal pizza, whatever his name is.

28:23.800 --> 28:24.800
Little personal pizza.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
That's it.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.800
Like one of his, one of his entourage is named Little Zahar.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.880
Did he cash a little pee pee, right in dirty?

28:29.880 --> 28:33.760
But, but, but, but the idea is, I'm telling you, I'm telling you right now, if you kick

28:33.760 --> 28:37.320
in my door, you're going to find some shit, I'm an American.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.320
Let's get over there right now.

28:39.320 --> 28:40.320
I'm trying to think.

28:40.320 --> 28:46.240
I pursue my fucking right to happiness, and I do it on my own property, and if you kick

28:46.240 --> 28:51.120
in my door, and you go through every inch of my house, you are going to find illegal

28:51.120 --> 28:52.120
shit.

28:52.120 --> 28:56.120
God bless me.

28:56.120 --> 29:00.600
And the same went for George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who would have been hung

29:00.600 --> 29:04.240
if they caught them because they were fucking treasonous terrorists.

29:04.240 --> 29:08.360
They were forming a fucking country where people should mind their own goddamn business.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.080
And I, and I, and I'm egging a house is shitty.

29:11.080 --> 29:16.320
And if you can prove that you egged a house, and you owe the guy 20 grand, that is not

29:16.320 --> 29:17.320
fun.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.320
That is not a search warrant situation.

29:18.320 --> 29:22.120
Well, I, I don't think they, I would guess that it wasn't, they broke, they broke down

29:22.120 --> 29:24.400
the door without a search warrant and started looking.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.400
No, they served him a warrant.

29:25.400 --> 29:26.400
I'm sure.

29:26.400 --> 29:27.400
And I think, I think he was like, okay.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.120
But they can also say, can we come in?

29:29.120 --> 29:30.520
And they go, yeah, you can come in.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.200
And when they come in and they see Coke on the table, they can go, what's this?

29:33.200 --> 29:35.040
And they can bust whoever is involved.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.040
Anyways, team Biebs.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.040
I'm just, I'm just saying, no.

29:37.040 --> 29:41.080
It sounds to me, Dan, like you're, you're, you've become a bit of a constitutional

29:41.080 --> 29:42.080
believer.

29:42.080 --> 29:48.360
And I'm going back to all of Justin Bieber's crimes and I'm going, you know what, Anne

29:48.360 --> 29:50.160
Frank probably would have been a believer.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.160
He had every right to.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.160
Oh, God.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.160
Oh, he said it.

29:53.160 --> 29:57.320
She probably would have, but that's what I, I think he's getting, I think he's getting

29:57.320 --> 30:01.080
punished for just being a tiny douchebag is what's happened.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.080
Exactly.

30:02.080 --> 30:05.680
And that is, if that's a crime, we're all in trouble, man, especially me.

30:05.680 --> 30:06.680
Yeah.

30:06.680 --> 30:11.080
I think I need to keep my ass like, like, like, like I, it needs to not be illegal to be

30:11.080 --> 30:12.080
unlikable.

30:12.080 --> 30:15.720
My only problem with Justin Bieber is that he's rocking and made quite famous the haircut

30:15.720 --> 30:18.360
that I had when I was four.

30:18.360 --> 30:23.480
I was doing the big sweepy thing a long time ago and fucking nothing, no record deals.

30:23.480 --> 30:28.320
I also want to reach out to him and say, uh, from the bottom of my heart, I'm so sorry

30:28.320 --> 30:34.320
about the photos they choose when you're being vilified in the, because man, they found,

30:34.320 --> 30:40.440
when I, when I, when I make my classic rape joke, uh, boy, they found the yellowest teeth.

30:40.440 --> 30:48.360
Like, like, they just found like these snarling photos of me going, I love rape.

30:48.360 --> 30:51.880
And, and, and, and he's, he's, he egged a house and they found cocaine and there's every

30:51.880 --> 30:56.200
photos like him on the red carpet doing like a Corey Feldman break dancer.

30:56.200 --> 31:04.720
Can I, here's my, look, I love the constitution as much as anybody, but, um, I, I do think

31:04.720 --> 31:10.360
that personal rights might have to be stepped in on when he's wearing the pants with the

31:10.360 --> 31:11.760
crotch is by the knees.

31:11.760 --> 31:16.440
Fucking no, then, then, no, then you're under, I don't know what that mean, crotch is by

31:16.440 --> 31:17.440
the knees.

31:17.440 --> 31:22.200
And those pants, the saggy crotch pants were like, the, the, the, the bells would be where

31:22.200 --> 31:26.320
the normal pants would be wasted, but the crotch portion is down here.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.320
So it's okay.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.320
You know what?

31:28.320 --> 31:29.320
It's full of cocaine and eggs and cough syrup.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.320
Cocaine and eggs and cough syrup?

31:30.320 --> 31:31.320
You know what?

31:31.320 --> 31:32.320
Oh my.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.320
The heaviest habits, no demand.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.320
Just in case.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.320
Just in case.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.320
Just in case.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.320
Good night, everybody.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.320
It's been our show.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.320
Thank you for coming to Harmontown.

31:39.320 --> 31:40.320
Let's search her house.

31:40.320 --> 31:50.320
She made a pun.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.320
What's that, Georgia?

31:51.320 --> 31:53.120
What's the worst thing they would find in your house?

31:53.120 --> 31:56.120
The worst thing they would, Georgia and I have this game we play on slumber party because

31:56.120 --> 31:59.160
we ask slumber party questions and one of them is when you die, what's the worst thing

31:59.160 --> 32:00.160
that you fail with?

32:00.160 --> 32:01.160
Then feel free to include hard drugs.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.160
Oh, hard drugs.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.160
Then we're all fucked.

32:03.160 --> 32:10.160
You know, I, I, I got us, this isn't my house, but I, I stay friends with an ex partly

32:10.160 --> 32:13.160
because he has videos and pictures.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.160
You know what I mean?

32:15.160 --> 32:16.160
And it's like, what's his name?

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
I'm just kidding.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.160
No.

32:18.160 --> 32:22.360
He, you know, I can't piss him off that much because he has.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.360
What are these videos?

32:23.360 --> 32:24.360
Can you, like in broad strokes?

32:24.360 --> 32:26.360
Long term relationship videos and stuff.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.360
She was in a musical.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.360
Yeah.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.360
Yeah.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.360
Yeah.

32:31.360 --> 32:37.160
It's you and, it's you and Pippin when you're, no, it's a kinky scale, one to 10, 10 being

32:37.160 --> 32:38.160
holy shit.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.160
Five.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.160
Five.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.160
It's not that bad.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.160
Yeah.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.160
So yeah, enough to, enough to be embarrassing.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.160
But not, yeah.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.160
Not felonious.

32:45.160 --> 32:46.160
My hair was terrible.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.160
You know.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.160
Oh yeah.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.160
Is that what you're worried about?

32:49.160 --> 32:53.240
See Dan, it seems to me that a lot of your beef with this whole Justin Bieber break-in

32:53.240 --> 32:58.160
is that the idea that your, your illegal stuff at home isn't safe, right?

32:58.160 --> 33:06.640
It all, it all goes back to me taking a pee in first grade and all of the kids at the

33:06.640 --> 33:12.280
year and all slowly looking over and laughing at me and at that point, me realizing that

33:12.280 --> 33:15.080
you're not supposed to drop your underwear and pants all the way to your ankle.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.080
I knew it.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.880
Oh God, it's awful.

33:17.880 --> 33:23.040
Which is why Justin Bieber invented these new pants that are, that the job is half

33:23.040 --> 33:24.040
none.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.040
I mean, there is overlap there.

33:25.040 --> 33:29.760
Maybe people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their pant level too.

33:29.760 --> 33:38.960
The, the, I, I, I, I, I, I never diagnosed myself with Asperger's, I never will, I'm

33:38.960 --> 33:45.440
41, it takes too long, too much money, I don't care, but, but I have achieved a lot of understanding

33:45.440 --> 33:51.040
about my personality and the struggles I've gone through by, by participating or voyeuristically

33:51.040 --> 33:57.480
spying on conversations between people on the spectrum on the internet, which I started

33:57.480 --> 34:01.200
doing accidentally because I was writing this character that, that I didn't want to, I didn't

34:01.200 --> 34:03.200
want to get wrong.

34:03.200 --> 34:08.680
And, and I, what I understand now very clearly is that there's a bit, like we all share

34:08.680 --> 34:13.960
as a fear of alienation and excommunication and that a lot of people have like these

34:13.960 --> 34:18.440
tendrils, these social cues, these pickups and things like, like, like, like, like,

34:18.440 --> 34:22.320
they just keep them safe, like, like people, there's people who are naturally buoyant to

34:22.320 --> 34:26.400
use the metaphor of a pool and then there's people who feel like they sink like a stone

34:26.400 --> 34:30.360
after a second if they don't flail or grab something.

34:30.360 --> 34:34.880
And I think when you're on the spectrum, you are, it's not, it's not that doing things

34:34.880 --> 34:39.720
wrong, it's the realization that you can do things wrong and not even realize that you've

34:39.720 --> 34:45.000
been doing them wrong until it's too late and it's that fear that we all have of being

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
kicked out.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.760
It's like, I didn't know that if I egged my neighbor's house, you could fucking kick

34:50.760 --> 34:51.760
in my door.

34:51.760 --> 34:57.040
We've both been pantsed before, like, as young people, like, the panting was a formative

34:57.040 --> 34:58.040
drama.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.040
Oh, it changed my life.

34:59.040 --> 35:02.080
I'm coming out to you in the lunchroom and just slapping you in the back of the head

35:02.080 --> 35:06.200
and you have no idea it was coming and you don't know why it happened and then you find

35:06.200 --> 35:11.360
out because you're confused and your hero is Spock or Dr. Who and he gets to the bottom

35:11.360 --> 35:12.360
of things.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.480
Like, why did that happen?

35:13.480 --> 35:15.360
Why did Troy do that?

35:15.360 --> 35:20.360
Troy did that because you spoke up in science class and you embarrassed him, you raised

35:20.360 --> 35:21.520
your hand at the wrong time.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.560
You've been wearing those pants for too many days in a row.

35:23.560 --> 35:28.240
Well, realizing you're the butt of the joke is like the most eye-opening thing that happened

35:28.240 --> 35:32.840
when I was in fifth grade and got pants and I was like, oh, this is funny to people.

35:32.840 --> 35:33.840
What was your reaction?

35:33.840 --> 35:38.120
Because I saw some girls go through some pretty traumatic pantsings.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.080
Like, really traumatic life, like life changing.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.080
Oh, yeah.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.120
Mine was in seventh grade and I was in a fight with my friend Laura.

35:45.120 --> 35:50.840
She was not drunk and not in the hotel room, but her boyfriend was a dick.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.640
And yeah, like a whole group of them are like, hey, Laura wants to talk to you.

35:53.640 --> 35:58.400
And then Kenji, her boyfriend came up behind me and pulled the guy down and he should die.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.920
And it was like, I had a whole like group of people watching.

36:01.920 --> 36:06.800
I remember the same thing, slow motion, my entire fifth grade class.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.400
Down to the knickers or down to fully nude?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.400
Just underwear.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.400
I think just underwear.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.680
But still, like, you don't get pantsed if you're like a popular kid.

36:13.680 --> 36:18.400
We both were really, oh, yeah, super dorks, hated ourselves with total nerds and then

36:18.400 --> 36:19.400
that happened.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.960
Clap Kenji in the fucking face, though.

36:20.960 --> 36:21.960
I clawed the girls' arms.

36:21.960 --> 36:22.960
I clawed the girls' arms.

36:22.960 --> 36:26.160
It's funny that you guys have the slumber party motif, though, because slumber parties

36:26.160 --> 36:29.480
were really even beyond any scholastic environments.

36:29.480 --> 36:35.280
Slumber parties, your closest friends, also the place where the knife could go in the

36:35.280 --> 36:36.280
deepest.

36:36.280 --> 36:41.080
Like, I have my best times and my worst times at slumber parties, where we call them sleepovers

36:41.080 --> 36:43.880
because we were dudes.

36:43.880 --> 36:48.720
But we, you know, like the most, the reason why you always wanted to have sleepovers is

36:48.720 --> 36:55.280
because you wanted to be participatory of like the most joyous moments of young life

36:55.280 --> 36:59.080
and like those spikes would come and those are like jumping up and down in your friends

36:59.080 --> 37:00.360
and you're having a great time.

37:00.360 --> 37:05.000
But then, oh, my worst memories are at slumber parties where I'm suddenly realizing again,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.840
like, wait, what the fuck, what did I, wait, me?

37:07.840 --> 37:08.840
I'm the scapegoat?

37:08.840 --> 37:09.840
No, that's the worst.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.840
Did you guys have a meeting about this?

37:11.840 --> 37:14.080
That's the worst, but that's the worst fear.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.640
That's the fear that's so weirdly universal to humanity.

37:16.640 --> 37:20.640
And I wouldn't get like, I wouldn't get like, like, down or about it, but it's something

37:20.640 --> 37:24.200
that I struggle with my whole life and being like, what if everyone fucking hates me and

37:24.200 --> 37:25.200
I have no idea?

37:25.200 --> 37:29.360
So when a helicopter shot at Justin Bieber's house is a thing, like, my mind doesn't automatically

37:29.360 --> 37:33.280
go to, ha, fuck that guy, he's so popular and rich.

37:33.280 --> 37:40.400
My mind goes to, fuck the police, fuck, like, I know there's police out there that are such

37:40.400 --> 37:41.400
great people.

37:41.400 --> 37:47.240
Like, thank God there are decent people who've signed up for that job, but I'm just saying

37:47.240 --> 37:53.280
as an institution, like, if I'm watching someone's house get raided on CNN, like, I never go,

37:53.280 --> 37:57.280
I don't care how famous they are, like, first we have to hate the government, then we have

37:57.280 --> 37:59.600
to hate famous people in that order.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.680
So important.

38:01.680 --> 38:05.600
Because famous people can't yet, all they can really do is fuck with your brain a little

38:05.600 --> 38:07.600
bit and lower your taste.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.360
The government can really do a lot of damage with too much power.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.800
Those things don't really make sense.

38:11.800 --> 38:17.320
Egging to raiding, don't, it's Charlie Sheehan, you'd be like, well, he brought this all

38:17.320 --> 38:18.320
come in.

38:18.320 --> 38:21.440
If there was a news story that broke about a little kid that egged somebody's house

38:21.440 --> 38:27.440
and then the cops raided their house, like, under the right demographic circumstances,

38:27.440 --> 38:28.440
that would be all over Facebook.

38:28.440 --> 38:32.640
That happens every night all across the country, I'm certain.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.960
Well, it's called raiding people's houses who didn't even egg people because they live

38:35.960 --> 38:36.960
in the wrong neighborhood.

38:36.960 --> 38:45.480
If you live in a wealthy neighborhood and you are a non-famous child living in a neighborhood

38:45.480 --> 38:52.800
or a youngster like he is, and you decide to do shitloads of, like, heavy-duty damage

38:52.800 --> 38:55.040
to your neighbor's house, the cops are coming.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.080
They're going to come into your house if you allow them in.

38:57.080 --> 39:01.080
If you go, no, sir, not without a warrant, they'll go, all right, they'll have to play

39:01.080 --> 39:02.080
Mother Rules.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.320
But if you let them in and they find drugs there, you go to jail, everybody there gets

39:05.320 --> 39:07.540
questioned and all that shit happens.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.840
Helicopters come because he's Justin Bieber, but then-

39:09.840 --> 39:10.840
No, those are news coppers.

39:10.840 --> 39:11.840
I understand.

39:11.840 --> 39:12.840
Copters.

39:12.840 --> 39:13.840
I understand.

39:13.840 --> 39:20.640
But the whole thing in total that disturbs me is that the entire thing adds up to something

39:20.640 --> 39:24.920
that we all just take for granted, which is that, oh, well, he had it coming.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.120
Now, wait a minute.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.800
I don't care who had it coming.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.160
I watch enough law and order.

39:29.160 --> 39:34.000
I love me some Sam Waterston, like, the rule of law is what's important.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.960
It doesn't matter who had it coming.

39:35.960 --> 39:41.280
You can't shoot someone in the face because they, you know, until after the law fails

39:41.280 --> 39:42.280
you anyway.

39:42.280 --> 39:49.080
Like, you know, you can't, like, and we can't just look at somebody and go, like, oh, well,

39:49.080 --> 39:54.280
he was a dick about that monkey thing on the airline and there's been all kinds of stories

39:54.280 --> 39:55.280
about him.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.280
So fuck him.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.280
No.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.280
Not fuck anybody.

39:58.280 --> 39:59.600
Is Justin Bieber under charges right now?

39:59.600 --> 40:01.000
Has he been, like, arrested or arrested?

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
I don't know.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
I gave up at my outrage.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.520
I had something to talk about so I stopped researching.

40:05.520 --> 40:10.160
He was in the news today for drinking a shitton of weird cough syrup, which is so slumming

40:10.160 --> 40:11.160
it.

40:11.160 --> 40:14.280
But on that point, though, I think there's something really interesting about, like,

40:14.280 --> 40:21.440
about Hive Mind and about, have you ever heard of the term tallest poppy syndrome,

40:21.440 --> 40:27.400
where it's like a metaphor for the tallest poppies in opium crops get cut because they

40:27.400 --> 40:28.400
don't conform?

40:28.400 --> 40:34.800
So this idea that something rises above and it's bigger and it's more conspicuous than

40:34.800 --> 40:38.360
gets the nature, human nature, is to chop it.

40:38.360 --> 40:42.240
And so it's, that's the, I think it's above constitutional law concerns.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.240
It's also that, that, you know.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.240
That's Harrison Bergeron.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.240
But that's celebrity.

40:46.240 --> 40:52.560
But that's celebrity as we're uncomfortable with a kid who put a YouTube video up and

40:52.560 --> 40:54.920
became a billionaire at 12.

40:54.920 --> 40:55.920
That's my problem.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.920
And gets more posy than anyone in this room ever will.

40:57.920 --> 40:58.920
Obviously.

40:58.920 --> 41:02.680
I thought, I thought our country was supposed to be about innovation and this whole stuff.

41:02.680 --> 41:08.160
The glee that we take in raising people up, it's like, if somebody is that famous, it's

41:08.160 --> 41:10.920
because everybody loved them and then we crucify them.

41:10.920 --> 41:11.920
That's what we do.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.520
It's, it's, it's, I don't like that and neither did God.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.520
Hence the New Testament.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.520
No, it's not.

41:17.520 --> 41:21.720
It's not a cool behavior and we fucking don't learn our lesson.

41:21.720 --> 41:26.040
But all of that is a reflection also, and this is super cheesy, but of how much you actually

41:26.040 --> 41:29.760
like yourself and if you hate yourself, you want everyone to hate themselves.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.800
And if you're okay with yourself, you don't give a shit what people think about themselves.

41:32.800 --> 41:36.800
And so the idea that if you're in this cycle of like, I suck, I suck, everyone hates me,

41:36.800 --> 41:37.800
I must be terrible.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.800
What's wrong with me?

41:38.800 --> 41:39.800
Is there something wrong with me?

41:39.800 --> 41:40.800
I don't know about.

41:40.800 --> 41:41.800
Am I okay today?

41:41.800 --> 41:43.800
You're, you're going to want, you're going to wish failure on everyone.

41:43.800 --> 41:44.800
Yeah.

41:44.800 --> 41:45.800
And you, and you're going to feel fine with it.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.800
It's like throwing a rock at the moon.

41:47.800 --> 41:52.640
That's every day on Twitter, somebody like takes a shot at me, you know, 85,000 people

41:52.640 --> 41:56.880
hug me and make me feel wonderful about myself, and then one person goes like, Hey fuckface,

41:56.880 --> 41:58.880
why are you so fat and untalented?

41:58.880 --> 42:03.000
And of course I go like, well, let's talk about this.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.560
And I get up my eyeglasses and I want to talk to them.

42:06.560 --> 42:10.200
And I like over and over and over again, it's the same thing.

42:10.200 --> 42:15.040
It's like this person that no matter how they want to dress it up, regardless of what form

42:15.040 --> 42:21.840
they take, it's this person that is actually quite shocked in the end that like I would

42:21.840 --> 42:24.760
go, Hey, what?

42:24.760 --> 42:28.680
Because the first thing they say is they go like, what a loser talking to me.

42:28.680 --> 42:29.680
What the fuck?

42:29.680 --> 42:30.680
That's sad.

42:30.680 --> 42:34.360
You don't want to, well, why did you talk to me?

42:34.360 --> 42:35.360
Are you doing it?

42:35.360 --> 42:36.360
Like do you want to?

42:36.360 --> 42:37.360
Well, I just think I'm fucking you up.

42:37.360 --> 42:43.160
And then 90% of them go like, look, maybe I misspoke, I was just saying, like, I think,

42:43.160 --> 42:47.520
like, like, like, it's our celebrity worship is.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.520
They think you're invincible.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.520
They think you're invincible.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.520
It is dangerous.

42:50.520 --> 42:51.520
They don't know.

42:51.520 --> 42:58.040
And that's just me, like, I exist in a safe part of that pond, you look at the things

42:58.040 --> 43:06.680
if you ever go to like a Kardashian's Instagram, and some girl takes a photo of herself and

43:06.680 --> 43:15.920
says, I'm having fun at the zoo, I'm a Kardashian, and the things like it's just kill yourself.

43:15.920 --> 43:18.520
You should kill yourself if you don't kill yourself.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.520
I'm going to kill you.

43:19.520 --> 43:21.800
I'm going to hire someone to kill you.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.200
Your head looks stupid.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.000
Your face looks stupid.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.440
You shouldn't be at the zoo.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.720
You're a horrible person.

43:28.720 --> 43:31.240
I hope your face gets ripped off by that animal.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.740
I hope you're...

43:32.740 --> 43:33.740
I don't...

43:33.740 --> 43:35.800
I've never watched the Kardashian show.

43:35.800 --> 43:40.240
I don't know what these people do that's so wrong, but it's so disturbing.

43:40.240 --> 43:45.320
We always, like, have, like, like, struggled with the thought of, like, promoting ourselves,

43:45.320 --> 43:49.080
like, and being like, look at me doing this thing, and look at us doing this thing, and

43:49.080 --> 43:53.560
hey, we're going to be even, like, at Harmontown, and it's like, are we bragging?

43:53.560 --> 43:56.520
Are we inviting people to be annoyed with us and to hate us?

43:56.520 --> 43:57.520
Yeah.

43:57.520 --> 43:58.520
Well, that's a large...

43:58.520 --> 43:59.520
I got a documentary coming out about myself.

43:59.520 --> 44:00.520
That's going to go well.

44:00.520 --> 44:02.320
That's going to go real well.

44:02.320 --> 44:09.600
I can't wait to read the AV Club review of the documentary I produced about myself.

44:09.600 --> 44:10.600
That's going to go...

44:10.600 --> 44:12.600
That's going to make me feel fantastic.

44:12.600 --> 44:18.000
Well, but all of that is, you'll notice, like, the more invincible and the more on top people

44:18.000 --> 44:23.080
will see, then the more of that, like, chopping poppy syndrome you see.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.760
And so you have to understand and take that with some kind of weird...

44:25.760 --> 44:26.760
It's almost like...

44:26.760 --> 44:29.880
And I don't know if this is part of the solution or part of the problem, but I think what you're

44:29.880 --> 44:37.200
suggesting is that a healthy person would look at each knife as a hug, like, but I don't

44:37.200 --> 44:39.680
know if that turns you into a monster.

44:39.680 --> 44:41.720
Isn't that the definition of an associate path?

44:41.720 --> 44:45.400
I think what you do is look at the person on the other side of the knife and realize

44:45.400 --> 44:47.960
that they're these sad people who are never going to affect your life.

44:47.960 --> 44:48.960
Don't matter.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.880
In their mind, the blade on the knife is a nerf blade.

44:51.880 --> 44:52.880
Yeah.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.240
I mean, really, they're trying to get your attention.

44:55.240 --> 44:56.240
That's what they're doing.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.040
And so there's something about them that needs to be yourself.

44:58.040 --> 45:03.240
It's almost like an Andy Kaufman routine where it's like, like, he just went, fuck it.

45:03.240 --> 45:06.400
If people are booing you, that's part of the act.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.320
Like, it didn't affect him that way.

45:08.320 --> 45:11.880
But you just said, Dan, that you know that 85,000 people hug you and one person says,

45:11.880 --> 45:13.880
uh, you're fat and that drives you crazy.

45:13.880 --> 45:18.520
You, you, you don't think that you're going to get 100% of the people to say nice things

45:18.520 --> 45:19.520
to you online.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.520
Right.

45:20.520 --> 45:23.640
So intellectually, you understand that there's a percentage of people who are going to say

45:23.640 --> 45:24.640
that.

45:24.640 --> 45:28.200
No, I understand that all intellectually, but that's just like, I don't, I, I'll look

45:28.200 --> 45:29.200
here.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.200
Here's the thing.

45:30.200 --> 45:37.880
Uh, everyone loved the last episode of community, uh, about five seconds into reading the praise

45:37.880 --> 45:44.440
of the last episode of community, I started to get bummed out because the praise came

45:44.440 --> 45:49.880
in the form of this is the funniest episode of community since season two, which made

45:49.880 --> 45:54.240
me go, bad job at season three.

45:54.240 --> 45:57.800
I, I made a realization and I'll make it again for the rest of my life.

45:57.800 --> 45:58.800
It's too late for me.

45:58.800 --> 46:03.400
I'll never be mentally healthy, but it's another epiphany in my epiphany drawer.

46:03.400 --> 46:07.680
My work, my relationship with strangers will never make me happy.

46:07.680 --> 46:08.680
That's how sick I am.

46:08.680 --> 46:10.280
So yes, I realize all these things.

46:10.280 --> 46:13.000
The logical realization of it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't mean anything.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.560
But do you think that this, that you yourself hatred and we both have it in certain doses

46:17.560 --> 46:24.280
like helps fuel you as a person because you, you hate yourself yet you've made this incredible

46:24.280 --> 46:27.640
career, like career doing something you love and are good at.

46:27.640 --> 46:31.600
But you know, if you liked yourself, would you have tried so hard to prove?

46:31.600 --> 46:32.600
No, exactly.

46:32.600 --> 46:33.600
Yeah.

46:33.600 --> 46:37.640
That's a problem is that am, that validation is the reward for ambition, which can a lot

46:37.640 --> 46:39.480
of times be fueled by the need for validation.

46:39.480 --> 46:42.560
So you, if you are like, ah, fuck, I got a hole in my bucket.

46:42.560 --> 46:44.880
You're going to keep trying to fill your bucket and you're like, I still got a hole

46:44.880 --> 46:45.880
in it.

46:45.880 --> 46:49.440
I think the key has something to do with that whole, the whole of the bucket has to, you

46:49.440 --> 46:56.760
have to let that lead you into vocational ambition where it will never be fulfilled.

46:56.760 --> 47:02.480
And you have to then simultaneously somehow I'm miming like some bucket going underwater.

47:02.480 --> 47:10.160
It looks like some weird thing, but, but like, like while that, while that incom, that unfillable

47:10.160 --> 47:18.680
void directs you forward in terms of the things you output, you simultaneously have to derive

47:18.680 --> 47:23.120
your emotional well-being from your dog, your fiance, your,

47:23.120 --> 47:24.120
But you're amazing.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
You're not mine.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.120
I have neither.

47:26.120 --> 47:32.320
And you have to not let those things, that's the, that's the thing, like you can't like

47:32.320 --> 47:38.080
you have to like, yeah, you just have to go like, okay, I'm, I'm a person who can never

47:38.080 --> 47:39.560
do anything right for anybody.

47:39.560 --> 47:43.080
So I'm going to always like, until I drop dead, like Robert Altman, I'm just going to

47:43.080 --> 47:45.080
like make things like Woody Allen.

47:45.080 --> 47:46.080
I'll just make things.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.080
Like those are great.

47:47.080 --> 47:51.160
They're heroes of ours because they're prolific, but they compartmentalize because obviously

47:51.160 --> 47:57.080
if Woody Allen ever allowed people's opinions of his personality to mitigate his output,

47:57.080 --> 48:01.120
there would have been a little bit of a divot at a certain point in his career and there

48:01.120 --> 48:02.120
wasn't.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.120
I don't know how to not egg anyone.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.120
If you should never egg anyone.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.660
I think Christina Barcelona was pretty shitty.

48:05.660 --> 48:10.620
Well, yeah, I mean, he's a, he's psychologically probably a monster, but that's okay.

48:10.620 --> 48:15.440
And he's not listening and he won't punch a mirror when you say that unlike me.

48:15.440 --> 48:16.480
And that's where I fall short.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.600
Like I probably won't punch a mirror, but...

48:18.600 --> 48:23.920
But that's, I mean that's the thing is, is in, for me, we would not have multiple TV

48:23.920 --> 48:24.920
shows.

48:24.920 --> 48:28.900
If out of a McNuggetini video, if I didn't have an unfillable void.

48:28.900 --> 48:32.580
Yeah, my anxiety and depression wasn't fueled on like,

48:32.580 --> 48:34.420
but you're not doing enough, enough, enough.

48:34.420 --> 48:36.540
We wouldn't have, yeah, we wouldn't have.

48:36.540 --> 48:37.940
I have no ambition.

48:37.940 --> 48:39.060
I have zero.

48:39.060 --> 48:41.220
Well, maybe, well, that's a good thing to do.

48:41.220 --> 48:44.860
I don't, I don't think I'm crazy enough

48:44.860 --> 48:46.420
to be that talented or that funny.

48:46.420 --> 48:47.260
Like, I feel like-

48:47.260 --> 48:48.100
Well, I don't think I'm talented.

48:48.100 --> 48:49.100
I know, I worked my ass off.

48:49.100 --> 48:51.700
The guilt of having a partner that you have to,

48:51.700 --> 48:53.220
I would have never done this on my own.

48:53.220 --> 48:54.060
Like, the guilt of being like,

48:54.060 --> 48:55.300
well, I was gonna be disappointed

48:55.300 --> 48:56.140
if I don't write this thing.

48:56.140 --> 48:58.220
Or like, well, I have to show that I'm carrying my weight.

48:58.220 --> 49:00.220
And so, when you have someone to work with like that,

49:00.220 --> 49:01.060
it really helps.

49:01.060 --> 49:02.620
I'm the deadline bitch a lot of times.

49:02.620 --> 49:03.460
So, I keep-

49:03.460 --> 49:04.300
See, I don't like people like you

49:04.300 --> 49:06.420
that have ambition, that have,

49:06.420 --> 49:08.940
I don't like people that have holes in their bucket

49:08.940 --> 49:11.260
because you guys are all the people that get shit done.

49:11.260 --> 49:12.100
You guys are-

49:12.100 --> 49:12.940
I know.

49:12.940 --> 49:13.780
Because we're never gonna be happy.

49:13.780 --> 49:15.380
You have careers and shit like that.

49:15.380 --> 49:16.620
No, I actually had a weird,

49:16.620 --> 49:17.660
and I don't know if this is,

49:17.660 --> 49:18.500
you guys don't know me,

49:18.500 --> 49:19.700
so I don't know if this is weirdly personal,

49:19.700 --> 49:21.820
but I had a fucking, the last couple weeks,

49:21.820 --> 49:23.340
I, we've both had really hard years.

49:23.340 --> 49:24.380
We've had terrible years.

49:24.380 --> 49:26.620
And if you listen to Slumber Party with Ali

49:26.620 --> 49:27.980
and George on Feral Audio,

49:27.980 --> 49:30.620
we, one of our episodes was called Flash Flood of Sadness

49:30.620 --> 49:32.140
because like in the one month,

49:32.140 --> 49:33.580
like we just, we both went through

49:33.580 --> 49:36.660
all kinds of weird shit outside of our control.

49:36.660 --> 49:38.940
And so, I've had like this terrible hard year,

49:38.940 --> 49:41.580
and I have beat myself up a million times

49:41.580 --> 49:42.980
for how I am not enough.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.180
I didn't handle it well.

49:44.180 --> 49:45.820
Everyone must hate me, blah, blah, blah, blah.

49:45.820 --> 49:47.860
I, if I send a birthday gift late,

49:47.860 --> 49:49.060
I'm like, oh, I'm a monster.

49:49.060 --> 49:50.580
I'm a social, I should kill myself.

49:50.580 --> 49:52.460
Like, I should Kardashian myself at the zoo.

49:52.460 --> 49:53.300
I'm the worst person.

49:53.300 --> 49:58.300
And I just recently, like just recently finally was like,

49:59.460 --> 50:00.740
I can't do this anymore.

50:00.740 --> 50:02.420
No one wants me to hate myself.

50:02.420 --> 50:04.220
I keep thinking everyone will like me more

50:04.220 --> 50:06.380
if I'm successful and have it together.

50:06.380 --> 50:08.220
And I'm like, not hideous.

50:08.220 --> 50:09.940
And I have like a show with my best friend.

50:09.940 --> 50:11.860
As long as I hate myself, I'm acceptable.

50:11.860 --> 50:13.820
And I was like, no, no one wants me to hate myself.

50:13.820 --> 50:15.860
I mean, that's makes me more of a garbage person.

50:15.860 --> 50:17.020
So I'm just like, fuck it.

50:17.020 --> 50:18.140
I'm just gonna be okay with it

50:18.140 --> 50:19.900
and just worry about other shit.

50:19.900 --> 50:22.300
So, thanks, oh my God, thanks.

50:22.300 --> 50:23.140
Woo!

50:25.220 --> 50:26.900
I'm able to accept your applause.

50:26.900 --> 50:31.580
There is always an outrage underneath every hackle

50:31.580 --> 50:33.420
when you confront it that the people go like,

50:33.420 --> 50:34.980
oh, wait a minute, what the fuck are you doing?

50:34.980 --> 50:36.100
You're standing in front of me.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.540
You're running your mouth.

50:37.540 --> 50:39.660
I'm not allowed to shoot a paintball gun at you.

50:39.660 --> 50:40.580
That's all I'm doing.

50:40.580 --> 50:41.780
Yeah, I have my own issues,

50:41.780 --> 50:43.820
but I'm not a celebrity, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

50:43.820 --> 50:45.140
They unfold all this stuff.

50:45.140 --> 50:49.100
And then we go, oh, look at all the hypocrisy

50:49.100 --> 50:50.500
of your point of view and all this shit.

50:50.500 --> 50:51.980
They're like, yeah, I'm not in that business.

50:51.980 --> 50:56.980
Fuck off, I'm a fucking audience member.

50:57.180 --> 50:59.100
Like, I'm sitting here on Twitter,

50:59.100 --> 51:01.740
I'm just like tweeting that Dan Harmon's an asshole.

51:01.740 --> 51:04.300
I didn't expect Dan Harmon to fucking come down

51:04.300 --> 51:07.460
on me like a goddamn weird cloud.

51:08.740 --> 51:09.900
But I'm gonna keep doing it

51:09.900 --> 51:12.140
because it freaks him out so much.

51:12.140 --> 51:12.980
I love it.

51:12.980 --> 51:13.820
Like all the other people,

51:13.820 --> 51:15.500
like the percentage of people in this room

51:15.500 --> 51:17.500
who have tweeted at you is probably really low,

51:17.500 --> 51:20.580
but the percentage of people who like appreciate you

51:20.580 --> 51:21.420
and like you.

51:21.420 --> 51:22.580
I mean, like think about the people

51:22.580 --> 51:24.380
that you used to love when you were growing up

51:24.380 --> 51:26.580
and there was no way to tell them ever.

51:26.580 --> 51:27.420
Yeah, exactly.

51:27.420 --> 51:30.060
And also if I knew that like Kyle McLaughlin

51:30.060 --> 51:32.420
from Twin Peaks like was really sensitive

51:32.420 --> 51:33.540
about how people perceived him,

51:33.540 --> 51:34.980
I would have liked him less.

51:34.980 --> 51:36.820
I don't wanna know the ins and outs

51:36.820 --> 51:39.260
of his fucking relationship with his self image.

51:39.260 --> 51:40.860
Now that I know what it's like for someone

51:40.860 --> 51:43.060
to come up to me and be like, I love your show.

51:43.060 --> 51:45.860
Like I saw Jellaby Offer outside of a bar like years ago.

51:45.860 --> 51:48.140
I should have been like, you changed everything.

51:48.140 --> 51:50.100
But, and I was like, I'm gonna annoy him.

51:50.100 --> 51:50.980
I'm not gonna say anything.

51:50.980 --> 51:52.340
But like these people are really stoked.

51:52.340 --> 51:53.180
But.

51:53.180 --> 51:55.500
I would have retweeted Janeane Garofalo all the time.

51:55.500 --> 51:58.940
I would have spent my entire adolescence just arching.

51:58.940 --> 52:01.220
Like more, look at what she said.

52:01.220 --> 52:02.700
I had no access to that.

52:02.700 --> 52:05.100
I just had to stare at them from afar and read liner notes.

52:05.100 --> 52:05.940
That's a why.

52:05.940 --> 52:07.740
So I mean, that's a totally, I mean people,

52:07.740 --> 52:10.060
I think now celebrities or people,

52:10.060 --> 52:12.460
tallest poppies are much more porous in that way.

52:12.460 --> 52:16.100
I think that their membranes are much more permeable too.

52:16.100 --> 52:18.460
That criticism and not, I don't think people

52:18.460 --> 52:20.620
who are in this business necessarily take praise

52:20.620 --> 52:21.900
with the way that they do criticism.

52:21.900 --> 52:24.140
And that's a big thing that you just have to like

52:24.140 --> 52:24.980
get zen about.

52:24.980 --> 52:25.820
Or else you're gonna-

52:25.820 --> 52:27.820
But those tallest poppies are more sensitive to the sun

52:27.820 --> 52:30.500
and are reaching higher and represent a biosphere

52:30.500 --> 52:32.260
in which poppies are gonna get taller.

52:32.260 --> 52:33.940
That's why everyone's on opium.

52:33.940 --> 52:37.100
Because, yeah, like, but it's true.

52:37.100 --> 52:39.620
Like, because there's not,

52:39.620 --> 52:41.860
there is no Cary Grant of the year 2050.

52:41.860 --> 52:43.180
That doesn't work that way anymore.

52:43.180 --> 52:44.300
There's no newsreel going,

52:44.300 --> 52:47.180
hey, who's that with Marilyn Monroe on the red carpet?

52:47.180 --> 52:49.700
It's only gonna be a bunch of people that are like,

52:49.700 --> 52:50.740
hey, what'd you say about me?

52:50.740 --> 52:51.580
Fuck you!

52:52.940 --> 52:54.260
Because everyone's gonna be,

52:54.260 --> 52:55.940
you're not gonna be allowed to be famous

52:55.940 --> 52:56.940
if you're not accessible.

52:56.940 --> 52:58.660
Or like having to reveal more and more about yourself

52:58.660 --> 53:00.060
or like you have to be this,

53:00.060 --> 53:01.420
you can't be this character.

53:01.420 --> 53:03.660
You have to be like, here's how flawed I am.

53:03.660 --> 53:06.420
Or like here's everything about me that you need to know.

53:06.420 --> 53:08.380
No, I would say like throughout time,

53:08.380 --> 53:10.580
like the Mount Olympus of, you know,

53:10.580 --> 53:12.180
the people that we allow to be celebrities,

53:12.180 --> 53:13.580
there are people that we don't want to touch.

53:13.580 --> 53:15.300
There are people that are sacrosanct.

53:15.300 --> 53:16.140
But we do want to, yeah.

53:16.140 --> 53:17.780
We always give like some George Clooney,

53:17.780 --> 53:18.620
like a little-

53:18.620 --> 53:20.100
Yeah, George Clooney or a little Beyonce,

53:20.100 --> 53:21.540
like we be like, okay, no, she's safe.

53:21.540 --> 53:23.380
Like we'll fucking leave her alone.

53:23.380 --> 53:25.260
You know, when people are being vicious to each other

53:25.260 --> 53:26.100
throughout the year,

53:26.100 --> 53:27.900
it's like nobody out at Barbra Stanwalk or Doris Day

53:27.900 --> 53:29.260
because they're fucking beloved.

53:29.260 --> 53:31.820
And like everybody knew that they were gay.

53:31.820 --> 53:33.780
They knew them, but they didn't say it because of that.

53:33.780 --> 53:34.620
Just found out right now.

53:34.620 --> 53:36.620
Yeah, because I made it up, no.

53:36.620 --> 53:40.460
But like there are people that we do want to be Apollo

53:40.460 --> 53:41.780
and after a dieting.

53:41.780 --> 53:44.140
There's also people that we want to be punished.

53:44.140 --> 53:45.740
There's people that we want to cast away.

53:45.740 --> 53:48.100
Like Madonna from the beginning.

53:48.100 --> 53:50.260
Like it's not like she was beyond reproach.

53:50.260 --> 53:53.820
Like she was a sexable and she was world conquering

53:53.820 --> 53:55.300
and everyone knew her name.

53:55.300 --> 53:58.180
But at the same time, she represented an archetype

53:58.180 --> 54:00.980
that was like inviting everyone's vile.

54:00.980 --> 54:02.780
I think it's we should forget puked on.

54:02.780 --> 54:03.900
We don't have a Kerry Grant.

54:03.900 --> 54:06.900
I mean, George Clooney is doing his level best

54:06.900 --> 54:09.380
to probably without trying to,

54:09.380 --> 54:11.500
we're forcing that on him to be a guy

54:11.500 --> 54:13.180
that people really want to like.

54:13.180 --> 54:17.180
And he's making it very easy for us to like George Clooney.

54:17.180 --> 54:19.300
He doesn't, and even if he ever did something bad,

54:19.300 --> 54:21.100
people wouldn't fucking talk about it.

54:21.100 --> 54:23.740
Like when I was a kid, like I mentioned before,

54:23.740 --> 54:24.820
I was in a play with Joel Brunner.

54:24.820 --> 54:27.060
If you guys know him, he's an actor from the 50s.

54:27.060 --> 54:31.220
And he was a big sex symbol for many years

54:31.220 --> 54:33.300
and a big hot shot in his giant movies.

54:33.300 --> 54:36.900
And when we were, we did like 13 cities

54:36.900 --> 54:38.660
on this tour before I went to Broadway

54:38.660 --> 54:40.700
and we were in Cincinnati, it was opening night.

54:40.700 --> 54:42.860
And we were on the, whatever the river is there.

54:42.860 --> 54:43.780
Is it the Ohio River?

54:43.780 --> 54:44.620
What is it?

54:44.620 --> 54:45.460
Yes.

54:45.460 --> 54:46.300
And there was a river boat

54:46.300 --> 54:47.540
and that was where opening night party was.

54:47.540 --> 54:50.060
And there was always local dignitaries and press

54:50.060 --> 54:51.940
and you know, like kind of local hot shots

54:51.940 --> 54:54.300
and possibly a mayor would come to these parties.

54:54.300 --> 54:55.940
And the kids, there were 13 of us,

54:55.940 --> 54:58.020
seven that traveled and seven local kids

54:58.020 --> 55:01.540
that filled out the kid portion of the cast.

55:01.540 --> 55:04.500
We would all walk up on this procession and meet him.

55:04.500 --> 55:07.180
And I learned, I mean, I was raised in kind of

55:07.180 --> 55:11.540
an old school like LA kind of very mannerly environment

55:11.540 --> 55:13.180
where you said good evening and how do you do

55:13.180 --> 55:14.020
and stuff like that.

55:14.020 --> 55:17.140
But we were suits and my understudy was brand new

55:17.140 --> 55:19.340
in the job and he was a kid named Luke from Philadelphia.

55:19.340 --> 55:21.700
He was very crass, very, you know,

55:21.700 --> 55:24.300
like Irish Catholic working class kid, really funny

55:24.300 --> 55:26.660
but really, you know, like rough around the edges

55:26.660 --> 55:29.860
compared to, you know, like the rest of us probably.

55:29.860 --> 55:31.340
And his dad was this, you know,

55:31.340 --> 55:34.060
tough old Irish guy who's hilarious.

55:34.060 --> 55:35.700
And he was in front of me

55:35.700 --> 55:37.580
and he was his first time meeting Yule.

55:37.580 --> 55:38.420
And it was in front of everybody.

55:38.420 --> 55:41.300
There's cameras, you know, for the local newspapers.

55:41.300 --> 55:43.220
And he walks up and he goes, hi.

55:43.220 --> 55:44.620
And Yule just goes, boom.

55:44.620 --> 55:48.140
It just smashes him with his giant hand across his face.

55:48.140 --> 55:50.820
Absolutely clobbers this 10 year old.

55:50.820 --> 55:51.820
10 year old.

55:51.820 --> 55:53.740
And I'm right behind him and like,

55:53.740 --> 55:54.980
I'd never seen Yule hit anybody

55:54.980 --> 55:56.860
but I knew that like you don't fucking cross,

55:56.860 --> 55:58.660
he's the king on and off stage.

55:58.660 --> 56:00.540
And he was a bad old school motherfucker

56:00.540 --> 56:01.780
who was dying of cancer.

56:01.780 --> 56:02.620
And in front of me.

56:02.620 --> 56:04.060
And who was a robot cowboy?

56:04.060 --> 56:04.900
Yes.

56:04.900 --> 56:07.580
And who said to him, go back to your mama.

56:07.580 --> 56:08.900
Is that what he said?

56:08.900 --> 56:09.980
No, in Westworld.

56:09.980 --> 56:10.820
Okay.

56:10.820 --> 56:14.140
Westworld, quote, for nobody.

56:16.780 --> 56:17.780
Fucking rent Westworld.

56:17.780 --> 56:19.020
He fucking gives Richard Benjamin

56:19.020 --> 56:20.540
the fucking time of his life, man.

56:20.540 --> 56:21.540
I love that you just got.

56:21.540 --> 56:24.500
He really gives Richard Benjamin what how?

56:24.500 --> 56:25.340
What how?

56:26.340 --> 56:27.180
Anyway.

56:27.180 --> 56:28.620
You got one person snapping to that.

56:28.620 --> 56:31.020
By the way, like a beat audience.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.820
Just like a glorious and disgusting.

56:32.820 --> 56:33.660
And I love that.

56:33.660 --> 56:34.500
It's Adam Colbert.

56:36.620 --> 56:38.820
I did not rub your lamp at him, be quiet.

56:38.820 --> 56:43.500
So anyway, so you'll just bash this kid

56:43.500 --> 56:45.500
and he gives him this big model like,

56:45.500 --> 56:46.820
you're in the presence of ladies.

56:46.820 --> 56:48.460
You do not say hi, you say, how do you do?

56:48.460 --> 56:49.300
You say, good evening.

56:49.300 --> 56:50.900
I gave him this big ass thing.

56:50.900 --> 56:53.020
And the thing is, the guys with the cameras,

56:53.020 --> 56:56.180
the press that were there, put their cameras down.

56:56.180 --> 56:57.020
Right.

56:57.020 --> 56:58.420
And like, this kid's getting the fucking talking to,

56:58.420 --> 56:59.740
he's getting the rules right now.

56:59.740 --> 57:02.940
No, look, the Irish Catholic father of Luke,

57:02.940 --> 57:06.140
who is, you know, he had diabetes, he had scoliosis,

57:06.140 --> 57:08.140
one leg was fucking a foot shorter than the other one.

57:08.140 --> 57:10.340
Like he had, this guy had been through wars and shit.

57:10.340 --> 57:14.460
He, like his fists came up and then put him right back down

57:14.460 --> 57:19.220
because like, there was a status ladder

57:19.220 --> 57:21.780
and you'll just gave him this fucking talking to.

57:21.780 --> 57:24.140
And I mean, the sound it made when he hit this kid

57:24.140 --> 57:25.580
was a fucking major.

57:25.580 --> 57:27.220
Okay, so let's not live in that world.

57:27.220 --> 57:29.540
There's so much worse in me.

57:29.540 --> 57:33.140
But if paratroopers come in through the skylight then

57:33.140 --> 57:37.420
and arrest Yule Brenner for the future crime of child murder,

57:37.420 --> 57:38.820
then I'm on Yule Brenner's side.

57:38.820 --> 57:41.740
No, but the reason I bring that up,

57:41.740 --> 57:44.980
that we lived in a time when celebrities misbehaved,

57:44.980 --> 57:45.980
that wasn't news.

57:45.980 --> 57:49.140
Now any bit of misbehavior is front page news at all times.

57:49.140 --> 57:50.900
Because gloriously the concept of celebrity,

57:50.900 --> 57:53.500
hopefully, it'd be interesting to watch how this happens.

57:53.500 --> 57:56.700
It's like a paint pigment that's like, you know,

57:56.700 --> 58:00.260
you can't, you used to, I feel like from watching

58:00.260 --> 58:03.460
old black and white, you know, culture and stuff

58:03.460 --> 58:06.180
that you could count the number of celebrities

58:06.180 --> 58:10.060
on a couple of hands and that the list dropped off

58:10.060 --> 58:10.900
really fast.

58:10.900 --> 58:14.940
You didn't like have like, you didn't know who was famous

58:14.940 --> 58:16.620
beyond like 10 people.

58:16.620 --> 58:20.100
And that now it's just more stratified kind of like,

58:20.100 --> 58:23.220
obviously it's just like, oh, my neighbor has a podcast

58:23.220 --> 58:25.460
and she's got a thousand listeners,

58:25.460 --> 58:27.900
which I think is very healthy and very good.

58:27.900 --> 58:31.660
But it's like, it's being infected by this old world

58:31.660 --> 58:35.140
concept of celebrities as a class.

58:35.140 --> 58:36.300
I disagree with that though.

58:36.300 --> 58:37.540
I think we've needed celebrities

58:37.540 --> 58:39.860
since before we had Twitter or podcasts.

58:39.860 --> 58:42.300
Like if you look, like I studied Latin in college

58:42.300 --> 58:46.380
or high school at AP Latin, only one person in my class,

58:46.380 --> 58:47.420
it was me and Mrs. B.C.O.

58:47.420 --> 58:49.660
She's dead now, don't worry about it.

58:49.660 --> 58:51.500
It was just me and her, but you know,

58:51.500 --> 58:52.940
so you study when you study the classics

58:52.940 --> 58:55.540
and you know, Roman and Greek mythology,

58:55.540 --> 58:57.580
you learn about demigods and you learn about their Zeus

58:57.580 --> 58:58.740
and then he's got a whole bunch of people

58:58.740 --> 59:01.060
that are like half here and they're half human,

59:01.060 --> 59:01.900
they're half gods.

59:01.900 --> 59:03.860
And that is who you look to to learn like,

59:03.860 --> 59:05.980
how the fuck to grow grain and like,

59:05.980 --> 59:08.540
how not to get smoked essentially.

59:08.540 --> 59:11.420
But I mean, between that and like sun gods

59:11.420 --> 59:14.260
and gods of rain, I think, and royalty through,

59:14.260 --> 59:16.980
before we had media, the kind of technology

59:16.980 --> 59:19.980
that we have now to be like so in everyone's face,

59:19.980 --> 59:22.020
we always needed something to guide us.

59:22.020 --> 59:23.420
We needed to hear Hermes fuck the swan.

59:23.420 --> 59:25.580
Yeah, we needed something to guide us.

59:25.580 --> 59:28.380
Back when there was only the radio and before TV,

59:28.380 --> 59:30.540
and then when there was TV, there was three channels

59:30.540 --> 59:32.540
and then there was five and then there was a million.

59:32.540 --> 59:35.140
And now there's everybody has a podcast

59:35.140 --> 59:37.060
and a YouTube channel and stuff like that.

59:37.060 --> 59:39.700
We still want to classify the people around us,

59:39.700 --> 59:42.580
the celebrities that we choose to put on pedestals.

59:42.580 --> 59:43.940
And the reason why we erect pedestals

59:43.940 --> 59:46.300
is for the purpose of knocking them off them

59:46.300 --> 59:47.740
when that happens.

59:47.740 --> 59:51.060
In that fucking glory, glorious two weeks

59:51.060 --> 59:52.900
when Charlie Sheen was becoming the greatest thing

59:52.900 --> 59:54.100
that ever fucking happened,

59:54.100 --> 59:56.820
everybody was just like, okay, this is fucking exciting.

59:56.820 --> 59:59.580
Whether or not you loved it, hated it, didn't give a shit,

59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.140
you were violently indifferent to it, you were indifferent to it.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.340
And in a slow news week,

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.620
if Dan and Chevy Chase get in the fight,

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.180
that's because Charlie Sheen isn't doing it

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.140
on a fucking way bigger level.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.140
We do need to cast part-

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.060
I'm offended by that?

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:13.900
Yeah.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:14.740
Well, no.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.580
I'm kidding about that.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.060
I'm saying, well, you aren't.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:21.060
We have to cast our, I don't wanna joke.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.860
I'm definitely kidding about wanting to be more famous

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:24.860
than Charlie Sheen.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:28.700
I'd say that we have to cast our gods and demi-gods.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.620
We have to create our Mount Olympus at all times.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:31.940
Now it's so devious

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.300
because we have a million Charlie Sheens, a very-

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.420
I agree with all of you.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.060
I think that the reason why,

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:43.060
I think that in days when media was very, very limited

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.620
where it was just one-way transmission of imagery,

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.380
then we had that perfect harmony with that golden age

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.740
where it basically supplanted what you're describing

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.980
in ancient Greek, ancient Roman society

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:57.020
where you had the mystery gods and I worship Isis

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.300
and I have a statue of Soto.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.340
Yeah, but did you hear Isis?

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.980
So is the reason why there was a flood last week?

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.020
Yeah, fuck that bitch.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:02.860
All right, she's all right.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.700
She's all right.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.460
You know, like it was sort of like,

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:10.260
it was gossip and soap opera all tied into religion

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.460
and it was civic and it worked as long as a society worked

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.900
and then the barbarians at the gate

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.820
and then the monotheism and whatever.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.820
The only thing that I'm saying is that nowadays,

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.700
now that we have so much access to everything,

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:30.700
we're coming off of an industry where the concept

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:37.180
of fame and celebrity had so much dollar value per ounce

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:42.420
that it's incompatible right now

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:48.020
that you would hold the third lead of vampire diaries

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.500
or someone whose blog is taking off

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.580
to this Keri Grant kind of standard.

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:59.140
It's where we're seeing as a sort of a blender of weirdness.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:03.020
I certainly feel that way as a person who never wanted

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.100
to be regarded as anything in particular

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.900
except by a couple of people.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.180
Like that's what I'm saying is that there's a lot

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.980
of fame to go around and I do think we will always

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.540
have George Clooney's that we can launch to the moon

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.020
and we can watch them explode in space.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.900
Now fame is so, I think the idea now

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:26.700
because the internet being what it is,

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.300
the amount of efficacy people have

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.740
that they can rumble you and you can be rumbled

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.380
and then the Kraken can come out from the sea

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.420
and start laying waste and start like engaging

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:36.820
like the town spoke.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.380
But also, I think people see fame as something

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.460
much more attainable now because you can become like a-

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.180
And they should, everyone can be famous.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.020
That's what I wonder about.

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.700
Look at it that way first.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.700
You can't stop looking at your life as miserable

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.500
and start realizing that although it doesn't pay anything

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:56.300
tomorrow, you can be seen by a million people.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.220
Everybody can be famous and that's why every fucking day

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.980
you turn the TV on is some guy who shot up a school.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.540
Everybody can be famous.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.660
Those people are having a fucking breakdown

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.220
because of some kind of like, I think-

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.060
Because they don't matter.

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:08.900
They don't matter.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.740
They don't matter.

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.580
And that's why you make the 17 videos.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.580
And they're sensing that they're supposed to matter.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.820
Now there's recourse.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.660
I don't exist.

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.500
I can exist for 48 hours in the fucking national media.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.860
Like I can be notorious.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:23.660
I can trade in all my mortgage and all my moms yelling at me

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.180
or whatever the situation I'm in.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.940
I'm gonna kill myself anyway.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:30.620
I think I'll go blow away a syrup factory.

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:33.020
Yeah, I'll be a shitty John Wilkes.

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.660
Because they make sweets.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.740
I'll be a John Wilkes booth, kind of, you know.

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.580
I'll be a-

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:43.460
We've made fame, something that you can't just choose.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.060
The tribe has to choose who gets on the pedestal

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.940
and the tribe gets to stand around that pedestal

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:49.860
and decide whether or not-

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.540
It's a holdover for the idea that everyone knowing

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.980
who you are equated to money.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.820
That's the thing.

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.460
That's what I was gonna say is, I think that some,

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.060
you know, it seems like you won the lotto.

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.340
Like why Jennifer Lawrence than some other blonde actress?

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.380
Like it could've been anyone.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.660
And, you know, the third lead on whatever,

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.540
the vampire diaries is making so much fucking money

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.780
off of that, right?

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:14.180
And everyone, it seems like an easy thing to attain.

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.100
These American Idol shows and things like that.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.980
Like, I don't know how these people fare afterward,

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.860
but the miracle of that show is that they actually,

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.540
now you're just famous because you're an American Idol

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.220
because it's a fucking popular show.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.300
But my god, that promise of like,

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.060
and the winner will be a famous singer.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.620
Yeah, just like that.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:33.460
But that's also very-

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.220
They kind of end up being a famous singer

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.460
because everyone was watching that show.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.860
Lasted 20 years, it was Major League Baseball.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.740
But like, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it.

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.580
That's American though.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.420
That's a weird America.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:48.260
Yeah, American expansion was based on like,

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.140
shit, there's gold and everyone ran to it.

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.580
And like, and you know, California was settled

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.820
because we had gold up north and we had movies down here.

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.380
So we had like gold and fame.

01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.060
And so that's the only reason why any of you are sitting here.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.300
To you, to, to expand on that metaphor,

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.620
because there was only so much you can do

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:07.140
with a pickaxe or a stick of dynamite.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.460
There's only so much gold you can get out of the earth.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:13.340
And then, if you have the technology to point a ray

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:17.300
and just go, and scan the planet and go,

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.780
this planet is 10% gold.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.980
Okay, I'll take it, fuck the planet, move away.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.900
That's what the internet is.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.460
Whatever you have to offer, give it to me.

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.220
I'll take it for free.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.260
I'll download it.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.420
I don't care.

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.540
There's no, it's not gold.

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.700
Maybe the gold is limited because of the gold is talent,

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.540
but fucking, I'll take it.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.860
And I'm not gonna pay you that much for it.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.060
Like, and Snickers ain't gonna get paid for it.

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.660
And Nike ain't gonna get paid for it.

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.700
Like, those are the days in which we live.

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.700
So, all of us people who wanna be heard

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.780
and wanna, like, like our narcissists

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.580
and want to output stuff,

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.060
we're living in the golden age,

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.020
but we're not gonna get any money for it.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.780
Right not, although, I don't know.

01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:00.180
Well, I think if McDonald's offered us any money,

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.260
I think I would have.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.340
No, you take it, they're not going to.

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.180
I would say no.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.140
But I mean, that's the thing is like,

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:09.260
is we have one dumb video that led to now,

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.620
this is our job, this is our career.

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.500
I make more now than I ever did at the times.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.820
And at the times, also, if we wanted coffee creamer,

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.420
we had to pay 15 cents.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.140
And once I had to look under my floor mats

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.740
in my 1993 Subaru to buy coffee creamer.

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.740
I only charge her 10 cents for coffee creamer.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:23.580
That's true.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.540
But I mean, but that's the thing is it is,

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.980
it is that gold rush.

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.460
And it is, it is that idea that like anyone here,

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.940
sitting in front of us or listening to this,

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.780
could have some idea that no one's ever really had.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.340
And then in 72 hours, someone's aunt would be like,

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.540
did you see the thing?

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.380
And then all the door opens.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.220
They absolutely can.

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:41.060
There's within their power.

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.340
Then there's something, they're okay.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.260
You can look at that two ways.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.340
You can look at that as like gross.

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.460
Everyone needs validation.

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.300
Everyone wants to be famous.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.140
Everyone's a whore.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.620
Oh my God, who's gonna notice me?

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:49.620
My bucket has a hole in it.

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.420
Or you can look at it as we have a platform and a voice.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:57.420
We, essentially, everyone in like 2005 was handed a megaphone.

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.660
And it's very loud and it's very noisy,

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:00.500
but everyone has more.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.580
But our areas are just, so that's how people talk now.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.780
I think it's great that everyone has a podcast.

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:09.780
When I got a podcast, I was the 450 millionth person.

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:13.420
There was no way I was gonna convince myself

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.180
that I was doing anything innovative by saying,

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.060
I'm gonna have a podcast.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.500
I bit that bullet.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.780
I was like, yeah, but podcasts are awesome.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.940
That's just, there's the alternatives of people tweeting

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.660
about like, everyone's got a podcast.

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.980
What, where is that gonna get you?

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.980
I'm all over the place, but I'm just saying like,

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.220
and I don't think this issue needs to be resolved.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.980
I have another issue with this,

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:37.820
but that brings up a really important question.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.180
And that is, on different social media platforms,

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.380
you have a really different tonal way

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.860
of representing yourself and your life.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.860
And Twitter, it's, oh, I'm so fucking miserable.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.900
Oh, you haven't changed my pants in five days.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.340
Blah, and I don't have a boyfriend.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.820
And then, and then on Instagram.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:57.180
You're obviously following Questlove.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.020
Yeah.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:01.660
Hillary Clinton, official.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.940
But no, and then on Instagram, it's like,

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.060
well, isn't that nice?

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.380
And then on Facebook, it's like,

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.100
I am so grateful for my family.

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.300
So you represent yourself.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.820
And then Tumblr, it's like,

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:14.980
I cannot believe what happened yesterday.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.380
But I mean, that's a weird, and that's weird.

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:20.020
How dare he, in that interview,

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:22.540
suggest that Jeff and Annie's relationship

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.420
had something to do with the schoolgirl crush.

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.260
All right, you're projecting.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.260
I'm gonna kill myself right now if no one stops me.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.860
You're projecting, and that is a very,

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.700
that's a limited scope of your experience,

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.700
but I believe you.

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.420
Then I may scroll down to the cat meme.

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.780
Right now on Twitter, I'm not like,

01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:37.500
the world's biggest tweeter.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.660
I do it once in a while.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.500
I'm going through a fucking crisis.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.980
I have been for a long time now,

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.220
been confused with Jeff Davis,

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.540
the creator of Criminal Minds,

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.340
and now the television's Teen Wolf.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.260
Oh, dear.

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:50.820
There's a guy named fucking-

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.740
Is there a guy that makes shows that has your name?

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:57.220
And once I was told by my accounts,

01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.620
our accounts, we had the same accountancy, people,

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.980
that hey, you, BLS limo,

01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.500
you used a limo service for something,

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.220
and it got charged to another Jeff Davis,

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.580
but we sorted it out.

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.740
My credit card was shut off a couple months ago

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:13.140
because my accountant called me up and said,

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.660
did you just spend $5,000 on limos last night?

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:16.500
I'm like, no.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.180
They go, okay, that's Criminal Minds, Teen Wolf,

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:20.020
Jeff Davis.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:20.860
I go, can you-

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.700
I had no idea.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.540
No, but God.

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.380
I said, can you tell BLS limo

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.660
to get their shit together as I've left them?

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:29.300
And also BLS, if you let me, go, pfft, thumbs down.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.420
You need a middle name, like Minotaur.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.980
My name is Brian because of SAG.

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.980
There's a million Jeff Davis.

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:38.300
I am Jeff Brian, or Jeff B. Davis, rather.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.100
I'm Jeff B. Davis, for that reason,

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:42.540
because there's a long line for Jeff Davis's out there.

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:43.820
No, you need to throw a Muhammad in there.

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:44.820
You need to do something.

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:45.660
Muhammad, yes.

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.060
Or you need to go for Heartstack,

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.780
which is not George's last name, it's Heartstark,

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:49.620
but everyone missed it.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.020
Well, Ally has an E on the end of her name

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:51.860
because of that reason.

01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.780
Oh yeah, I did search engine optimization on my name

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:55.860
and I changed my identity.

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.020
Hi.

01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.500
My name is Ally Ward, but it was ALI, and then Ward.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.980
And then 2011 happened, 2011.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.580
2000, and September 11th happened.

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.420
Hi.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.260
When?

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.100
I don't know.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.420
I already fucking forgot.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.340
I, oh, never forget.

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.860
There's a mnemonic device, if you want to remember 9-11.

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.020
I have a posted note on my mirror that's like,

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.420
don't forget the thing.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:20.780
September 2000, the thing?

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.620
I know.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.700
But after that, people would call me Ally all the time,

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.060
and I was like, this is getting confusing.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.860
And then I started writing for a newspaper,

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.140
and there was another journalist named Ally Ward,

01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.820
spelled with no E, and she was a horticulturist in Britain.

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:35.380
And so people would be like, hi, I'd

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.740
love for her to ask about tulip bulbs.

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:38.980
And I was like, fuck you.

01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.060
And so I put an E on the end.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:44.060
I Googled Ally Ward with an E. No one else, zero search results.

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.740
And I was like, all right, that's my new name.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.900
And now my parents, when they write to me, they don't,

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.100
they put, sometimes it in E. No, no, take it off.

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:51.540
Allison?

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:51.860
Allison.

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.620
They don't know what to call me, and I'm like, hi,

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.460
I'm the chick with the E on the end of the name.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.660
You know, when I was younger, I got

01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.860
made fun of for my name, like both the first and last

01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.780
so fucking much.

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.980
But now I'm so.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.260
George, I'm nearly a pot.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.020
Georgia Hardstark in the world.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.260
You have the name of a dead woman.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.340
It's Georgia Miriam Hardstark.

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.340
House Hardstark.

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.340
What the hell is that?

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.380
Oh, I get a lot of the guys come up to me, like, do you

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.260
watch Game of Thrones?

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.060
Because your last name is really.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:16.020
What is it in Game of Thrones?

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:17.340
It's like House Stark, right?

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:17.840
Is it?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.340
Your house.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.660
Who's, where are my nerds at?

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:20.660
Woo!

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.020
I hear there's tons of tits and tits.

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.100
If you go on my Twitter timeline right now, look,

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.580
90 fucking percent of it is a bunch of people

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.020
going, like, naming characters.

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.140
Like, oh my god, this is the best thing

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:29.860
that ever happened.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.380
So-and-so, they make that with so-and-so.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.420
And then it's everybody replying to everybody,

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.700
including the official MTV Teen Wolf sites.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:41.660
So before this quite escalated, I wrote a tweet a while back,

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:43.180
like, a couple weeks ago, and said,

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.620
to the people following me that have confused me with Jeff

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.460
Davis' creator of TV's Teen Wolf,

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.380
don't you think it's weird that I've never tweeted

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.140
about Teen Wolf?

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.300
And then I said, you know what?

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.060
Fuck it.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.460
I have never seen the show, but I'm going to do a Q&A.

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:58.020
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.740
So I've never seen the show, but I

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:01.860
am not the creator of Teen Wolf.

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.820
I'm going to do a brief Teen Wolf Q&A.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.180
So people are like, how do you know when a Teen Wolf

01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.060
goes through puberty?

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:07.820
Harry or balls?

01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:10.020
I was just like, stupid shit like that.

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.500
And what's it going to be called when he's not a teenager

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:12.980
anymore?

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.580
It's just going to be called wolf.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.900
So I did five of those and said, thank you.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.860
I hope I answered your Teen Wolf questions.

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.900
Sincerely, Jeff Davis creator of Teen Wolf.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.900
But also, I called the cast a bunch of pricks,

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:28.060
and I said I had a methadone addiction.

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.340
So there was something like online news thing.

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:33.260
Like the dots or I don't know what it was fucking called.

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.740
Did some funny article and they said like, the wrong Jeff

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:39.020
Davis answers your Teen Wolf questions.

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.820
And they got like, it's comedian Jeff Davis, Jeff Brian

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.980
Davis, because apparently this guy, Jeff Davis,

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.020
had gone offline of Twitter a couple of years ago.

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:50.220
Probably because he's truly disliked because most of the

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:53.780
shit I get on my time, I was like, fuck you, you're Satan.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:57.980
I'm like, hey, whose line shouldn't be taken that serious?

01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.460
We got to get this guy on the show.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.300
Please, Jeff Davis.

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.540
So actually, the Teen Wolf people said like, that was

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.660
hilarious, thank you.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.620
But with all of that, because people that watch the show,

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.220
God bless them.

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:11.620
I'm sure they're lovely people, but I would guess younger.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.740
And irony, not their fort.

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.860
So I cast them, not their bag, neither the bread,

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:21.500
nor their butter.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.980
And so now, because of that, I have so many more followers

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.060
to think I'm the creator of Teen Wolf.

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:33.140
And so I've just gone on begging MTV, please set the fucking

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.860
record straight on this one.

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:39.620
My timeline right now is a fucking absolute morass of people

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.860
saying things I have no idea what they're talking about.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.820
Do you have dueling wikis?

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.260
Dueling wikis, by the way, name of my autobiography.

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.740
No, do you have dueling wikipedias?

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.340
What the hell was that?

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:50.580
Oh, it's fine.

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.060
Her jazzle phone.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.300
It was blowing up too much.

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.580
Oh, don't worry about it.

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.100
Do you have dueling wikipedias?

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.060
I don't know what that is.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:01.020
Like, did you have Jeff Davis and Jeff TV?

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.980
Oh, my wikipedia page is so fucking absolutely fallacious.

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:05.940
I've tried to change it.

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.260
I'm not allowed to change it.

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.300
I'm still dating a person I've never met.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:20.780
I created Calcium, I'm the vice-roy of Bengal.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:23.900
I won't go to mine because people that hate me,

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.060
I cross the tipping part.

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.780
I don't Google myself, and I won't wikipedia myself,

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.660
because sometimes there'll just be a paragraph in there

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:34.100
that's like, fat asshole Dan Harmon is a fat fuck

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.620
and a fat piece of shit.

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:38.420
If it was just that, it would be great.

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:41.540
But it's the insinuation that I'm a bad person with bad values.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:44.060
That's what gets under my skin.

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:47.220
When I was in my 20s, and Google was first a thing,

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.820
and I would Google my own name.

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:53.660
And there was a little blend of like, oh, I've done some stuff.

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:57.140
And it's a dim recollection of wishing

01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.420
that I was like, oh, I wish I was.

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.780
Because there was another guy who

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:07.420
was like a district attorney of Arkansas named Dan Harmon,

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.940
who had participated in the assassination of two kids who

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.100
were walking down a railroad track

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:16.380
and stumbled onto a drug deal between cops and drug dealers.

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:17.580
Can assassinate kids?

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.100
Yeah.

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:22.300
Well, if they witnessed the drug deal between cops

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:26.020
and drug dealers, and the two kids were just blown away.

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.860
And Dan Harmon was the district attorney,

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:31.940
I want to say, or attorney general of the state

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:32.820
or something like that.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:33.940
Would you Google my name?

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:34.700
Oh, you're not done.

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.820
And so it was just like, I kept.

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:38.300
Wow.

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:41.900
I would Google my name, and I would look at the first three

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.060
results, and I would be like, fuck this fucking guy

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.540
that murdered two kids.

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.580
One day I'm going to be more famous than him.

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.060
I would really think that in my head.

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.020
I'm like, I'm the one day I'm going to fucking

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.980
trump this guy for the murder of two children.

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.260
Be careful what you wish for.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.380
Also, a name for a noose in the south

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.460
is a Jeff Davis necktie.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.860
There's a famous Jeff Davis out there, and he went, yeah.

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.140
When you Google my name, which I don't do often because it's

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:12.780
fucking terrible for yourself, but three years ago,

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:16.820
I wrote for a deal breaker blog, a deal breaker,

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.060
if you share custody of a pet with your ex,

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.100
that's a deal breaker.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.940
And some fucking guy, if you Google

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:27.340
my name, it says why Georgia Heartstark will die alone.

01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.780
Not literally word for word, and you click on it,

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.420
and it's just tearing me apart for having that opinion.

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.220
And you're really a guy that shared a bulldog,

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:36.380
where they're like a fucking obnoxious.

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.260
Every time people, I think, well, Google me,

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.900
they'll click it because it's terrifying,

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.340
and so it stays up on the top of the Google list.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.500
So my grandma is 103 if she fucking.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.060
She does not get a little shit, dude.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.700
Whatever, my aunt, she's like, ever life potion.

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.900
Like your grandma doesn't get it.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.900
Hey, Dan, can we bring Spencer up?

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.660
Well, we should bid goodbye to our guests.

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.020
I don't know if there's other guests.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.500
We're blind on dead grandma.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:04.100
We have to, but would you?

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.100
I was saying, if you're welcome to stay,

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.420
as far as I'm concerned, but I think it's time

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.260
to have Spencer come.

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.100
Well, I think we're going to bring Aaron up,

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:09.940
we're going to bring Spencer up,

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.780
and we're going to play D&D.

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.580
So I would give our guests the broom,

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:16.180
but you've pointed it out now.

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.500
No, no, we're out of here.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.100
I'm sorry, I just assumed they were staying with us.

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:19.940
No, we're out of here.

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:21.420
We'll watch the D&D from the Wings.

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:22.740
I still have a Magic the Gathering deck

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.100
in case anyone wants to play.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:26.020
Thank you, everyone!

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:27.860
All right, well, let's thank Allie and Georgia

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:28.820
for coming by.

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:29.660
Thank you.

01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:31.380
Wonderful.

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.260
We all have a Magic the Gathering deck.

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:36.020
We all have a Magic the Gathering.

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.020
Woo!

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.020
Woo!

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.020
Woo!

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.020
Woo!

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:41.020
Woo!

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:42.020
Woo!

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.020
Woo!

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.020
Woo!

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.020
Woo!

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.020
Woo!

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.020
Woo!

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.020
Woo!

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.820
Allie and Georgia, everybody.

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:50.820
Woo!

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.820
Woo!

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:57.820
Oh, I assumed they were staying. I didn't mean to give them the hook.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.820
Yeah, man, I was trying to get rid of them and you fucked it up.

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.820
Or I just put the pedal to the metal.

01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.820
Oh, yeah. I guess you forced the issue. That's for sure.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:07.820
Well, let's bring Spencer out, shall we?

01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.820
Spencer!

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:14.820
Whoa!

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:23.820
Spencer, you leapt to the stage like a desert breeze.

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.820
Yeah, I'm all over the place today.

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:26.820
How you doing, man?

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:31.820
I'm out of sorts. I mean, everyone who's not listening to the podcast will know.

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.820
I look like shit. I smell like shit.

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:42.820
I woke up bad. I threatened the life of an elderly lady today.

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:44.820
Alright, go with that. Let's go with that.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:48.820
What occasion do you threaten the life of an elderly lady?

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:53.820
Drive in on near target Lebrea.

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:58.820
There was this old woman who had the crazed look of a homeless person,

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:03.820
but the well-dressedness of a lady going to church.

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:10.820
She was wandering in the street like those hobos do when they're going up and down the aisles looking for change.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:17.820
But she was just making the most craven stare like at people and then like walking towards them

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:20.820
if they gave any indication of noticing her existence.

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:26.820
And I slipped up. I slipped up. I gave one glance and the next thing I know,

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:31.820
she was right at the corner of my car, like right in front of it, like just...

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:37.820
And my window was down. I think that might be why she was targeting me because, you know,

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:40.820
I could hear her potentially, but she didn't say anything.

01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:43.820
She was just staring at me and then the light turns green.

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.820
You'd think it was because she was trying to cross the street, but it wasn't.

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:52.820
But she started to go in front of my car to make as if she was going to walk in front of my car,

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:56.820
make an eye contact all this time, like, you know what's going to happen.

01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.820
I don't know what's going to happen. What are you planning, old lady?

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:07.820
But so my window was rolled down and so I cut around her and like sped off and I was like,

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.820
I will end your life!

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.820
You said that? I will end your life?

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:17.820
Yeah. As you drove away, you could have just done it.

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.820
I know. And I wanted her to know that.

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.820
I could have just plowed straight through her and had a great say.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:31.820
You drove around her but said, I saved you this day, but I will in the future end your life.

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:32.820
Yeah.

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:37.820
What did that lady say at the drive through in that YouTube video when she couldn't get her chicken McNuggets?

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:38.820
You know what I'm talking about?

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.820
I will achieve my ultimate form.

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.820
You just don't want me to achieve my ultimate form.

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.820
It seems like this is now a thing.

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:51.820
I mean, because really you said that in a rage. That's what you said.

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.820
I am an ageist. I have a problem with old people.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.820
I will end your life. Not I will run you over. I will kill you.

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.820
Fuck off, old lady.

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.820
I said fuck you under my breath and then I went into...

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.820
I will end your life.

01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:05.820
Yeah.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:11.820
It just feels like we're becoming a society of video games.

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:16.820
No, I'd love to be able to end the lives of the elderly.

01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:23.820
I'd love to have the composure to word my outrage like that.

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.820
I had no idea what she was planning.

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:33.820
If I was trying to get the attention of a motorist, I would make eye contact and then maybe gesture at them

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:37.820
and maybe mouth a few words, get their attention, you know?

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:44.820
And then once they had my attention, I'd maybe sidle up to the side of the car and maybe say anything at all.

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:50.820
Or, you know, do anything other than walk in front of my car right the second that the light is turning green

01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.820
without the intent to cross the street. I don't know.

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.820
Is it possible she was just kind of like a demented...

01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:59.820
Well, that's even worse for me. I want to kill those people too.

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:00.820
Wow.

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:02.820
I got a lot of problems.

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:07.820
Yeah. You're about, I don't know, 70 years too late for that, man.

01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.820
There was a time.

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.820
I know.

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.820
I got to catch up.

01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.820
Let's bring out my betrothed, Erin McGathy.

01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:17.820
Erin McGathy!

01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.820
Thanks for coming, Erin. Erin McGathy, everybody.

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:37.820
Wow.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.820
Short interview.

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:39.820
Allie and Georgia.

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:40.820
Yeah.

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:41.820
I love Allie and Georgia.

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.820
I just remember when we were in that restaurant, when we were in the Rustic Inn and I yelled at that guy.

01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:50.820
I told that story of the podcast where the guy like yelled at us at the end of a lunch for swearing during lunch.

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.820
And I just blurted out.

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.820
You mean Tamo Shanta, right?

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.820
Yeah. He said, oh yeah, I said Rustic Inn.

01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:01.820
He said, he said, if you guys want to talk like you're at a truck stop, why don't you eat at one?

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:07.820
And I just blurted out like, if you want to tell people how to talk, why don't you go back to Germany?

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:16.820
In my most outraged moments, I am not the most articulate.

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:18.820
Do we tell the dog that's not true?

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:24.820
You've been outraged and been overly articulate and decimated people or eviscerated people.

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:28.820
Well, who's the guy that came by in the hat at that big foot lodge?

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.820
And we saw him and he had a fedora on and suspenders and he was kind of one of those guys.

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:36.820
He was exactly one of those.

01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.820
He might have known swing dance.

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:43.820
And actually, I knew him from the old swing dance days.

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:46.820
So there you have it.

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:50.820
But he was like, hey Jeff, I'm so-and-so, I'm so-and-so.

01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:54.820
And he kind of like pistol winks and you know, and he moved off and we didn't leave.

01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:58.820
And two hours later, he comes by like, you guys still in the same booth?

01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.820
And I forget what you said, but it was a fucking goodie.

01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:06.820
I said, well, count your blessings if it weren't for people like us that didn't move, you wouldn't know.

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.820
You'd lose your stripes, Magellan.

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:14.820
But I wasn't mad at him. I just hated him. I wanted him to die.

01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:17.820
You weren't mad at him, you just wanted him to know.

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:22.820
I'm in a fight or flight response. I'm not going to be like Jonathan Swift.

01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.820
It's when I'm in a surly mood.

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:31.820
If I've been drinking and I just want to be left alone and someone comes up to me and does one of those things

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:36.820
where they wave their hand in front of your face because you're not making enough eye contact,

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:42.820
or they say like that guy did, like he implied that I should have been moving more.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:52.820
I would gladly watch that guy just like descend on a spike onto a bunch of other spikes.

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:59.820
I don't know how torture works, but I hate murder.

01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:05.820
I'm in a surly, surly leave me alone mood.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:08.820
I'm kind of in the mood to get a good session of D&D. Are you guys down for that?

01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:10.820
I don't know.

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.820
I feel like the last couple, we didn't get shit done.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.820
Oh, dear heavens.

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.820
Now we know why.

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:24.820
Aaron, do you have anything to even building up pressure back there?

01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:29.820
I'm doing great.

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:32.820
I am enjoying the show so far.

01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:37.820
I'm a little distracted by our recent wedding planning.

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.820
We're not going to talk about that because we want it to be special, right?

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.820
Yeah, yeah. No, we're not going to talk about it.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:48.820
But backstage I was just talking to our friends and floating on a happy cloud.

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:52.820
So I was listening to the episode, I Love Valley in Georgia, which is enjoying there.

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.820
They're all right.

01:25:54.820 --> 01:26:01.820
The wedding thing does, it's kind of cool to have to pick seven groomsmen.

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:05.820
It's like when you're a kid picking action figures.

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:08.820
I mean, you guys just got slumber parties and stuff while you were talking about that.

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:16.820
I was thinking about my bachelorette party and what that means and being able to pick people for that.

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:20.820
And like you said, being able to pick bridesmaids and groomsmen.

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:25.820
It's a weird position for like an outcast to be in.

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.820
But it's great. It's so fun.

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:34.820
But as far as like building up steam, I've just been right in this high, man.

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:40.820
We went to our wedding venue yesterday and I am still right in that high.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:41.820
It's going to be good.

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:47.820
Are we going to be the first people to get married that don't almost get divorced during the planning of the wedding?

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:49.820
Are we going to be able to pull this off?

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.820
I hope so. Is that a life trope?

01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:56.820
It just seems like everyone I've ever talked to when they're planning their wedding.

01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:59.820
How involved are you going to be in this planning, Dan?

01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:01.820
So far 100%.

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.820
I would like to think that everything that I don't care about is stuff that Aaron cares about.

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:11.820
Have you chosen to be very involved or very not involved?

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.820
I want it to be a good wedding.

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:17.820
I'm not going to baby out.

01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:21.820
I'm not going to go, just tell me where I'm getting married.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.820
And then also complain about everything.

01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:25.820
I have a lot of opinions about weddings.

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.820
I have gone to a lot of them.

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:32.820
And so I want to make sure the sound system is fucking whip ass.

01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:38.820
I don't want to hear a crackle or a fucking hum during those goddamn shitty self-written vows.

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:44.820
I don't want any of this shit that always bugs the fuck out of me when I go to weddings

01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:46.820
to bug the fuck out of anybody that goes to my wedding.

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.820
So I have a lot of opinions about that stuff.

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.820
I don't want to jinx it, but so far...

01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:52.820
If I did, it would go a little something.

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.820
Like this.

01:27:54.820 --> 01:28:02.820
So I mean, I wasn't one of those little girls who dreamed about her wedding, so now as an adult

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:05.820
I'm getting to dream about it from scratch.

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:10.820
But all of my really specific, passionate ideas match with dance.

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:16.820
And I don't feel, you guys will see, it's just going to get weird at our wedding.

01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:25.820
But it's all very specific and works with, it's the same as your vision.

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:26.820
So it's all great.

01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:27.820
I had a dream about your wedding.

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:29.820
You can't go though, you're not invited.

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.820
When is it?

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:33.820
I'm out of town.

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:39.820
I had a dream about your wedding that you would ask me to emcee it, not officiate it.

01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.820
But to be like the emcee, like kind of bring people up.

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:47.820
And then Dan panicked and just went out there and just started roasting everybody.

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:52.820
And Dan just did a big roast.

01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:56.820
And then there was a dolphin playing violin.

01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:01.820
So you were there at our session with our wedding planner.

01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:03.820
All right.

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:08.820
Spencer, have you been enjoying being my assistant?

01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.820
Yeah, I feel like I've been slipping lately.

01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.820
I'm not sure, not sure.

01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:14.820
Exactly.

01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:15.820
Because I don't need an assistant lately.

01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:16.820
Is that what it is?

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:17.820
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:18.820
So it's been an easy job.

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.820
Okay.

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.820
You should high five yourself.

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.820
It's easy.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:22.820
Dan doesn't have a house here.

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.820
I'm a more alcoholic.

01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:24.820
Yeah?

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:25.820
He doesn't have a house here.

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.820
I will go get one right now.

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:28.820
I have a copy.

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:29.820
I know.

01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:33.820
I also need a, I need my key fob for my Prius replaced.

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:37.820
That's the one that you like hold near the door and then it opens.

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:40.820
What, what are you, an alien?

01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:43.820
If that were, no, you have to push a button.

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:46.820
I don't know why I'm so offended by that.

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:50.820
Your car doesn't have a smart key access where it opens up just because it knows your keys are up on here.

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.820
Well, it does.

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:53.820
He has to push the button, but if he doesn't have the key fob, it won't work.

01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:54.820
Right.

01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.820
Yeah.

01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:56.820
It's, it's, it's fallen apart.

01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:00.820
I've, I've, I've dropped it and it's, I need a new one.

01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:01.820
All right.

01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:02.820
That's something to work on.

01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:03.820
Let me write that down.

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:04.820
Yeah.

01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:05.820
So now you're a good assistant.

01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.820
Spencer, do you have any critiques for Dan as an employer?

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.820
No, no, you're doing an amazing job.

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:13.820
I think you could stand a gain a few pounds.

01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:14.820
I like this guy.

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:15.820
Yeah.

01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:16.820
You know what?

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:19.820
You're promoted to senior assistant.

01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:23.820
He just became platinum assistant.

01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.820
Spencer, you ready to roll on this DND?

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:26.820
Yeah, sure.

01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:27.820
Let's say we,

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:36.820
How exciting is it to see the Harmon Quest animation?

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:39.820
It's really exciting.

01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:40.820
I'm terrified.

01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:44.820
I've never, you know, I'm just a fucking guy and now I have this thing.

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.820
And now there's a cartoon of you.

01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:46.820
Yeah.

01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:47.820
Yeah.

01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:48.820
That's awesome.

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.820
That's pretty incredible.

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:51.820
How do you, how do you feel about that cartoon?

01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:52.820
I feel good.

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:56.820
I, I, I looked way too fat originally.

01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:58.820
I was like, I'm not saying I'm skinny.

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:02.820
I'm saying I'm tall and fat, not fat.

01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:03.820
No, I,

01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:04.820
There's a difference.

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:05.820
There's a difference.

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:06.820
I had to tell you like, yeah.

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.820
Go tell them you're not that fat.

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:09.820
I was like, I made you.

01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:10.820
Yeah.

01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:11.820
Your character is like an incredibly real tough.

01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:12.820
But he's an orc.

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:13.820
Like he's fine.

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:15.820
His character is like six foot seven.

01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:17.820
Like, and I was fatter and taller than him.

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:18.820
And I'm six foot four.

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:19.820
So that doesn't make sense, right?

01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:20.820
All right.

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:21.820
Meanwhile.

01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:22.820
Oh, Larry McGathey.

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.820
My animation is sexies.

01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:25.820
Fuck.

01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:26.820
Yeah.

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:27.820
Yeah.

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:28.820
You're like,

01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:29.820
Way sexier than I,

01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:30.820
Jessica Rabbit.

01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:31.820
Yeah.

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.820
And you could note it and be like,

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:35.820
This does not look like her at all.

01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:37.820
But instead it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:38.820
Totally in her mind.

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.820
That's what, that's what it is.

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:41.820
It's appropriate.

01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.820
I'm glad you like it.

01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:43.820
I love it.

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:45.820
I didn't want it to be like trivialized.

01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:46.820
No.

01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:47.820
Tribute.

01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:48.820
I was like,

01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:49.820
Your boobs.

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:50.820
I am.

01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:51.820
I am torn.

01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:52.820
I am torn in that way.

01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:55.820
And I say during the thing I describe myself as,

01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:57.820
it was very like busty and skinny.

01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:01.820
It's incredibly insulting for every feminist listening.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:02.820
I'm sure.

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:05.820
And I should also my, my dream also great.

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.820
Cause I'm, I'm, I'm marginalizing myself.

01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:08.820
I should just disclaim.

01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.820
I didn't actually like say anything.

01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:12.820
They did a great job on their own.

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:13.820
The artists.

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.820
Thank you for disclaiming.

01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:16.820
Yeah.

01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.820
I didn't want to have people think that it was my idea.

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.820
Well, now that's all we know.

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:21.820
Do we know what this is going to,

01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:22.820
would this be visible?

01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:23.820
When's this going to be done?

01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:24.820
No idea.

01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:25.820
That's, that's what's so crazy.

01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:26.820
That's what I never would have expected.

01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:30.820
Like because, you know, there's people who like wrote a pilot and took it around.

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:32.820
And then they get it shot.

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.820
And then they have a pilot in, in the works.

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.820
Like I just fell into that.

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:37.820
It's weird.

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:40.820
I feel bad for everybody else.

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.820
I'm going to make sure next week, next week's podcast,

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:46.820
we got to have like a civil rights activist on.

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:48.820
It was the last two weeks.

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:52.820
We've talked about how I don't understand women and how fat I'm getting

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.820
and how famous we all are.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:58.820
Just a mental note to myself.

01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:00.820
Okay.

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:05.820
That's the wrong sound.

01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.820
That's right.

01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:12.820
Someone who's desalinizing water off the coast of Africa or something.

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:15.820
Just to, just to gain something back that I think we've lost.

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:19.820
And that person just by proxy is a civil rights activist?

01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:22.820
No, I'm just riffing lists of possibilities.

01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.820
Someone special.

01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:29.820
Someone, someone humanizing.

01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:31.820
When we last met.

01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:32.820
Thank you.

01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:37.820
Our heroes were down a hole and up a creek, hundreds of feet below the earth.

01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:41.820
After landing in the dust, the group spied an approaching hissing skeleton

01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:44.820
with orange glowing hands.

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:46.820
His name was Lenev, the rebel.

01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:51.820
And he revealed to be, he revealed to the gang that Chris de Burgh was possessed

01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:53.820
by dark forces.

01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:54.820
The fates would have it.

01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:58.820
Lenev was also, also happened to reveal a cure to the heroes.

01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:01.820
The mythical, mystical tarragon of virtue.

01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:04.820
Then Chris de Burgh started shooting lasers all over the place

01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.820
and Mulraine had to restrain him,

01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.820
deftly crafting a, crafting a muscling manacle.

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:13.820
Then Quark took off the muzzle to make out with a possessed robe

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:16.820
which was an admittedly terrible idea.

01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:20.820
And in return received a mouth full of vomit.

01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:25.820
The appetite sated, the party departed for Tormator, the city of Unshackled Dead.

01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:28.820
But who was this mysterious skeleton?

01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:33.820
And why did he quickly drop his language of hisses within five minutes of meeting him?

01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:36.820
And why did his hands glow with an orange light?

01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:41.820
We'll find out next, maybe, probably not, I doubt it.

01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:50.820
How drunk were you last week?

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:55.820
I don't, I don't, that's like, that was like, hearing, like, this is what you did.

01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:58.820
That's what you sounded like when I was saying it then too, so.

01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:02.820
You told Trisha she was a, a racist?

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:05.820
Trisha, who's Trisha?

01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:08.820
Do we need a Chris de Burgh up here or are we going to go just to freestyle it with us?

01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:09.820
Can I be Chris de Burgh?

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:10.820
Yes, yes.

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:11.820
Sorry folks.

01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.820
Hey Chris de Burgh, how are you feeling?

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.820
Are you still possessed?

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:18.820
No, no, I mean, I'm fine.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.820
I sense, I sense motive on him.

01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:22.820
His eyes are glowing with rage.

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:23.820
Okay.

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:27.820
Do we find even untimely?

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:31.820
No, no, we're going to leave you, you vomit it out of my mouth, man.

01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.820
Yeah.

01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:36.820
Where do we find this tarragon of, of, of, of virtue?

01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:40.820
That's a weird thing to ask me, the person who's afflicted by it.

01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.820
Okay.

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.820
I, I, I asked the game, I asked the game master, because I forgot.

01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:47.820
Did he say where the tarragon of virtue lay?

01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:50.820
No, he said he'd take you to the bone sages.

01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.820
Uh, uh, Lenev, the rebel speaks up.

01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:54.820
I'm taking you to the bone sages now.

01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:55.820
All right, we'll follow you.

01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:56.820
You'll recall.

01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:57.820
Fantastic.

01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:58.820
Yeah.

01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.820
Let's, let's go to the bone sages.

01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:01.820
That sounds good.

01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:02.820
All right.

01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:07.820
As you trek through the dusty gray darkness, you're reminded of the hazy monochromatic

01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:12.820
look of the monochromatic look of the shadow plane.

01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:13.820
Ah.

01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.820
Remember this?

01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:15.820
Remember this fellas?

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:22.820
By several dark gray pillars and massive curved bones stab out of the ground like teeth.

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:23.820
The old shadow plane.

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:24.820
It's funny.

01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:28.820
It's funny when you come to call home when you've been so far.

01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:31.820
Ain't that the truth?

01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:34.820
I never thought I'd miss the shadow plane.

01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:41.820
And they're all we've been through.

01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:49.820
It's just good to be back in the shadow plane.

01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:51.820
Oh, so we're walking with a skeleton?

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.820
I don't know what the fuck.

01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:54.820
I swear to God.

01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:57.820
Like last week, I was just, I just, I don't know what happened.

01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:59.820
It wasn't, it wasn't along, it wasn't along.

01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:01.820
Tell me about the bone sages.

01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:02.820
Who are they?

01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:03.820
Oh, the bone sages.

01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:06.820
They, they, they, they see the future.

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.820
They know stuff.

01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.820
They're like, you know, normal, non-bone sages.

01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.820
Why, why is people, dude, advisors?

01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:16.820
They advise the magister of Tormod Tor.

01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:17.820
Are they, are they nearby?

01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:18.820
They're pretty nearby.

01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:20.820
We're getting close now.

01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:21.820
Okay, cool.

01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:22.820
Thank you, Lenev.

01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:23.820
I take Quirk aside.

01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:24.820
Who's Lenev?

01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:25.820
When did we meet her?

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.820
Is it, is she?

01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:27.820
I don't know what.

01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:31.820
He, or I would say, he was a hissing skeleton that had orange glowing hands that came out.

01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:32.820
Hissing skeleton, orange glowing hands.

01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:33.820
Yes.

01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.820
And then he stopped hissing and he started speaking.

01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:37.820
And, and just, here to help us.

01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:40.820
Yeah, he's, I look, I was there too, baby.

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:41.820
Okay.

01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:43.820
Hey, man.

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:48.820
I was just saying that, you know, I'm a skeleton, but I'm not a bad guy.

01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:51.820
But there's skeletons down here that are bad guys.

01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:52.820
For sure.

01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:54.820
How do we know that we can trust you, Lenev?

01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:57.820
I mean, I haven't eaten your faces.

01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:59.820
Oh, nor have you tried.

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.820
In which case you would invoke my fucking rage.

01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.820
That's learned was impossible.

01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:05.820
Sharpie, sharpie, sharpie.

01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:06.820
No, no, no.

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:07.820
I just want to make that clear.

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:12.820
I've run into too many people on this quest who have implied that they have power over me.

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:13.820
Nobody does.

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:16.820
I've been stomped by an ice giant.

01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:19.820
And I'm here, motherfucker.

01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:21.820
You eat my face.

01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:23.820
You eat it.

01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:28.820
You were so much more pleasant just five minutes ago.

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.820
He had a cup of coffee.

01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:31.820
I'm confused.

01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:35.820
You're thankful that I'm your friend.

01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:36.820
Sharpie.

01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.820
Not the other way around.

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:38.820
Sharpie.

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.820
You're lucky.

01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:40.820
Sharpie.

01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:41.820
You're lucky.

01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:42.820
Sharpie.

01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:44.820
When was luck invoked?

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:45.820
Sharpie.

01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.820
I just said I didn't attack you this time.

01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:51.820
Sharpie, just because you don't remember what happened five minutes ago doesn't make it his fault.

01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:52.820
Lenev.

01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:53.820
Okay, okay.

01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:54.820
I take Lenore aside.

01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:55.820
Can I take Lenore aside?

01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:56.820
Lenev.

01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:57.820
Lenev.

01:38:57.820 --> 01:38:58.820
Lenore.

01:38:58.820 --> 01:38:59.820
Lenev.

01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:00.820
Lenev.

01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:01.820
Listen.

01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:02.820
Fucking alcoholics.

01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:08.820
I'm going to tell you something that I don't feel like I can tell other people.

01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:09.820
Nope.

01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:11.820
I'm an alcoholic.

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:17.820
And it comes with all kinds of behaviors that...

01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.820
I'm sorry.

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:20.820
That's okay.

01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.820
But don't fuck with me.

01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:26.820
Don't assert dominance over me.

01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:28.820
What is dominance?

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.820
What you...

01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:34.820
You just implied a minute ago that I'm fortunate that you haven't eaten my face.

01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:35.820
Don't fucking deny it.

01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:36.820
No, I...

01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:38.820
He didn't categorically deny that.

01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.820
He didn't imply that you were lucky.

01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:42.820
He said, how do I know you were on our side?

01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.820
He goes, because if I weren't, I might eat your face.

01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:45.820
How many?

01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:46.820
Okay, well, I just want to correct that.

01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:49.820
If you weren't, you would try to eat my face.

01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:53.820
Astrosk, you'd fail.

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:57.820
As so many have before.

01:39:57.820 --> 01:39:59.820
Because I'm a fucking badass.

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:02.820
Because this is the game and not real life.

01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:04.820
Sharpie, let's...

01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:08.820
Sharpie, let's put this to the test and torment of terror.

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:14.820
As we go in search of the Tarragona virtue to save Christopher Berg from his possession.

01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.820
What?

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.820
Just...

01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:19.820
Just nod and go, all right, all right, okay.

01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:22.820
I was drunk last week and I'm sorry.

01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:23.820
You know what?

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:24.820
I won't lie.

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.820
I'm a little drunk this week.

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:27.820
It's not helping.

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:28.820
No.

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.820
I'm sober.

01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:31.820
What's your name?

01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:32.820
Lenore?

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:33.820
Lenev.

01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:34.820
Lenev.

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:35.820
Lenev.

01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:38.820
Okay, just like...

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:41.820
Let's both be thankful that we're friends.

01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:43.820
Fucking Sharpie, leave it.

01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:44.820
No one's fucking leave it.

01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.820
No one's benefiting.

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.820
Who's talking about thankfulness or friendship?

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:50.820
Are we still walking while this is happening?

01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:51.820
Are we...

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:53.820
Are we living while this is happening?

01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:54.820
This is like that Justin Bieber shit.

01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:57.820
You got all bent out of shape because they went to his house because he ate people.

01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:58.820
Somebody implies that...

01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:00.820
Oh, here's how you know if I wasn't your friend.

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:01.820
Your face would be...

01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:08.820
Hey, how many zombies that have been your friend did bit you in the face upon meeting you?

01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:09.820
None.

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:10.820
Yeah.

01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.820
Because none of those zombies were your friends.

01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:19.820
I approached Sharpie and I used my fingers to do like the walking up spider motion up

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:21.820
his arm to his shoulder.

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.820
I slap it away.

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:30.820
I'm just saying, I just want to clarify, here's where our culture gap is.

01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:32.820
I really thought we were...

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.820
In movies.

01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.820
I start eating dirt.

01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:35.820
In movies.

01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:37.820
You know what else to do.

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:42.820
What is that term for that condition where you want to eat dirt and rocks?

01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:43.820
Pika.

01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:44.820
Micah?

01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:45.820
Pika.

01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:46.820
Pika.

01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:47.820
I have pika.

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:48.820
So I start eating dirt and rocks.

01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:51.820
It's a badass thing to say in movies that somebody goes like,

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:54.820
if I wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead.

01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:56.820
That's how I interpret it.

01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:58.820
I am a person.

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:00.820
I'm okay.

01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.820
Don't eat dirt.

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.820
All right.

01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:04.820
Okay.

01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.820
I stop her from eating dirt.

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.820
Mommy, daddy, in the sand.

01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:10.820
Don't eat dirt.

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:13.820
I walk off with Lenev in the direction of tour mode of tour.

01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:14.820
Don't eat dirt.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:15.820
Okay.

01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:16.820
Don't eat dirt.

01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:17.820
I leave them...

01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:18.820
I want to get some shit done today.

01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:19.820
Well...

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:21.820
I want to get into some combat.

01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:22.820
I want to fucking...

01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:23.820
I want to fucking fuck...

01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:30.820
I sing an original song called Don't Eat Dirt.

01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:31.820
It's awesome.

01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:32.820
Sing it.

01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:33.820
Take my word for it.

01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:34.820
Sing it.

01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:36.820
Well, it doesn't matter.

01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.820
If he rolls, then it's awesome.

01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.820
No.

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.820
You'll sing it.

01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:42.820
If I like it, it's awesome.

01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:45.820
Don't eat dirt.

01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:49.820
Don't munch gravel.

01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:56.820
For your hurt, can you now unravel?

01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:01.820
If you take my hand in yours, you don't need minerals

01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:05.820
or ores to put on your gullet.

01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:11.820
Take that bullet and bite it and take my hand.

01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:15.820
But I'm afraid.

01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:17.820
And anyways, it's awesome.

01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:18.820
No matter what you roll.

01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:22.820
Now you can't.

01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:23.820
So now we...

01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:24.820
Now we...

01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:30.820
Dan, we just revealed our vows.

01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:31.820
Blibber and wait up.

01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:32.820
Blibber.

01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:33.820
The nev.

01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:35.820
The face eater.

01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:40.820
Don't eat my face.

01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:45.820
I run up to Quirk and I'm also trying to stay on task.

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:46.820
Okay.

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.820
Just promise me you won't eat my face.

01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:49.820
He never said he was going to, man.

01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:52.820
He said I would know if we weren't friends

01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:54.820
because he would eat my face.

01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:56.820
He said, did I try to eat your face?

01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:58.820
He didn't say it did you, is your face eating?

01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:01.820
He said, how do I know you on our side?

01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:02.820
Have I tried to eat your face?

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:03.820
By the way, why are you on his side?

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:04.820
Because he's been...

01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:05.820
I asked him, are we on your side?

01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:07.820
He goes, have I tried to eat your face?

01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:08.820
And you don't know?

01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:12.820
It's a very common undead activity to eat your face.

01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:14.820
Very normal among them.

01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:15.820
Okay.

01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:16.820
I just had a curiosity.

01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:19.820
Like I pull the nev aside and I go, okay, the nev.

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.820
Sharpie's being...

01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:23.820
He's in one of his episodes right now.

01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:25.820
Go up there and try to eat his face.

01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:26.820
I lay down.

01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:27.820
I lay down.

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.820
I lay down with my hands under my back.

01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:34.820
And I go, here's my face.

01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:38.820
Let's pretend, hey, fuck your mother.

01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:39.820
We're not friends.

01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:41.820
I want to go through the motions you'd go through.

01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:44.820
Chris de Burgh vomits acid on your face.

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:45.820
What?

01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:46.820
What?

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:49.820
Chris de Burgh, the possessed rogue.

01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:51.820
Dealing how much vomit damage.

01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:52.820
He's been tied up.

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:53.820
I still vomit.

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.820
French speakers, does nev mean dream?

01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:57.820
What does nev mean?

01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:00.820
Oh, nev doesn't mean anything.

01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:01.820
You're drunk.

01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:06.820
Okay, so there's vomit on my face?

01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:07.820
Yeah, that's great.

01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:11.820
Well, why'd you get down on the floor and threaten things to happen to you?

01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:12.820
To make a point.

01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:13.820
To assert dominance.

01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:14.820
Did you make your point?

01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:22.820
No, you did.

01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:27.820
Okay, fine, I get up and I follow Laverne.

01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:28.820
La-nev.

01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:29.820
La-nev.

01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:35.820
La-nev, are we close to the torment?

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:37.820
I stopped walking to see all this happen.

01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:38.820
Yeah, I'm sure we're really close.

01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:40.820
I'm sure we're right at the precipice of...

01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:42.820
Can we compress time and be there?

01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:45.820
I mean, we could have done that five minutes ago.

01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:46.820
Let's do it now.

01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:47.820
We do it now.

01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:49.820
Okay, but if during any of that time...

01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:50.820
Jesus Christ.

01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:55.820
Compress it.

01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:59.820
Hey, I turn to Sharpie, go Sharpie.

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:04.820
Look, you're on edge right now, but I say harness that energy, harness that rage, because

01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.820
we might need it for what's coming up.

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:07.820
Okay.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:09.820
I don't like people telling me...

01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:10.820
He didn't say anything.

01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:16.820
Do you think there are any kids who listen to Harmontown and they first heard about

01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:23.820
Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder via Harmontown, and they're playing and then they all

01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:26.820
tell each other, no, no, you're not drunk enough.

01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:32.820
And they go into their parents' liquor cabinet or they start drinking Drano, but it was like

01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:34.820
this isn't real yet.

01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:38.820
You have to play, you have to be black out drunk to play.

01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.820
There's an explicit label.

01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:45.820
What if Justin Bieber and his friends were playing D&D or they started larping and the

01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:47.820
eggs are part of it, like they are.

01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:49.820
They're casting spells in their eggs.

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.820
I guess he's a Justin Bieber.

01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:53.820
I cast Egg of Doom.

01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:58.820
You know that Justin Bieber's larping is like, I go to the grocery store.

01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:00.820
I buy fruity pebbles.

01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:02.820
I go home.

01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:05.820
Team Bieber.

01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.820
Team Bieber.

01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:14.820
I believe the Constitution's intact.

01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:19.820
Team Bieber.

01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:26.820
I believe in the Constitutional right to protect you from search and seizure.

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:27.820
I couldn't hit the high note.

01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.820
All right, Spencer, keep it going, baby.

01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:30.820
What?

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:33.820
Spencer, I attack the affinefus.

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:35.820
You miss.

01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:37.820
Keep what going?

01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:39.820
I'm sorry, let's get back on track.

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:40.820
I'm sorry.

01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:42.820
Get back on track?

01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:43.820
Let's get on track.

01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:44.820
No, that makes no sense.

01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:45.820
I've been trying.

01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:46.820
I have been trying.

01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:50.820
Some of I, I'm fucking role playing when somebody says they're going to eat my face.

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:53.820
He didn't say he was going to eat your face.

01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:55.820
Dude, this is being recorded.

01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:58.820
Everyone on Reddit is going to agree with me.

01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:00.820
No, they're not.

01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:06.820
The way that that skeleton talked to me was unacceptable.

01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:09.820
I said, are you friends?

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:12.820
There's a live audience of sober people who heard just what I heard.

01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:16.820
He said, if I wasn't your friend, I'd be eating your face.

01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:17.820
No, he did not say that.

01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:18.820
It's not what he said.

01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:19.820
That's what he said.

01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:25.820
No, that's what you heard because you're a fucking paranoid lunatic.

01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:29.820
He said, if I wasn't your friend, I'd be eating your face.

01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:30.820
No, he didn't say that.

01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:31.820
That's not what he said.

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:35.820
I said, I've told you four times what he said.

01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:36.820
What did he say?

01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:38.820
I said, can we trust you?

01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:42.820
He said, how do we know we can trust you?

01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:44.820
He said, have I tried to eat your face?

01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:46.820
That's the same thing!

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:47.820
Fine.

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.820
I don't accept that socially.

01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.820
You're a fucking crazy person.

01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:53.820
Hey man, can you park my car?

01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.820
Sure, I'll park your car.

01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:00.820
Is the valet an undead monstrosity?

01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:03.820
He's separating himself from the other undead people

01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:05.820
who would absolutely try to eat your face.

01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:07.820
Hey bartender, can I have a drink?

01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.820
Is the bartender an undead monstrosity?

01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:13.820
Yeah, I'll get you a drink.

01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:16.820
Hey, you're working this shift, right?

01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:20.820
Hey, I'm not stabbing you in the throat, am I?

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:22.820
Is he wrong?

01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:23.820
No, you're not.

01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:25.820
But fucking try, motherfucker.

01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:26.820
What the fuck?

01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:27.820
Where is he right now?

01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.820
He's trying to stab me.

01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:30.820
Why are you so defensive?

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:32.820
What the fuck?

01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.820
What?

01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:38.820
Maybe we should talk about gender neutrality.

01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.820
Everybody's on your side.

01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:44.820
Dan, everybody, Sharpie, everybody's on your team right now.

01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.820
Take it easy.

01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:50.820
Fucking have a sip of water, fucking take it, take a couple breaths.

01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:52.820
Nobody's out to get you right now.

01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.820
No, no, everybody is because I went to them and they all booed.

01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:00.820
I don't understand the society where someone could threaten to eat your face.

01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:02.820
He threatened you, he didn't threaten to eat your face.

01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:05.820
We're staying here until midnight tonight, by the way.

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:09.820
We don't, we don't, we don't go home.

01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:13.820
We play D&D until this shit is fucking, like, settled.

01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:17.820
Can we have, Dustin, can you put, do we have live playback?

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:18.820
No, don't, don't.

01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:21.820
I know what you said, I agree with what you said.

01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:23.820
He said, I'm, fuck it, god damn it.

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.820
It's a great idea for a new t-shirt, we don't go home.

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:28.820
I think you're on an edge about this whole Justin Bieber thing,

01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.820
but that's not the root of it.

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:32.820
The root of it is that you feel that the world is closing in on you.

01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:34.820
No, just Spencer's point, because he's an undead maniac,

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:37.820
I'm supposed to accept threats from him, but guess what?

01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:39.820
I'm, I'm Sharpie.

01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.820
I've been stomped by giants.

01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:44.820
I didn't take shit from them and I don't take shit from anybody.

01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.820
He didn't give me any shit.

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:50.820
He gave me shit, he fucking said that he has the freedom to eat my face.

01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:52.820
You're being a fucking weirdo.

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:57.820
So, Neve, Neve, what is our, we're going to meet these other guys, yeah?

01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.820
We're trying to help Chris de Burgh get un-possessed, I think.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.820
All right.

01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:02.820
All right, LeVern?

01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:04.820
LeNev.

01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:06.820
Uh, forward.

01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:11.820
And hey, just so you know, I'm happy to be with you right now.

01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:17.820
Exhibit A, I'm not stabbing you in the face.

01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:21.820
That's how you know we're friends.

01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:23.820
Let's hang out.

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:27.820
Dan, you're behaving like a monstrosity right now.

01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:28.820
I guess that's what I am.

01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:30.820
I guess you should take it as a compliment.

01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:32.820
Can I summon Coco the horse?

01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:34.820
Yeah, she's been here.

01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:36.820
Okay, I hop on top of her.

01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:41.820
Quirk, Sharpie, would you like to hop on top of my horse?

01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.820
Yes, I hop on the back of the horse.

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:45.820
Of course I'd love to hop on your horse.

01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:46.820
You know how you know.

01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:47.820
Here we go.

01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:48.820
Jesus Christ.

01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:51.820
I'm not cutting a tart out and roasting it over a fire.

01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:53.820
Kinda weird.

01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:55.820
More than you're right on your horse.

01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:58.820
Social, socially acceptable exchange.

01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:00.820
I hop on your horse.

01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:03.820
He's a giant skeleton with glowing hands.

01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:05.820
Why do you expect it to be hands?

01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:07.820
We're all on Coco and we're falling here at this point.

01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:08.820
He hasn't.

01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:10.820
I'm worried about Sharpie right now.

01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:11.820
Yeah.

01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:14.820
Alright, so it's so advanced, LeNev.

01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:17.820
No, this is all fucked up now.

01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:20.820
This guy's being a real dick.

01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:22.820
I'm just trying to help you.

01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.820
I get off the horse.

01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:26.820
I get off the horse.

01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:29.820
I go up to him.

01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.820
What?

01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:33.820
What do you mean, what?

01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:35.820
Who's being a real dick?

01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:38.820
You were threatening to stab me in the face just now.

01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:41.820
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:43.820
Interesting.

01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:48.820
That's weird.

01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:50.820
Transitive property.

01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:52.820
Fuck you!

01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:54.820
Don't eat my face!

01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.820
I will be friends with you.

01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:58.820
Friends don't throw shit like that

01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:00.820
out into the air.

01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:02.820
You don't go to a party.

01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:04.820
People don't do that.

01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:06.820
Well, friends or enemies.

01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.820
Enemies have, like, détente

01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:10.820
where they go like, I'm keeping my eye on you

01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:12.820
and I might eat your face.

01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:14.820
Friends are fucking friends.

01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:16.820
You bony dick.

01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:19.820
You don't fucking do that shit.

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:21.820
But you...

01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:23.820
He, he, he, he...

01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:25.820
He stabs you in the face.

01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:27.820
He stabs you!

01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:31.820
Please be a 20.

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:33.820
No, no, he doesn't.

01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:35.820
He lunges at you, though.

01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:37.820
With his glowing hands.

01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:39.820
Sharpie's our friend.

01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:41.820
I've never said anything about it being friends.

01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:43.820
I said I'd take you to tour my tour.

01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:45.820
Everyone's being a douchebag to me.

01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:48.820
I'm reverting to my, my, my baser instincts.

01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:49.820
This is happening.

01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:51.820
Is he saying all this while he's missing me?

01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:52.820
Yeah.

01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:54.820
He has plenty of time.

01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:56.820
Sharpie, he's gonna help us to leave it.

01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:57.820
I'm gonna help him.

01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:59.820
I'm gonna help him.

01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:01.820
In ways that he would have never imagined.

01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:03.820
Perhaps this is a totally inappropriate moment for this,

01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:06.820
but I'm so happy that we're getting married.

01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:11.820
Christopher's head spins around,

01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:14.820
vomiting all the way 360 degrees.

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.820
He's tied up, and it doesn't matter.

01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.820
Like a fountain.

01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:18.820
Okay.

01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:19.820
I dodge.

01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:21.820
Obviously, he missed me.

01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:22.820
He sure did.

01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:24.820
And I say to him,

01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:28.820
and I want you to know that I have the skill of...

01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:31.820
Impulse.

01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:33.820
I say to him,

01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:36.820
look, let's not fight.

01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:39.820
You initiated, literally,

01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:41.820
the last 20 minutes of fighting.

01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:44.820
You started fighting, that's how fights get perpetuated.

01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:47.820
What sort of schizophrenic shit...

01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:52.820
Are you gonna stab me in the face, man?

01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:54.820
I'm not the one attacking people.

01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:55.820
Yes, you are!

01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:56.820
What?

01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:58.820
I didn't do shit, man!

01:54:58.820 --> 01:54:59.820
You've been fucking antagonizing everything.

01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:02.820
No, I'm not spending a turn explaining to my supposed friend

01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:03.820
how this fucking...

01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:04.820
Supposed friend?

01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:05.820
Yeah, well...

01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:06.820
I'm trying to keep you alive.

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.820
Take a skeleton side a couple more times.

01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:09.820
I'm trying to keep you alive.

01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:11.820
Fucking weird.

01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:12.820
Laverne?

01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:13.820
Laverne.

01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:18.820
I'm cool if you're cool.

01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.820
It's Laverne!

01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:25.820
Cliffhanger!

01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:26.820
What?

01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:33.820
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:40.820
We almost got something done in D&D.

01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:43.820
Thank you, Erin McGathy, Spencer Crittenden,

01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:46.820
Allian Georgia, everyone here for coming.

01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:50.820
I'm Jeff Davis, your cop-troller.

01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:53.820
Go on the internet and discuss

01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:56.820
whether that was an appropriate way to respond to someone.

01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:59.820
I'm your friend because I'm not eating your face.

01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:02.820
Is that an appropriate way to talk to somebody?

01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:03.820
It's up to you.

01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:32.820
Dan Harmon, everybody!
