{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:21.920\nHello, what and all, welcome once again, from Meltdown Comics, the NerdMelt Theater in\n\n00:21.920 --> 00:25.920\nHollywood, California, Harmontown, is now in session.\n\n00:25.920 --> 00:32.920\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:32.920 --> 00:44.920\nThank you, thank you very much.\n\n00:44.920 --> 00:48.520\nA little nervous tonight, I don't know why.\n\n00:48.520 --> 00:51.560\nIt's because that guy's got high standards.\n\n00:51.560 --> 00:55.400\nI could feel, I felt his needs when he walked in the door, the Woo guy.\n\n00:55.400 --> 01:00.600\nThe Woo guy sounds like he's got very few needs.\n\n01:00.600 --> 01:01.600\nHe's already that entertained.\n\n01:01.600 --> 01:03.040\nI'm looking at the other way around.\n\n01:03.040 --> 01:07.880\nI think he's acting that way because he feels like he's at a big time, it's time for him\n\n01:07.880 --> 01:08.880\nto be really entertained.\n\n01:08.880 --> 01:10.360\nWell, why don't you just entertain him?\n\n01:10.360 --> 01:11.960\nWhy don't you knuckle down and do it?\n\n01:11.960 --> 01:14.160\nI will.\n\n01:14.160 --> 01:22.080\nSpeaking of our lovable fans, I stopped for a drink at the pikes and as Aaron and I were\n\n01:22.080 --> 01:31.520\nwalking back, we saw this dark, foreboding gang of street thugs, his kids, tufts, you\n\n01:31.520 --> 01:32.520\nknow?\n\n01:32.520 --> 01:36.720\nBut then as they emerged through the street lights, more emo tufts.\n\n01:36.720 --> 01:43.800\nOh, it's Harmontown fans, all of them, like five of them, but like, by my perception,\n\n01:43.800 --> 01:49.800\nall different combinations, like, so Anatoly was there, Matt Lansman, those are the two\n\n01:49.800 --> 01:54.000\nfaces I saw, but for my social disorder caused me to just look at the sidewalk.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.640\nAnatoly is wearing an Argyle sweater vest.\n\n01:56.640 --> 01:58.200\nYou thought he was an emo tuft?\n\n01:58.200 --> 02:01.080\nI don't know, well, what's an emo tuft?\n\n02:01.080 --> 02:02.480\nI don't know what that is.\n\n02:02.480 --> 02:03.480\nYou just invented it.\n\n02:03.480 --> 02:04.480\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n02:04.480 --> 02:09.360\nIt was a bunch of street tufts, a bunch of kids, I saw youthful posture, I saw a confident\n\n02:09.360 --> 02:10.360\ngate.\n\n02:10.360 --> 02:12.600\nWere they still in the weathered, or could you see that he was wearing a red Argyle\n\n02:12.600 --> 02:13.600\nsweater vest?\n\n02:13.600 --> 02:14.960\nNo, I didn't see the red Argyle sweater.\n\n02:14.960 --> 02:15.960\nOkay.\n\n02:15.960 --> 02:21.080\nSo, then it became clear it was like five Harmontown fans, all walking as like a throng.\n\n02:21.080 --> 02:26.400\nThey were probably on their way to the pikey, I would guess, right, to get 7-Eleven, okay,\n\n02:26.400 --> 02:30.080\nto get five hour energies and blinky key chains or something.\n\n02:30.080 --> 02:33.560\nIt's cool shit, like stuff that street kids do.\n\n02:33.560 --> 02:39.240\nBut we walked past them and we were like, oh, Harmontown, Harmonians, that's what they\n\n02:39.240 --> 02:40.240\nwere.\n\n02:40.240 --> 02:44.120\nWe walked past them and then, but then something occurred to me, like it made me really laugh\n\n02:44.120 --> 02:50.840\ninside, that like, okay, so there's five guys, they're all like Harmontown fans.\n\n02:50.840 --> 02:55.720\nThey probably met like hanging out here, I'm just going to hazard a guess, or there's probably\n\n02:55.720 --> 02:59.840\ngroups of friends who did meet by coming to the show.\n\n02:59.840 --> 03:06.960\nWhat if five of them then robbed a bank?\n\n03:06.960 --> 03:08.800\nOr killed somebody or something?\n\n03:08.800 --> 03:11.560\nAre you worried about how this would reflect on you?\n\n03:11.560 --> 03:17.040\nI'm pretty delighted, I don't know, I'm just being like, how fun, how amazing would that\n\n03:17.040 --> 03:18.040\nbe?\n\n03:18.040 --> 03:19.040\nHow weird would that be?\n\n03:19.040 --> 03:22.880\nRemember after Columbine, when there's all this undue attention on Doom, the video game,\n\n03:22.880 --> 03:26.760\nyou know, like there's always this ancillary thing, whatever, something happens.\n\n03:26.760 --> 03:30.840\nAll friends get together in some way, they all have some common connection.\n\n03:30.840 --> 03:36.480\nOh, those, they would be called the Harmontown robberies, because they all met, like,\n\n03:36.480 --> 03:39.200\nthere would be pictures of them at the show.\n\n03:39.200 --> 03:42.560\nI think we can agree that's pretty unlikely, but I would like to plant that seed right\n\n03:42.560 --> 03:43.560\nnow.\n\n03:43.560 --> 03:49.840\nIt would be amazing, every group of people who ends up doing something historically horrible\n\n03:49.840 --> 03:51.000\nmet somewhere.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:56.920\nI think what we should do right now is, look, if the mood strikes any of you, commit a non-violence\n\n03:56.920 --> 04:05.240\nbut high-profile crime, and wear an all-wear Harmontown hoodies, or do it with a bunch\n\n04:05.240 --> 04:08.600\nof people you've met at Harmontown so that's the thread, because then the cops and their\n\n04:08.600 --> 04:12.720\nstatements, they're gonna see this word Harmontown, they're gonna circle it, they're gonna\n\n04:12.720 --> 04:15.920\nrelease a statement, and it's gonna be like the trench coat mafia, but it'll be like\n\n04:15.920 --> 04:17.520\nthe Harmontown killers.\n\n04:17.520 --> 04:20.320\nNo, not killers, robbers, burglars.\n\n04:20.320 --> 04:21.840\nBut robbers, burglars, whatever.\n\n04:21.840 --> 04:26.600\nThey're gonna be white-collar, non-violence, like, they're gonna rob from the rich.\n\n04:26.600 --> 04:28.600\nAre you worried about, you're worried about liability right now?\n\n04:28.600 --> 04:30.960\nI'm worried about being blown up by one of them.\n\n04:30.960 --> 04:34.320\nI worry about my own safety if it becomes violent.\n\n04:34.320 --> 04:37.640\nSpeaking of violent crime, fantastic segue, great job.\n\n04:37.640 --> 04:39.560\nWe did it.\n\n04:39.560 --> 04:42.920\nThat's called accidental com-trolling.\n\n04:42.920 --> 04:48.720\nI often, you know, Twitter, there's, you know, you have 225,000 followers, you definitely\n\n04:48.720 --> 04:54.240\nevery day someone says, someone tweets you and says, my baby daughter's getting a heart\n\n04:54.240 --> 04:58.200\ntransplant or whatever, something heart-breaking and, you know, can you retweet and blah blah\n\n04:58.200 --> 05:03.800\nblah, and I kind of, so that I don't do it 24 hours a day, why am I qualifying this?\n\n05:03.800 --> 05:04.800\nWhat the fuck am I doing?\n\n05:04.800 --> 05:10.200\nI just like, there's all kinds of stuff like that, but those people like tweet at also\n\n05:10.200 --> 05:15.560\nMarc Maron or something like that, and I hope your daughter has a good heart transplant\n\n05:15.560 --> 05:19.920\nand all that stuff, but I also, if somebody's a big Harmontown fan, specifically somebody\n\n05:19.920 --> 05:27.040\nthat I met on tour, this guy's brother tweeted me, and I promised him that I would mention\n\n05:27.040 --> 05:28.200\nit.\n\n05:28.200 --> 05:35.480\nHis Twitter name, the brother, is mngravue, mng, with three Fs, said, Dan Harmon, my\n\n05:35.480 --> 05:42.120\nbrother, a Armenian you met at your Portland stop, was jumped, beaten and stabbed and nearly\n\n05:42.120 --> 05:44.680\ndied Wednesday in Seattle.\n\n05:44.680 --> 05:50.720\nThursday in ICU, we watched the new episode, we loved the graceful exits for Troy Barnes\n\n05:50.720 --> 05:51.720\nand Pierce Hawthorne.\n\n05:51.720 --> 05:56.160\nWould you wish Jeff a get well at Harmontown, you're a hero to us, please, thanks.\n\n05:56.160 --> 05:58.920\nSo of course, of course, Jeff, goddamn it, get well.\n\n05:58.920 --> 06:12.640\nHe also said, thank you, Dan, when I responded to him, I said, I hope he's going to get better.\n\n06:12.640 --> 06:16.880\nSurgeons broke his sternum to fix his heart, so it would be a long recovery, and then he\n\n06:16.880 --> 06:25.680\nincluded a photo of us, like we met in Portland, not at the sternum.\n\n06:25.680 --> 06:29.600\nYeah, that's what he said, sternum, they broke his sternum to fix his heart, and it was a\n\n06:29.600 --> 06:36.760\nlink to a picture, and I clicked it very hesitatingly, and I'm like, well, I guess I deserve this.\n\n06:36.760 --> 06:41.920\nBut it was the photo that we took together, the brothers, and I'm assuming from the hashtag\n\n06:41.920 --> 06:49.400\ntough ginger that the kid in question, Jeff, is probably the curly redhead on the right\n\n06:49.400 --> 06:53.480\nof the picture, and boy, there's not a lot of people who look like they deserve to be\n\n06:53.480 --> 07:01.720\nstabbed, but this kid looks the least like he deserves to be.\n\n07:01.720 --> 07:07.840\nWe all thought you were going the other way on that one, I would have stabbed this cocksucker.\n\n07:07.840 --> 07:12.200\nIt's like you're looking for something, like, oh, I can see why he got stabbed, look at\n\n07:12.200 --> 07:18.360\nthat hat, this kid looks like he's just adorable, he looks like a little angel, so Jeff, if\n\n07:18.360 --> 07:23.960\nyou're able to be listening to this, our prayers and good vibes are with you here at Harmon\n\n07:23.960 --> 07:24.960\nTown.\n\n07:24.960 --> 07:27.040\nTell your doctors to stop breaking your sternum.\n\n07:27.040 --> 07:28.520\nNo, they had to.\n\n07:28.520 --> 07:29.520\nDid they?\n\n07:29.520 --> 07:30.520\nThey had to fix his fucking heart.\n\n07:30.520 --> 07:31.520\nCan you imagine?\n\n07:31.520 --> 07:32.520\nJesus Christ.\n\n07:32.520 --> 07:33.520\nWow.\n\n07:33.520 --> 07:34.520\nMaybe they broke his sternum.\n\n07:34.520 --> 07:37.520\nMaybe they broke his sternum, and they said that after the fact.\n\n07:37.520 --> 07:38.520\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n07:38.520 --> 07:39.520\nThey're like mechanics.\n\n07:39.520 --> 07:40.520\nYou're going to make a heart omelette.\n\n07:40.520 --> 07:41.520\nYou got to break a couple.\n\n07:41.520 --> 07:46.520\nYeah, I don't know, man, your sternum is all in the way of your heart, you should have\n\n07:46.520 --> 07:47.520\nbrought it in.\n\n07:47.520 --> 07:48.520\nMore often.\n\n07:48.520 --> 07:58.200\nIt makes sense because mechanics get away with almost literal murder because none of\n\n07:58.200 --> 08:02.880\nus know anything about cars, way less of us know anything about the human body.\n\n08:02.880 --> 08:04.560\nSo how do you trust these fucking doctors?\n\n08:04.560 --> 08:05.560\nFuck them.\n\n08:05.560 --> 08:09.360\nI'm sorry, Jeff, you should trust your doctors in intensive care.\n\n08:09.360 --> 08:14.000\nYou should trust that they know what they're doing.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:19.320\nAll right, so I don't know, there's a couple things I wanted to talk about, but I think\n\n08:19.320 --> 08:20.760\nwe should bring up our guests first.\n\n08:20.760 --> 08:21.760\nLet's do that.\n\n08:21.760 --> 08:26.520\nBecause maybe we can talk about it with some of them if we're lacking for conversation.\n\n08:26.520 --> 08:33.840\nSo Allie Ward and Georgia Hartstarch, they're known as Allie and Georgia, commonly, and\n\n08:33.840 --> 08:36.520\nI asked them in the last names in the green room.\n\n08:36.520 --> 08:39.920\nThey're on the Feral Audio Network, would you figure that, Jeff?\n\n08:39.920 --> 08:42.840\nDid you know that Feral Audio is a network?\n\n08:42.840 --> 08:45.080\nI'd be jiggered if I knew that.\n\n08:45.080 --> 08:49.040\nTheir podcast is called Slumber Party, and they did have a show on the cooking channel\n\n08:49.040 --> 08:54.440\ncalled Tripping Out, and they're known for making insane cocktails like the McNuggettini.\n\n08:54.440 --> 08:55.440\nWhat?\n\n08:55.440 --> 08:56.440\nYou can ask them about it if you want.\n\n08:56.440 --> 08:58.240\nI'm fucking going to.\n\n08:58.240 --> 09:03.440\nSometimes I just read the blurb that I get too, but here's why they're really coming\n\n09:03.440 --> 09:07.520\nout because they're going to start doing their podcast live, and their first live podcast\n\n09:07.520 --> 09:13.680\nis at the Hollywood Improv, Wednesday the 29th, and their first guest is Dan Harmon.\n\n09:13.680 --> 09:14.960\nThat sounds exciting to me.\n\n09:14.960 --> 09:15.960\nIs he in town?\n\n09:15.960 --> 09:16.960\nYeah.\n\n09:16.960 --> 09:19.480\nSo let's bring them up.\n\n09:19.480 --> 09:20.720\nAllie and Georgia, come on out.\n\n09:20.720 --> 09:21.720\nSit where you like.\n\n09:21.720 --> 09:22.720\nDo what you like.\n\n09:22.720 --> 09:38.440\nSorry, I called one of you Hearthstark before.\n\n09:38.440 --> 09:41.000\nI get worse than that.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nNervous tonight.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nI don't know why.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:44.000\nIt's because of the woo guy.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:45.000\nI don't know.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.920\nYou said you were nervous before the guy wooed, and I just compounded it.\n\n09:47.920 --> 09:50.480\nI think it may be because we didn't do shows in so long.\n\n09:50.480 --> 09:52.560\nWe went to Scotland, and we came back.\n\n09:52.560 --> 09:54.240\nLast week's show, I wasn't a blackout drunk.\n\n09:54.240 --> 09:55.240\nI won't listen to it.\n\n09:55.240 --> 09:56.240\nI don't.\n\n09:56.240 --> 09:59.240\nWe talked about gender for three hours.\n\n09:59.240 --> 10:04.040\nI'd like to say a quick apology to all listeners that still listen to us after that show, because\n\n10:04.040 --> 10:08.560\nthat show was...\n\n10:08.560 --> 10:09.560\nAllie and Georgia.\n\n10:09.560 --> 10:14.840\nThree unqualified lunatics talking about an issue they neither know anything about or\n\n10:14.840 --> 10:17.440\nhave any fucking stake in the fucking...\n\n10:17.440 --> 10:18.440\nWow.\n\n10:18.440 --> 10:19.440\nNor an issue that is...\n\n10:19.440 --> 10:23.360\nI was going to say, you have double vaginas up here if you need to revisit any gender stuff.\n\n10:23.360 --> 10:27.120\nWell, we combined it's like maybe one and a half to three.\n\n10:27.120 --> 10:30.800\nBut you guys said you enjoyed it, and you have vaginas, and we have all of those.\n\n10:30.800 --> 10:34.840\nI enjoyed those without vaginas talking about the people with vaginas.\n\n10:34.840 --> 10:37.680\nI don't think the lack of vagina was what disqualified us.\n\n10:37.680 --> 10:41.920\nIt was a lack of intellectual assertion.\n\n10:41.920 --> 10:42.920\nWe were just...\n\n10:42.920 --> 10:45.840\nIt was rudderless, meaningless, garbage.\n\n10:45.840 --> 10:49.880\nYeah, I just kind of blunder into that room and just go like, can you believe black men\n\n10:49.880 --> 10:51.400\nhad the vote before white women?\n\n10:51.400 --> 10:52.400\nThat's crazy.\n\n10:52.400 --> 10:53.400\nGood night.\n\n10:53.400 --> 10:59.160\nAnd then I go home and sleep like a baby, and then all races and all genders are like,\n\n10:59.160 --> 11:00.160\nwhat the fuck?\n\n11:00.160 --> 11:01.160\nWhat?\n\n11:01.160 --> 11:03.040\nAnd we're like, what do you...\n\n11:03.040 --> 11:04.040\nWhat did you mean?\n\n11:04.040 --> 11:07.320\nWe're making this up, and we misspeak a lot.\n\n11:07.320 --> 11:08.320\nYou say the wrong thing.\n\n11:08.320 --> 11:09.320\nYou misquote something.\n\n11:09.320 --> 11:10.320\nThat's going to happen.\n\n11:10.320 --> 11:11.320\nThat's fine.\n\n11:11.320 --> 11:12.320\nIt's going to happen to anybody.\n\n11:12.320 --> 11:13.320\nThat doesn't bother me.\n\n11:13.320 --> 11:16.080\nI didn't...I mean, I never listened to our shows.\n\n11:16.080 --> 11:20.120\nI would never listen to that one again, simply from my own sense of well-being.\n\n11:20.120 --> 11:22.360\nI listened to almost all of them.\n\n11:22.360 --> 11:23.360\nThere's some that I...\n\n11:23.360 --> 11:25.120\nIt has mostly to do with alcohol intake.\n\n11:25.120 --> 11:28.000\nI feel like if I get off stage and I'm like, I don't even remember how that show went,\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nbut I don't listen to it.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:34.040\nYeah, but you can have drunk vodka all day long and come up here and have an incredible\n\n11:34.040 --> 11:35.040\nfacility.\n\n11:35.040 --> 11:39.520\nYou can be quite lucid even though I know, because I know you, that you're Steamboat Willie\n\n11:39.520 --> 11:40.520\ndrunk.\n\n11:40.520 --> 11:47.080\nYeah, but that night seemed to be extra special, like swirly and like...\n\n11:47.080 --> 11:49.680\nI think I had been drinking for two days or something.\n\n11:49.680 --> 11:50.680\nI don't know.\n\n11:50.680 --> 11:51.680\nLet's talk to the ladies.\n\n11:51.680 --> 11:52.680\nWhat?\n\n11:52.680 --> 11:53.680\nHow'd you get anything different?\n\n11:53.680 --> 11:54.680\nYeah, well, had you read like an...\n\n11:54.680 --> 11:56.840\nI had you seen like a blurb about feminism or something?\n\n11:56.840 --> 11:57.840\nLike what precipitated it?\n\n11:57.840 --> 11:58.840\nWell, no.\n\n11:58.840 --> 11:59.840\nSome guy sent us a book.\n\n11:59.840 --> 12:00.840\nI remember that vaguely.\n\n12:00.840 --> 12:01.840\nI remember that.\n\n12:01.840 --> 12:02.840\nYeah, I remember that it was...\n\n12:02.840 --> 12:03.840\nIt took a giant shit on him.\n\n12:03.840 --> 12:04.840\nThat poor guy.\n\n12:04.840 --> 12:05.840\nThat poor guy.\n\n12:05.840 --> 12:06.840\nMine was simply on format.\n\n12:06.840 --> 12:07.840\nI didn't even read his stuff.\n\n12:07.840 --> 12:10.400\nI'm sure he's great, but his publisher can go second.\n\n12:10.400 --> 12:11.400\nI don't know.\n\n12:11.400 --> 12:12.400\nNo, I have no idea how we got on the topic.\n\n12:12.400 --> 12:13.400\nI mean, you listened to it.\n\n12:13.400 --> 12:14.400\nI did.\n\n12:14.400 --> 12:15.400\nYeah.\n\n12:15.400 --> 12:19.400\nI mean, I just, I learned not to send you a book, which is fine.\n\n12:19.400 --> 12:20.400\nI hadn't planned on it anyway.\n\n12:20.400 --> 12:21.400\nSo, we're good.\n\n12:21.400 --> 12:22.400\nWe're in the clear.\n\n12:22.400 --> 12:23.400\nAnd yeah, I learned that...\n\n12:23.400 --> 12:28.000\nWell, I revisited the thought that machines replace slavery, which is always...\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:31.640\nAnd then, of course, there's us with all of our dumb iPhones that are made essentially\n\n12:31.640 --> 12:32.640\nby slaves.\n\n12:32.640 --> 12:33.640\nAnd that's a whole other story.\n\n12:33.640 --> 12:34.640\nBut whatever.\n\n12:34.640 --> 12:35.640\nSo...\n\n12:35.640 --> 12:36.640\nGod, I touched on that slavery.\n\n12:36.640 --> 12:39.640\nCan I just open up with Chicken McNuggettini?\n\n12:39.640 --> 12:40.640\nSure.\n\n12:40.640 --> 12:41.640\nI would love for you to open up.\n\n12:41.640 --> 12:42.640\nYeah.\n\n12:42.640 --> 12:43.640\nTell me a little bit about this.\n\n12:43.640 --> 12:44.640\nOh, no.\n\n12:44.640 --> 12:45.640\nDoes that...\n\n12:45.640 --> 12:46.640\nOkay.\n\n12:46.640 --> 12:47.640\nWell, that's how we monetized our friendship.\n\n12:47.640 --> 12:48.640\nYeah.\n\n12:48.640 --> 12:49.640\nPretty much.\n\n12:49.640 --> 12:50.640\nYeah.\n\n12:50.640 --> 12:51.640\nWe, like, have this inside joke between the two of us.\n\n12:51.640 --> 12:55.520\nWe were best friends and we'd go out at late at night and drink and we had hard jobs\n\n12:55.520 --> 12:56.520\nand...\n\n12:56.520 --> 12:57.520\nYeah.\n\n12:57.520 --> 12:58.520\nWe had...\n\n12:58.520 --> 12:59.520\nI was actually a writer at the LA Times.\n\n12:59.520 --> 13:02.880\nAnd so, I would be there until the lights turned off and I'd have to call the power\n\n13:02.880 --> 13:04.560\nroom and be like, can you turn it back on?\n\n13:04.560 --> 13:08.360\nAnd I was a receptionist, so I had to say yes to white men a lot.\n\n13:08.360 --> 13:09.360\nYeah.\n\n13:09.360 --> 13:10.360\nI was a white man.\n\n13:10.360 --> 13:11.360\nI had to be like, smile.\n\n13:11.360 --> 13:12.360\nAnd that's really hard, you guys.\n\n13:12.360 --> 13:16.560\nShe would g-chat me and she'd be like, ugh, they asked me to fax something.\n\n13:16.560 --> 13:21.840\nI'm right in the middle of, like, the fourth episode of whatever, and she hated it.\n\n13:21.840 --> 13:26.600\nAnd so, we always had this joke where we wanted to go out for a McNuggettini after work because\n\n13:26.600 --> 13:29.880\nit would take care of dinner and a drink and dessert, and then we could just go back to\n\n13:29.880 --> 13:30.880\nbed and...\n\n13:30.880 --> 13:31.880\nGet it out of the way.\n\n13:31.880 --> 13:32.880\nAnd then suffer again in the morning.\n\n13:32.880 --> 13:36.880\nAnd so, we had this joke and I think we posted on each other's MySpace pages at the time.\n\n13:36.880 --> 13:40.080\nWe had a McNuggettini, and then we're like, what if we actually did this, what would it\n\n13:40.080 --> 13:41.080\ntaste like?\n\n13:41.080 --> 13:43.800\nAnd it was just this long standing joke between the two of us, and finally we're like, well,\n\n13:43.800 --> 13:44.800\nlet's do it.\n\n13:44.800 --> 13:46.680\nIt was like a Pegasus, that you're like, does it exist?\n\n13:46.680 --> 13:47.680\nLet's make it.\n\n13:47.680 --> 13:48.680\nSo, how do you make it?\n\n13:48.680 --> 13:53.200\nWell, so then we had our friend Peter Tensio, who's the really funny comedy director, but\n\n13:53.200 --> 13:54.200\nhe then didn't.\n\n13:54.200 --> 13:58.960\nYeah, he was making things for super deluxe, and they paid him in packets of oatmeal, and\n\n13:58.960 --> 14:03.040\nhe'd still worked with them, but now he directs Key and Peele, so we managed to get in on the\n\n14:03.040 --> 14:04.040\nground floor there.\n\n14:04.040 --> 14:08.720\nAnd he made a video for us of us making this drink, and it involves, which is like all\n\n14:08.720 --> 14:11.760\nmanner of horrible, just in every scale.\n\n14:11.760 --> 14:17.200\nIt's a McDonald's milkshake chocolate, and then you add vanilla vodka to it, and you\n\n14:17.200 --> 14:19.880\nshake it lightly, and then you pour it into a martini glass.\n\n14:19.880 --> 14:23.840\nThat's been rimmed in the McDonald's barbecue sauce, and then you pour it in.\n\n14:23.840 --> 14:24.840\nSo, no actual McNugget?\n\n14:24.840 --> 14:25.840\nNo, no.\n\n14:25.840 --> 14:26.840\nNo, not done yet.\n\n14:26.840 --> 14:27.840\nOh, you put one on the rim.\n\n14:27.840 --> 14:31.840\nIt's perched on the side as a garnish is a McNuggettini.\n\n14:31.840 --> 14:40.280\nSo wait, chocolate milkshake, vanilla vodka, no, I'm just barfing.\n\n14:40.280 --> 14:46.600\nWith a rim of barbecue sauce, and I'm imagining like you would put an olive garnish or an\n\n14:46.600 --> 14:47.600\nonion on a Gibson.\n\n14:47.600 --> 14:48.600\nYeah.\n\n14:48.600 --> 14:51.360\nA chicken McNuggettini, resting gently across the...\n\n14:51.360 --> 14:53.800\nOn the rim, so you slice it down the side a little bit.\n\n14:53.800 --> 14:54.800\nYeah.\n\n14:54.800 --> 14:55.800\nOh, I see, like a lemon.\n\n14:55.800 --> 14:56.800\nYeah, a lemon.\n\n14:56.800 --> 15:00.000\nSo then you drink it, and you have to get through the barbecue sauce, and then when\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.160\nyou're done with it, you swipe the McNuggettini around the rim and eat it.\n\n15:04.160 --> 15:07.560\nAnd it's like, you know, when you dip french fries in like a milkshake, it's like, you\n\n15:07.560 --> 15:08.560\nknow, have you ever...\n\n15:08.560 --> 15:09.560\nIt actually sounds so bad.\n\n15:09.560 --> 15:13.160\nI've heard of worse foods than that, and there's a hilarious, like, Greg Prupp's\n\n15:13.160 --> 15:15.840\nseven pleas, if you have not done this.\n\n15:15.840 --> 15:20.640\nGo read, there's a New York Times restaurant review of Guy Fieri's Times Square.\n\n15:20.640 --> 15:21.640\nThat's amazing.\n\n15:21.640 --> 15:22.640\nTimes Square.\n\n15:22.640 --> 15:23.640\nHave you read this review?\n\n15:23.640 --> 15:24.640\nYeah.\n\n15:24.640 --> 15:25.640\nWho had it?\n\n15:25.640 --> 15:34.040\nAbsolutely, buys 15 machine guns, loads them up, and just blazes that restaurant to pieces\n\n15:34.040 --> 15:35.280\nin this review.\n\n15:35.280 --> 15:40.000\nIt's an absolute assassination of this restaurant.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.840\nI love that New York Times even went to Guy Fieri's...\n\n15:42.840 --> 15:43.840\nWhat's it called?\n\n15:43.840 --> 15:44.840\nBros and tits?\n\n15:44.840 --> 15:45.840\nYeah.\n\n15:45.840 --> 15:46.840\nBros and tits and anus is who it is.\n\n15:46.840 --> 15:47.840\nDo you know what's weird about it?\n\n15:47.840 --> 15:48.840\nYeah.\n\n15:48.840 --> 15:52.840\nIt actually kind of made me want to go with it, like, that article made me be like, well,\n\n15:52.840 --> 15:53.840\nI got to see this.\n\n15:53.840 --> 15:54.840\nCut your name in?\n\n15:54.840 --> 15:59.040\nLike, it sounds like a miniature golf course of food, just like things in rock scales and\n\n15:59.040 --> 16:00.040\nconfusing.\n\n16:00.040 --> 16:04.120\nIf on that menu or anywhere, if you'd said it's the chicken McNugget, teeny, and you\n\n16:04.120 --> 16:10.000\nsaid it's a McDonald's chocolate milkshake with vanilla vodka, a barbecue sauce rim\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:16.800\nglass, and a slice of chicken McNugget on the rim, that would sell like gross McDonald's\n\n16:16.800 --> 16:17.800\nhotcakes.\n\n16:17.800 --> 16:18.800\nWell, here's the first one.\n\n16:18.800 --> 16:20.320\nSo have you sold this in Nessie?\n\n16:20.320 --> 16:23.920\nNo, we haven't, because we have just a tiny bit of pride left.\n\n16:23.920 --> 16:24.920\nSo we haven't ever sold it.\n\n16:24.920 --> 16:29.440\nBut what happened was that this video went viral and we were like, oh, shit, because\n\n16:29.440 --> 16:31.320\nwe didn't mean to be known for this.\n\n16:31.320 --> 16:35.160\nLike, I studied so hard in school, there's so many times where we'll do, like, we'll\n\n16:35.160 --> 16:39.240\nbe doing something and that Allie will be like, Magna Colana, like, we'll be like,\n\n16:39.240 --> 16:41.240\nso, this is your penicillin.\n\n16:41.240 --> 16:45.560\nYeah, this is, yeah, this was my accident, like, this was, this was my moldy dish after\n\n16:45.560 --> 16:46.560\nvacation.\n\n16:46.560 --> 16:49.760\nIt was my, it was like this weird accident, it's like a baby that you're like, let's\n\n16:49.760 --> 16:50.760\nnot abort it.\n\n16:50.760 --> 16:53.200\nAnd then we just have raised it and who occurred to go to college.\n\n16:53.200 --> 16:55.880\nSo my parents are stoked that, like, I have a career.\n\n16:55.880 --> 17:00.960\nNow, when you both made these, this was a joint, like, collaboration on the, and...\n\n17:00.960 --> 17:05.480\nYeah, so since then, it was like, 2009, we've made a fucking career out of this, we quit\n\n17:05.480 --> 17:07.240\nour jobs and like, this is our...\n\n17:07.240 --> 17:11.600\nWe ended up, it went viral and then the New York Times contacted us and they're like,\n\n17:11.600 --> 17:15.040\nwe'd like to do a feature story, can you fly out to New York so we can interview you.\n\n17:15.040 --> 17:20.240\nAnd we both collectively lost our shit and then Food Network offered us a contract, so\n\n17:20.240 --> 17:21.240\nwe would...\n\n17:21.240 --> 17:22.240\nBecause of that?\n\n17:22.240 --> 17:27.960\nWell, here's why, because it sounds just ridiculous enough to be awesome.\n\n17:27.960 --> 17:30.160\nJeff, you're being impolite to our guests.\n\n17:30.160 --> 17:33.400\nNo, I'm saying, no, I'm sharing their incredulity, right?\n\n17:33.400 --> 17:36.960\nI know, but well, you shouldn't share people's incredulity about their success, you should\n\n17:36.960 --> 17:37.960\nlet them be incredulous.\n\n17:37.960 --> 17:38.960\nNo, it's fucking ridiculous.\n\n17:38.960 --> 17:43.320\nAnd you should assure them that it's for a reason, so that's, that's just like taking\n\n17:43.320 --> 17:44.320\ntheir coat.\n\n17:44.320 --> 17:48.880\nI'm saying that I'm certain, I'm certain that they proved them they're, they're worthiness\n\n17:48.880 --> 17:54.200\noutside of that, that that's a hilarious thing to become family.\n\n17:54.200 --> 17:55.200\nThey're world-class fellatrices.\n\n17:55.200 --> 18:01.640\nWell, I want to talk to you guys about, about podcasting because you've, for a very long\n\n18:01.640 --> 18:06.120\ntime now in the Farrell Audio Network, which is an amazing network, you've been doing,\n\n18:06.120 --> 18:12.880\nI don't know how else, like, I don't know what the terminology is, like, in terms of\n\n18:12.880 --> 18:16.520\nsitcoms, there's single camera and multi-camera, which means there's an audience, like there's\n\n18:16.520 --> 18:20.240\nan audience here, there's not an audience, you guys have been doing the not an audience\n\n18:20.240 --> 18:24.680\none for a while, have you, and now you're, you're gonna, are you just shifting gears\n\n18:24.680 --> 18:28.400\nentirely, bailing on the non-audience and doing the audience thing now?\n\n18:28.400 --> 18:29.400\nNo way.\n\n18:29.400 --> 18:35.040\nNo, I think we just want a more immediate form of validation, so we're going to, I mean,\n\n18:35.040 --> 18:39.080\nwe've done it with an audience of Dustin, the producer, who's just out, like, right\n\n18:39.080 --> 18:42.880\noutside the pillow fort, and if we say something really disgusting, we'll hear him wince.\n\n18:42.880 --> 18:46.960\nYeah, like, you get Dustin to laugh outside the pillow fort, like, you can hear his whole\n\n18:46.960 --> 18:47.960\nbody.\n\n18:47.960 --> 18:48.960\nWell, how heavily did you edit?\n\n18:48.960 --> 18:53.840\nBecause, like, I went through all these phases with this thing where we would record this\n\n18:53.840 --> 18:57.280\nand then I would sit with, you know, try to schedule a time with Dustin and go through\n\n18:57.280 --> 19:01.520\nit, and then we'd be sitting there in Pro Tools or whatever, Logic or Square Five or\n\n19:01.520 --> 19:07.120\nwhatever the fuck kids use, and going like, oh, well, that was, that kind of doesn't really\n\n19:07.120 --> 19:10.920\ngo anywhere, so let's, let's, let's bring up that laugh and do all those things, and\n\n19:10.920 --> 19:14.600\nwe tried to minimize the dishonesty, and like, I was trying to keep it to 90 minutes, all\n\n19:14.600 --> 19:15.600\nthat stuff.\n\n19:15.600 --> 19:19.600\nThe more emails I got, or Tumblr messages about people that were just going, you know\n\n19:19.600 --> 19:25.520\nwhat, I, I listened to your podcast while I'm welding a mechanical bowl at work, I listened\n\n19:25.520 --> 19:30.120\nto your podcast while I'm driving to and from work, I, they, it became very clear that part\n\n19:30.120 --> 19:35.160\nof the format was that the, the, the people that really gobble it up, what they prefer\n\n19:35.160 --> 19:42.440\nmore is a timely schedule than a finely edited masterpiece, and so we just stopped editing\n\n19:42.440 --> 19:43.440\nat a certain point.\n\n19:43.440 --> 19:46.720\nThat makes total sense, and I don't like to listen to myself talk, so if I'm saying,\n\n19:46.720 --> 19:50.320\nif I'm on doing the podcast and I say something like racist or like shitty that I know is\n\n19:50.320 --> 19:54.760\nbad, I'm like, not that I ever did, Dustin, like, that, take that out, but like, I won't\n\n19:54.760 --> 19:59.720\ngo back and listen to it, and our best, our best, like, episodes have been our solo episodes\n\n19:59.720 --> 20:05.560\nand we're, because we're best friends, we know fucking everything about each other,\n\n20:05.560 --> 20:06.560\nbuttons to push.\n\n20:06.560 --> 20:09.200\nSo the best episodes are when we're just totally candid and like,\n\n20:09.200 --> 20:11.240\nHave you guys ever been in like a, like an actual fight?\n\n20:11.240 --> 20:12.240\nSo many.\n\n20:12.240 --> 20:13.240\nSo many.\n\n20:13.240 --> 20:14.240\nOh my God.\n\n20:14.240 --> 20:17.640\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n20:17.640 --> 20:21.240\nI locked her out of a hotel room in New Orleans, but I mean, that was the worst thing that\n\n20:21.240 --> 20:22.240\never happened.\n\n20:22.240 --> 20:23.240\nI broke into the hotel room in New Orleans.\n\n20:23.240 --> 20:27.520\nShe busted through the fucking door, and I was like, oh, how did you get through a door?\n\n20:27.520 --> 20:28.520\nDid you kick her?\n\n20:28.520 --> 20:29.520\nI was like, there's a monster.\n\n20:29.520 --> 20:30.520\nA monster outside?\n\n20:30.520 --> 20:34.040\nThis is the thing, when they put the door, like, the lock thing on the door.\n\n20:34.040 --> 20:36.640\nWhen they, meaning Ally, who's locking her down.\n\n20:36.640 --> 20:38.200\nI watched your crime constantly.\n\n20:38.200 --> 20:39.200\nThe little hingey one?\n\n20:39.200 --> 20:40.200\nYeah, the hingey one.\n\n20:40.200 --> 20:45.200\nIf you take a credit card or the room, whatever, and you slide it through, like, it'll open\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:46.200\nit up.\n\n20:46.200 --> 20:47.200\nGood to know.\n\n20:47.200 --> 20:49.680\nMy favorite thing about that is, don't rape anyone.\n\n20:49.680 --> 20:52.400\nEveryone's groaning because you just armed a million.\n\n20:52.400 --> 20:53.400\nYeah.\n\n20:53.400 --> 20:58.760\nBut my favorite thing about that is that the idea that amidst of a drunken hotel fight,\n\n20:58.760 --> 21:04.840\none person will do something as delicate as threading a needle, and then I'm sure you're\n\n21:04.840 --> 21:09.360\nright back to, fuck you bitch, I thought I was so smart, and really I should have just\n\n21:09.360 --> 21:12.840\ngone and sat down and had some water, and everything would have been fine, but I was\n\n21:12.840 --> 21:13.840\nlike, I got her.\n\n21:13.840 --> 21:14.840\nSo where did you pick that up?\n\n21:14.840 --> 21:16.480\nLike, watching Dog the Bounty Hunter?\n\n21:16.480 --> 21:21.400\nNo, I watched, I obsessively watched shows about, like, people who have been, have murdered\n\n21:21.400 --> 21:22.400\npeople.\n\n21:22.400 --> 21:23.400\nLike, obsessively.\n\n21:23.400 --> 21:24.400\n48 hours.\n\n21:24.400 --> 21:25.400\nYes.\n\n21:25.400 --> 21:26.400\nOh my God.\n\n21:26.400 --> 21:27.400\nAll of that is front-line.\n\n21:27.400 --> 21:28.400\nHence I locked the hotel room door when Jordan is drunk.\n\n21:28.400 --> 21:31.480\nWait, so the little, the little hingy one with the little thing that slides in and kind\n\n21:31.480 --> 21:33.680\nof locks in, you can, you can put a credit card through that?\n\n21:33.680 --> 21:36.920\nYou put a credit card and like, kind of slide the hinge off.\n\n21:36.920 --> 21:37.920\nOh.\n\n21:37.920 --> 21:38.920\nIt's so easy.\n\n21:38.920 --> 21:39.920\nLife hacking.\n\n21:39.920 --> 21:40.920\nThis is why I put, yeah.\n\n21:40.920 --> 21:41.920\nThis is why I put a...\n\n21:41.920 --> 21:42.920\nThis is why I put a...\n\n21:42.920 --> 21:45.920\nAlso, you get a Mountain Dew bottle, makes a great silencer.\n\n21:45.920 --> 21:47.920\nAnd it's also the thing...\n\n21:47.920 --> 21:48.920\nThere's...\n\n21:48.920 --> 21:49.920\nCrazy.\n\n21:49.920 --> 21:54.920\nYeah, you put a pillow inside a Mountain Dew bottle, it has to be Mountain Dew for some\n\n21:54.920 --> 21:55.920\nreason though.\n\n21:55.920 --> 22:00.040\nLike, if you hold certain buttons down and certain elevators and you just, you bypass\n\n22:00.040 --> 22:01.720\nall the other floors, if you want to go straight down.\n\n22:01.720 --> 22:03.280\nWhoa, I did not know this.\n\n22:03.280 --> 22:07.120\nYeah, if you hold the door, open or close button, and hit a thing, and the floor you're\n\n22:07.120 --> 22:10.640\ngoing to, it just goes, fire departments use it to get in places.\n\n22:10.640 --> 22:15.280\nSo now I tell the world that, so that the fire department, so people die.\n\n22:15.280 --> 22:20.000\nBut if you hold it down a second too long, you end up on a special floor where the elevator\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.400\nmaster goes, who brought you here?\n\n22:22.400 --> 22:25.640\nWe have no way of knowing.\n\n22:25.640 --> 22:28.360\nYou have come up, but you can never go down.\n\n22:28.360 --> 22:32.160\nYou're just in a shitty, like, adjustment bureau movie.\n\n22:32.160 --> 22:34.160\nWhat slumber party?\n\n22:34.160 --> 22:35.160\nOkay.\n\n22:35.160 --> 22:36.160\nOh.\n\n22:36.160 --> 22:37.160\nWhat?\n\n22:37.160 --> 22:38.160\nOh, sorry.\n\n22:38.160 --> 22:39.160\nI was asking about slumber parties.\n\n22:39.160 --> 22:41.160\nWe're like, murderers, and slumber parties.\n\n22:41.160 --> 22:46.080\nYeah, we have a slumber party podcast, so we get in pajamas because it's comfortable,\n\n22:46.080 --> 22:47.080\nand then we get people in a little...\n\n22:47.080 --> 22:50.360\nSlumber parties that no one until now has been able to see, like, you guys have actually\n\n22:50.360 --> 22:51.360\npitched a tent.\n\n22:51.360 --> 22:52.360\nWe do the pillow fort, we do the pajamas.\n\n22:52.360 --> 22:55.600\nYou get in there, and you make the guests feel comfortable, and then you talk to them.\n\n22:55.600 --> 22:59.120\nAnd now you're going to start doing that in front of an audience, so there's challenges\n\n22:59.120 --> 23:00.120\nthere.\n\n23:00.120 --> 23:01.120\nRight.\n\n23:01.120 --> 23:02.120\nAre there?\n\n23:02.120 --> 23:03.120\nHave you thought about them?\n\n23:03.120 --> 23:04.120\nNo, no, actually.\n\n23:04.120 --> 23:05.120\nWe haven't.\n\n23:05.120 --> 23:06.120\nNo.\n\n23:06.120 --> 23:07.120\nGood thing I'll be your first guest.\n\n23:07.120 --> 23:08.120\nThank you for being our first guest.\n\n23:08.120 --> 23:11.080\nWait, so you're going to be the first live guest of the slumber party?\n\n23:11.080 --> 23:12.080\nYeah.\n\n23:12.080 --> 23:13.080\nAre you going to wear PJs?\n\n23:13.080 --> 23:14.080\nSounds like it.\n\n23:14.080 --> 23:16.600\nCan you wear, like, a little onesie or something?\n\n23:16.600 --> 23:17.600\nYes.\n\n23:17.600 --> 23:18.600\nI have one.\n\n23:18.600 --> 23:19.600\nYou do?\n\n23:19.600 --> 23:21.200\nI got one from Paramount for Christmas.\n\n23:21.200 --> 23:22.200\nIt's like a red onesie.\n\n23:22.200 --> 23:23.200\nCan you wear that?\n\n23:23.200 --> 23:24.200\nSlippers?\n\n23:24.200 --> 23:25.680\nIs it a union suit?\n\n23:25.680 --> 23:26.680\nIt's a little button.\n\n23:26.680 --> 23:30.000\nYeah, it looks like I want you to get off my moonshine.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:37.360\nAll right, should we shift focus and talk about constitutional law and Justin Bieber?\n\n23:37.360 --> 23:38.360\nOh, yes.\n\n23:38.360 --> 23:40.960\nHe's on that scissor.\n\n23:40.960 --> 23:42.800\nHe's on that serp so bad.\n\n23:42.800 --> 23:45.880\nJeff, what do you know about Justin Bieber?\n\n23:45.880 --> 23:47.280\nVery precious little.\n\n23:47.280 --> 23:52.880\nI do know that I was slipping channels and he is throwing the charges for egging his\n\n23:52.880 --> 23:53.880\nneighbors.\n\n23:53.880 --> 23:58.800\nDoes anybody else in this audience have the immediate, do I have a personality disorder?\n\n23:58.800 --> 23:59.800\nYes.\n\n23:59.800 --> 24:06.520\nOr within five seconds of those kairons, are you upset about search and seizure?\n\n24:06.520 --> 24:12.280\nAre you upset about, like, all I heard was everybody's laughing about, like, oh, I guess\n\n24:12.280 --> 24:18.840\nJustin Bieber egged his neighbor's house so the cops raided his house and found cocaine.\n\n24:18.840 --> 24:19.840\nWhat?\n\n24:19.840 --> 24:23.080\nWait, back up a million steps in the fucking constitution.\n\n24:23.080 --> 24:28.640\nI know he's not American, but apparently either are we.\n\n24:28.640 --> 24:29.640\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n24:29.640 --> 24:35.640\nOh, well, I guess he had surveillance cameras so they want to, that's self-incriminating.\n\n24:35.640 --> 24:42.080\nYou can't, you can't, if I, I, I, look, I'm pretty sure if you search every house in\n\n24:42.080 --> 24:45.680\nCalifornia you're going to find some fucking cocaine.\n\n24:45.680 --> 24:48.560\nLet's just call that a given.\n\n24:48.560 --> 24:53.920\nLet's make the assumption that in the eyes of the fucking government, which is a shitty,\n\n24:53.920 --> 25:00.280\njoyless organization designed to govern, not to provide us with happiness, but to supposedly\n\n25:00.280 --> 25:07.680\nprotect it, let's just assume that within the eyes of a faceless, inhuman organization\n\n25:07.680 --> 25:13.160\nlike the government, every person's individual life is spent breaking the law.\n\n25:13.160 --> 25:17.200\nLet's assume that, that if you pull every car over, there's something nasty in their\n\n25:17.200 --> 25:18.200\ntrunk.\n\n25:18.200 --> 25:21.680\nIn any one's house, they got something that they're embarrassed about.\n\n25:21.680 --> 25:26.560\nThat's why the founding fathers put a little concept in the goddamn constitution called\n\n25:26.560 --> 25:28.080\nfucking privacy.\n\n25:28.080 --> 25:30.560\nWe have privacy.\n\n25:30.560 --> 25:32.880\nWe have a right to be individuals.\n\n25:32.880 --> 25:37.560\nAnd when it comes to drugs, I think it's perfectly fine for a country with a gross national product\n\n25:37.560 --> 25:43.040\nto say, well, at our borders, we're going to try to, like, put a throttle on the amount\n\n25:43.040 --> 25:47.040\nof cocaine or heroin or whatever the, whatever the fuck their business is.\n\n25:47.040 --> 25:51.520\nSo if you're living in a country that has less pantyhose or more potted ferns because\n\n25:51.520 --> 25:55.920\nyour giant country made a social contract with some free trade agreement with some other\n\n25:55.920 --> 25:57.960\ncountry, hey, that's tough titties for you as an individual.\n\n25:57.960 --> 26:05.080\nYou move countries or whatever, or you're trapped there and you have less pantyhose.\n\n26:05.080 --> 26:06.200\nSo goes drugs.\n\n26:06.200 --> 26:10.000\nBut I think the idea has always been that by the time a little bundle of cocaine gets\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:15.400\ninto your front pocket at the local bar, you're allowed to have it.\n\n26:15.400 --> 26:22.360\nLike, you need to have done some fucked up shit before they're allowed to find that shit.\n\n26:22.360 --> 26:24.280\nAnd people can't kick in your door.\n\n26:24.280 --> 26:27.120\nDid they burst in or did they actually have access to the house?\n\n26:27.120 --> 26:31.040\nAll I understood was that the kid egged a house.\n\n26:31.040 --> 26:34.720\nObviously he's been a bit of an annoyance in his neighborhood.\n\n26:34.720 --> 26:37.240\nI have a feeling his neighbor is well hooked up.\n\n26:37.240 --> 26:41.880\nI picture his neighbor being like a guy like me, like a 41-year-old guy whose neighbor\n\n26:41.880 --> 26:42.880\nis Justin Bieber.\n\n26:42.880 --> 26:50.240\nOr has had it for 20 years and dines with cops and is like, fuck this fucking kid.\n\n26:50.240 --> 26:54.600\nYou know what it kind of reminds me of is when you hear about people who were peeing\n\n26:54.600 --> 27:09.080\nin a bush, which is how we met, get arrested and then have sex crimes or what is it called?\n\n27:09.080 --> 27:10.080\nThank you.\n\n27:10.080 --> 27:14.880\nThey're on the sex offender registry because it's almost like a thing where they're like,\n\n27:14.880 --> 27:17.080\ncome in for a free tour and then they try to sell you a condo.\n\n27:17.080 --> 27:20.280\nYou're like, well, that's not really the same thing as that.\n\n27:20.280 --> 27:23.400\nAnd like, egging a fucking house, like if he really wanted to, he could have killed\n\n27:23.400 --> 27:24.400\nthat guy.\n\n27:24.400 --> 27:28.880\nI saw a couple days ago, god, if Bieber just whacked somebody, that would be so good.\n\n27:28.880 --> 27:32.880\nWhat do you mean when you say if he really wanted to, he could have whacked that guy?\n\n27:32.880 --> 27:38.280\nI'm just saying like, egging a house is an innocent, simple way to get out your frustrations\n\n27:38.280 --> 27:39.280\non this person.\n\n27:39.280 --> 27:40.280\nSo why is this?\n\n27:40.280 --> 27:41.280\nOver a certain dollar amount of damage.\n\n27:41.280 --> 27:42.280\nOh, I see what you're saying.\n\n27:42.280 --> 27:43.280\nYeah.\n\n27:43.280 --> 27:44.280\nYeah.\n\n27:44.280 --> 27:48.440\nWell, apparently there was $20,000 worth of damage, which is believable when you egg a\n\n27:48.440 --> 27:49.440\nrich person's house.\n\n27:49.440 --> 27:52.680\nAnd I saw this news item a couple of days ago, so I don't know what happened today, I guess\n\n27:52.680 --> 27:53.680\ntoday really.\n\n27:53.680 --> 27:57.200\nOh, he's got, he's drinking copious amounts of cough syrup.\n\n27:57.200 --> 27:58.200\nSweet.\n\n27:58.200 --> 27:59.200\nWhich is so sad.\n\n27:59.200 --> 28:00.200\nDid people do that?\n\n28:00.200 --> 28:01.200\nDoesn't he have any cocaine on him?\n\n28:01.200 --> 28:07.040\nThe impression that I got when I first watched it was that there was probably a bunch of\n\n28:07.040 --> 28:12.040\npeople in his house, he throws parties, and people, maybe him included, maybe not, went\n\n28:12.040 --> 28:15.680\nand egged the neighbor's house, and then the cops came in like, hey, can we come in?\n\n28:15.680 --> 28:16.680\nSure.\n\n28:16.680 --> 28:17.680\nAnd then there was somebody had cooked.\n\n28:17.680 --> 28:18.680\nRight.\n\n28:18.680 --> 28:21.800\nNow I think it was actually, I think it was on one of his entourage, little, little, little\n\n28:21.800 --> 28:23.800\npersonal pizza, whatever his name is.\n\n28:23.800 --> 28:24.800\nLittle personal pizza.\n\n28:24.800 --> 28:25.800\nThat's it.\n\n28:25.800 --> 28:27.800\nLike one of his, one of his entourage is named Little Zahar.\n\n28:27.800 --> 28:29.880\nDid he cash a little pee pee, right in dirty?\n\n28:29.880 --> 28:33.760\nBut, but, but, but the idea is, I'm telling you, I'm telling you right now, if you kick\n\n28:33.760 --> 28:37.320\nin my door, you're going to find some shit, I'm an American.\n\n28:37.320 --> 28:39.320\nLet's get over there right now.\n\n28:39.320 --> 28:40.320\nI'm trying to think.\n\n28:40.320 --> 28:46.240\nI pursue my fucking right to happiness, and I do it on my own property, and if you kick\n\n28:46.240 --> 28:51.120\nin my door, and you go through every inch of my house, you are going to find illegal\n\n28:51.120 --> 28:52.120\nshit.\n\n28:52.120 --> 28:56.120\nGod bless me.\n\n28:56.120 --> 29:00.600\nAnd the same went for George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who would have been hung\n\n29:00.600 --> 29:04.240\nif they caught them because they were fucking treasonous terrorists.\n\n29:04.240 --> 29:08.360\nThey were forming a fucking country where people should mind their own goddamn business.\n\n29:08.360 --> 29:11.080\nAnd I, and I, and I'm egging a house is shitty.\n\n29:11.080 --> 29:16.320\nAnd if you can prove that you egged a house, and you owe the guy 20 grand, that is not\n\n29:16.320 --> 29:17.320\nfun.\n\n29:17.320 --> 29:18.320\nThat is not a search warrant situation.\n\n29:18.320 --> 29:22.120\nWell, I, I don't think they, I would guess that it wasn't, they broke, they broke down\n\n29:22.120 --> 29:24.400\nthe door without a search warrant and started looking.\n\n29:24.400 --> 29:25.400\nNo, they served him a warrant.\n\n29:25.400 --> 29:26.400\nI'm sure.\n\n29:26.400 --> 29:27.400\nAnd I think, I think he was like, okay.\n\n29:27.400 --> 29:29.120\nBut they can also say, can we come in?\n\n29:29.120 --> 29:30.520\nAnd they go, yeah, you can come in.\n\n29:30.520 --> 29:33.200\nAnd when they come in and they see Coke on the table, they can go, what's this?\n\n29:33.200 --> 29:35.040\nAnd they can bust whoever is involved.\n\n29:35.040 --> 29:36.040\nAnyways, team Biebs.\n\n29:36.040 --> 29:37.040\nI'm just, I'm just saying, no.\n\n29:37.040 --> 29:41.080\nIt sounds to me, Dan, like you're, you're, you've become a bit of a constitutional\n\n29:41.080 --> 29:42.080\nbeliever.\n\n29:42.080 --> 29:48.360\nAnd I'm going back to all of Justin Bieber's crimes and I'm going, you know what, Anne\n\n29:48.360 --> 29:50.160\nFrank probably would have been a believer.\n\n29:50.160 --> 29:51.160\nHe had every right to.\n\n29:51.160 --> 29:52.160\nOh, God.\n\n29:52.160 --> 29:53.160\nOh, he said it.\n\n29:53.160 --> 29:57.320\nShe probably would have, but that's what I, I think he's getting, I think he's getting\n\n29:57.320 --> 30:01.080\npunished for just being a tiny douchebag is what's happened.\n\n30:01.080 --> 30:02.080\nExactly.\n\n30:02.080 --> 30:05.680\nAnd that is, if that's a crime, we're all in trouble, man, especially me.\n\n30:05.680 --> 30:06.680\nYeah.\n\n30:06.680 --> 30:11.080\nI think I need to keep my ass like, like, like, like I, it needs to not be illegal to be\n\n30:11.080 --> 30:12.080\nunlikable.\n\n30:12.080 --> 30:15.720\nMy only problem with Justin Bieber is that he's rocking and made quite famous the haircut\n\n30:15.720 --> 30:18.360\nthat I had when I was four.\n\n30:18.360 --> 30:23.480\nI was doing the big sweepy thing a long time ago and fucking nothing, no record deals.\n\n30:23.480 --> 30:28.320\nI also want to reach out to him and say, uh, from the bottom of my heart, I'm so sorry\n\n30:28.320 --> 30:34.320\nabout the photos they choose when you're being vilified in the, because man, they found,\n\n30:34.320 --> 30:40.440\nwhen I, when I, when I make my classic rape joke, uh, boy, they found the yellowest teeth.\n\n30:40.440 --> 30:48.360\nLike, like, they just found like these snarling photos of me going, I love rape.\n\n30:48.360 --> 30:51.880\nAnd, and, and, and he's, he's, he egged a house and they found cocaine and there's every\n\n30:51.880 --> 30:56.200\nphotos like him on the red carpet doing like a Corey Feldman break dancer.\n\n30:56.200 --> 31:04.720\nCan I, here's my, look, I love the constitution as much as anybody, but, um, I, I do think\n\n31:04.720 --> 31:10.360\nthat personal rights might have to be stepped in on when he's wearing the pants with the\n\n31:10.360 --> 31:11.760\ncrotch is by the knees.\n\n31:11.760 --> 31:16.440\nFucking no, then, then, no, then you're under, I don't know what that mean, crotch is by\n\n31:16.440 --> 31:17.440\nthe knees.\n\n31:17.440 --> 31:22.200\nAnd those pants, the saggy crotch pants were like, the, the, the, the bells would be where\n\n31:22.200 --> 31:26.320\nthe normal pants would be wasted, but the crotch portion is down here.\n\n31:26.320 --> 31:27.320\nSo it's okay.\n\n31:27.320 --> 31:28.320\nYou know what?\n\n31:28.320 --> 31:29.320\nIt's full of cocaine and eggs and cough syrup.\n\n31:29.320 --> 31:30.320\nCocaine and eggs and cough syrup?\n\n31:30.320 --> 31:31.320\nYou know what?\n\n31:31.320 --> 31:32.320\nOh my.\n\n31:32.320 --> 31:33.320\nThe heaviest habits, no demand.\n\n31:33.320 --> 31:34.320\nJust in case.\n\n31:34.320 --> 31:35.320\nJust in case.\n\n31:35.320 --> 31:36.320\nJust in case.\n\n31:36.320 --> 31:37.320\nGood night, everybody.\n\n31:37.320 --> 31:38.320\nIt's been our show.\n\n31:38.320 --> 31:39.320\nThank you for coming to Harmontown.\n\n31:39.320 --> 31:40.320\nLet's search her house.\n\n31:40.320 --> 31:50.320\nShe made a pun.\n\n31:50.320 --> 31:51.320\nWhat's that, Georgia?\n\n31:51.320 --> 31:53.120\nWhat's the worst thing they would find in your house?\n\n31:53.120 --> 31:56.120\nThe worst thing they would, Georgia and I have this game we play on slumber party because\n\n31:56.120 --> 31:59.160\nwe ask slumber party questions and one of them is when you die, what's the worst thing\n\n31:59.160 --> 32:00.160\nthat you fail with?\n\n32:00.160 --> 32:01.160\nThen feel free to include hard drugs.\n\n32:01.160 --> 32:02.160\nOh, hard drugs.\n\n32:02.160 --> 32:03.160\nThen we're all fucked.\n\n32:03.160 --> 32:10.160\nYou know, I, I, I got us, this isn't my house, but I, I stay friends with an ex partly\n\n32:10.160 --> 32:13.160\nbecause he has videos and pictures.\n\n32:13.160 --> 32:15.160\nYou know what I mean?\n\n32:15.160 --> 32:16.160\nAnd it's like, what's his name?\n\n32:16.160 --> 32:17.160\nI'm just kidding.\n\n32:17.160 --> 32:18.160\nNo.\n\n32:18.160 --> 32:22.360\nHe, you know, I can't piss him off that much because he has.\n\n32:22.360 --> 32:23.360\nWhat are these videos?\n\n32:23.360 --> 32:24.360\nCan you, like in broad strokes?\n\n32:24.360 --> 32:26.360\nLong term relationship videos and stuff.\n\n32:26.360 --> 32:28.360\nShe was in a musical.\n\n32:28.360 --> 32:29.360\nYeah.\n\n32:29.360 --> 32:30.360\nYeah.\n\n32:30.360 --> 32:31.360\nYeah.\n\n32:31.360 --> 32:37.160\nIt's you and, it's you and Pippin when you're, no, it's a kinky scale, one to 10, 10 being\n\n32:37.160 --> 32:38.160\nholy shit.\n\n32:38.160 --> 32:39.160\nFive.\n\n32:39.160 --> 32:40.160\nFive.\n\n32:40.160 --> 32:41.160\nIt's not that bad.\n\n32:41.160 --> 32:42.160\nYeah.\n\n32:42.160 --> 32:43.160\nSo yeah, enough to, enough to be embarrassing.\n\n32:43.160 --> 32:44.160\nBut not, yeah.\n\n32:44.160 --> 32:45.160\nNot felonious.\n\n32:45.160 --> 32:46.160\nMy hair was terrible.\n\n32:46.160 --> 32:47.160\nYou know.\n\n32:47.160 --> 32:48.160\nOh yeah.\n\n32:48.160 --> 32:49.160\nIs that what you're worried about?\n\n32:49.160 --> 32:53.240\nSee Dan, it seems to me that a lot of your beef with this whole Justin Bieber break-in\n\n32:53.240 --> 32:58.160\nis that the idea that your, your illegal stuff at home isn't safe, right?\n\n32:58.160 --> 33:06.640\nIt all, it all goes back to me taking a pee in first grade and all of the kids at the\n\n33:06.640 --> 33:12.280\nyear and all slowly looking over and laughing at me and at that point, me realizing that\n\n33:12.280 --> 33:15.080\nyou're not supposed to drop your underwear and pants all the way to your ankle.\n\n33:15.080 --> 33:16.080\nI knew it.\n\n33:16.080 --> 33:17.880\nOh God, it's awful.\n\n33:17.880 --> 33:23.040\nWhich is why Justin Bieber invented these new pants that are, that the job is half\n\n33:23.040 --> 33:24.040\nnone.\n\n33:24.040 --> 33:25.040\nI mean, there is overlap there.\n\n33:25.040 --> 33:29.760\nMaybe people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their pant level too.\n\n33:29.760 --> 33:38.960\nThe, the, I, I, I, I, I, I never diagnosed myself with Asperger's, I never will, I'm\n\n33:38.960 --> 33:45.440\n41, it takes too long, too much money, I don't care, but, but I have achieved a lot of understanding\n\n33:45.440 --> 33:51.040\nabout my personality and the struggles I've gone through by, by participating or voyeuristically\n\n33:51.040 --> 33:57.480\nspying on conversations between people on the spectrum on the internet, which I started\n\n33:57.480 --> 34:01.200\ndoing accidentally because I was writing this character that, that I didn't want to, I didn't\n\n34:01.200 --> 34:03.200\nwant to get wrong.\n\n34:03.200 --> 34:08.680\nAnd, and I, what I understand now very clearly is that there's a bit, like we all share\n\n34:08.680 --> 34:13.960\nas a fear of alienation and excommunication and that a lot of people have like these\n\n34:13.960 --> 34:18.440\ntendrils, these social cues, these pickups and things like, like, like, like, like,\n\n34:18.440 --> 34:22.320\nthey just keep them safe, like, like people, there's people who are naturally buoyant to\n\n34:22.320 --> 34:26.400\nuse the metaphor of a pool and then there's people who feel like they sink like a stone\n\n34:26.400 --> 34:30.360\nafter a second if they don't flail or grab something.\n\n34:30.360 --> 34:34.880\nAnd I think when you're on the spectrum, you are, it's not, it's not that doing things\n\n34:34.880 --> 34:39.720\nwrong, it's the realization that you can do things wrong and not even realize that you've\n\n34:39.720 --> 34:45.000\nbeen doing them wrong until it's too late and it's that fear that we all have of being\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:46.000\nkicked out.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:50.760\nIt's like, I didn't know that if I egged my neighbor's house, you could fucking kick\n\n34:50.760 --> 34:51.760\nin my door.\n\n34:51.760 --> 34:57.040\nWe've both been pantsed before, like, as young people, like, the panting was a formative\n\n34:57.040 --> 34:58.040\ndrama.\n\n34:58.040 --> 34:59.040\nOh, it changed my life.\n\n34:59.040 --> 35:02.080\nI'm coming out to you in the lunchroom and just slapping you in the back of the head\n\n35:02.080 --> 35:06.200\nand you have no idea it was coming and you don't know why it happened and then you find\n\n35:06.200 --> 35:11.360\nout because you're confused and your hero is Spock or Dr. Who and he gets to the bottom\n\n35:11.360 --> 35:12.360\nof things.\n\n35:12.360 --> 35:13.480\nLike, why did that happen?\n\n35:13.480 --> 35:15.360\nWhy did Troy do that?\n\n35:15.360 --> 35:20.360\nTroy did that because you spoke up in science class and you embarrassed him, you raised\n\n35:20.360 --> 35:21.520\nyour hand at the wrong time.\n\n35:21.520 --> 35:23.560\nYou've been wearing those pants for too many days in a row.\n\n35:23.560 --> 35:28.240\nWell, realizing you're the butt of the joke is like the most eye-opening thing that happened\n\n35:28.240 --> 35:32.840\nwhen I was in fifth grade and got pants and I was like, oh, this is funny to people.\n\n35:32.840 --> 35:33.840\nWhat was your reaction?\n\n35:33.840 --> 35:38.120\nBecause I saw some girls go through some pretty traumatic pantsings.\n\n35:38.120 --> 35:41.080\nLike, really traumatic life, like life changing.\n\n35:41.080 --> 35:42.080\nOh, yeah.\n\n35:42.080 --> 35:45.120\nMine was in seventh grade and I was in a fight with my friend Laura.\n\n35:45.120 --> 35:50.840\nShe was not drunk and not in the hotel room, but her boyfriend was a dick.\n\n35:50.840 --> 35:53.640\nAnd yeah, like a whole group of them are like, hey, Laura wants to talk to you.\n\n35:53.640 --> 35:58.400\nAnd then Kenji, her boyfriend came up behind me and pulled the guy down and he should die.\n\n35:58.400 --> 36:01.920\nAnd it was like, I had a whole like group of people watching.\n\n36:01.920 --> 36:06.800\nI remember the same thing, slow motion, my entire fifth grade class.\n\n36:06.800 --> 36:08.400\nDown to the knickers or down to fully nude?\n\n36:08.400 --> 36:09.400\nJust underwear.\n\n36:09.400 --> 36:10.400\nI think just underwear.\n\n36:10.400 --> 36:13.680\nBut still, like, you don't get pantsed if you're like a popular kid.\n\n36:13.680 --> 36:18.400\nWe both were really, oh, yeah, super dorks, hated ourselves with total nerds and then\n\n36:18.400 --> 36:19.400\nthat happened.\n\n36:19.400 --> 36:20.960\nClap Kenji in the fucking face, though.\n\n36:20.960 --> 36:21.960\nI clawed the girls' arms.\n\n36:21.960 --> 36:22.960\nI clawed the girls' arms.\n\n36:22.960 --> 36:26.160\nIt's funny that you guys have the slumber party motif, though, because slumber parties\n\n36:26.160 --> 36:29.480\nwere really even beyond any scholastic environments.\n\n36:29.480 --> 36:35.280\nSlumber parties, your closest friends, also the place where the knife could go in the\n\n36:35.280 --> 36:36.280\ndeepest.\n\n36:36.280 --> 36:41.080\nLike, I have my best times and my worst times at slumber parties, where we call them sleepovers\n\n36:41.080 --> 36:43.880\nbecause we were dudes.\n\n36:43.880 --> 36:48.720\nBut we, you know, like the most, the reason why you always wanted to have sleepovers is\n\n36:48.720 --> 36:55.280\nbecause you wanted to be participatory of like the most joyous moments of young life\n\n36:55.280 --> 36:59.080\nand like those spikes would come and those are like jumping up and down in your friends\n\n36:59.080 --> 37:00.360\nand you're having a great time.\n\n37:00.360 --> 37:05.000\nBut then, oh, my worst memories are at slumber parties where I'm suddenly realizing again,\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.840\nlike, wait, what the fuck, what did I, wait, me?\n\n37:07.840 --> 37:08.840\nI'm the scapegoat?\n\n37:08.840 --> 37:09.840\nNo, that's the worst.\n\n37:09.840 --> 37:11.840\nDid you guys have a meeting about this?\n\n37:11.840 --> 37:14.080\nThat's the worst, but that's the worst fear.\n\n37:14.080 --> 37:16.640\nThat's the fear that's so weirdly universal to humanity.\n\n37:16.640 --> 37:20.640\nAnd I wouldn't get like, I wouldn't get like, like, down or about it, but it's something\n\n37:20.640 --> 37:24.200\nthat I struggle with my whole life and being like, what if everyone fucking hates me and\n\n37:24.200 --> 37:25.200\nI have no idea?\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:29.360\nSo when a helicopter shot at Justin Bieber's house is a thing, like, my mind doesn't automatically\n\n37:29.360 --> 37:33.280\ngo to, ha, fuck that guy, he's so popular and rich.\n\n37:33.280 --> 37:40.400\nMy mind goes to, fuck the police, fuck, like, I know there's police out there that are such\n\n37:40.400 --> 37:41.400\ngreat people.\n\n37:41.400 --> 37:47.240\nLike, thank God there are decent people who've signed up for that job, but I'm just saying\n\n37:47.240 --> 37:53.280\nas an institution, like, if I'm watching someone's house get raided on CNN, like, I never go,\n\n37:53.280 --> 37:57.280\nI don't care how famous they are, like, first we have to hate the government, then we have\n\n37:57.280 --> 37:59.600\nto hate famous people in that order.\n\n37:59.600 --> 38:01.680\nSo important.\n\n38:01.680 --> 38:05.600\nBecause famous people can't yet, all they can really do is fuck with your brain a little\n\n38:05.600 --> 38:07.600\nbit and lower your taste.\n\n38:07.600 --> 38:10.360\nThe government can really do a lot of damage with too much power.\n\n38:10.360 --> 38:11.800\nThose things don't really make sense.\n\n38:11.800 --> 38:17.320\nEgging to raiding, don't, it's Charlie Sheehan, you'd be like, well, he brought this all\n\n38:17.320 --> 38:18.320\ncome in.\n\n38:18.320 --> 38:21.440\nIf there was a news story that broke about a little kid that egged somebody's house\n\n38:21.440 --> 38:27.440\nand then the cops raided their house, like, under the right demographic circumstances,\n\n38:27.440 --> 38:28.440\nthat would be all over Facebook.\n\n38:28.440 --> 38:32.640\nThat happens every night all across the country, I'm certain.\n\n38:32.640 --> 38:35.960\nWell, it's called raiding people's houses who didn't even egg people because they live\n\n38:35.960 --> 38:36.960\nin the wrong neighborhood.\n\n38:36.960 --> 38:45.480\nIf you live in a wealthy neighborhood and you are a non-famous child living in a neighborhood\n\n38:45.480 --> 38:52.800\nor a youngster like he is, and you decide to do shitloads of, like, heavy-duty damage\n\n38:52.800 --> 38:55.040\nto your neighbor's house, the cops are coming.\n\n38:55.040 --> 38:57.080\nThey're going to come into your house if you allow them in.\n\n38:57.080 --> 39:01.080\nIf you go, no, sir, not without a warrant, they'll go, all right, they'll have to play\n\n39:01.080 --> 39:02.080\nMother Rules.\n\n39:02.080 --> 39:05.320\nBut if you let them in and they find drugs there, you go to jail, everybody there gets\n\n39:05.320 --> 39:07.540\nquestioned and all that shit happens.\n\n39:07.540 --> 39:09.840\nHelicopters come because he's Justin Bieber, but then-\n\n39:09.840 --> 39:10.840\nNo, those are news coppers.\n\n39:10.840 --> 39:11.840\nI understand.\n\n39:11.840 --> 39:12.840\nCopters.\n\n39:12.840 --> 39:13.840\nI understand.\n\n39:13.840 --> 39:20.640\nBut the whole thing in total that disturbs me is that the entire thing adds up to something\n\n39:20.640 --> 39:24.920\nthat we all just take for granted, which is that, oh, well, he had it coming.\n\n39:24.920 --> 39:26.120\nNow, wait a minute.\n\n39:26.120 --> 39:27.800\nI don't care who had it coming.\n\n39:27.800 --> 39:29.160\nI watch enough law and order.\n\n39:29.160 --> 39:34.000\nI love me some Sam Waterston, like, the rule of law is what's important.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:35.960\nIt doesn't matter who had it coming.\n\n39:35.960 --> 39:41.280\nYou can't shoot someone in the face because they, you know, until after the law fails\n\n39:41.280 --> 39:42.280\nyou anyway.\n\n39:42.280 --> 39:49.080\nLike, you know, you can't, like, and we can't just look at somebody and go, like, oh, well,\n\n39:49.080 --> 39:54.280\nhe was a dick about that monkey thing on the airline and there's been all kinds of stories\n\n39:54.280 --> 39:55.280\nabout him.\n\n39:55.280 --> 39:56.280\nSo fuck him.\n\n39:56.280 --> 39:57.280\nNo.\n\n39:57.280 --> 39:58.280\nNot fuck anybody.\n\n39:58.280 --> 39:59.600\nIs Justin Bieber under charges right now?\n\n39:59.600 --> 40:01.000\nHas he been, like, arrested or arrested?\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:02.000\nI don't know.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:03.000\nI gave up at my outrage.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.520\nI had something to talk about so I stopped researching.\n\n40:05.520 --> 40:10.160\nHe was in the news today for drinking a shitton of weird cough syrup, which is so slumming\n\n40:10.160 --> 40:11.160\nit.\n\n40:11.160 --> 40:14.280\nBut on that point, though, I think there's something really interesting about, like,\n\n40:14.280 --> 40:21.440\nabout Hive Mind and about, have you ever heard of the term tallest poppy syndrome,\n\n40:21.440 --> 40:27.400\nwhere it's like a metaphor for the tallest poppies in opium crops get cut because they\n\n40:27.400 --> 40:28.400\ndon't conform?\n\n40:28.400 --> 40:34.800\nSo this idea that something rises above and it's bigger and it's more conspicuous than\n\n40:34.800 --> 40:38.360\ngets the nature, human nature, is to chop it.\n\n40:38.360 --> 40:42.240\nAnd so it's, that's the, I think it's above constitutional law concerns.\n\n40:42.240 --> 40:44.240\nIt's also that, that, you know.\n\n40:44.240 --> 40:45.240\nThat's Harrison Bergeron.\n\n40:45.240 --> 40:46.240\nBut that's celebrity.\n\n40:46.240 --> 40:52.560\nBut that's celebrity as we're uncomfortable with a kid who put a YouTube video up and\n\n40:52.560 --> 40:54.920\nbecame a billionaire at 12.\n\n40:54.920 --> 40:55.920\nThat's my problem.\n\n40:55.920 --> 40:57.920\nAnd gets more posy than anyone in this room ever will.\n\n40:57.920 --> 40:58.920\nObviously.\n\n40:58.920 --> 41:02.680\nI thought, I thought our country was supposed to be about innovation and this whole stuff.\n\n41:02.680 --> 41:08.160\nThe glee that we take in raising people up, it's like, if somebody is that famous, it's\n\n41:08.160 --> 41:10.920\nbecause everybody loved them and then we crucify them.\n\n41:10.920 --> 41:11.920\nThat's what we do.\n\n41:11.920 --> 41:15.520\nIt's, it's, it's, I don't like that and neither did God.\n\n41:15.520 --> 41:16.520\nHence the New Testament.\n\n41:16.520 --> 41:17.520\nNo, it's not.\n\n41:17.520 --> 41:21.720\nIt's not a cool behavior and we fucking don't learn our lesson.\n\n41:21.720 --> 41:26.040\nBut all of that is a reflection also, and this is super cheesy, but of how much you actually\n\n41:26.040 --> 41:29.760\nlike yourself and if you hate yourself, you want everyone to hate themselves.\n\n41:29.760 --> 41:32.800\nAnd if you're okay with yourself, you don't give a shit what people think about themselves.\n\n41:32.800 --> 41:36.800\nAnd so the idea that if you're in this cycle of like, I suck, I suck, everyone hates me,\n\n41:36.800 --> 41:37.800\nI must be terrible.\n\n41:37.800 --> 41:38.800\nWhat's wrong with me?\n\n41:38.800 --> 41:39.800\nIs there something wrong with me?\n\n41:39.800 --> 41:40.800\nI don't know about.\n\n41:40.800 --> 41:41.800\nAm I okay today?\n\n41:41.800 --> 41:43.800\nYou're, you're going to want, you're going to wish failure on everyone.\n\n41:43.800 --> 41:44.800\nYeah.\n\n41:44.800 --> 41:45.800\nAnd you, and you're going to feel fine with it.\n\n41:45.800 --> 41:47.800\nIt's like throwing a rock at the moon.\n\n41:47.800 --> 41:52.640\nThat's every day on Twitter, somebody like takes a shot at me, you know, 85,000 people\n\n41:52.640 --> 41:56.880\nhug me and make me feel wonderful about myself, and then one person goes like, Hey fuckface,\n\n41:56.880 --> 41:58.880\nwhy are you so fat and untalented?\n\n41:58.880 --> 42:03.000\nAnd of course I go like, well, let's talk about this.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:06.560\nAnd I get up my eyeglasses and I want to talk to them.\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:10.200\nAnd I like over and over and over again, it's the same thing.\n\n42:10.200 --> 42:15.040\nIt's like this person that no matter how they want to dress it up, regardless of what form\n\n42:15.040 --> 42:21.840\nthey take, it's this person that is actually quite shocked in the end that like I would\n\n42:21.840 --> 42:24.760\ngo, Hey, what?\n\n42:24.760 --> 42:28.680\nBecause the first thing they say is they go like, what a loser talking to me.\n\n42:28.680 --> 42:29.680\nWhat the fuck?\n\n42:29.680 --> 42:30.680\nThat's sad.\n\n42:30.680 --> 42:34.360\nYou don't want to, well, why did you talk to me?\n\n42:34.360 --> 42:35.360\nAre you doing it?\n\n42:35.360 --> 42:36.360\nLike do you want to?\n\n42:36.360 --> 42:37.360\nWell, I just think I'm fucking you up.\n\n42:37.360 --> 42:43.160\nAnd then 90% of them go like, look, maybe I misspoke, I was just saying, like, I think,\n\n42:43.160 --> 42:47.520\nlike, like, like, it's our celebrity worship is.\n\n42:47.520 --> 42:48.520\nThey think you're invincible.\n\n42:48.520 --> 42:49.520\nThey think you're invincible.\n\n42:49.520 --> 42:50.520\nIt is dangerous.\n\n42:50.520 --> 42:51.520\nThey don't know.\n\n42:51.520 --> 42:58.040\nAnd that's just me, like, I exist in a safe part of that pond, you look at the things\n\n42:58.040 --> 43:06.680\nif you ever go to like a Kardashian's Instagram, and some girl takes a photo of herself and\n\n43:06.680 --> 43:15.920\nsays, I'm having fun at the zoo, I'm a Kardashian, and the things like it's just kill yourself.\n\n43:15.920 --> 43:18.520\nYou should kill yourself if you don't kill yourself.\n\n43:18.520 --> 43:19.520\nI'm going to kill you.\n\n43:19.520 --> 43:21.800\nI'm going to hire someone to kill you.\n\n43:21.800 --> 43:23.200\nYour head looks stupid.\n\n43:23.200 --> 43:25.000\nYour face looks stupid.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.440\nYou shouldn't be at the zoo.\n\n43:26.440 --> 43:28.720\nYou're a horrible person.\n\n43:28.720 --> 43:31.240\nI hope your face gets ripped off by that animal.\n\n43:31.240 --> 43:32.740\nI hope you're...\n\n43:32.740 --> 43:33.740\nI don't...\n\n43:33.740 --> 43:35.800\nI've never watched the Kardashian show.\n\n43:35.800 --> 43:40.240\nI don't know what these people do that's so wrong, but it's so disturbing.\n\n43:40.240 --> 43:45.320\nWe always, like, have, like, like, struggled with the thought of, like, promoting ourselves,\n\n43:45.320 --> 43:49.080\nlike, and being like, look at me doing this thing, and look at us doing this thing, and\n\n43:49.080 --> 43:53.560\nhey, we're going to be even, like, at Harmontown, and it's like, are we bragging?\n\n43:53.560 --> 43:56.520\nAre we inviting people to be annoyed with us and to hate us?\n\n43:56.520 --> 43:57.520\nYeah.\n\n43:57.520 --> 43:58.520\nWell, that's a large...\n\n43:58.520 --> 43:59.520\nI got a documentary coming out about myself.\n\n43:59.520 --> 44:00.520\nThat's going to go well.\n\n44:00.520 --> 44:02.320\nThat's going to go real well.\n\n44:02.320 --> 44:09.600\nI can't wait to read the AV Club review of the documentary I produced about myself.\n\n44:09.600 --> 44:10.600\nThat's going to go...\n\n44:10.600 --> 44:12.600\nThat's going to make me feel fantastic.\n\n44:12.600 --> 44:18.000\nWell, but all of that is, you'll notice, like, the more invincible and the more on top people\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:23.080\nwill see, then the more of that, like, chopping poppy syndrome you see.\n\n44:23.080 --> 44:25.760\nAnd so you have to understand and take that with some kind of weird...\n\n44:25.760 --> 44:26.760\nIt's almost like...\n\n44:26.760 --> 44:29.880\nAnd I don't know if this is part of the solution or part of the problem, but I think what you're\n\n44:29.880 --> 44:37.200\nsuggesting is that a healthy person would look at each knife as a hug, like, but I don't\n\n44:37.200 --> 44:39.680\nknow if that turns you into a monster.\n\n44:39.680 --> 44:41.720\nIsn't that the definition of an associate path?\n\n44:41.720 --> 44:45.400\nI think what you do is look at the person on the other side of the knife and realize\n\n44:45.400 --> 44:47.960\nthat they're these sad people who are never going to affect your life.\n\n44:47.960 --> 44:48.960\nDon't matter.\n\n44:48.960 --> 44:51.880\nIn their mind, the blade on the knife is a nerf blade.\n\n44:51.880 --> 44:52.880\nYeah.\n\n44:52.880 --> 44:55.240\nI mean, really, they're trying to get your attention.\n\n44:55.240 --> 44:56.240\nThat's what they're doing.\n\n44:56.240 --> 44:58.040\nAnd so there's something about them that needs to be yourself.\n\n44:58.040 --> 45:03.240\nIt's almost like an Andy Kaufman routine where it's like, like, he just went, fuck it.\n\n45:03.240 --> 45:06.400\nIf people are booing you, that's part of the act.\n\n45:06.400 --> 45:08.320\nLike, it didn't affect him that way.\n\n45:08.320 --> 45:11.880\nBut you just said, Dan, that you know that 85,000 people hug you and one person says,\n\n45:11.880 --> 45:13.880\nuh, you're fat and that drives you crazy.\n\n45:13.880 --> 45:18.520\nYou, you, you don't think that you're going to get 100% of the people to say nice things\n\n45:18.520 --> 45:19.520\nto you online.\n\n45:19.520 --> 45:20.520\nRight.\n\n45:20.520 --> 45:23.640\nSo intellectually, you understand that there's a percentage of people who are going to say\n\n45:23.640 --> 45:24.640\nthat.\n\n45:24.640 --> 45:28.200\nNo, I understand that all intellectually, but that's just like, I don't, I, I'll look\n\n45:28.200 --> 45:29.200\nhere.\n\n45:29.200 --> 45:30.200\nHere's the thing.\n\n45:30.200 --> 45:37.880\nUh, everyone loved the last episode of community, uh, about five seconds into reading the praise\n\n45:37.880 --> 45:44.440\nof the last episode of community, I started to get bummed out because the praise came\n\n45:44.440 --> 45:49.880\nin the form of this is the funniest episode of community since season two, which made\n\n45:49.880 --> 45:54.240\nme go, bad job at season three.\n\n45:54.240 --> 45:57.800\nI, I made a realization and I'll make it again for the rest of my life.\n\n45:57.800 --> 45:58.800\nIt's too late for me.\n\n45:58.800 --> 46:03.400\nI'll never be mentally healthy, but it's another epiphany in my epiphany drawer.\n\n46:03.400 --> 46:07.680\nMy work, my relationship with strangers will never make me happy.\n\n46:07.680 --> 46:08.680\nThat's how sick I am.\n\n46:08.680 --> 46:10.280\nSo yes, I realize all these things.\n\n46:10.280 --> 46:13.000\nThe logical realization of it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't mean anything.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:17.560\nBut do you think that this, that you yourself hatred and we both have it in certain doses\n\n46:17.560 --> 46:24.280\nlike helps fuel you as a person because you, you hate yourself yet you've made this incredible\n\n46:24.280 --> 46:27.640\ncareer, like career doing something you love and are good at.\n\n46:27.640 --> 46:31.600\nBut you know, if you liked yourself, would you have tried so hard to prove?\n\n46:31.600 --> 46:32.600\nNo, exactly.\n\n46:32.600 --> 46:33.600\nYeah.\n\n46:33.600 --> 46:37.640\nThat's a problem is that am, that validation is the reward for ambition, which can a lot\n\n46:37.640 --> 46:39.480\nof times be fueled by the need for validation.\n\n46:39.480 --> 46:42.560\nSo you, if you are like, ah, fuck, I got a hole in my bucket.\n\n46:42.560 --> 46:44.880\nYou're going to keep trying to fill your bucket and you're like, I still got a hole\n\n46:44.880 --> 46:45.880\nin it.\n\n46:45.880 --> 46:49.440\nI think the key has something to do with that whole, the whole of the bucket has to, you\n\n46:49.440 --> 46:56.760\nhave to let that lead you into vocational ambition where it will never be fulfilled.\n\n46:56.760 --> 47:02.480\nAnd you have to then simultaneously somehow I'm miming like some bucket going underwater.\n\n47:02.480 --> 47:10.160\nIt looks like some weird thing, but, but like, like while that, while that incom, that unfillable\n\n47:10.160 --> 47:18.680\nvoid directs you forward in terms of the things you output, you simultaneously have to derive\n\n47:18.680 --> 47:23.120\nyour emotional well-being from your dog, your fiance, your,\n\n47:23.120 --> 47:24.120\nBut you're amazing.\n\n47:24.120 --> 47:25.120\nYou're not mine.\n\n47:25.120 --> 47:26.120\nI have neither.\n\n47:26.120 --> 47:32.320\nAnd you have to not let those things, that's the, that's the thing, like you can't like\n\n47:32.320 --> 47:38.080\nyou have to like, yeah, you just have to go like, okay, I'm, I'm a person who can never\n\n47:38.080 --> 47:39.560\ndo anything right for anybody.\n\n47:39.560 --> 47:43.080\nSo I'm going to always like, until I drop dead, like Robert Altman, I'm just going to\n\n47:43.080 --> 47:45.080\nlike make things like Woody Allen.\n\n47:45.080 --> 47:46.080\nI'll just make things.\n\n47:46.080 --> 47:47.080\nLike those are great.\n\n47:47.080 --> 47:51.160\nThey're heroes of ours because they're prolific, but they compartmentalize because obviously\n\n47:51.160 --> 47:57.080\nif Woody Allen ever allowed people's opinions of his personality to mitigate his output,\n\n47:57.080 --> 48:01.120\nthere would have been a little bit of a divot at a certain point in his career and there\n\n48:01.120 --> 48:02.120\nwasn't.\n\n48:02.120 --> 48:03.120\nI don't know how to not egg anyone.\n\n48:03.120 --> 48:04.120\nIf you should never egg anyone.\n\n48:04.120 --> 48:05.660\nI think Christina Barcelona was pretty shitty.\n\n48:05.660 --> 48:10.620\nWell, yeah, I mean, he's a, he's psychologically probably a monster, but that's okay.\n\n48:10.620 --> 48:15.440\nAnd he's not listening and he won't punch a mirror when you say that unlike me.\n\n48:15.440 --> 48:16.480\nAnd that's where I fall short.\n\n48:16.480 --> 48:18.600\nLike I probably won't punch a mirror, but...\n\n48:18.600 --> 48:23.920\nBut that's, I mean that's the thing is, is in, for me, we would not have multiple TV\n\n48:23.920 --> 48:24.920\nshows.\n\n48:24.920 --> 48:28.900\nIf out of a McNuggetini video, if I didn't have an unfillable void.\n\n48:28.900 --> 48:32.580\nYeah, my anxiety and depression wasn't fueled on like,\n\n48:32.580 --> 48:34.420\nbut you're not doing enough, enough, enough.\n\n48:34.420 --> 48:36.540\nWe wouldn't have, yeah, we wouldn't have.\n\n48:36.540 --> 48:37.940\nI have no ambition.\n\n48:37.940 --> 48:39.060\nI have zero.\n\n48:39.060 --> 48:41.220\nWell, maybe, well, that's a good thing to do.\n\n48:41.220 --> 48:44.860\nI don't, I don't think I'm crazy enough\n\n48:44.860 --> 48:46.420\nto be that talented or that funny.\n\n48:46.420 --> 48:47.260\nLike, I feel like-\n\n48:47.260 --> 48:48.100\nWell, I don't think I'm talented.\n\n48:48.100 --> 48:49.100\nI know, I worked my ass off.\n\n48:49.100 --> 48:51.700\nThe guilt of having a partner that you have to,\n\n48:51.700 --> 48:53.220\nI would have never done this on my own.\n\n48:53.220 --> 48:54.060\nLike, the guilt of being like,\n\n48:54.060 --> 48:55.300\nwell, I was gonna be disappointed\n\n48:55.300 --> 48:56.140\nif I don't write this thing.\n\n48:56.140 --> 48:58.220\nOr like, well, I have to show that I'm carrying my weight.\n\n48:58.220 --> 49:00.220\nAnd so, when you have someone to work with like that,\n\n49:00.220 --> 49:01.060\nit really helps.\n\n49:01.060 --> 49:02.620\nI'm the deadline bitch a lot of times.\n\n49:02.620 --> 49:03.460\nSo, I keep-\n\n49:03.460 --> 49:04.300\nSee, I don't like people like you\n\n49:04.300 --> 49:06.420\nthat have ambition, that have,\n\n49:06.420 --> 49:08.940\nI don't like people that have holes in their bucket\n\n49:08.940 --> 49:11.260\nbecause you guys are all the people that get shit done.\n\n49:11.260 --> 49:12.100\nYou guys are-\n\n49:12.100 --> 49:12.940\nI know.\n\n49:12.940 --> 49:13.780\nBecause we're never gonna be happy.\n\n49:13.780 --> 49:15.380\nYou have careers and shit like that.\n\n49:15.380 --> 49:16.620\nNo, I actually had a weird,\n\n49:16.620 --> 49:17.660\nand I don't know if this is,\n\n49:17.660 --> 49:18.500\nyou guys don't know me,\n\n49:18.500 --> 49:19.700\nso I don't know if this is weirdly personal,\n\n49:19.700 --> 49:21.820\nbut I had a fucking, the last couple weeks,\n\n49:21.820 --> 49:23.340\nI, we've both had really hard years.\n\n49:23.340 --> 49:24.380\nWe've had terrible years.\n\n49:24.380 --> 49:26.620\nAnd if you listen to Slumber Party with Ali\n\n49:26.620 --> 49:27.980\nand George on Feral Audio,\n\n49:27.980 --> 49:30.620\nwe, one of our episodes was called Flash Flood of Sadness\n\n49:30.620 --> 49:32.140\nbecause like in the one month,\n\n49:32.140 --> 49:33.580\nlike we just, we both went through\n\n49:33.580 --> 49:36.660\nall kinds of weird shit outside of our control.\n\n49:36.660 --> 49:38.940\nAnd so, I've had like this terrible hard year,\n\n49:38.940 --> 49:41.580\nand I have beat myself up a million times\n\n49:41.580 --> 49:42.980\nfor how I am not enough.\n\n49:42.980 --> 49:44.180\nI didn't handle it well.\n\n49:44.180 --> 49:45.820\nEveryone must hate me, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n49:45.820 --> 49:47.860\nI, if I send a birthday gift late,\n\n49:47.860 --> 49:49.060\nI'm like, oh, I'm a monster.\n\n49:49.060 --> 49:50.580\nI'm a social, I should kill myself.\n\n49:50.580 --> 49:52.460\nLike, I should Kardashian myself at the zoo.\n\n49:52.460 --> 49:53.300\nI'm the worst person.\n\n49:53.300 --> 49:58.300\nAnd I just recently, like just recently finally was like,\n\n49:59.460 --> 50:00.740\nI can't do this anymore.\n\n50:00.740 --> 50:02.420\nNo one wants me to hate myself.\n\n50:02.420 --> 50:04.220\nI keep thinking everyone will like me more\n\n50:04.220 --> 50:06.380\nif I'm successful and have it together.\n\n50:06.380 --> 50:08.220\nAnd I'm like, not hideous.\n\n50:08.220 --> 50:09.940\nAnd I have like a show with my best friend.\n\n50:09.940 --> 50:11.860\nAs long as I hate myself, I'm acceptable.\n\n50:11.860 --> 50:13.820\nAnd I was like, no, no one wants me to hate myself.\n\n50:13.820 --> 50:15.860\nI mean, that's makes me more of a garbage person.\n\n50:15.860 --> 50:17.020\nSo I'm just like, fuck it.\n\n50:17.020 --> 50:18.140\nI'm just gonna be okay with it\n\n50:18.140 --> 50:19.900\nand just worry about other shit.\n\n50:19.900 --> 50:22.300\nSo, thanks, oh my God, thanks.\n\n50:22.300 --> 50:23.140\nWoo!\n\n50:25.220 --> 50:26.900\nI'm able to accept your applause.\n\n50:26.900 --> 50:31.580\nThere is always an outrage underneath every hackle\n\n50:31.580 --> 50:33.420\nwhen you confront it that the people go like,\n\n50:33.420 --> 50:34.980\noh, wait a minute, what the fuck are you doing?\n\n50:34.980 --> 50:36.100\nYou're standing in front of me.\n\n50:36.100 --> 50:37.540\nYou're running your mouth.\n\n50:37.540 --> 50:39.660\nI'm not allowed to shoot a paintball gun at you.\n\n50:39.660 --> 50:40.580\nThat's all I'm doing.\n\n50:40.580 --> 50:41.780\nYeah, I have my own issues,\n\n50:41.780 --> 50:43.820\nbut I'm not a celebrity, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n50:43.820 --> 50:45.140\nThey unfold all this stuff.\n\n50:45.140 --> 50:49.100\nAnd then we go, oh, look at all the hypocrisy\n\n50:49.100 --> 50:50.500\nof your point of view and all this shit.\n\n50:50.500 --> 50:51.980\nThey're like, yeah, I'm not in that business.\n\n50:51.980 --> 50:56.980\nFuck off, I'm a fucking audience member.\n\n50:57.180 --> 50:59.100\nLike, I'm sitting here on Twitter,\n\n50:59.100 --> 51:01.740\nI'm just like tweeting that Dan Harmon's an asshole.\n\n51:01.740 --> 51:04.300\nI didn't expect Dan Harmon to fucking come down\n\n51:04.300 --> 51:07.460\non me like a goddamn weird cloud.\n\n51:08.740 --> 51:09.900\nBut I'm gonna keep doing it\n\n51:09.900 --> 51:12.140\nbecause it freaks him out so much.\n\n51:12.140 --> 51:12.980\nI love it.\n\n51:12.980 --> 51:13.820\nLike all the other people,\n\n51:13.820 --> 51:15.500\nlike the percentage of people in this room\n\n51:15.500 --> 51:17.500\nwho have tweeted at you is probably really low,\n\n51:17.500 --> 51:20.580\nbut the percentage of people who like appreciate you\n\n51:20.580 --> 51:21.420\nand like you.\n\n51:21.420 --> 51:22.580\nI mean, like think about the people\n\n51:22.580 --> 51:24.380\nthat you used to love when you were growing up\n\n51:24.380 --> 51:26.580\nand there was no way to tell them ever.\n\n51:26.580 --> 51:27.420\nYeah, exactly.\n\n51:27.420 --> 51:30.060\nAnd also if I knew that like Kyle McLaughlin\n\n51:30.060 --> 51:32.420\nfrom Twin Peaks like was really sensitive\n\n51:32.420 --> 51:33.540\nabout how people perceived him,\n\n51:33.540 --> 51:34.980\nI would have liked him less.\n\n51:34.980 --> 51:36.820\nI don't wanna know the ins and outs\n\n51:36.820 --> 51:39.260\nof his fucking relationship with his self image.\n\n51:39.260 --> 51:40.860\nNow that I know what it's like for someone\n\n51:40.860 --> 51:43.060\nto come up to me and be like, I love your show.\n\n51:43.060 --> 51:45.860\nLike I saw Jellaby Offer outside of a bar like years ago.\n\n51:45.860 --> 51:48.140\nI should have been like, you changed everything.\n\n51:48.140 --> 51:50.100\nBut, and I was like, I'm gonna annoy him.\n\n51:50.100 --> 51:50.980\nI'm not gonna say anything.\n\n51:50.980 --> 51:52.340\nBut like these people are really stoked.\n\n51:52.340 --> 51:53.180\nBut.\n\n51:53.180 --> 51:55.500\nI would have retweeted Janeane Garofalo all the time.\n\n51:55.500 --> 51:58.940\nI would have spent my entire adolescence just arching.\n\n51:58.940 --> 52:01.220\nLike more, look at what she said.\n\n52:01.220 --> 52:02.700\nI had no access to that.\n\n52:02.700 --> 52:05.100\nI just had to stare at them from afar and read liner notes.\n\n52:05.100 --> 52:05.940\nThat's a why.\n\n52:05.940 --> 52:07.740\nSo I mean, that's a totally, I mean people,\n\n52:07.740 --> 52:10.060\nI think now celebrities or people,\n\n52:10.060 --> 52:12.460\ntallest poppies are much more porous in that way.\n\n52:12.460 --> 52:16.100\nI think that their membranes are much more permeable too.\n\n52:16.100 --> 52:18.460\nThat criticism and not, I don't think people\n\n52:18.460 --> 52:20.620\nwho are in this business necessarily take praise\n\n52:20.620 --> 52:21.900\nwith the way that they do criticism.\n\n52:21.900 --> 52:24.140\nAnd that's a big thing that you just have to like\n\n52:24.140 --> 52:24.980\nget zen about.\n\n52:24.980 --> 52:25.820\nOr else you're gonna-\n\n52:25.820 --> 52:27.820\nBut those tallest poppies are more sensitive to the sun\n\n52:27.820 --> 52:30.500\nand are reaching higher and represent a biosphere\n\n52:30.500 --> 52:32.260\nin which poppies are gonna get taller.\n\n52:32.260 --> 52:33.940\nThat's why everyone's on opium.\n\n52:33.940 --> 52:37.100\nBecause, yeah, like, but it's true.\n\n52:37.100 --> 52:39.620\nLike, because there's not,\n\n52:39.620 --> 52:41.860\nthere is no Cary Grant of the year 2050.\n\n52:41.860 --> 52:43.180\nThat doesn't work that way anymore.\n\n52:43.180 --> 52:44.300\nThere's no newsreel going,\n\n52:44.300 --> 52:47.180\nhey, who's that with Marilyn Monroe on the red carpet?\n\n52:47.180 --> 52:49.700\nIt's only gonna be a bunch of people that are like,\n\n52:49.700 --> 52:50.740\nhey, what'd you say about me?\n\n52:50.740 --> 52:51.580\nFuck you!\n\n52:52.940 --> 52:54.260\nBecause everyone's gonna be,\n\n52:54.260 --> 52:55.940\nyou're not gonna be allowed to be famous\n\n52:55.940 --> 52:56.940\nif you're not accessible.\n\n52:56.940 --> 52:58.660\nOr like having to reveal more and more about yourself\n\n52:58.660 --> 53:00.060\nor like you have to be this,\n\n53:00.060 --> 53:01.420\nyou can't be this character.\n\n53:01.420 --> 53:03.660\nYou have to be like, here's how flawed I am.\n\n53:03.660 --> 53:06.420\nOr like here's everything about me that you need to know.\n\n53:06.420 --> 53:08.380\nNo, I would say like throughout time,\n\n53:08.380 --> 53:10.580\nlike the Mount Olympus of, you know,\n\n53:10.580 --> 53:12.180\nthe people that we allow to be celebrities,\n\n53:12.180 --> 53:13.580\nthere are people that we don't want to touch.\n\n53:13.580 --> 53:15.300\nThere are people that are sacrosanct.\n\n53:15.300 --> 53:16.140\nBut we do want to, yeah.\n\n53:16.140 --> 53:17.780\nWe always give like some George Clooney,\n\n53:17.780 --> 53:18.620\nlike a little-\n\n53:18.620 --> 53:20.100\nYeah, George Clooney or a little Beyonce,\n\n53:20.100 --> 53:21.540\nlike we be like, okay, no, she's safe.\n\n53:21.540 --> 53:23.380\nLike we'll fucking leave her alone.\n\n53:23.380 --> 53:25.260\nYou know, when people are being vicious to each other\n\n53:25.260 --> 53:26.100\nthroughout the year,\n\n53:26.100 --> 53:27.900\nit's like nobody out at Barbra Stanwalk or Doris Day\n\n53:27.900 --> 53:29.260\nbecause they're fucking beloved.\n\n53:29.260 --> 53:31.820\nAnd like everybody knew that they were gay.\n\n53:31.820 --> 53:33.780\nThey knew them, but they didn't say it because of that.\n\n53:33.780 --> 53:34.620\nJust found out right now.\n\n53:34.620 --> 53:36.620\nYeah, because I made it up, no.\n\n53:36.620 --> 53:40.460\nBut like there are people that we do want to be Apollo\n\n53:40.460 --> 53:41.780\nand after a dieting.\n\n53:41.780 --> 53:44.140\nThere's also people that we want to be punished.\n\n53:44.140 --> 53:45.740\nThere's people that we want to cast away.\n\n53:45.740 --> 53:48.100\nLike Madonna from the beginning.\n\n53:48.100 --> 53:50.260\nLike it's not like she was beyond reproach.\n\n53:50.260 --> 53:53.820\nLike she was a sexable and she was world conquering\n\n53:53.820 --> 53:55.300\nand everyone knew her name.\n\n53:55.300 --> 53:58.180\nBut at the same time, she represented an archetype\n\n53:58.180 --> 54:00.980\nthat was like inviting everyone's vile.\n\n54:00.980 --> 54:02.780\nI think it's we should forget puked on.\n\n54:02.780 --> 54:03.900\nWe don't have a Kerry Grant.\n\n54:03.900 --> 54:06.900\nI mean, George Clooney is doing his level best\n\n54:06.900 --> 54:09.380\nto probably without trying to,\n\n54:09.380 --> 54:11.500\nwe're forcing that on him to be a guy\n\n54:11.500 --> 54:13.180\nthat people really want to like.\n\n54:13.180 --> 54:17.180\nAnd he's making it very easy for us to like George Clooney.\n\n54:17.180 --> 54:19.300\nHe doesn't, and even if he ever did something bad,\n\n54:19.300 --> 54:21.100\npeople wouldn't fucking talk about it.\n\n54:21.100 --> 54:23.740\nLike when I was a kid, like I mentioned before,\n\n54:23.740 --> 54:24.820\nI was in a play with Joel Brunner.\n\n54:24.820 --> 54:27.060\nIf you guys know him, he's an actor from the 50s.\n\n54:27.060 --> 54:31.220\nAnd he was a big sex symbol for many years\n\n54:31.220 --> 54:33.300\nand a big hot shot in his giant movies.\n\n54:33.300 --> 54:36.900\nAnd when we were, we did like 13 cities\n\n54:36.900 --> 54:38.660\non this tour before I went to Broadway\n\n54:38.660 --> 54:40.700\nand we were in Cincinnati, it was opening night.\n\n54:40.700 --> 54:42.860\nAnd we were on the, whatever the river is there.\n\n54:42.860 --> 54:43.780\nIs it the Ohio River?\n\n54:43.780 --> 54:44.620\nWhat is it?\n\n54:44.620 --> 54:45.460\nYes.\n\n54:45.460 --> 54:46.300\nAnd there was a river boat\n\n54:46.300 --> 54:47.540\nand that was where opening night party was.\n\n54:47.540 --> 54:50.060\nAnd there was always local dignitaries and press\n\n54:50.060 --> 54:51.940\nand you know, like kind of local hot shots\n\n54:51.940 --> 54:54.300\nand possibly a mayor would come to these parties.\n\n54:54.300 --> 54:55.940\nAnd the kids, there were 13 of us,\n\n54:55.940 --> 54:58.020\nseven that traveled and seven local kids\n\n54:58.020 --> 55:01.540\nthat filled out the kid portion of the cast.\n\n55:01.540 --> 55:04.500\nWe would all walk up on this procession and meet him.\n\n55:04.500 --> 55:07.180\nAnd I learned, I mean, I was raised in kind of\n\n55:07.180 --> 55:11.540\nan old school like LA kind of very mannerly environment\n\n55:11.540 --> 55:13.180\nwhere you said good evening and how do you do\n\n55:13.180 --> 55:14.020\nand stuff like that.\n\n55:14.020 --> 55:17.140\nBut we were suits and my understudy was brand new\n\n55:17.140 --> 55:19.340\nin the job and he was a kid named Luke from Philadelphia.\n\n55:19.340 --> 55:21.700\nHe was very crass, very, you know,\n\n55:21.700 --> 55:24.300\nlike Irish Catholic working class kid, really funny\n\n55:24.300 --> 55:26.660\nbut really, you know, like rough around the edges\n\n55:26.660 --> 55:29.860\ncompared to, you know, like the rest of us probably.\n\n55:29.860 --> 55:31.340\nAnd his dad was this, you know,\n\n55:31.340 --> 55:34.060\ntough old Irish guy who's hilarious.\n\n55:34.060 --> 55:35.700\nAnd he was in front of me\n\n55:35.700 --> 55:37.580\nand he was his first time meeting Yule.\n\n55:37.580 --> 55:38.420\nAnd it was in front of everybody.\n\n55:38.420 --> 55:41.300\nThere's cameras, you know, for the local newspapers.\n\n55:41.300 --> 55:43.220\nAnd he walks up and he goes, hi.\n\n55:43.220 --> 55:44.620\nAnd Yule just goes, boom.\n\n55:44.620 --> 55:48.140\nIt just smashes him with his giant hand across his face.\n\n55:48.140 --> 55:50.820\nAbsolutely clobbers this 10 year old.\n\n55:50.820 --> 55:51.820\n10 year old.\n\n55:51.820 --> 55:53.740\nAnd I'm right behind him and like,\n\n55:53.740 --> 55:54.980\nI'd never seen Yule hit anybody\n\n55:54.980 --> 55:56.860\nbut I knew that like you don't fucking cross,\n\n55:56.860 --> 55:58.660\nhe's the king on and off stage.\n\n55:58.660 --> 56:00.540\nAnd he was a bad old school motherfucker\n\n56:00.540 --> 56:01.780\nwho was dying of cancer.\n\n56:01.780 --> 56:02.620\nAnd in front of me.\n\n56:02.620 --> 56:04.060\nAnd who was a robot cowboy?\n\n56:04.060 --> 56:04.900\nYes.\n\n56:04.900 --> 56:07.580\nAnd who said to him, go back to your mama.\n\n56:07.580 --> 56:08.900\nIs that what he said?\n\n56:08.900 --> 56:09.980\nNo, in Westworld.\n\n56:09.980 --> 56:10.820\nOkay.\n\n56:10.820 --> 56:14.140\nWestworld, quote, for nobody.\n\n56:16.780 --> 56:17.780\nFucking rent Westworld.\n\n56:17.780 --> 56:19.020\nHe fucking gives Richard Benjamin\n\n56:19.020 --> 56:20.540\nthe fucking time of his life, man.\n\n56:20.540 --> 56:21.540\nI love that you just got.\n\n56:21.540 --> 56:24.500\nHe really gives Richard Benjamin what how?\n\n56:24.500 --> 56:25.340\nWhat how?\n\n56:26.340 --> 56:27.180\nAnyway.\n\n56:27.180 --> 56:28.620\nYou got one person snapping to that.\n\n56:28.620 --> 56:31.020\nBy the way, like a beat audience.\n\n56:31.020 --> 56:32.820\nJust like a glorious and disgusting.\n\n56:32.820 --> 56:33.660\nAnd I love that.\n\n56:33.660 --> 56:34.500\nIt's Adam Colbert.\n\n56:36.620 --> 56:38.820\nI did not rub your lamp at him, be quiet.\n\n56:38.820 --> 56:43.500\nSo anyway, so you'll just bash this kid\n\n56:43.500 --> 56:45.500\nand he gives him this big model like,\n\n56:45.500 --> 56:46.820\nyou're in the presence of ladies.\n\n56:46.820 --> 56:48.460\nYou do not say hi, you say, how do you do?\n\n56:48.460 --> 56:49.300\nYou say, good evening.\n\n56:49.300 --> 56:50.900\nI gave him this big ass thing.\n\n56:50.900 --> 56:53.020\nAnd the thing is, the guys with the cameras,\n\n56:53.020 --> 56:56.180\nthe press that were there, put their cameras down.\n\n56:56.180 --> 56:57.020\nRight.\n\n56:57.020 --> 56:58.420\nAnd like, this kid's getting the fucking talking to,\n\n56:58.420 --> 56:59.740\nhe's getting the rules right now.\n\n56:59.740 --> 57:02.940\nNo, look, the Irish Catholic father of Luke,\n\n57:02.940 --> 57:06.140\nwho is, you know, he had diabetes, he had scoliosis,\n\n57:06.140 --> 57:08.140\none leg was fucking a foot shorter than the other one.\n\n57:08.140 --> 57:10.340\nLike he had, this guy had been through wars and shit.\n\n57:10.340 --> 57:14.460\nHe, like his fists came up and then put him right back down\n\n57:14.460 --> 57:19.220\nbecause like, there was a status ladder\n\n57:19.220 --> 57:21.780\nand you'll just gave him this fucking talking to.\n\n57:21.780 --> 57:24.140\nAnd I mean, the sound it made when he hit this kid\n\n57:24.140 --> 57:25.580\nwas a fucking major.\n\n57:25.580 --> 57:27.220\nOkay, so let's not live in that world.\n\n57:27.220 --> 57:29.540\nThere's so much worse in me.\n\n57:29.540 --> 57:33.140\nBut if paratroopers come in through the skylight then\n\n57:33.140 --> 57:37.420\nand arrest Yule Brenner for the future crime of child murder,\n\n57:37.420 --> 57:38.820\nthen I'm on Yule Brenner's side.\n\n57:38.820 --> 57:41.740\nNo, but the reason I bring that up,\n\n57:41.740 --> 57:44.980\nthat we lived in a time when celebrities misbehaved,\n\n57:44.980 --> 57:45.980\nthat wasn't news.\n\n57:45.980 --> 57:49.140\nNow any bit of misbehavior is front page news at all times.\n\n57:49.140 --> 57:50.900\nBecause gloriously the concept of celebrity,\n\n57:50.900 --> 57:53.500\nhopefully, it'd be interesting to watch how this happens.\n\n57:53.500 --> 57:56.700\nIt's like a paint pigment that's like, you know,\n\n57:56.700 --> 58:00.260\nyou can't, you used to, I feel like from watching\n\n58:00.260 --> 58:03.460\nold black and white, you know, culture and stuff\n\n58:03.460 --> 58:06.180\nthat you could count the number of celebrities\n\n58:06.180 --> 58:10.060\non a couple of hands and that the list dropped off\n\n58:10.060 --> 58:10.900\nreally fast.\n\n58:10.900 --> 58:14.940\nYou didn't like have like, you didn't know who was famous\n\n58:14.940 --> 58:16.620\nbeyond like 10 people.\n\n58:16.620 --> 58:20.100\nAnd that now it's just more stratified kind of like,\n\n58:20.100 --> 58:23.220\nobviously it's just like, oh, my neighbor has a podcast\n\n58:23.220 --> 58:25.460\nand she's got a thousand listeners,\n\n58:25.460 --> 58:27.900\nwhich I think is very healthy and very good.\n\n58:27.900 --> 58:31.660\nBut it's like, it's being infected by this old world\n\n58:31.660 --> 58:35.140\nconcept of celebrities as a class.\n\n58:35.140 --> 58:36.300\nI disagree with that though.\n\n58:36.300 --> 58:37.540\nI think we've needed celebrities\n\n58:37.540 --> 58:39.860\nsince before we had Twitter or podcasts.\n\n58:39.860 --> 58:42.300\nLike if you look, like I studied Latin in college\n\n58:42.300 --> 58:46.380\nor high school at AP Latin, only one person in my class,\n\n58:46.380 --> 58:47.420\nit was me and Mrs. B.C.O.\n\n58:47.420 --> 58:49.660\nShe's dead now, don't worry about it.\n\n58:49.660 --> 58:51.500\nIt was just me and her, but you know,\n\n58:51.500 --> 58:52.940\nso you study when you study the classics\n\n58:52.940 --> 58:55.540\nand you know, Roman and Greek mythology,\n\n58:55.540 --> 58:57.580\nyou learn about demigods and you learn about their Zeus\n\n58:57.580 --> 58:58.740\nand then he's got a whole bunch of people\n\n58:58.740 --> 59:01.060\nthat are like half here and they're half human,\n\n59:01.060 --> 59:01.900\nthey're half gods.\n\n59:01.900 --> 59:03.860\nAnd that is who you look to to learn like,\n\n59:03.860 --> 59:05.980\nhow the fuck to grow grain and like,\n\n59:05.980 --> 59:08.540\nhow not to get smoked essentially.\n\n59:08.540 --> 59:11.420\nBut I mean, between that and like sun gods\n\n59:11.420 --> 59:14.260\nand gods of rain, I think, and royalty through,\n\n59:14.260 --> 59:16.980\nbefore we had media, the kind of technology\n\n59:16.980 --> 59:19.980\nthat we have now to be like so in everyone's face,\n\n59:19.980 --> 59:22.020\nwe always needed something to guide us.\n\n59:22.020 --> 59:23.420\nWe needed to hear Hermes fuck the swan.\n\n59:23.420 --> 59:25.580\nYeah, we needed something to guide us.\n\n59:25.580 --> 59:28.380\nBack when there was only the radio and before TV,\n\n59:28.380 --> 59:30.540\nand then when there was TV, there was three channels\n\n59:30.540 --> 59:32.540\nand then there was five and then there was a million.\n\n59:32.540 --> 59:35.140\nAnd now there's everybody has a podcast\n\n59:35.140 --> 59:37.060\nand a YouTube channel and stuff like that.\n\n59:37.060 --> 59:39.700\nWe still want to classify the people around us,\n\n59:39.700 --> 59:42.580\nthe celebrities that we choose to put on pedestals.\n\n59:42.580 --> 59:43.940\nAnd the reason why we erect pedestals\n\n59:43.940 --> 59:46.300\nis for the purpose of knocking them off them\n\n59:46.300 --> 59:47.740\nwhen that happens.\n\n59:47.740 --> 59:51.060\nIn that fucking glory, glorious two weeks\n\n59:51.060 --> 59:52.900\nwhen Charlie Sheen was becoming the greatest thing\n\n59:52.900 --> 59:54.100\nthat ever fucking happened,\n\n59:54.100 --> 59:56.820\neverybody was just like, okay, this is fucking exciting.\n\n59:56.820 --> 59:59.580\nWhether or not you loved it, hated it, didn't give a shit,\n\n59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.140\nyou were violently indifferent to it, you were indifferent to it.\n\n01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.340\nAnd in a slow news week,\n\n01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.620\nif Dan and Chevy Chase get in the fight,\n\n01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.180\nthat's because Charlie Sheen isn't doing it\n\n01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.140\non a fucking way bigger level.\n\n01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.140\nWe do need to cast part-\n\n01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.060\nI'm offended by that?\n\n01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:13.900\nYeah.\n\n01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:14.740\nWell, no.\n\n01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.580\nI'm kidding about that.\n\n01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.060\nI'm saying, well, you aren't.\n\n01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:21.060\nWe have to cast our, I don't wanna joke.\n\n01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.860\nI'm definitely kidding about wanting to be more famous\n\n01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:24.860\nthan Charlie Sheen.\n\n01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:28.700\nI'd say that we have to cast our gods and demi-gods.\n\n01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.620\nWe have to create our Mount Olympus at all times.\n\n01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:31.940\nNow it's so devious\n\n01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.300\nbecause we have a million Charlie Sheens, a very-\n\n01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.420\nI agree with all of you.\n\n01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.060\nI think that the reason why,\n\n01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:43.060\nI think that in days when media was very, very limited\n\n01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.620\nwhere it was just one-way transmission of imagery,\n\n01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.380\nthen we had that perfect harmony with that golden age\n\n01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.740\nwhere it basically supplanted what you're describing\n\n01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.980\nin ancient Greek, ancient Roman society\n\n01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:57.020\nwhere you had the mystery gods and I worship Isis\n\n01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.300\nand I have a statue of Soto.\n\n01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.340\nYeah, but did you hear Isis?\n\n01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.980\nSo is the reason why there was a flood last week?\n\n01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.020\nYeah, fuck that bitch.\n\n01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:02.860\nAll right, she's all right.\n\n01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.700\nShe's all right.\n\n01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.460\nYou know, like it was sort of like,\n\n01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:10.260\nit was gossip and soap opera all tied into religion\n\n01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.460\nand it was civic and it worked as long as a society worked\n\n01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.900\nand then the barbarians at the gate\n\n01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.820\nand then the monotheism and whatever.\n\n01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.820\nThe only thing that I'm saying is that nowadays,\n\n01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.700\nnow that we have so much access to everything,\n\n01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:30.700\nwe're coming off of an industry where the concept\n\n01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:37.180\nof fame and celebrity had so much dollar value per ounce\n\n01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:42.420\nthat it's incompatible right now\n\n01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:48.020\nthat you would hold the third lead of vampire diaries\n\n01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.500\nor someone whose blog is taking off\n\n01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.580\nto this Keri Grant kind of standard.\n\n01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:59.140\nIt's where we're seeing as a sort of a blender of weirdness.\n\n01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:03.020\nI certainly feel that way as a person who never wanted\n\n01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.100\nto be regarded as anything in particular\n\n01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.900\nexcept by a couple of people.\n\n01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.180\nLike that's what I'm saying is that there's a lot\n\n01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.980\nof fame to go around and I do think we will always\n\n01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.540\nhave George Clooney's that we can launch to the moon\n\n01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.020\nand we can watch them explode in space.\n\n01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.900\nNow fame is so, I think the idea now\n\n01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:26.700\nbecause the internet being what it is,\n\n01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.300\nthe amount of efficacy people have\n\n01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.740\nthat they can rumble you and you can be rumbled\n\n01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.380\nand then the Kraken can come out from the sea\n\n01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.420\nand start laying waste and start like engaging\n\n01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:36.820\nlike the town spoke.\n\n01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.380\nBut also, I think people see fame as something\n\n01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.460\nmuch more attainable now because you can become like a-\n\n01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.180\nAnd they should, everyone can be famous.\n\n01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.020\nThat's what I wonder about.\n\n01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.700\nLook at it that way first.\n\n01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.700\nYou can't stop looking at your life as miserable\n\n01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.500\nand start realizing that although it doesn't pay anything\n\n01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:56.300\ntomorrow, you can be seen by a million people.\n\n01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.220\nEverybody can be famous and that's why every fucking day\n\n01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.980\nyou turn the TV on is some guy who shot up a school.\n\n01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.540\nEverybody can be famous.\n\n01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.660\nThose people are having a fucking breakdown\n\n01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.220\nbecause of some kind of like, I think-\n\n01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.060\nBecause they don't matter.\n\n01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:08.900\nThey don't matter.\n\n01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.740\nThey don't matter.\n\n01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.580\nAnd that's why you make the 17 videos.\n\n01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.580\nAnd they're sensing that they're supposed to matter.\n\n01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.820\nNow there's recourse.\n\n01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.660\nI don't exist.\n\n01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.500\nI can exist for 48 hours in the fucking national media.\n\n01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.860\nLike I can be notorious.\n\n01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:23.660\nI can trade in all my mortgage and all my moms yelling at me\n\n01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.180\nor whatever the situation I'm in.\n\n01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.940\nI'm gonna kill myself anyway.\n\n01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:30.620\nI think I'll go blow away a syrup factory.\n\n01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:33.020\nYeah, I'll be a shitty John Wilkes.\n\n01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.660\nBecause they make sweets.\n\n01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.740\nI'll be a John Wilkes booth, kind of, you know.\n\n01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.580\nI'll be a-\n\n01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:43.460\nWe've made fame, something that you can't just choose.\n\n01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.060\nThe tribe has to choose who gets on the pedestal\n\n01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.940\nand the tribe gets to stand around that pedestal\n\n01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:49.860\nand decide whether or not-\n\n01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.540\nIt's a holdover for the idea that everyone knowing\n\n01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.980\nwho you are equated to money.\n\n01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.820\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.460\nThat's what I was gonna say is, I think that some,\n\n01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.060\nyou know, it seems like you won the lotto.\n\n01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.340\nLike why Jennifer Lawrence than some other blonde actress?\n\n01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.380\nLike it could've been anyone.\n\n01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.660\nAnd, you know, the third lead on whatever,\n\n01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.540\nthe vampire diaries is making so much fucking money\n\n01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.780\noff of that, right?\n\n01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:14.180\nAnd everyone, it seems like an easy thing to attain.\n\n01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.100\nThese American Idol shows and things like that.\n\n01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.980\nLike, I don't know how these people fare afterward,\n\n01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.860\nbut the miracle of that show is that they actually,\n\n01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.540\nnow you're just famous because you're an American Idol\n\n01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.220\nbecause it's a fucking popular show.\n\n01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.300\nBut my god, that promise of like,\n\n01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.060\nand the winner will be a famous singer.\n\n01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.620\nYeah, just like that.\n\n01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:33.460\nBut that's also very-\n\n01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.220\nThey kind of end up being a famous singer\n\n01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.460\nbecause everyone was watching that show.\n\n01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.860\nLasted 20 years, it was Major League Baseball.\n\n01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.740\nBut like, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it.\n\n01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.580\nThat's American though.\n\n01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.420\nThat's a weird America.\n\n01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:48.260\nYeah, American expansion was based on like,\n\n01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.140\nshit, there's gold and everyone ran to it.\n\n01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.580\nAnd like, and you know, California was settled\n\n01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.820\nbecause we had gold up north and we had movies down here.\n\n01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.380\nSo we had like gold and fame.\n\n01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.060\nAnd so that's the only reason why any of you are sitting here.\n\n01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.300\nTo you, to, to expand on that metaphor,\n\n01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.620\nbecause there was only so much you can do\n\n01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:07.140\nwith a pickaxe or a stick of dynamite.\n\n01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.460\nThere's only so much gold you can get out of the earth.\n\n01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:13.340\nAnd then, if you have the technology to point a ray\n\n01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:17.300\nand just go, and scan the planet and go,\n\n01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.780\nthis planet is 10% gold.\n\n01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.980\nOkay, I'll take it, fuck the planet, move away.\n\n01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.900\nThat's what the internet is.\n\n01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.460\nWhatever you have to offer, give it to me.\n\n01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.220\nI'll take it for free.\n\n01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.260\nI'll download it.\n\n01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.420\nI don't care.\n\n01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.540\nThere's no, it's not gold.\n\n01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.700\nMaybe the gold is limited because of the gold is talent,\n\n01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.540\nbut fucking, I'll take it.\n\n01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.860\nAnd I'm not gonna pay you that much for it.\n\n01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.060\nLike, and Snickers ain't gonna get paid for it.\n\n01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.660\nAnd Nike ain't gonna get paid for it.\n\n01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.700\nLike, those are the days in which we live.\n\n01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.700\nSo, all of us people who wanna be heard\n\n01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.780\nand wanna, like, like our narcissists\n\n01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.580\nand want to output stuff,\n\n01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.060\nwe're living in the golden age,\n\n01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.020\nbut we're not gonna get any money for it.\n\n01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.780\nRight not, although, I don't know.\n\n01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:00.180\nWell, I think if McDonald's offered us any money,\n\n01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.260\nI think I would have.\n\n01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.340\nNo, you take it, they're not going to.\n\n01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.180\nI would say no.\n\n01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.140\nBut I mean, that's the thing is like,\n\n01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:09.260\nis we have one dumb video that led to now,\n\n01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.620\nthis is our job, this is our career.\n\n01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.500\nI make more now than I ever did at the times.\n\n01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.820\nAnd at the times, also, if we wanted coffee creamer,\n\n01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.420\nwe had to pay 15 cents.\n\n01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.140\nAnd once I had to look under my floor mats\n\n01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.740\nin my 1993 Subaru to buy coffee creamer.\n\n01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.740\nI only charge her 10 cents for coffee creamer.\n\n01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:23.580\nThat's true.\n\n01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.540\nBut I mean, but that's the thing is it is,\n\n01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.980\nit is that gold rush.\n\n01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.460\nAnd it is, it is that idea that like anyone here,\n\n01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.940\nsitting in front of us or listening to this,\n\n01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.780\ncould have some idea that no one's ever really had.\n\n01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.340\nAnd then in 72 hours, someone's aunt would be like,\n\n01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.540\ndid you see the thing?\n\n01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.380\nAnd then all the door opens.\n\n01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.220\nThey absolutely can.\n\n01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:41.060\nThere's within their power.\n\n01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.340\nThen there's something, they're okay.\n\n01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.260\nYou can look at that two ways.\n\n01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.340\nYou can look at that as like gross.\n\n01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.460\nEveryone needs validation.\n\n01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.300\nEveryone wants to be famous.\n\n01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.140\nEveryone's a whore.\n\n01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.620\nOh my God, who's gonna notice me?\n\n01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:49.620\nMy bucket has a hole in it.\n\n01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.420\nOr you can look at it as we have a platform and a voice.\n\n01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:57.420\nWe, essentially, everyone in like 2005 was handed a megaphone.\n\n01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.660\nAnd it's very loud and it's very noisy,\n\n01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:00.500\nbut everyone has more.\n\n01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.580\nBut our areas are just, so that's how people talk now.\n\n01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.780\nI think it's great that everyone has a podcast.\n\n01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:09.780\nWhen I got a podcast, I was the 450 millionth person.\n\n01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:13.420\nThere was no way I was gonna convince myself\n\n01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.180\nthat I was doing anything innovative by saying,\n\n01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.060\nI'm gonna have a podcast.\n\n01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.500\nI bit that bullet.\n\n01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.780\nI was like, yeah, but podcasts are awesome.\n\n01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.940\nThat's just, there's the alternatives of people tweeting\n\n01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.660\nabout like, everyone's got a podcast.\n\n01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.980\nWhat, where is that gonna get you?\n\n01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.980\nI'm all over the place, but I'm just saying like,\n\n01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.220\nand I don't think this issue needs to be resolved.\n\n01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.980\nI have another issue with this,\n\n01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:37.820\nbut that brings up a really important question.\n\n01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.180\nAnd that is, on different social media platforms,\n\n01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.380\nyou have a really different tonal way\n\n01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.860\nof representing yourself and your life.\n\n01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.860\nAnd Twitter, it's, oh, I'm so fucking miserable.\n\n01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.900\nOh, you haven't changed my pants in five days.\n\n01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.340\nBlah, and I don't have a boyfriend.\n\n01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.820\nAnd then, and then on Instagram.\n\n01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:57.180\nYou're obviously following Questlove.\n\n01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.020\nYeah.\n\n01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:01.660\nHillary Clinton, official.\n\n01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.940\nBut no, and then on Instagram, it's like,\n\n01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.060\nwell, isn't that nice?\n\n01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.380\nAnd then on Facebook, it's like,\n\n01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.100\nI am so grateful for my family.\n\n01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.300\nSo you represent yourself.\n\n01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.820\nAnd then Tumblr, it's like,\n\n01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:14.980\nI cannot believe what happened yesterday.\n\n01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.380\nBut I mean, that's a weird, and that's weird.\n\n01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:20.020\nHow dare he, in that interview,\n\n01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:22.540\nsuggest that Jeff and Annie's relationship\n\n01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.420\nhad something to do with the schoolgirl crush.\n\n01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.260\nAll right, you're projecting.\n\n01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.260\nI'm gonna kill myself right now if no one stops me.\n\n01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.860\nYou're projecting, and that is a very,\n\n01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.700\nthat's a limited scope of your experience,\n\n01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.700\nbut I believe you.\n\n01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.420\nThen I may scroll down to the cat meme.\n\n01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.780\nRight now on Twitter, I'm not like,\n\n01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:37.500\nthe world's biggest tweeter.\n\n01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.660\nI do it once in a while.\n\n01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.500\nI'm going through a fucking crisis.\n\n01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.980\nI have been for a long time now,\n\n01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.220\nbeen confused with Jeff Davis,\n\n01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.540\nthe creator of Criminal Minds,\n\n01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.340\nand now the television's Teen Wolf.\n\n01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.260\nOh, dear.\n\n01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:50.820\nThere's a guy named fucking-\n\n01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.740\nIs there a guy that makes shows that has your name?\n\n01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:57.220\nAnd once I was told by my accounts,\n\n01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.620\nour accounts, we had the same accountancy, people,\n\n01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.980\nthat hey, you, BLS limo,\n\n01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.500\nyou used a limo service for something,\n\n01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.220\nand it got charged to another Jeff Davis,\n\n01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.580\nbut we sorted it out.\n\n01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.740\nMy credit card was shut off a couple months ago\n\n01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:13.140\nbecause my accountant called me up and said,\n\n01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.660\ndid you just spend $5,000 on limos last night?\n\n01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:16.500\nI'm like, no.\n\n01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.180\nThey go, okay, that's Criminal Minds, Teen Wolf,\n\n01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:20.020\nJeff Davis.\n\n01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:20.860\nI go, can you-\n\n01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.700\nI had no idea.\n\n01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.540\nNo, but God.\n\n01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.380\nI said, can you tell BLS limo\n\n01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.660\nto get their shit together as I've left them?\n\n01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:29.300\nAnd also BLS, if you let me, go, pfft, thumbs down.\n\n01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.420\nYou need a middle name, like Minotaur.\n\n01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.980\nMy name is Brian because of SAG.\n\n01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.980\nThere's a million Jeff Davis.\n\n01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:38.300\nI am Jeff Brian, or Jeff B. Davis, rather.\n\n01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.100\nI'm Jeff B. Davis, for that reason,\n\n01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:42.540\nbecause there's a long line for Jeff Davis's out there.\n\n01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:43.820\nNo, you need to throw a Muhammad in there.\n\n01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:44.820\nYou need to do something.\n\n01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:45.660\nMuhammad, yes.\n\n01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.060\nOr you need to go for Heartstack,\n\n01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.780\nwhich is not George's last name, it's Heartstark,\n\n01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:49.620\nbut everyone missed it.\n\n01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.020\nWell, Ally has an E on the end of her name\n\n01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:51.860\nbecause of that reason.\n\n01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.780\nOh yeah, I did search engine optimization on my name\n\n01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:55.860\nand I changed my identity.\n\n01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.020\nHi.\n\n01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.500\nMy name is Ally Ward, but it was ALI, and then Ward.\n\n01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.980\nAnd then 2011 happened, 2011.\n\n01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.580\n2000, and September 11th happened.\n\n01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.420\nHi.\n\n01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.260\nWhen?\n\n01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.100\nI don't know.\n\n01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.420\nI already fucking forgot.\n\n01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.340\nI, oh, never forget.\n\n01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.860\nThere's a mnemonic device, if you want to remember 9-11.\n\n01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.020\nI have a posted note on my mirror that's like,\n\n01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.420\ndon't forget the thing.\n\n01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:20.780\nSeptember 2000, the thing?\n\n01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.620\nI know.\n\n01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.700\nBut after that, people would call me Ally all the time,\n\n01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.060\nand I was like, this is getting confusing.\n\n01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.860\nAnd then I started writing for a newspaper,\n\n01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.140\nand there was another journalist named Ally Ward,\n\n01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.820\nspelled with no E, and she was a horticulturist in Britain.\n\n01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:35.380\nAnd so people would be like, hi, I'd\n\n01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.740\nlove for her to ask about tulip bulbs.\n\n01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:38.980\nAnd I was like, fuck you.\n\n01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.060\nAnd so I put an E on the end.\n\n01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:44.060\nI Googled Ally Ward with an E. No one else, zero search results.\n\n01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.740\nAnd I was like, all right, that's my new name.\n\n01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.900\nAnd now my parents, when they write to me, they don't,\n\n01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.100\nthey put, sometimes it in E. No, no, take it off.\n\n01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:51.540\nAllison?\n\n01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:51.860\nAllison.\n\n01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.620\nThey don't know what to call me, and I'm like, hi,\n\n01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.460\nI'm the chick with the E on the end of the name.\n\n01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.660\nYou know, when I was younger, I got\n\n01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.860\nmade fun of for my name, like both the first and last\n\n01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.780\nso fucking much.\n\n01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.980\nBut now I'm so.\n\n01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.260\nGeorge, I'm nearly a pot.\n\n01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.020\nGeorgia Hardstark in the world.\n\n01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.260\nYou have the name of a dead woman.\n\n01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.340\nIt's Georgia Miriam Hardstark.\n\n01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.340\nHouse Hardstark.\n\n01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.340\nWhat the hell is that?\n\n01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.380\nOh, I get a lot of the guys come up to me, like, do you\n\n01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.260\nwatch Game of Thrones?\n\n01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.060\nBecause your last name is really.\n\n01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:16.020\nWhat is it in Game of Thrones?\n\n01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:17.340\nIt's like House Stark, right?\n\n01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:17.840\nIs it?\n\n01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.340\nYour house.\n\n01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.660\nWho's, where are my nerds at?\n\n01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:20.660\nWoo!\n\n01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.020\nI hear there's tons of tits and tits.\n\n01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.100\nIf you go on my Twitter timeline right now, look,\n\n01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.580\n90 fucking percent of it is a bunch of people\n\n01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.020\ngoing, like, naming characters.\n\n01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.140\nLike, oh my god, this is the best thing\n\n01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:29.860\nthat ever happened.\n\n01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.380\nSo-and-so, they make that with so-and-so.\n\n01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.420\nAnd then it's everybody replying to everybody,\n\n01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.700\nincluding the official MTV Teen Wolf sites.\n\n01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:41.660\nSo before this quite escalated, I wrote a tweet a while back,\n\n01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:43.180\nlike, a couple weeks ago, and said,\n\n01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.620\nto the people following me that have confused me with Jeff\n\n01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.460\nDavis' creator of TV's Teen Wolf,\n\n01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.380\ndon't you think it's weird that I've never tweeted\n\n01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.140\nabout Teen Wolf?\n\n01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.300\nAnd then I said, you know what?\n\n01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.060\nFuck it.\n\n01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.460\nI have never seen the show, but I'm going to do a Q&A.\n\n01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:58.020\nI'm doing it, I'm doing it.\n\n01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.740\nSo I've never seen the show, but I\n\n01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:01.860\nam not the creator of Teen Wolf.\n\n01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.820\nI'm going to do a brief Teen Wolf Q&A.\n\n01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.180\nSo people are like, how do you know when a Teen Wolf\n\n01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.060\ngoes through puberty?\n\n01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:07.820\nHarry or balls?\n\n01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:10.020\nI was just like, stupid shit like that.\n\n01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.500\nAnd what's it going to be called when he's not a teenager\n\n01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:12.980\nanymore?\n\n01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.580\nIt's just going to be called wolf.\n\n01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.900\nSo I did five of those and said, thank you.\n\n01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.860\nI hope I answered your Teen Wolf questions.\n\n01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.900\nSincerely, Jeff Davis creator of Teen Wolf.\n\n01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.900\nBut also, I called the cast a bunch of pricks,\n\n01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:28.060\nand I said I had a methadone addiction.\n\n01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.340\nSo there was something like online news thing.\n\n01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:33.260\nLike the dots or I don't know what it was fucking called.\n\n01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.740\nDid some funny article and they said like, the wrong Jeff\n\n01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:39.020\nDavis answers your Teen Wolf questions.\n\n01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.820\nAnd they got like, it's comedian Jeff Davis, Jeff Brian\n\n01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.980\nDavis, because apparently this guy, Jeff Davis,\n\n01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.020\nhad gone offline of Twitter a couple of years ago.\n\n01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:50.220\nProbably because he's truly disliked because most of the\n\n01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:53.780\nshit I get on my time, I was like, fuck you, you're Satan.\n\n01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:57.980\nI'm like, hey, whose line shouldn't be taken that serious?\n\n01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.460\nWe got to get this guy on the show.\n\n01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.300\nPlease, Jeff Davis.\n\n01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.540\nSo actually, the Teen Wolf people said like, that was\n\n01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.660\nhilarious, thank you.\n\n01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.620\nBut with all of that, because people that watch the show,\n\n01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.220\nGod bless them.\n\n01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:11.620\nI'm sure they're lovely people, but I would guess younger.\n\n01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.740\nAnd irony, not their fort.\n\n01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.860\nSo I cast them, not their bag, neither the bread,\n\n01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:21.500\nnor their butter.\n\n01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.980\nAnd so now, because of that, I have so many more followers\n\n01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.060\nto think I'm the creator of Teen Wolf.\n\n01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:33.140\nAnd so I've just gone on begging MTV, please set the fucking\n\n01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.860\nrecord straight on this one.\n\n01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:39.620\nMy timeline right now is a fucking absolute morass of people\n\n01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.860\nsaying things I have no idea what they're talking about.\n\n01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.820\nDo you have dueling wikis?\n\n01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.260\nDueling wikis, by the way, name of my autobiography.\n\n01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.740\nNo, do you have dueling wikipedias?\n\n01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.340\nWhat the hell was that?\n\n01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:50.580\nOh, it's fine.\n\n01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.060\nHer jazzle phone.\n\n01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.300\nIt was blowing up too much.\n\n01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.580\nOh, don't worry about it.\n\n01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.100\nDo you have dueling wikipedias?\n\n01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.060\nI don't know what that is.\n\n01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:01.020\nLike, did you have Jeff Davis and Jeff TV?\n\n01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.980\nOh, my wikipedia page is so fucking absolutely fallacious.\n\n01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:05.940\nI've tried to change it.\n\n01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.260\nI'm not allowed to change it.\n\n01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.300\nI'm still dating a person I've never met.\n\n01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:20.780\nI created Calcium, I'm the vice-roy of Bengal.\n\n01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:23.900\nI won't go to mine because people that hate me,\n\n01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.060\nI cross the tipping part.\n\n01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.780\nI don't Google myself, and I won't wikipedia myself,\n\n01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.660\nbecause sometimes there'll just be a paragraph in there\n\n01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:34.100\nthat's like, fat asshole Dan Harmon is a fat fuck\n\n01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.620\nand a fat piece of shit.\n\n01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:38.420\nIf it was just that, it would be great.\n\n01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:41.540\nBut it's the insinuation that I'm a bad person with bad values.\n\n01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:44.060\nThat's what gets under my skin.\n\n01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:47.220\nWhen I was in my 20s, and Google was first a thing,\n\n01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.820\nand I would Google my own name.\n\n01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:53.660\nAnd there was a little blend of like, oh, I've done some stuff.\n\n01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:57.140\nAnd it's a dim recollection of wishing\n\n01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.420\nthat I was like, oh, I wish I was.\n\n01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.780\nBecause there was another guy who\n\n01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:07.420\nwas like a district attorney of Arkansas named Dan Harmon,\n\n01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.940\nwho had participated in the assassination of two kids who\n\n01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.100\nwere walking down a railroad track\n\n01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:16.380\nand stumbled onto a drug deal between cops and drug dealers.\n\n01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:17.580\nCan assassinate kids?\n\n01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.100\nYeah.\n\n01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:22.300\nWell, if they witnessed the drug deal between cops\n\n01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:26.020\nand drug dealers, and the two kids were just blown away.\n\n01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.860\nAnd Dan Harmon was the district attorney,\n\n01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:31.940\nI want to say, or attorney general of the state\n\n01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:32.820\nor something like that.\n\n01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:33.940\nWould you Google my name?\n\n01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:34.700\nOh, you're not done.\n\n01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.820\nAnd so it was just like, I kept.\n\n01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:38.300\nWow.\n\n01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:41.900\nI would Google my name, and I would look at the first three\n\n01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.060\nresults, and I would be like, fuck this fucking guy\n\n01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.540\nthat murdered two kids.\n\n01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.580\nOne day I'm going to be more famous than him.\n\n01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.060\nI would really think that in my head.\n\n01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.020\nI'm like, I'm the one day I'm going to fucking\n\n01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.980\ntrump this guy for the murder of two children.\n\n01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.260\nBe careful what you wish for.\n\n01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.380\nAlso, a name for a noose in the south\n\n01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.460\nis a Jeff Davis necktie.\n\n01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.860\nThere's a famous Jeff Davis out there, and he went, yeah.\n\n01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.140\nWhen you Google my name, which I don't do often because it's\n\n01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:12.780\nfucking terrible for yourself, but three years ago,\n\n01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:16.820\nI wrote for a deal breaker blog, a deal breaker,\n\n01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.060\nif you share custody of a pet with your ex,\n\n01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.100\nthat's a deal breaker.\n\n01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.940\nAnd some fucking guy, if you Google\n\n01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:27.340\nmy name, it says why Georgia Heartstark will die alone.\n\n01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.780\nNot literally word for word, and you click on it,\n\n01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.420\nand it's just tearing me apart for having that opinion.\n\n01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.220\nAnd you're really a guy that shared a bulldog,\n\n01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:36.380\nwhere they're like a fucking obnoxious.\n\n01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.260\nEvery time people, I think, well, Google me,\n\n01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.900\nthey'll click it because it's terrifying,\n\n01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.340\nand so it stays up on the top of the Google list.\n\n01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.500\nSo my grandma is 103 if she fucking.\n\n01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.060\nShe does not get a little shit, dude.\n\n01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.700\nWhatever, my aunt, she's like, ever life potion.\n\n01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.900\nLike your grandma doesn't get it.\n\n01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.900\nHey, Dan, can we bring Spencer up?\n\n01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.660\nWell, we should bid goodbye to our guests.\n\n01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.020\nI don't know if there's other guests.\n\n01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.500\nWe're blind on dead grandma.\n\n01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:04.100\nWe have to, but would you?\n\n01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.100\nI was saying, if you're welcome to stay,\n\n01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.420\nas far as I'm concerned, but I think it's time\n\n01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.260\nto have Spencer come.\n\n01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.100\nWell,

Wings.\n\n01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:22.740\nI still have a Magic the Gathering deck\n\n01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.100\nin case anyone wants to play.\n\n01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:26.020\nThank you,

I didn't mean to give them the hook.\n\n01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.820\nYeah, man, I was trying to get rid of them and you fucked it up.\n\n01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.820\nOr I just put the pedal to the metal.\n\n01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.820\nOh, yeah. I guess you forced the issue. That's for sure.\n\n01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:07.820\nWell, let's bring Spencer out, shall we?\n\n01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.820\nSpencer!\n\n01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:14.820\nWhoa!\n\n01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:23.820\nSpencer, you leapt to the stage like a desert breeze.\n\n01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.820\nYeah, I'm all over the place today.\n\n01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:26.820\nHow you doing, man?\n\n01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:31.820\nI'm out of sorts. I mean, everyone who's not listening to the podcast will know.\n\n01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.820\nI look like shit. I smell like shit.\n\n01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:42.820\nI woke up bad. I threatened the life of an elderly lady today.\n\n01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:44.820\nAlright, go with that. Let's go with that.\n\n01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:48.820\nWhat occasion do you threaten the life of an elderly lady?\n\n01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:53.820\nDrive in on near target Lebrea.\n\n01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:58.820\nThere was this old woman who had the crazed look of a homeless person,\n\n01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:03.820\nbut the well-dressedness of a lady going to church.\n\n01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:10.820\nShe was wandering in the street like those hobos do when they're going up and down the aisles looking for change.\n\n01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:17.820\nBut she was just making the most craven stare like at people and then like walking towards them\n\n01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:20.820\nif they gave any indication of noticing her existence.\n\n01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:26.820\nAnd I slipped up. I slipped up. I gave one glance and the next thing I know,\n\n01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:31.820\nshe was right at the corner of my car, like right in front of it, like just...\n\n01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:37.820\nAnd my window was down. I think that might be why she was targeting me because, you know,\n\n01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:40.820\nI could hear her potentially, but she didn't say anything.\n\n01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:43.820\nShe was just staring at me and then the light turns green.\n\n01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.820\nYou'd think it was because she was trying to cross the street, but it wasn't.\n\n01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:52.820\nBut she started to go in front of my car to make as if she was going to walk in front of my car,\n\n01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:56.820\nmake an eye contact all this time, like, you know what's going to happen.\n\n01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.820\nI don't know what's going to happen. What are you planning, old lady?\n\n01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:07.820\nBut so my window was rolled down and so I cut around her and like sped off and I was like,\n\n01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.820\nI will end your life!\n\n01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.820\nYou said that? I will end your life?\n\n01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:17.820\nYeah. As you drove away, you could have just done it.\n\n01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.820\nI know. And I wanted her to know that.\n\n01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.820\nI could have just plowed straight through her and had a great say.\n\n01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:31.820\nYou drove around her but said, I saved you this day, but I will in the future end your life.\n\n01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:32.820\nYeah.\n\n01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:37.820\nWhat did that lady say at the drive through in that YouTube video when she couldn't get her chicken McNuggets?\n\n01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:38.820\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.820\nI will achieve my ultimate form.\n\n01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.820\nYou just don't want me to achieve my ultimate form.\n\n01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.820\nIt seems like this is now a thing.\n\n01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:51.820\nI mean, because really you said that in a rage. That's what you said.\n\n01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.820\nI am an ageist. I have a problem with old people.\n\n01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.820\nI will end your life. Not I will run you over. I will kill you.\n\n01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.820\nFuck off, old lady.\n\n01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.820\nI said fuck you under my breath and then I went into...\n\n01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.820\nI will end your life.\n\n01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:05.820\nYeah.\n\n01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:11.820\nIt just feels like we're becoming a society of video games.\n\n01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:16.820\nNo, I'd love to be able to end the lives of the elderly.\n\n01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:23.820\nI'd love to have the composure to word my outrage like that.\n\n01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.820\nI had no idea what she was planning.\n\n01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:33.820\nIf I was trying to get the attention of a motorist, I would make eye contact and then maybe gesture at them\n\n01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:37.820\nand maybe mouth a few words, get their attention, you know?\n\n01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:44.820\nAnd then once they had my attention, I'd maybe sidle up to the side of the car and maybe say anything at all.\n\n01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:50.820\nOr, you know, do anything other than walk in front of my car right the second that the light is turning green\n\n01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.820\nwithout the intent to cross the street. I don't know.\n\n01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.820\nIs it possible she was just kind of like a demented...\n\n01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:59.820\nWell, that's even worse for me. I want to kill those people too.\n\n01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:00.820\nWow.\n\n01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:02.820\nI got a lot of problems.\n\n01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:07.820\nYeah. You're about, I don't know, 70 years too late for that, man.\n\n01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.820\nThere was a time.\n\n01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.820\nI know.\n\n01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.820\nI got to catch up.\n\n01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.820\nLet's bring out my betrothed, Erin McGathy.\n\n01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:17.820\nErin McGathy!\n\n01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.820\nThanks for coming, Erin. Erin McGathy, everybody.\n\n01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:37.820\nWow.\n\n01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.820\nShort interview.\n\n01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:39.820\nAllie and Georgia.\n\n01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:40.820\nYeah.\n\n01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:41.820\nI love Allie and Georgia.\n\n01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.820\nI just remember when we were in that restaurant, when we were in the Rustic Inn and I yelled at that guy.\n\n01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:50.820\nI told that story of the podcast where the guy like yelled at us at the end of a lunch for swearing during lunch.\n\n01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.820\nAnd I just blurted out.\n\n01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.820\nYou mean Tamo Shanta, right?\n\n01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.820\nYeah. He said, oh yeah, I said Rustic Inn.\n\n01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:01.820\nHe said, he said, if you guys want to talk like you're at a truck stop, why don't you eat at one?\n\n01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:07.820\nAnd I just blurted out like, if you want to tell people how to talk, why don't you go back to Germany?\n\n01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:16.820\nIn my most outraged moments, I am not the most articulate.\n\n01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:18.820\nDo we tell the dog that's not true?\n\n01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:24.820\nYou've been outraged and been overly articulate and decimated people or eviscerated people.\n\n01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:28.820\nWell, who's the guy that came by in the hat at that big foot lodge?\n\n01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.820\nAnd we saw him and he had a fedora on and suspenders and he was kind of one of those guys.\n\n01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:36.820\nHe was exactly one of those.\n\n01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.820\nHe might have known swing dance.\n\n01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:43.820\nAnd actually, I knew him from the old swing dance days.\n\n01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:46.820\nSo there you have it.\n\n01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:50.820\nBut he was like, hey Jeff, I'm so-and-so, I'm so-and-so.\n\n01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:54.820\nAnd he kind of like pistol winks and you know, and he moved off and we didn't leave.\n\n01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:58.820\nAnd two hours later, he comes by like, you guys still in the same booth?\n\n01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.820\nAnd I forget what you said, but it was a fucking goodie.\n\n01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:06.820\nI said, well, count your blessings if it weren't for people like us that didn't move, you wouldn't know.\n\n01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.820\nYou'd lose your stripes, Magellan.\n\n01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:14.820\nBut I wasn't mad at him. I just hated him. I wanted him to die.\n\n01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:17.820\nYou weren't mad at him, you just wanted him to know.\n\n01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:22.820\nI'm in a fight or flight response. I'm not going to be like Jonathan Swift.\n\n01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.820\nIt's when I'm in a surly mood.\n\n01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:31.820\nIf I've been drinking and I just want to be left alone and someone comes up to me and does one of those things\n\n01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:36.820\nwhere they wave their hand in front of your face because you're not making enough eye contact,\n\n01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:42.820\nor they say like that guy did, like he implied that I should have been moving more.\n\n01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:52.820\nI would gladly watch that guy just like descend on a spike onto a bunch of other spikes.\n\n01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:59.820\nI don't know how torture works, but I hate murder.\n\n01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:05.820\nI'm in a surly, surly leave me alone mood.\n\n01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:08.820\nI'm kind of in the mood to get a good session of D&D. Are you guys down for that?\n\n01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:10.820\nI don't know.\n\n01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.820\nI feel like the last couple, we didn't get shit done.\n\n01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.820\nOh, dear heavens.\n\n01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.820\nNow we know why.\n\n01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:24.820\nAaron, do you have anything to even building up pressure back there?\n\n01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:29.820\nI'm doing great.\n\n01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:32.820\nI am enjoying the show so far.\n\n01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:37.820\nI'm a little distracted by our recent wedding planning.\n\n01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.820\nWe're not going to talk about that because we want it to be special, right?\n\n01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.820\nYeah, yeah. No, we're not going to talk about it.\n\n01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:48.820\nBut backstage I was just talking to our friends and floating on a happy cloud.\n\n01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:52.820\nSo I was listening to the episode, I Love Valley in Georgia, which is enjoying there.\n\n01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.820\nThey're all right.\n\n01:25:54.820 --> 01:26:01.820\nThe wedding thing does, it's kind of cool to have to pick seven groomsmen.\n\n01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:05.820\nIt's like when you're a kid picking action figures.\n\n01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:08.820\nI mean, you guys just got slumber parties and stuff while you were talking about that.\n\n01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:16.820\nI was thinking about my bachelorette party and what that means and being able to pick people for that.\n\n01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:20.820\nAnd like you said, being able to pick bridesmaids and groomsmen.\n\n01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:25.820\nIt's a weird position for like an outcast to be in.\n\n01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.820\nBut it's great. It's so fun.\n\n01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:34.820\nBut as far as like building up steam, I've just been right in this high, man.\n\n01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:40.820\nWe went to our wedding venue yesterday and I am still right in that high.\n\n01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:41.820\nIt's going to be good.\n\n01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:47.820\nAre we going to be the first people to get married that don't almost get divorced during the planning of the wedding?\n\n01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:49.820\nAre we going to be able to pull this off?\n\n01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.820\nI hope so. Is that a life trope?\n\n01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:56.820\nIt just seems like everyone I've ever talked to when they're planning their wedding.\n\n01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:59.820\nHow involved are you going to be in this planning, Dan?\n\n01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:01.820\nSo far 100%.\n\n01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.820\nI would like to think that everything that I don't care about is stuff that Aaron cares about.\n\n01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:11.820\nHave you chosen to be very involved or very not involved?\n\n01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.820\nI want it to be a good wedding.\n\n01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:17.820\nI'm not going to baby out.\n\n01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:21.820\nI'm not going to go, just tell me where I'm getting married.\n\n01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.820\nAnd then also complain about everything.\n\n01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:25.820\nI have a lot of opinions about weddings.\n\n01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.820\nI have gone to a lot of them.\n\n01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:32.820\nAnd so I want to make sure the sound system is fucking whip ass.\n\n01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:38.820\nI don't want to hear a crackle or a fucking hum during those goddamn shitty self-written vows.\n\n01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:44.820\nI don't want any of this shit that always bugs the fuck out of me when I go to weddings\n\n01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:46.820\nto bug the fuck out of anybody that goes to my wedding.\n\n01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.820\nSo I have a lot of opinions about that stuff.\n\n01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.820\nI don't want to jinx it, but so far...\n\n01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:52.820\nIf I did, it would go a little something.\n\n01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.820\nLike this.\n\n01:27:54.820 --> 01:28:02.820\nSo I mean, I wasn't one of those little girls who dreamed about her wedding, so now as an adult\n\n01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:05.820\nI'm getting to dream about it from scratch.\n\n01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:10.820\nBut all of my really specific, passionate ideas match with dance.\n\n01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:16.820\nAnd I don't feel, you guys will see, it's just going to get weird at our wedding.\n\n01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:25.820\nBut it's all very specific and works with, it's the same as your vision.\n\n01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:26.820\nSo it's all great.\n\n01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:27.820\nI had a dream about your wedding.\n\n01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:29.820\nYou can't go though, you're not invited.\n\n01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.820\nWhen is it?\n\n01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:33.820\nI'm out of town.\n\n01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:39.820\nI had a dream about your wedding that you would ask me to emcee it, not officiate it.\n\n01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.820\nBut to be like the emcee, like kind of bring people up.\n\n01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:47.820\nAnd then Dan panicked and just went out there and just started roasting everybody.\n\n01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:52.820\nAnd Dan just did a big roast.\n\n01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:56.820\nAnd then there was a dolphin playing violin.\n\n01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:01.820\nSo you were there at our session with our wedding planner.\n\n01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:03.820\nAll right.\n\n01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:08.820\nSpencer, have you been enjoying being my assistant?\n\n01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.820\nYeah, I feel like I've been slipping lately.\n\n01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.820\nI'm not sure, not sure.\n\n01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:14.820\nExactly.\n\n01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:15.820\nBecause I don't need an assistant lately.\n\n01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:16.820\nIs that what it is?\n\n01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:17.820\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:18.820\nSo it's been an easy job.\n\n01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.820\nOkay.\n\n01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.820\nYou should high five yourself.\n\n01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.820\nIt's easy.\n\n01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:22.820\nDan doesn't have a house here.\n\n01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.820\nI'm a more alcoholic.\n\n01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:24.820\nYeah?\n\n01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:25.820\nHe doesn't have a house here.\n\n01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.820\nI will go get one right now.\n\n01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:28.820\nI have a copy.\n\n01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:29.820\nI know.\n\n01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:33.820\nI also need a, I need my key fob for my Prius replaced.\n\n01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:37.820\nThat's the one that you like hold near the door and then it opens.\n\n01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:40.820\nWhat, what are you, an alien?\n\n01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:43.820\nIf that were, no, you have to push a button.\n\n01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:46.820\nI don't know why I'm so offended by that.\n\n01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:50.820\nYour car doesn't have a smart key access where it opens up just because it knows your keys are up on here.\n\n01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.820\nWell, it does.\n\n01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:53.820\nHe has to push the button, but if he doesn't have the key fob, it won't work.\n\n01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:54.820\nRight.\n\n01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.820\nYeah.\n\n01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:56.820\nIt's, it's, it's fallen apart.\n\n01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:00.820\nI've, I've, I've dropped it and it's, I need a new one.\n\n01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:01.820\nAll right.\n\n01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:02.820\nThat's something to work on.\n\n01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:03.820\nLet me write that down.\n\n01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:04.820\nYeah.\n\n01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:05.820\nSo now you're a good assistant.\n\n01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.820\nSpencer, do you have any critiques for Dan as an employer?\n\n01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.820\nNo, no, you're doing an amazing job.\n\n01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:13.820\nI think you could stand a gain a few pounds.\n\n01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:14.820\nI like this guy.\n\n01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:15.820\nYeah.\n\n01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:16.820\nYou know what?\n\n01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:19.820\nYou're promoted to senior assistant.\n\n01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:23.820\nHe just became platinum assistant.\n\n01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.820\nSpencer, you ready to roll on this DND?\n\n01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:26.820\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:27.820\nLet's say we,\n\n01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:36.820\nHow exciting is it to see the Harmon Quest animation?\n\n01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:39.820\nIt's really exciting.\n\n01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:40.820\nI'm terrified.\n\n01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:44.820\nI've never, you know, I'm just a fucking guy and now I have this thing.\n\n01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.820\nAnd now there's a cartoon of you.\n\n01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:46.820\nYeah.\n\n01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:47.820\nYeah.\n\n01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:48.820\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.820\nThat's pretty incredible.\n\n01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:51.820\nHow do you, how do you feel about that cartoon?\n\n01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:52.820\nI feel good.\n\n01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:56.820\nI, I, I looked way too fat originally.\n\n01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:58.820\nI was like, I'm not saying I'm skinny.\n\n01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:02.820\nI'm saying I'm tall and fat, not fat.\n\n01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:03.820\nNo, I,\n\n01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:04.820\nThere's a difference.\n\n01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:05.820\nThere's a difference.\n\n01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:06.820\nI had to tell you like, yeah.\n\n01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.820\nGo tell them you're not that fat.\n\n01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:09.820\nI was like, I made you.\n\n01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:10.820\nYeah.\n\n01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:11.820\nYour character is like an incredibly real tough.\n\n01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:12.820\nBut he's an orc.\n\n01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:13.820\nLike he's fine.\n\n01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:15.820\nHis character is like six foot seven.\n\n01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:17.820\nLike, and I was fatter and taller than him.\n\n01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:18.820\nAnd I'm six foot four.\n\n01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:19.820\nSo that doesn't make sense, right?\n\n01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:20.820\nAll right.\n\n01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:21.820\nMeanwhile.\n\n01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:22.820\nOh, Larry McGathey.\n\n01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.820\nMy animation is sexies.\n\n01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:25.820\nFuck.\n\n01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:26.820\nYeah.\n\n01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:27.820\nYeah.\n\n01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:28.820\nYou're like,\n\n01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:29.820\nWay sexier than I,\n\n01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:30.820\nJessica Rabbit.\n\n01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:31.820\nYeah.\n\n01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.820\nAnd you could note it and be like,\n\n01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:35.820\nThis does not look like her at all.\n\n01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:37.820\nBut instead it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:38.820\nTotally in her mind.\n\n01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.820\nThat's what, that's what it is.\n\n01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:41.820\nIt's appropriate.\n\n01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.820\nI'm glad you like it.\n\n01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:43.820\nI love it.\n\n01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:45.820\nI didn't want it to be like trivialized.\n\n01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:46.820\nNo.\n\n01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:47.820\nTribute.\n\n01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:48.820\nI was like,\n\n01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:49.820\nYour boobs.\n\n01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:50.820\nI am.\n\n01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:51.820\nI am torn.\n\n01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:52.820\nI am torn in that way.\n\n01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:55.820\nAnd I say during the thing I describe myself as,\n\n01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:57.820\nit was very like busty and skinny.\n\n01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:01.820\nIt's incredibly insulting for every feminist listening.\n\n01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:02.820\nI'm sure.\n\n01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:05.820\nAnd I should also my, my dream also great.\n\n01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.820\nCause I'm, I'm, I'm marginalizing myself.\n\n01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:08.820\nI should just disclaim.\n\n01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.820\nI didn't actually like say anything.\n\n01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:12.820\nThey did a great job on their own.\n\n01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:13.820\nThe artists.\n\n01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.820\nThank you for disclaiming.\n\n01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:16.820\nYeah.\n\n01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.820\nI didn't want to have people think that it was my idea.\n\n01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.820\nWell, now that's all we know.\n\n01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:21.820\nDo we know what this is going to,\n\n01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:22.820\nwould this be visible?\n\n01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:23.820\nWhen's this going to be done?\n\n01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:24.820\nNo idea.\n\n01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:25.820\nThat's, that's what's so crazy.\n\n01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:26.820\nThat's what I never would have expected.\n\n01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:30.820\nLike because, you know, there's people who like wrote a pilot and took it around.\n\n01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:32.820\nAnd then they get it shot.\n\n01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.820\nAnd then they have a pilot in, in the works.\n\n01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.820\nLike I just fell into that.\n\n01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:37.820\nIt's weird.\n\n01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:40.820\nI feel bad for everybody else.\n\n01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.820\nI'm going to make sure next week, next week's podcast,\n\n01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:46.820\nwe got to have like a civil rights activist on.\n\n01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:48.820\nIt was the last two weeks.\n\n01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:52.820\nWe've talked about how I don't understand women and how fat I'm getting\n\n01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.820\nand how famous we all are.\n\n01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:58.820\nJust a mental note to myself.\n\n01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:00.820\nOkay.\n\n01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:05.820\nThat's the wrong sound.\n\n01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.820\nThat's right.\n\n01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:12.820\nSomeone who's desalinizing water off the coast of Africa or something.\n\n01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:15.820\nJust to, just to gain something back that I think we've lost.\n\n01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:19.820\nAnd that person just by proxy is a civil rights activist?\n\n01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:22.820\nNo, I'm just riffing lists of possibilities.\n\n01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.820\nSomeone special.\n\n01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:29.820\nSomeone, someone humanizing.\n\n01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:31.820\nWhen we last met.\n\n01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:32.820\nThank you.\n\n01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:37.820\nOur heroes were down a hole and up a creek, hundreds of feet below the earth.\n\n01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:41.820\nAfter landing in the dust, the group spied an approaching hissing skeleton\n\n01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:44.820\nwith orange glowing hands.\n\n01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:46.820\nHis name was Lenev, the rebel.\n\n01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:51.820\nAnd he revealed to be, he revealed to the gang that Chris de Burgh was possessed\n\n01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:53.820\nby dark forces.\n\n01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:54.820\nThe fates would have it.\n\n01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:58.820\nLenev was also, also happened to reveal a cure to the heroes.\n\n01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:01.820\nThe mythical, mystical tarragon of virtue.\n\n01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:04.820\nThen Chris de Burgh started shooting lasers all over the place\n\n01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.820\nand Mulraine had to restrain him,\n\n01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.820\ndeftly crafting a, crafting a muscling manacle.\n\n01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:13.820\nThen Quark took off the muzzle to make out with a possessed robe\n\n01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:16.820\nwhich was an admittedly terrible idea.\n\n01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:20.820\nAnd in return received a mouth full of vomit.\n\n01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:25.820\nThe appetite sated, the party departed for Tormator, the city of Unshackled Dead.\n\n01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:28.820\nBut who was this mysterious skeleton?\n\n01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:33.820\nAnd why did he quickly drop his language of hisses within five minutes of meeting him?\n\n01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:36.820\nAnd why did his hands glow with an orange light?\n\n01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:41.820\nWe'll find out next, maybe, probably not, I doubt it.\n\n01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:50.820\nHow drunk were you last week?\n\n01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:55.820\nI don't, I don't, that's like, that was like, hearing, like, this is what you did.\n\n01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:58.820\nThat's what you sounded like when I was saying it then too, so.\n\n01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:02.820\nYou told Trisha she was a, a racist?\n\n01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:05.820\nTrisha, who's Trisha?\n\n01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:08.820\nDo we need a Chris de Burgh up here or are we going to go just to freestyle it with us?\n\n01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:09.820\nCan I be Chris de Burgh?\n\n01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:10.820\nYes, yes.\n\n01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:11.820\nSorry folks.\n\n01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.820\nHey Chris de Burgh, how are you feeling?\n\n01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.820\nAre you still possessed?\n\n01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:18.820\nNo, no, I mean, I'm fine.\n\n01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.820\nI sense, I sense motive on him.\n\n01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:22.820\nHis eyes are glowing with rage.\n\n01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:23.820\nOkay.\n\n01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:27.820\nDo we find even untimely?\n\n01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:31.820\nNo, no, we're going to leave you, you vomit it out of my mouth, man.\n\n01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.820\nYeah.\n\n01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:36.820\nWhere do we find this tarragon of, of, of, of virtue?\n\n01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:40.820\nThat's a weird thing to ask me, the person who's afflicted by it.\n\n01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.820\nOkay.\n\n01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.820\nI, I, I asked the game, I asked the game master, because I forgot.\n\n01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:47.820\nDid he say where the tarragon of virtue lay?\n\n01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:50.820\nNo, he said he'd take you to the bone sages.\n\n01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.820\nUh, uh, Lenev, the rebel speaks up.\n\n01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:54.820\nI'm taking you to the bone sages now.\n\n01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:55.820\nAll right, we'll follow you.\n\n01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:56.820\nYou'll recall.\n\n01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:57.820\nFantastic.\n\n01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:58.820\nYeah.\n\n01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.820\nLet's, let's go to the bone sages.\n\n01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:01.820\nThat sounds good.\n\n01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:02.820\nAll right.\n\n01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:07.820\nAs you trek through the dusty gray darkness, you're reminded of the hazy monochromatic\n\n01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:12.820\nlook of the monochromatic look of the shadow plane.\n\n01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:13.820\nAh.\n\n01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.820\nRemember this?\n\n01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:15.820\nRemember this fellas?\n\n01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:22.820\nBy several dark gray pillars and massive curved bones stab out of the ground like teeth.\n\n01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:23.820\nThe old shadow plane.\n\n01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:24.820\nIt's funny.\n\n01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:28.820\nIt's funny when you come to call home when you've been so far.\n\n01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:31.820\nAin't that the truth?\n\n01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:34.820\nI never thought I'd miss the shadow plane.\n\n01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:41.820\nAnd they're all we've been through.\n\n01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:49.820\nIt's just good to be back in the shadow plane.\n\n01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:51.820\nOh, so we're walking with a skeleton?\n\n01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.820\nI don't know what the fuck.\n\n01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:54.820\nI swear to God.\n\n01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:57.820\nLike last week, I was just, I just, I don't know what happened.\n\n01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:59.820\nIt wasn't, it wasn't along, it wasn't along.\n\n01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:01.820\nTell me about the bone sages.\n\n01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:02.820\nWho are they?\n\n01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:03.820\nOh, the bone sages.\n\n01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:06.820\nThey, they, they, they see the future.\n\n01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.820\nThey know stuff.\n\n01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.820\nThey're like, you know, normal, non-bone sages.\n\n01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.820\nWhy, why is people, dude, advisors?\n\n01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:16.820\nThey advise the magister of Tormod Tor.\n\n01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:17.820\nAre they, are they nearby?\n\n01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:18.820\nThey're pretty nearby.\n\n01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:20.820\nWe're getting close now.\n\n01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:21.820\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:22.820\nThank you, Lenev.\n\n01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:23.820\nI take Quirk aside.\n\n01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:24.820\nWho's Lenev?\n\n01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:25.820\nWhen did we meet her?\n\n01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.820\nIs it, is she?\n\n01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:27.820\nI don't know what.\n\n01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:31.820\nHe, or I would say, he was a hissing skeleton that had orange glowing hands that came out.\n\n01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:32.820\nHissing skeleton, orange glowing hands.\n\n01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:33.820\nYes.\n\n01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.820\nAnd then he stopped hissing and he started speaking.\n\n01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:37.820\nAnd, and just, here to help us.\n\n01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:40.820\nYeah, he's, I look, I was there too, baby.\n\n01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:41.820\nOkay.\n\n01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:43.820\nHey, man.\n\n01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:48.820\nI was just saying that, you know, I'm a skeleton, but I'm not a bad guy.\n\n01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:51.820\nBut there's skeletons down here that are bad guys.\n\n01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:52.820\nFor sure.\n\n01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:54.820\nHow do we know that we can trust you, Lenev?\n\n01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:57.820\nI mean, I haven't eaten your faces.\n\n01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:59.820\nOh, nor have you tried.\n\n01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.820\nIn which case you would invoke my fucking rage.\n\n01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.820\nThat's learned was impossible.\n\n01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:05.820\nSharpie, sharpie, sharpie.\n\n01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:06.820\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:07.820\nI just want to make that clear.\n\n01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:12.820\nI've run into too many people on this quest who have implied that they have power over me.\n\n01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:13.820\nNobody does.\n\n01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:16.820\nI've been stomped by an ice giant.\n\n01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:19.820\nAnd I'm here, motherfucker.\n\n01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:21.820\nYou eat my face.\n\n01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:23.820\nYou eat it.\n\n01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:28.820\nYou were so much more pleasant just five minutes ago.\n\n01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.820\nHe had a cup of coffee.\n\n01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:31.820\nI'm confused.\n\n01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:35.820\nYou're thankful that I'm your friend.\n\n01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:36.820\nSharpie.\n\n01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.820\nNot the other way around.\n\n01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:38.820\nSharpie.\n\n01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.820\nYou're lucky.\n\n01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:40.820\nSharpie.\n\n01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:41.820\nYou're lucky.\n\n01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:42.820\nSharpie.\n\n01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:44.820\nWhen was luck invoked?\n\n01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:45.820\nSharpie.\n\n01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.820\nI just said I didn't attack you this time.\n\n01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:51.820\nSharpie, just because you don't remember what happened five minutes ago doesn't make it his fault.\n\n01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:52.820\nLenev.\n\n01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:53.820\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:54.820\nI take Lenore aside.\n\n01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:55.820\nCan I take Lenore aside?\n\n01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:56.820\nLenev.\n\n01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:57.820\nLenev.\n\n01:38:57.820 --> 01:38:58.820\nLenore.\n\n01:38:58.820 --> 01:38:59.820\nLenev.\n\n01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:00.820\nLenev.\n\n01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:01.820\nListen.\n\n01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:02.820\nFucking alcoholics.\n\n01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:08.820\nI'm going to tell you something that I don't feel like I can tell other people.\n\n01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:09.820\nNope.\n\n01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:11.820\nI'm an alcoholic.\n\n01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:17.820\nAnd it comes with all kinds of behaviors that...\n\n01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.820\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:20.820\nThat's okay.\n\n01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.820\nBut don't fuck with me.\n\n01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:26.820\nDon't assert dominance over me.\n\n01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:28.820\nWhat is dominance?\n\n01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.820\nWhat you...\n\n01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:34.820\nYou just implied a minute ago that I'm fortunate that you haven't eaten my face.\n\n01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:35.820\nDon't fucking deny it.\n\n01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:36.820\nNo, I...\n\n01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:38.820\nHe didn't categorically deny that.\n\n01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.820\nHe didn't imply that you were lucky.\n\n01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:42.820\nHe said, how do I know you were on our side?\n\n01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.820\nHe goes, because if I weren't, I might eat your face.\n\n01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:45.820\nHow many?\n\n01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:46.820\nOkay, well, I just want to correct that.\n\n01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:49.820\nIf you weren't, you would try to eat my face.\n\n01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:53.820\nAstrosk, you'd fail.\n\n01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:57.820\nAs so many have before.\n\n01:39:57.820 --> 01:39:59.820\nBecause I'm a fucking badass.\n\n01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:02.820\nBecause this is the game and not real life.\n\n01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:04.820\nSharpie, let's...\n\n01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:08.820\nSharpie, let's put this to the test and torment of terror.\n\n01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:14.820\nAs we go in search of the Tarragona virtue to save Christopher Berg from his possession.\n\n01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.820\nWhat?\n\n01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.820\nJust...\n\n01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:19.820\nJust nod and go, all right, all right, okay.\n\n01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:22.820\nI was drunk last week and I'm sorry.\n\n01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:23.820\nYou know what?\n\n01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:24.820\nI won't lie.\n\n01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.820\nI'm a little drunk this week.\n\n01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:27.820\nIt's not helping.\n\n01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:28.820\nNo.\n\n01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.820\nI'm sober.\n\n01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:31.820\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:32.820\nLenore?\n\n01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:33.820\nLenev.\n\n01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:34.820\nLenev.\n\n01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:35.820\nLenev.\n\n01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:38.820\nOkay, just like...\n\n01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:41.820\nLet's both be thankful that we're friends.\n\n01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:43.820\nFucking Sharpie, leave it.\n\n01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:44.820\nNo one's fucking leave it.\n\n01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.820\nNo one's benefiting.\n\n01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.820\nWho's talking about thankfulness or friendship?\n\n01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:50.820\nAre we still walking while this is happening?\n\n01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:51.820\nAre we...\n\n01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:53.820\nAre we living while this is happening?\n\n01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:54.820\nThis is like that Justin Bieber shit.\n\n01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:57.820\nYou got all bent out of shape because they went to his house because he ate people.\n\n01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:58.820\nSomebody implies that...\n\n01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:00.820\nOh, here's how you know if I wasn't your friend.\n\n01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:01.820\nYour face would be...\n\n01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:08.820\nHey, how many zombies that have been your friend did bit you in the face upon meeting you?\n\n01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:09.820\nNone.\n\n01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:10.820\nYeah.\n\n01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.820\nBecause none of those zombies were your friends.\n\n01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:19.820\nI approached Sharpie and I used my fingers to do like the walking up spider motion up\n\n01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:21.820\nhis arm to his shoulder.\n\n01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.820\nI slap it away.\n\n01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:30.820\nI'm just saying, I just want to clarify, here's where our culture gap is.\n\n01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:32.820\nI really thought we were...\n\n01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.820\nIn movies.\n\n01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.820\nI start eating dirt.\n\n01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:35.820\nIn movies.\n\n01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:37.820\nYou know what else to do.\n\n01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:42.820\nWhat is that term for that condition where you want to eat dirt and rocks?\n\n01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:43.820\nPika.\n\n01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:44.820\nMicah?\n\n01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:45.820\nPika.\n\n01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:46.820\nPika.\n\n01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:47.820\nI have pika.\n\n01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:48.820\nSo I start eating dirt and rocks.\n\n01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:51.820\nIt's a badass thing to say in movies that somebody goes like,\n\n01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:54.820\nif I wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead.\n\n01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:56.820\nThat's how I interpret it.\n\n01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:58.820\nI am a person.\n\n01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:00.820\nI'm okay.\n\n01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.820\nDon't eat dirt.\n\n01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.820\nAll right.\n\n01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:04.820\nOkay.\n\n01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.820\nI stop her from eating dirt.\n\n01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.820\nMommy, daddy, in the sand.\n\n01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:10.820\nDon't eat dirt.\n\n01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:13.820\nI walk off with Lenev in the direction of tour mode of tour.\n\n01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:14.820\nDon't eat dirt.\n\n01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:15.820\nOkay.\n\n01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:16.820\nDon't eat dirt.\n\n01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:17.820\nI leave them...\n\n01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:18.820\nI want to get some shit done today.\n\n01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:19.820\nWell...\n\n01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:21.820\nI want to get into some combat.\n\n01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:22.820\nI want to fucking...\n\n01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:23.820\nI want to fucking fuck...\n\n01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:30.820\nI sing an original song called Don't Eat Dirt.\n\n01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:31.820\nIt's awesome.\n\n01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:32.820\nSing it.\n\n01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:33.820\nTake my word for it.\n\n01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:34.820\nSing it.\n\n01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:36.820\nWell, it doesn't matter.\n\n01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.820\nIf he rolls, then it's awesome.\n\n01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.820\nNo.\n\n01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.820\nYou'll sing it.\n\n01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:42.820\nIf I like it, it's awesome.\n\n01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:45.820\nDon't eat dirt.\n\n01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:49.820\nDon't munch gravel.\n\n01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:56.820\nFor your hurt, can you now unravel?\n\n01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:01.820\nIf you take my hand in yours, you don't need minerals\n\n01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:05.820\nor ores to put on your gullet.\n\n01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:11.820\nTake that bullet and bite it and take my hand.\n\n01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:15.820\nBut I'm afraid.\n\n01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:17.820\nAnd anyways, it's awesome.\n\n01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:18.820\nNo matter what you roll.\n\n01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:22.820\nNow you can't.\n\n01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:23.820\nSo now we...\n\n01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:24.820\nNow we...\n\n01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:30.820\nDan, we just revealed our vows.\n\n01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:31.820\nBlibber and wait up.\n\n01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:32.820\nBlibber.\n\n01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:33.820\nThe nev.\n\n01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:35.820\nThe face eater.\n\n01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:40.820\nDon't eat my face.\n\n01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:45.820\nI run up to Quirk and I'm also trying to stay on task.\n\n01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:46.820\nOkay.\n\n01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.820\nJust promise me you won't eat my face.\n\n01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:49.820\nHe never said he was going to, man.\n\n01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:52.820\nHe said I would know if we weren't friends\n\n01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:54.820\nbecause he would eat my face.\n\n01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:56.820\nHe said, did I try to eat your face?\n\n01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:58.820\nHe didn't say it did you, is your face eating?\n\n01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:01.820\nHe said, how do I know you on our side?\n\n01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:02.820\nHave I tried to eat your face?\n\n01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:03.820\nBy the way, why are you on his side?\n\n01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:04.820\nBecause he's been...\n\n01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:05.820\nI asked him, are we on your side?\n\n01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:07.820\nHe goes, have I tried to eat your face?\n\n01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:08.820\nAnd you don't know?\n\n01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:12.820\nIt's a very common undead activity to eat your face.\n\n01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:14.820\nVery normal among them.\n\n01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:15.820\nOkay.\n\n01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:16.820\nI just had a curiosity.\n\n01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:19.820\nLike I pull the nev aside and I go, okay, the nev.\n\n01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.820\nSharpie's being...\n\n01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:23.820\nHe's in one of his episodes right now.\n\n01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:25.820\nGo up there and try to eat his face.\n\n01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:26.820\nI lay down.\n\n01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:27.820\nI lay down.\n\n01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.820\nI lay down with my hands under my back.\n\n01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:34.820\nAnd I go, here's my face.\n\n01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:38.820\nLet's pretend, hey, fuck your mother.\n\n01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:39.820\nWe're not friends.\n\n01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:41.820\nI want to go through the motions you'd go through.\n\n01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:44.820\nChris de Burgh vomits acid on your face.\n\n01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:45.820\nWhat?\n\n01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:46.820\nWhat?\n\n01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:49.820\nChris de Burgh, the possessed rogue.\n\n01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:51.820\nDealing how much vomit damage.\n\n01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:52.820\nHe's been tied up.\n\n01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:53.820\nI still vomit.\n\n01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.820\nFrench speakers, does nev mean dream?\n\n01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:57.820\nWhat does nev mean?\n\n01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:00.820\nOh, nev doesn't mean anything.\n\n01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:01.820\nYou're drunk.\n\n01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:06.820\nOkay, so there's vomit on my face?\n\n01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:07.820\nYeah, that's great.\n\n01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:11.820\nWell, why'd you get down on the floor and threaten things to happen to you?\n\n01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:12.820\nTo make a point.\n\n01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:13.820\nTo assert dominance.\n\n01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:14.820\nDid you make your point?\n\n01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:22.820\nNo, you did.\n\n01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:27.820\nOkay, fine, I get up and I follow Laverne.\n\n01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:28.820\nLa-nev.\n\n01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:29.820\nLa-nev.\n\n01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:35.820\nLa-nev, are we close to the torment?\n\n01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:37.820\nI stopped walking to see all this happen.\n\n01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:38.820\nYeah, I'm sure we're really close.\n\n01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:40.820\nI'm sure we're right at the precipice of...\n\n01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:42.820\nCan we compress time and be there?\n\n01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:45.820\nI mean, we could have done that five minutes ago.\n\n01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:46.820\nLet's do it now.\n\n01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:47.820\nWe do it now.\n\n01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:49.820\nOkay, but if during any of that time...\n\n01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:50.820\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:55.820\nCompress it.\n\n01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:59.820\nHey, I turn to Sharpie, go Sharpie.\n\n01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:04.820\nLook, you're on edge right now, but I say harness that energy, harness that rage, because\n\n01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.820\nwe might need it for what's coming up.\n\n01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:07.820\nOkay.\n\n01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:09.820\nI don't like people telling me...\n\n01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:10.820\nHe didn't say anything.\n\n01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:16.820\nDo you think there are any kids who listen to Harmontown and they first heard about\n\n01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:23.820\nDungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder via Harmontown, and they're playing and then they all\n\n01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:26.820\ntell each other, no, no, you're not drunk enough.\n\n01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:32.820\nAnd they go into their parents' liquor cabinet or they start drinking Drano, but it was like\n\n01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:34.820\nthis isn't real yet.\n\n01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:38.820\nYou have to play, you have to be black out drunk to play.\n\n01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.820\nThere's an explicit label.\n\n01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:45.820\nWhat if Justin Bieber and his friends were playing D&D or they started larping and the\n\n01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:47.820\neggs are part of it, like they are.\n\n01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:49.820\nThey're casting spells in their eggs.\n\n01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.820\nI guess he's a Justin Bieber.\n\n01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:53.820\nI cast Egg of Doom.\n\n01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:58.820\nYou know that Justin Bieber's larping is like, I go to the grocery store.\n\n01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:00.820\nI buy fruity pebbles.\n\n01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:02.820\nI go home.\n\n01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:05.820\nTeam Bieber.\n\n01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.820\nTeam Bieber.\n\n01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:14.820\nI believe the Constitution's intact.\n\n01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:19.820\nTeam Bieber.\n\n01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:26.820\nI believe in the Constitutional right to protect you from search and seizure.\n\n01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:27.820\nI couldn't hit the high note.\n\n01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.820\nAll right, Spencer, keep it going, baby.\n\n01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:30.820\nWhat?\n\n01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:33.820\nSpencer, I attack the affinefus.\n\n01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:35.820\nYou miss.\n\n01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:37.820\nKeep what going?\n\n01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:39.820\nI'm sorry, let's get back on track.\n\n01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:40.820\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:42.820\nGet back on track?\n\n01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:43.820\nLet's get on track.\n\n01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:44.820\nNo, that makes no sense.\n\n01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:45.820\nI've been trying.\n\n01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:46.820\nI have been trying.\n\n01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:50.820\nSome of I, I'm fucking role playing when somebody says they're going to eat my face.\n\n01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:53.820\nHe didn't say he was going to eat your face.\n\n01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:55.820\nDude, this is being recorded.\n\n01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:58.820\nEveryone on Reddit is going to agree with me.\n\n01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:00.820\nNo, they're not.\n\n01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:06.820\nThe way that that skeleton talked to me was unacceptable.\n\n01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:09.820\nI said, are you friends?\n\n01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:12.820\nThere's a live audience of sober people who heard just what I heard.\n\n01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:16.820\nHe said, if I wasn't your friend, I'd be eating your face.\n\n01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:17.820\nNo, he did not say that.\n\n01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:18.820\nIt's not what he said.\n\n01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:19.820\nThat's what he said.\n\n01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:25.820\nNo, that's what you heard because you're a fucking paranoid lunatic.\n\n01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:29.820\nHe said, if I wasn't your friend, I'd be eating your face.\n\n01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:30.820\nNo, he didn't say that.\n\n01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:31.820\nThat's not what he said.\n\n01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:35.820\nI said, I've told you four times what he said.\n\n01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:36.820\nWhat did he say?\n\n01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:38.820\nI said, can we trust you?\n\n01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:42.820\nHe said, how do we know we can trust you?\n\n01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:44.820\nHe said, have I tried to eat your face?\n\n01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:46.820\nThat's the same thing!\n\n01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:47.820\nFine.\n\n01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.820\nI don't accept that socially.\n\n01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.820\nYou're a fucking crazy person.\n\n01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:53.820\nHey man, can you park my car?\n\n01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.820\nSure, I'll park your car.\n\n01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:00.820\nIs the valet an undead monstrosity?\n\n01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:03.820\nHe's separating himself from the other undead people\n\n01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:05.820\nwho would absolutely try to eat your face.\n\n01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:07.820\nHey bartender, can I have a drink?\n\n01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.820\nIs the bartender an undead monstrosity?\n\n01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:13.820\nYeah, I'll get you a drink.\n\n01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:16.820\nHey, you're working this shift, right?\n\n01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:20.820\nHey, I'm not stabbing you in the throat, am I?\n\n01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:22.820\nIs he wrong?\n\n01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:23.820\nNo, you're not.\n\n01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:25.820\nBut fucking try, motherfucker.\n\n01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:26.820\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:27.820\nWhere is he right now?\n\n01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.820\nHe's trying to stab me.\n\n01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:30.820\nWhy are you so defensive?\n\n01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:32.820\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.820\nWhat?\n\n01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:38.820\nMaybe we should talk about gender neutrality.\n\n01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.820\nEverybody's on your side.\n\n01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:44.820\nDan, everybody, Sharpie, everybody's on your team right now.\n\n01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.820\nTake it easy.\n\n01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:50.820\nFucking have a sip of water, fucking take it, take a couple breaths.\n\n01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:52.820\nNobody's out to get you right now.\n\n01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.820\nNo, no, everybody is because I went to them and they all booed.\n\n01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:00.820\nI don't understand the society where someone could threaten to eat your face.\n\n01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:02.820\nHe threatened you, he didn't threaten to eat your face.\n\n01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:05.820\nWe're staying here until midnight tonight, by the way.\n\n01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:09.820\nWe don't, we don't, we don't go home.\n\n01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:13.820\nWe play D&D until this shit is fucking, like, settled.\n\n01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:17.820\nCan we have, Dustin, can you put, do we have live playback?\n\n01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:18.820\nNo, don't, don't.\n\n01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:21.820\nI know what you said, I agree with what you said.\n\n01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:23.820\nHe said, I'm, fuck it, god damn it.\n\n01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.820\nIt's a great idea for a new t-shirt, we don't go home.\n\n01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:28.820\nI think you're on an edge about this whole Justin Bieber thing,\n\n01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.820\nbut that's not the root of it.\n\n01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:32.820\nThe root of it is that you feel that the world is closing in on you.\n\n01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:34.820\nNo, just Spencer's point, because he's an undead maniac,\n\n01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:37.820\nI'm supposed to accept threats from him, but guess what?\n\n01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:39.820\nI'm, I'm Sharpie.\n\n01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.820\nI've been stomped by giants.\n\n01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:44.820\nI didn't take shit from them and I don't take shit from anybody.\n\n01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.820\nHe didn't give me any shit.\n\n01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:50.820\nHe gave me shit, he fucking said that he has the freedom to eat my face.\n\n01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:52.820\nYou're being a fucking weirdo.\n\n01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:57.820\nSo, Neve, Neve, what is our, we're going to meet these other guys, yeah?\n\n01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.820\nWe're trying to help Chris de Burgh get un-possessed, I think.\n\n01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.820\nAll right.\n\n01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:02.820\nAll right, LeVern?\n\n01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:04.820\nLeNev.\n\n01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:06.820\nUh, forward.\n\n01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:11.820\nAnd hey, just so you know, I'm happy to be with you right now.\n\n01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:17.820\nExhibit A, I'm not stabbing you in the face.\n\n01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:21.820\nThat's how you know we're friends.\n\n01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:23.820\nLet's hang out.\n\n01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:27.820\nDan, you're behaving like a monstrosity right now.\n\n01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:28.820\nI guess that's what I am.\n\n01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:30.820\nI guess you should take it as a compliment.\n\n01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:32.820\nCan I summon Coco the horse?\n\n01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:34.820\nYeah, she's been here.\n\n01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:36.820\nOkay, I hop on top of her.\n\n01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:41.820\nQuirk, Sharpie, would you like to hop on top of my horse?\n\n01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.820\nYes, I hop on the back of the horse.\n\n01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:45.820\nOf course I'd love to hop on your horse.\n\n01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:46.820\nYou know how you know.\n\n01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:47.820\nHere we go.\n\n01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:48.820\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:51.820\nI'm not cutting a tart out and roasting it over a fire.\n\n01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:53.820\nKinda weird.\n\n01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:55.820\nMore than you're right on your horse.\n\n01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:58.820\nSocial, socially acceptable exchange.\n\n01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:00.820\nI hop on your horse.\n\n01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:03.820\nHe's a giant skeleton with glowing hands.\n\n01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:05.820\nWhy do you expect it to be hands?\n\n01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:07.820\nWe're all on Coco and we're falling here at this point.\n\n01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:08.820\nHe hasn't.\n\n01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:10.820\nI'm worried about Sharpie right now.\n\n01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:11.820\nYeah.\n\n01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:14.820\nAlright, so it's so advanced, LeNev.\n\n01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:17.820\nNo, this is all fucked up now.\n\n01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:20.820\nThis guy's being a real dick.\n\n01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:22.820\nI'm just trying to help you.\n\n01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.820\nI get off the horse.\n\n01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:26.820\nI get off the horse.\n\n01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:29.820\nI go up to him.\n\n01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.820\nWhat?\n\n01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:33.820\nWhat do you mean, what?\n\n01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:35.820\nWho's being a real dick?\n\n01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:38.820\nYou were threatening to stab me in the face just now.\n\n01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:41.820\nOh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:43.820\nInteresting.\n\n01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:48.820\nThat's weird.\n\n01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:50.820\nTransitive property.\n\n01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:52.820\nFuck you!\n\n01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:54.820\nDon't eat my face!\n\n01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.820\nI will be friends with you.\n\n01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:58.820\nFriends don't throw shit like that\n\n01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:00.820\nout into the air.\n\n01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:02.820\nYou don't go to a party.\n\n01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:04.820\nPeople don't do that.\n\n01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:06.820\nWell, friends or enemies.\n\n01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.820\nEnemies have, like, détente\n\n01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:10.820\nwhere they go like, I'm keeping my eye on you\n\n01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:12.820\nand I might eat your face.\n\n01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:14.820\nFriends are fucking friends.\n\n01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:16.820\nYou bony dick.\n\n01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:19.820\nYou don't fucking do that shit.\n\n01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:21.820\nBut you...\n\n01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:23.820\nHe, he, he, he...\n\n01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:25.820\nHe stabs you in the face.\n\n01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:27.820\nHe stabs you!\n\n01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:31.820\nPlease be a 20.\n\n01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:33.820\nNo, no, he doesn't.\n\n01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:35.820\nHe lunges at you, though.\n\n01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:37.820\nWith his glowing hands.\n\n01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:39.820\nSharpie's our friend.\n\n01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:41.820\nI've never said anything about it being friends.\n\n01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:43.820\nI said I'd take you to tour my tour.\n\n01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:45.820\nEveryone's being a douchebag to me.\n\n01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:48.820\nI'm reverting to my, my, my baser instincts.\n\n01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:49.820\nThis is happening.\n\n01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:51.820\nIs he saying all this while he's missing me?\n\n01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:52.820\nYeah.\n\n01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:54.820\nHe has plenty of time.\n\n01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:56.820\nSharpie, he's gonna help us to leave it.\n\n01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:57.820\nI'm gonna help him.\n\n01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:59.820\nI'm gonna help him.\n\n01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:01.820\nIn ways that he would have never imagined.\n\n01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:03.820\nPerhaps this is a totally inappropriate moment for this,\n\n01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:06.820\nbut I'm so happy that we're getting married.\n\n01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:11.820\nChristopher's head spins around,\n\n01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:14.820\nvomiting all the way 360 degrees.\n\n01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.820\nHe's tied up, and it doesn't matter.\n\n01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.820\nLike a fountain.\n\n01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:18.820\nOkay.\n\n01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:19.820\nI dodge.\n\n01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:21.820\nObviously, he missed me.\n\n01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:22.820\nHe sure did.\n\n01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:24.820\nAnd I say to him,\n\n01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:28.820\nand I want you to know that I have the skill of...\n\n01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:31.820\nImpulse.\n\n01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:33.820\nI say to him,\n\n01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:36.820\nlook, let's not fight.\n\n01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:39.820\nYou initiated, literally,\n\n01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:41.820\nthe last 20 minutes of fighting.\n\n01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:44.820\nYou started fighting, that's how fights get perpetuated.\n\n01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:47.820\nWhat sort of schizophrenic shit...\n\n01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:52.820\nAre you gonna stab me in the face, man?\n\n01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:54.820\nI'm not the one attacking people.\n\n01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:55.820\nYes, you are!\n\n01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:56.820\nWhat?\n\n01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:58.820\nI didn't do shit, man!\n\n01:54:58.820 --> 01:54:59.820\nYou've been fucking antagonizing everything.\n\n01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:02.820\nNo, I'm not spending a turn explaining to my supposed friend\n\n01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:03.820\nhow this fucking...\n\n01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:04.820\nSupposed friend?\n\n01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:05.820\nYeah,

you alive.\n\n01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:11.820\nFucking weird.\n\n01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:12.820\nLaverne?\n\n01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:13.820\nLaverne.\n\n01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:18.820\nI'm cool if you're cool.\n\n01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.820\nIt's Laverne!\n\n01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:25.820\nCliffhanger!\n\n01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:26.820\nWhat?\n\n01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:33.820\nThank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.\n\n01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:40.820\nWe almost got something done in D&D.\n\n01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:43.820\nThank you, Erin McGathy, Spencer Crittenden,\n\n01:55:43.820 -->
