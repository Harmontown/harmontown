{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:21.400\nIt truly is an honor to be on stage here at the Punchline.\n\n00:21.400 --> 00:22.900\nI love this club.\n\n00:22.900 --> 00:23.900\nI love this city.\n\n00:23.900 --> 00:25.900\nI love all of you already.\n\n00:25.900 --> 00:31.900\nI've got some very good news for you.\n\n00:31.900 --> 00:36.900\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:36.900 --> 00:41.900\nI'm Jeff Davis, but won't you more importantly welcome the mayor of Harmontown to the stage,\n\n00:41.900 --> 00:49.900\nMr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:49.900 --> 00:55.900\nSan Francisco to the Frisco, seein' free and fucked your momma so hard, she thought my name wasn't Dan.\n\n00:55.900 --> 00:57.900\nShe said, is your name Jeff?\n\n00:57.900 --> 00:58.900\nI said no, it's not.\n\n00:58.900 --> 01:01.900\nI fucked your momma so hard, her nose started to blow stuck.\n\n01:01.900 --> 01:03.900\nI gave her a cold when my dad got told.\n\n01:03.900 --> 01:05.900\nI fucked your momma so cold.\n\n01:05.900 --> 01:07.900\nI fucked your momma.\n\n01:07.900 --> 01:09.900\nI fucked your momma in San Francisco.\n\n01:09.900 --> 01:12.900\nI fucked your momma wet as Frisco.\n\n01:12.900 --> 01:15.900\nI fucked your momma cause she slipped and slid.\n\n01:15.900 --> 01:18.900\nI fucked your momma, that's what I did.\n\n01:18.900 --> 01:20.900\nI fucked your momma from the bay to the coast.\n\n01:20.900 --> 01:25.900\nI fucked your momma so hard, she thought her name was Donnie Most.\n\n01:25.900 --> 01:29.900\nFrom Happy Days.\n\n01:29.900 --> 01:40.900\nGeneration Gap.\n\n01:40.900 --> 01:48.900\nIs it possible to fuck a momma so hard that she faked her name as Donnie Most?\n\n01:48.900 --> 01:51.900\nWho is Potsy on Happy Days?\n\n01:51.900 --> 01:57.900\nHe played Ralph Mouth.\n\n01:57.900 --> 02:01.900\nAnd you tell me, is my mic okay?\n\n02:01.900 --> 02:06.900\nI'm hot up here already cause I've gained 300 pounds on the tour, which is not a bad thing.\n\n02:06.900 --> 02:08.900\nYou look fantastic.\n\n02:08.900 --> 02:12.900\nI always wear a pinstripe shirt if you gain weight.\n\n02:12.900 --> 02:18.900\nPeople associate stripes with tents and circus.\n\n02:18.900 --> 02:20.900\nDoesn't matter, I don't want to talk about weight.\n\n02:20.900 --> 02:22.900\nI'm proud that I'm fat.\n\n02:22.900 --> 02:25.900\nI'm like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.\n\n02:25.900 --> 02:29.900\nI'm the king of this river.\n\n02:29.900 --> 02:31.900\nYou savages, you worship me.\n\n02:31.900 --> 02:34.900\nYou were not fat at the beginning of this tour.\n\n02:34.900 --> 02:36.900\nYes, that's the point of getting fat.\n\n02:36.900 --> 02:39.900\nYou end fatter than you were.\n\n02:39.900 --> 02:42.900\nIf I was thinner, there would be something dishonest happening.\n\n02:42.900 --> 02:46.900\nI would have been on tour and I would have been going, I'll just have the salad.\n\n02:46.900 --> 02:49.900\nI ate the country.\n\n02:49.900 --> 02:55.900\nLike Pac-Man.\n\n02:55.900 --> 02:59.900\nAnd y'all are the ghosts.\n\n02:59.900 --> 03:01.900\nAnd you're blue tonight.\n\n03:01.900 --> 03:04.900\nAnd you ain't blinking yet.\n\n03:04.900 --> 03:07.900\nAgain, generation gap.\n\n03:07.900 --> 03:15.900\nSan Francisco, Jeff, our favorite city in the whole country.\n\n03:15.900 --> 03:17.900\nThese guys, not really from San Francisco.\n\n03:17.900 --> 03:21.900\nThese guys, is that how they...\n\n03:21.900 --> 03:23.900\nOkay, let's check in.\n\n03:23.900 --> 03:25.900\nIt's a lot about our towners though because it's sketch fest.\n\n03:25.900 --> 03:27.900\nWe're at the punchline.\n\n03:27.900 --> 03:29.900\nI've always wanted to be on stage here.\n\n03:29.900 --> 03:30.900\nThis is amazing.\n\n03:30.900 --> 03:35.900\nWe've been performing metaphorically at the set up our entire lives.\n\n03:35.900 --> 03:37.900\nOh, right.\n\n03:37.900 --> 03:39.900\nI got you.\n\n03:39.900 --> 03:42.900\nWe finally get to figure out what the point is tonight.\n\n03:42.900 --> 03:49.900\nI think it's more San Francisco this way because you got booed over here for that joke.\n\n03:49.900 --> 03:51.900\nThat guy comes here every night.\n\n03:51.900 --> 03:53.900\nWhat does that say about him?\n\n03:53.900 --> 03:56.900\nIt's not like Greg Proups is going to be up here.\n\n03:56.900 --> 03:59.900\nGreg Proups is not going to show up.\n\n03:59.900 --> 04:01.900\nSaturday, just yell out Saturday.\n\n04:01.900 --> 04:02.900\nI don't care.\n\n04:02.900 --> 04:04.900\nThat guy's name is Saturday.\n\n04:04.900 --> 04:05.900\nNow, Dan...\n\n04:05.900 --> 04:06.900\nHe's here with his family.\n\n04:06.900 --> 04:07.900\nThey take him out on weekends.\n\n04:07.900 --> 04:08.900\nSaturday!\n\n04:08.900 --> 04:10.900\nSaturday, you want to play with your truck?\n\n04:10.900 --> 04:12.900\nSaturday!\n\n04:12.900 --> 04:14.900\nSaturday, you want to play with your truck?\n\n04:14.900 --> 04:15.900\nSaturday!\n\n04:15.900 --> 04:17.900\nDan, I know that you're not...\n\n04:17.900 --> 04:19.900\nYou don't like sports.\n\n04:19.900 --> 04:21.900\nYou don't know much about them.\n\n04:21.900 --> 04:33.900\nBut I do know that it's time for Sports Corner with Dan Harmon.\n\n04:33.900 --> 04:34.900\nWait, wait.\n\n04:34.900 --> 04:35.900\nI got the wrong one.\n\n04:35.900 --> 04:36.900\nThere it is.\n\n04:36.900 --> 04:37.900\nNot in my opinion.\n\n04:37.900 --> 04:38.900\nAll right.\n\n04:38.900 --> 04:39.900\nA smooth sports corner.\n\n04:39.900 --> 04:40.900\nAll right.\n\n04:40.900 --> 04:41.900\nA smooth sports corner.\n\n04:41.900 --> 04:42.900\nIt's a sports...\n\n04:42.900 --> 04:43.900\nA sports bevel.\n\n04:43.900 --> 04:44.900\nThere you go.\n\n04:44.900 --> 04:45.900\nHello, everybody.\n\n04:45.900 --> 04:51.900\nWelcome to Smooth Sports Corner.\n\n04:51.900 --> 04:52.900\nSmooth.\n\n04:52.900 --> 04:55.900\nWith your pinstriped toast, Dan Harmon.\n\n04:55.900 --> 04:56.900\nSmooth.\n\n04:56.900 --> 04:58.900\nWho says a corner has to be hard?\n\n04:58.900 --> 05:00.900\nWho says it has to poke out like a glass shot?\n\n05:00.900 --> 05:02.900\nA sports corner can be soft.\n\n05:02.900 --> 05:03.900\nPoke into you softly.\n\n05:03.900 --> 05:05.900\nA sports corner gonna...\n\n05:05.900 --> 05:08.900\nFuck you.\n\n05:08.900 --> 05:09.900\nBut soft.\n\n05:09.900 --> 05:14.900\nSo, Dan, Super Bowl Sunday is coming up.\n\n05:14.900 --> 05:15.900\nWho do you like?\n\n05:15.900 --> 05:16.900\nBig day?\n\n05:16.900 --> 05:17.900\nBig Sunday?\n\n05:17.900 --> 05:18.900\nYeah.\n\n05:18.900 --> 05:26.900\nWhich of the two teams playing in the Super Bowl do you favor?\n\n05:26.900 --> 05:28.900\nI mean, look.\n\n05:28.900 --> 05:33.900\nWe got two Titans coming up to...\n\n05:33.900 --> 05:35.900\nBut not the Titans.\n\n05:35.900 --> 05:36.900\nNot the team.\n\n05:36.900 --> 05:37.900\nNo, no, no.\n\n05:37.900 --> 05:39.900\nI just mean two veritable giants.\n\n05:39.900 --> 05:42.900\nThe giants are not in the Super Bowl.\n\n05:42.900 --> 05:45.900\nNo, Jeff, you're getting hung up on pedantic details.\n\n05:45.900 --> 05:47.900\nI'm a bigger sports fan than you.\n\n05:47.900 --> 05:49.900\nI'm talking mythically.\n\n05:49.900 --> 05:52.900\nI'm saying these two large forces, athletically.\n\n05:52.900 --> 05:53.900\nWho do you like, though, Dan?\n\n05:53.900 --> 05:55.900\nWell, I like them both, Jeff.\n\n05:55.900 --> 05:59.900\nIt's called the Super Bowl, not the mundane Bowl.\n\n05:59.900 --> 06:01.900\nI enjoy both of them.\n\n06:01.900 --> 06:05.900\nI think they both enjoy to be honored and compete with each other.\n\n06:05.900 --> 06:14.900\nWe are at a rare 50-yard line on a battlefield, Jeff.\n\n06:14.900 --> 06:18.900\nIt's not just a football field, it's a battlefield between two armies.\n\n06:18.900 --> 06:21.900\nWhich teams do you think are in the Super Bowl?\n\n06:21.900 --> 06:32.900\nI think, Jeff, that when you look at the conferences and the way that they've proceeded\n\n06:32.900 --> 06:38.900\nfrom wide to narrow, with each all-star going to a new conference star,\n\n06:38.900 --> 06:42.900\nto a bracket, and then finally to the finalists.\n\n06:42.900 --> 06:43.900\nCertainly.\n\n06:43.900 --> 06:47.900\nYou're looking at two huge, huge talents.\n\n06:47.900 --> 06:51.900\nBut if I go to Vegas, Dan, if I go to Vegas and want to lay a bet\n\n06:51.900 --> 06:57.900\nbetween two teams in the Super Bowl, which two teams would I be betting on?\n\n06:57.900 --> 07:00.900\nI would put my money.\n\n07:00.900 --> 07:05.900\nAnd I'm going to tell you right now, we're in San Francisco.\n\n07:05.900 --> 07:13.900\nRight, but you said the Giants weren't in the Super Bowl.\n\n07:13.900 --> 07:15.900\nThat's what you said.\n\n07:15.900 --> 07:17.900\nThe Giants played baseball.\n\n07:17.900 --> 07:18.900\nOkay.\n\n07:18.900 --> 07:20.900\nThe Giants, that's the World Series.\n\n07:20.900 --> 07:24.900\nI was so proud of myself.\n\n07:24.900 --> 07:25.900\nYes.\n\n07:25.900 --> 07:30.900\nThe Giants are a great baseball team who I believe have won the last World Series.\n\n07:30.900 --> 07:37.900\nJeff, let's face it, the 49ers aren't in it either.\n\n07:37.900 --> 07:39.900\nYes, they are.\n\n07:39.900 --> 07:44.900\nI mean, they're not in it spiritually.\n\n07:44.900 --> 07:46.900\nAre you saying they are in it?\n\n07:46.900 --> 07:49.900\nAre you saying I successfully guessed half of the Super Bowl?\n\n07:49.900 --> 07:50.900\nYes.\n\n07:50.900 --> 07:54.900\nThe 49ers, Jeff, are in the Super Bowl.\n\n07:54.900 --> 07:57.900\nI think that much is obvious.\n\n07:57.900 --> 07:59.900\nWell, certainly.\n\n07:59.900 --> 08:02.900\nAnd what do you think about their opponents?\n\n08:02.900 --> 08:05.900\nOh, God, could you ask for a greater battle, Jeff?\n\n08:05.900 --> 08:11.900\nI mean, years, years, the old, the old, the old, like...\n\n08:11.900 --> 08:13.900\nIt's one of the oldest rivalries in sports.\n\n08:13.900 --> 08:16.900\nThe historic rivalry between these teams.\n\n08:16.900 --> 08:19.900\nSan Francisco and the...\n\n08:19.900 --> 08:23.900\nIt's just the fact that the 49ers are playing the...\n\n08:23.900 --> 08:25.900\nWhere are the San Francisco 49ers?\n\n08:25.900 --> 08:26.900\nThey're from Maryland.\n\n08:26.900 --> 08:29.900\nA football team in the Super Bowl, pickaxing away at victory.\n\n08:29.900 --> 08:30.900\nYeah.\n\n08:30.900 --> 08:31.900\nLike, working so hard.\n\n08:31.900 --> 08:36.900\nAnd it's so ironic that the team they'd go up against would also...\n\n08:36.900 --> 08:37.900\nDid you get the metaphor?\n\n08:37.900 --> 08:39.900\nWhat would you call the team, though?\n\n08:39.900 --> 08:43.900\nWhen you're a 49er and you're, like, you're, like, digging away,\n\n08:43.900 --> 08:47.900\nisn't it crazy to think that this thing, this animal...\n\n08:47.900 --> 08:49.900\nAs a bird?\n\n08:49.900 --> 08:50.900\nThis eagle would...\n\n08:50.900 --> 08:51.900\nNo, no, no.\n\n08:51.900 --> 08:53.900\nThis eagle-like creature.\n\n08:53.900 --> 08:54.900\nIt's a darker...\n\n08:54.900 --> 08:55.900\nThis hawk.\n\n08:55.900 --> 08:56.900\nIt's a black bird.\n\n08:56.900 --> 08:57.900\nThis mariner.\n\n08:57.900 --> 08:58.900\nIt's more of a black bird.\n\n08:58.900 --> 08:59.900\nThis pterodactyl.\n\n08:59.900 --> 09:00.900\nIt's like a crow.\n\n09:00.900 --> 09:01.900\nThis...\n\n09:01.900 --> 09:02.900\nIt's closer to a crow.\n\n09:02.900 --> 09:03.900\nRaven?\n\n09:03.900 --> 09:04.900\nRaven?\n\n09:04.900 --> 09:07.900\nThis Seattle raven?\n\n09:07.900 --> 09:09.900\nThis Denver raven?\n\n09:09.900 --> 09:11.900\nIt's the capital of Maryland.\n\n09:11.900 --> 09:13.900\nThis Baltimore raven.\n\n09:13.900 --> 09:15.900\nThere you go.\n\n09:15.900 --> 09:20.900\nTraditionally, like, in mythology, the 49er, even in the stories of our youth,\n\n09:20.900 --> 09:23.900\nis always waving off ravens with his pickaxe.\n\n09:23.900 --> 09:25.900\nGet out of here, you old coot.\n\n09:25.900 --> 09:26.900\nI'm trying to...\n\n09:26.900 --> 09:29.900\nI'm trying to dig the opposite of blackness with my pickaxe,\n\n09:29.900 --> 09:34.900\nand you're a black bird, and you're coming down and trying to get me gold.\n\n09:34.900 --> 09:37.900\nIt's amazing that these fucking Titans giants...\n\n09:37.900 --> 09:40.900\nSo, Dan, where do you put the money line on the...\n\n09:40.900 --> 09:41.900\nHere's the deal.\n\n09:41.900 --> 09:44.900\nWhen you put a 49er against a raven, just as an individual,\n\n09:44.900 --> 09:46.900\ntake one random 49er.\n\n09:46.900 --> 09:47.900\nTake Johnson.\n\n09:47.900 --> 09:48.900\nRight.\n\n09:48.900 --> 09:51.900\nTake the best raven you can.\n\n09:51.900 --> 09:52.900\nI don't care.\n\n09:52.900 --> 09:53.900\nTake Pickens.\n\n09:53.900 --> 09:58.900\nTake Pickens out of the front line, put them up against Johnson.\n\n09:58.900 --> 10:01.900\nCall them the average 49er and the average raven.\n\n10:01.900 --> 10:02.900\nWhat are we looking at?\n\n10:02.900 --> 10:07.900\nWe're looking at offensive yardage and defensive knee icing.\n\n10:07.900 --> 10:09.900\nSo, where do they excel?\n\n10:09.900 --> 10:10.900\nWell, the 49ers...\n\n10:10.900 --> 10:13.900\nAs a gambler, where do I put my money?\n\n10:13.900 --> 10:14.900\nWhat's the spread?\n\n10:14.900 --> 10:17.900\nAlways on the Niners, Jeff, and I call them the Niners for short.\n\n10:17.900 --> 10:20.900\nI don't even bother to say the 49ers because there's no 60 Niners.\n\n10:20.900 --> 10:21.900\nThere's no 30 Niners.\n\n10:21.900 --> 10:23.900\nI call them the Niners.\n\n10:23.900 --> 10:25.900\nI'm a sports fan.\n\n10:25.900 --> 10:27.900\nI'm an inveterated sports bettor.\n\n10:27.900 --> 10:30.900\nNow, do you feel that the Niners quarterback is up to snuff,\n\n10:30.900 --> 10:34.900\nor do you think they should bring in the young rookie off the bench?\n\n10:34.900 --> 10:35.900\nIt's counterintuitive, Jeff.\n\n10:35.900 --> 10:37.900\nIt won't win me any popularity contest,\n\n10:37.900 --> 10:39.900\nbut I say lose the quarterback entirely.\n\n10:39.900 --> 10:41.900\nDon't use him.\n\n10:41.900 --> 10:43.900\nLike, what are we doing out there?\n\n10:43.900 --> 10:46.900\nWe're throwing a ball and we're catching

I know that I know that I've grown to the point where I\n\n41:27.380 --> 41:30.820\nCan't wait to go go look at my mirror at home\n\n41:30.820 --> 41:35.700\nWhich was twice as wide because I get the one in the bus like it's designed for people who fit on the bus\n\n41:35.700 --> 41:39.380\nI know that I know that the amount of sweat pouring out of me\n\n41:39.380 --> 41:43.220\nUh per day is has reached Ron Jeremy proportions\n\n41:44.300 --> 41:49.180\nI've grown biologically. I've grown. I've grown organically\n\n41:56.740 --> 41:58.740\nNo\n\n41:58.740 --> 42:27.020\nI didn't know that Greg even existed. I don't I don't actually exist. I'm an ephemeral me asthma that\n\n42:29.700 --> 42:32.860\nStop stop great poops gonna break troops wrap\n\n42:34.140 --> 42:37.580\nOkay, yeah, have you ever walked through a swamp and seen green, you know\n\n42:38.580 --> 42:42.700\nSwamp gas coming up and you go like what was that for real? That's what it's like\n\n42:45.740 --> 42:48.540\nThat's what it's like to do what to be me\n\n42:48.540 --> 42:57.820\nWhen you enter the punchline when you come to the financial district this late at night and go, it's all in order a\n\n42:58.860 --> 43:01.940\nVery special edition of sports corner with great poops\n\n43:01.940 --> 43:13.900\nAnd then what's going on with your guess great poops\n\n43:18.260 --> 43:19.820\nYou know\n\n43:19.820 --> 43:25.180\nEven though the word the gayest team in the NFL we hate gays the most and that's what makes thank you\n\n43:25.780 --> 43:27.780\nThat's what makes us awesome\n\n43:27.780 --> 43:35.500\nWe apologize for it because we knew it was out of line, but fucking we said it and we didn't really mean it, okay?\n\n43:36.100 --> 43:41.940\nOur gay brothers and sisters help us win this Super Bowl by being there for us and holding our balls\n\n43:43.460 --> 43:50.060\nGreg do you know the two teams that are playing in the Super Bowl Steve? I do I'm uh, the ball\n\n43:50.060 --> 43:53.140\nI don't like your audience unlike your audience\n\n43:53.140 --> 43:57.420\nDan I don't just read graphic novels all day. I I\n\n43:58.580 --> 44:00.580\nParticipate that's right\n\n44:00.820 --> 44:06.260\nStraight white guy world is not a world that I'm unacquainted with I didn't vote for Mitt Romney and yet\n\n44:06.260 --> 44:08.260\nI know some of the things his people know\n\n44:08.900 --> 44:16.020\nFor instance, I know that the Baltimore Ravens who hilariously are named after Edgar Allen Poe who would have been\n\n44:16.740 --> 44:19.860\nAbsolutely stunned and shocked that an NFL team would have his name\n\n44:19.860 --> 44:25.740\nThe Baltimore Ravens for real. Yeah, they should be called the Baltimore of Mankin's\n\n44:26.420 --> 44:33.660\nAs all HL Mankin. Yeah. Yeah while I pondered we can worry once upon a midnight dreary for reals. That's a football team. Okay\n\n44:34.580 --> 44:36.580\nIs it really just because they're Ravens?\n\n44:37.500 --> 44:41.580\nAutomatically is named after as you're on the phone. He's the bar to Baltimore. Yes, I can't think of it\n\n44:42.300 --> 44:47.180\nOkay, all right, and then the Niners my my beloved San Francisco Niners who I've I\n\n44:47.180 --> 44:54.180\nDidn't love them, you know, I'm not a Johnny come lately ever since they won their third Super Bowl. I've been down\n\n44:56.060 --> 45:01.600\nI'm joking a Super Bowl is an event that happens when never mind. You guys don't know in any case\n\n45:03.220 --> 45:07.380\nI don't know if they do or don't I do a bit called Sports Corner where I talk as\n\n45:07.380 --> 45:17.260\nIt's earnestly as I can't about sports and it's funny because I know nothing about sports. That's what's gonna make this awesome\n\n45:21.780 --> 45:27.180\nWe're getting okay new beginning so here we are at Sports Corner\n\n45:31.660 --> 45:35.580\nI think that the 49ers are gonna beat the Ravens and here's why\n\n45:35.580 --> 45:36.940\nI\n\n45:36.940 --> 45:43.860\nThink that that their yardage will be better. I think that though they're doing a Sports Corner where it's as though\n\n45:43.860 --> 45:45.860\nEd Grahlin Poe was doing Sports Corner\n\n45:48.340 --> 45:53.740\nAnd all at Grahlin Poe themed Sports Center and Alex Smith whose head was bleary\n\n45:55.100 --> 45:57.100\nSmashed and smitten\n\n45:57.100 --> 45:58.980\nhorrible and teary and\n\n45:58.980 --> 46:05.900\nYet Keppernick did kiss his guns and upon this day did kiss his guns and many runs and many runs\n\n46:10.220 --> 46:12.220\nVernon Davis\n\n46:12.900 --> 46:14.900\nWith great temerity\n\n46:15.180 --> 46:17.660\nWe did not upon his sincerity\n\n46:18.820 --> 46:22.860\nAnd Alex Smith sat upon the bench his head is spinning the phone of ringing\n\n46:22.860 --> 46:28.380\nThe phone of ringing answer the phone the phone's not ringing, but Alice Smith thought the phone was ringing\n\n46:30.500 --> 46:38.660\nAnd hardball one and hardball two and hardball one and hardball you knew because hardball one was of that crew and\n\n46:38.860 --> 46:41.860\nHardball two was of you two and\n\n46:42.460 --> 46:48.300\nWe knew that hardball would say run there run. Oh negro in the field\n\n46:48.300 --> 46:52.820\nAnd the negro is running and the ball would be\n\n47:01.540 --> 47:07.420\nGreg since we have you here it's been a long time am I here? All right. How am I doing? All right? Yeah\n\n47:08.180 --> 47:10.180\nAre you in town?\n\n47:10.380 --> 47:15.500\nMaybe we could play since we have you and we have Steve Agee and we have Spencer. Maybe we could do a little\n\n47:15.500 --> 47:18.180\nLittle D&D. Let's get it on\n\n47:19.900 --> 47:21.900\nYeah\n\n47:22.460 --> 47:27.220\nErin McGathy back to the stage Erin McGathy, is Aaron still here?\n\n47:28.820 --> 47:30.820\nAaron could you\n\n47:33.780 --> 47:36.020\nPlease seven microphones\n\n47:37.260 --> 47:39.260\nThere you go\n\n47:39.260 --> 47:48.480\nUh, Lauren and Brian, I'm so sorry all this pressure. Okay good. What pressure? Oh, I missed that\n\n47:49.260 --> 47:50.900\nI\n\n47:50.900 --> 47:55.260\nSet them up during the show and when I was backstage it sounded like they were they're being made to have sex on stage\n\n47:55.740 --> 47:57.740\nin front of everyone did they\n\n47:58.580 --> 48:00.580\nOh, how disappointing\n\n48:01.380 --> 48:07.460\nLauren you've ever been to Amsterdam you can see that and it's extraordinarily disappointing\n\n48:07.460 --> 48:15.860\nThere really is nothing more disappointing than two people copulating in front of you unless it's been recorded on film by Czechslovakian coke slaves\n\n48:16.700 --> 48:18.700\nThen it's always titillating\n\n48:19.460 --> 48:21.460\nWho's with me?\n\n48:23.500 --> 48:28.380\nGreg the last time that Dan and I were here we watched your show Dan and I did and Jeff and afterwards\n\n48:28.380 --> 48:32.500\nIt was the first time that Dan and I said I love you to each other after your show here. I\n\n48:32.500 --> 48:38.620\nDon't want to say that my show's a cataclysmic event that forces people to realize their deepest emotional needs\n\n48:39.620 --> 48:45.980\nBut in this instance, I think it did precipitate a little bit of what only can be described now as an internal\n\n48:47.340 --> 48:49.340\nAlois and Abelard love\n\n48:49.740 --> 48:58.100\nWhere letters will be writ. I hope that's good in future. Alois and Abelard were in a graphic novel a couple years ago\n\n48:58.100 --> 49:00.100\nSpencer\n\n49:03.780 --> 49:09.100\nWe've forced you now to probably call a couple audibles and bring am I the only one who's been drinking?\n\n49:11.740 --> 49:18.500\nWhat do you think have you heard me hit one constant the entire night did you just say confident? Yes\n\n49:18.500 --> 49:25.540\nGreg if I find out you've been smoking dope or doing any fucking alcohol. What do you do?\n\n49:29.900 --> 49:37.460\nIt's like it's it's like a party of friends and family. That's all I've been doing. It's sketch fast. We don't get paid\n\n49:40.420 --> 49:43.180\nWe don't get paid, right? No, no, all right Spencer\n\n49:43.180 --> 49:49.620\nAh, do your best or do your worst bring us up to date and our campaign if you if you would\n\n49:51.700 --> 49:56.820\nWhen we last met the party was still trapped in the confines of the infinite fish\n\n49:57.460 --> 50:04.700\nAfter taking out a lung and destroying the kidney the party took on a tricky slime and discovered a magical and bloody book\n\n50:06.180 --> 50:07.540\nAll right\n\n50:07.540 --> 50:14.700\nSliding through a sphincter the group faced off with a beast's heart guarded by an ice dock tentacles and gas venting tubes\n\n50:15.220 --> 50:23.060\nThe fight grew fierce and our heroes were wounded in the shadow of desperation Jeff learned that his mysterious dagger was intelligent and could talk\n\n50:26.140 --> 50:30.360\nRegrouping against the nefarious organ system our heroes face down their fleshy\n\n50:30.360 --> 50:38.920\nThe wounded heart thumps loudly as the whole fish quakes wildly you feel sickened from the orange powder drifting through the air from the\n\n50:38.920 --> 50:47.160\nCeiling the ice stock reopens its injured eye the tendril gardening of the organ whips around wildly. It is time to fight\n\n50:49.040 --> 50:51.040\nEverybody Spencer\n\n50:52.760 --> 50:54.760\nWow\n\n50:54.760 --> 51:01.080\nI want to I want to you warned us in the green room that we need to like\n\n51:02.080 --> 51:06.360\nHit point up because we're about to die. Yeah, I guys want your character sheets\n\n51:07.480 --> 51:14.840\nGet the character heat out. I take my magical shards out my crystals, and I use them to heal up the group\n\n51:15.480 --> 51:21.240\nI take my healing crystals out to pulling the healing frisk crystals from your satchel\n\n51:21.240 --> 51:25.160\nYou rub them on your body before tossing them towards your teammates\n\n51:25.640 --> 51:31.160\nThere are people who there are people who know how to play D&D who listen to us play and who are keen to the fact that what\n\n51:31.160 --> 51:33.400\nWe're playing is a kind of a latent version of it\n\n51:33.400 --> 51:37.920\nBut they and they sometimes ask do you guys are is it possible for you to die?\n\n51:37.920 --> 51:42.760\nWhat would Spencer do? Is he just keeping you alive? He told us backstage. You're about to die\n\n51:42.880 --> 51:48.360\nYou I require you to heal yourselves when we start the next round. It's important\n\n51:48.360 --> 51:55.680\nI I take I take out my loot and I I start strumming chords and I know that I can't summon animals\n\n51:55.680 --> 51:57.680\nI can speak to them and yet I\n\n51:58.720 --> 52:01.960\nTry my hardest as a known barbarian with my magical loot\n\n52:01.960 --> 52:18.200\nTo play a song that will summon a unicorn to come to our aid\n\n52:18.200 --> 52:32.600\nWhat summoning is this? What festive music do I hear upon my ears like a thousand arboreal butterflies sent into my oral faculties?\n\n52:32.600 --> 52:35.000\nWhat gay wind blows?\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:50.880\nBecause I come here there from Harky bulgy wood and oh my god the purple darkness stuff enveloped me and now once again\n\n52:51.040 --> 52:56.640\nInto the pink light. I am born how grateful I am to see thee once again all the three\n\n52:56.640 --> 53:01.840\nI and I'm so happy to see you since we last met I put on a belt now. I'm a woman\n\n53:01.840 --> 53:10.040\nNot only are you a woman. You are boomedroculus and even in my anodyne a unicorn state\n\n53:10.040 --> 53:13.160\nWhich is ambisexual a giant horn.
