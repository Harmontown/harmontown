WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.400
It truly is an honor to be on stage here at the Punchline.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.900
I love this club.

00:22.900 --> 00:23.900
I love this city.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.900
I love all of you already.

00:25.900 --> 00:31.900
I've got some very good news for you.

00:31.900 --> 00:36.900
Harmontown is now in session.

00:36.900 --> 00:41.900
I'm Jeff Davis, but won't you more importantly welcome the mayor of Harmontown to the stage,

00:41.900 --> 00:49.900
Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:49.900 --> 00:55.900
San Francisco to the Frisco, seein' free and fucked your momma so hard, she thought my name wasn't Dan.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.900
She said, is your name Jeff?

00:57.900 --> 00:58.900
I said no, it's not.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.900
I fucked your momma so hard, her nose started to blow stuck.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.900
I gave her a cold when my dad got told.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.900
I fucked your momma so cold.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.900
I fucked your momma.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.900
I fucked your momma in San Francisco.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.900
I fucked your momma wet as Frisco.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.900
I fucked your momma cause she slipped and slid.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.900
I fucked your momma, that's what I did.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.900
I fucked your momma from the bay to the coast.

01:20.900 --> 01:25.900
I fucked your momma so hard, she thought her name was Donnie Most.

01:25.900 --> 01:29.900
From Happy Days.

01:29.900 --> 01:40.900
Generation Gap.

01:40.900 --> 01:48.900
Is it possible to fuck a momma so hard that she faked her name as Donnie Most?

01:48.900 --> 01:51.900
Who is Potsy on Happy Days?

01:51.900 --> 01:57.900
He played Ralph Mouth.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.900
And you tell me, is my mic okay?

02:01.900 --> 02:06.900
I'm hot up here already cause I've gained 300 pounds on the tour, which is not a bad thing.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.900
You look fantastic.

02:08.900 --> 02:12.900
I always wear a pinstripe shirt if you gain weight.

02:12.900 --> 02:18.900
People associate stripes with tents and circus.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.900
Doesn't matter, I don't want to talk about weight.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.900
I'm proud that I'm fat.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.900
I'm like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.

02:25.900 --> 02:29.900
I'm the king of this river.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.900
You savages, you worship me.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.900
You were not fat at the beginning of this tour.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.900
Yes, that's the point of getting fat.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.900
You end fatter than you were.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.900
If I was thinner, there would be something dishonest happening.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.900
I would have been on tour and I would have been going, I'll just have the salad.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.900
I ate the country.

02:49.900 --> 02:55.900
Like Pac-Man.

02:55.900 --> 02:59.900
And y'all are the ghosts.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.900
And you're blue tonight.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.900
And you ain't blinking yet.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.900
Again, generation gap.

03:07.900 --> 03:15.900
San Francisco, Jeff, our favorite city in the whole country.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.900
These guys, not really from San Francisco.

03:17.900 --> 03:21.900
These guys, is that how they...

03:21.900 --> 03:23.900
Okay, let's check in.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.900
It's a lot about our towners though because it's sketch fest.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.900
We're at the punchline.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.900
I've always wanted to be on stage here.

03:29.900 --> 03:30.900
This is amazing.

03:30.900 --> 03:35.900
We've been performing metaphorically at the set up our entire lives.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.900
Oh, right.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.900
I got you.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.900
We finally get to figure out what the point is tonight.

03:42.900 --> 03:49.900
I think it's more San Francisco this way because you got booed over here for that joke.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.900
That guy comes here every night.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.900
What does that say about him?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.900
It's not like Greg Proups is going to be up here.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.900
Greg Proups is not going to show up.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.900
Saturday, just yell out Saturday.

04:01.900 --> 04:02.900
I don't care.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.900
That guy's name is Saturday.

04:04.900 --> 04:05.900
Now, Dan...

04:05.900 --> 04:06.900
He's here with his family.

04:06.900 --> 04:07.900
They take him out on weekends.

04:07.900 --> 04:08.900
Saturday!

04:08.900 --> 04:10.900
Saturday, you want to play with your truck?

04:10.900 --> 04:12.900
Saturday!

04:12.900 --> 04:14.900
Saturday, you want to play with your truck?

04:14.900 --> 04:15.900
Saturday!

04:15.900 --> 04:17.900
Dan, I know that you're not...

04:17.900 --> 04:19.900
You don't like sports.

04:19.900 --> 04:21.900
You don't know much about them.

04:21.900 --> 04:33.900
But I do know that it's time for Sports Corner with Dan Harmon.

04:33.900 --> 04:34.900
Wait, wait.

04:34.900 --> 04:35.900
I got the wrong one.

04:35.900 --> 04:36.900
There it is.

04:36.900 --> 04:37.900
Not in my opinion.

04:37.900 --> 04:38.900
All right.

04:38.900 --> 04:39.900
A smooth sports corner.

04:39.900 --> 04:40.900
All right.

04:40.900 --> 04:41.900
A smooth sports corner.

04:41.900 --> 04:42.900
It's a sports...

04:42.900 --> 04:43.900
A sports bevel.

04:43.900 --> 04:44.900
There you go.

04:44.900 --> 04:45.900
Hello, everybody.

04:45.900 --> 04:51.900
Welcome to Smooth Sports Corner.

04:51.900 --> 04:52.900
Smooth.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.900
With your pinstriped toast, Dan Harmon.

04:55.900 --> 04:56.900
Smooth.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.900
Who says a corner has to be hard?

04:58.900 --> 05:00.900
Who says it has to poke out like a glass shot?

05:00.900 --> 05:02.900
A sports corner can be soft.

05:02.900 --> 05:03.900
Poke into you softly.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.900
A sports corner gonna...

05:05.900 --> 05:08.900
Fuck you.

05:08.900 --> 05:09.900
But soft.

05:09.900 --> 05:14.900
So, Dan, Super Bowl Sunday is coming up.

05:14.900 --> 05:15.900
Who do you like?

05:15.900 --> 05:16.900
Big day?

05:16.900 --> 05:17.900
Big Sunday?

05:17.900 --> 05:18.900
Yeah.

05:18.900 --> 05:26.900
Which of the two teams playing in the Super Bowl do you favor?

05:26.900 --> 05:28.900
I mean, look.

05:28.900 --> 05:33.900
We got two Titans coming up to...

05:33.900 --> 05:35.900
But not the Titans.

05:35.900 --> 05:36.900
Not the team.

05:36.900 --> 05:37.900
No, no, no.

05:37.900 --> 05:39.900
I just mean two veritable giants.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.900
The giants are not in the Super Bowl.

05:42.900 --> 05:45.900
No, Jeff, you're getting hung up on pedantic details.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.900
I'm a bigger sports fan than you.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.900
I'm talking mythically.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.900
I'm saying these two large forces, athletically.

05:52.900 --> 05:53.900
Who do you like, though, Dan?

05:53.900 --> 05:55.900
Well, I like them both, Jeff.

05:55.900 --> 05:59.900
It's called the Super Bowl, not the mundane Bowl.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.900
I enjoy both of them.

06:01.900 --> 06:05.900
I think they both enjoy to be honored and compete with each other.

06:05.900 --> 06:14.900
We are at a rare 50-yard line on a battlefield, Jeff.

06:14.900 --> 06:18.900
It's not just a football field, it's a battlefield between two armies.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.900
Which teams do you think are in the Super Bowl?

06:21.900 --> 06:32.900
I think, Jeff, that when you look at the conferences and the way that they've proceeded

06:32.900 --> 06:38.900
from wide to narrow, with each all-star going to a new conference star,

06:38.900 --> 06:42.900
to a bracket, and then finally to the finalists.

06:42.900 --> 06:43.900
Certainly.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.900
You're looking at two huge, huge talents.

06:47.900 --> 06:51.900
But if I go to Vegas, Dan, if I go to Vegas and want to lay a bet

06:51.900 --> 06:57.900
between two teams in the Super Bowl, which two teams would I be betting on?

06:57.900 --> 07:00.900
I would put my money.

07:00.900 --> 07:05.900
And I'm going to tell you right now, we're in San Francisco.

07:05.900 --> 07:13.900
Right, but you said the Giants weren't in the Super Bowl.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.900
That's what you said.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.900
The Giants played baseball.

07:17.900 --> 07:18.900
Okay.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.900
The Giants, that's the World Series.

07:20.900 --> 07:24.900
I was so proud of myself.

07:24.900 --> 07:25.900
Yes.

07:25.900 --> 07:30.900
The Giants are a great baseball team who I believe have won the last World Series.

07:30.900 --> 07:37.900
Jeff, let's face it, the 49ers aren't in it either.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.900
Yes, they are.

07:39.900 --> 07:44.900
I mean, they're not in it spiritually.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.900
Are you saying they are in it?

07:46.900 --> 07:49.900
Are you saying I successfully guessed half of the Super Bowl?

07:49.900 --> 07:50.900
Yes.

07:50.900 --> 07:54.900
The 49ers, Jeff, are in the Super Bowl.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.900
I think that much is obvious.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.900
Well, certainly.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.900
And what do you think about their opponents?

08:02.900 --> 08:05.900
Oh, God, could you ask for a greater battle, Jeff?

08:05.900 --> 08:11.900
I mean, years, years, the old, the old, the old, like...

08:11.900 --> 08:13.900
It's one of the oldest rivalries in sports.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.900
The historic rivalry between these teams.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.900
San Francisco and the...

08:19.900 --> 08:23.900
It's just the fact that the 49ers are playing the...

08:23.900 --> 08:25.900
Where are the San Francisco 49ers?

08:25.900 --> 08:26.900
They're from Maryland.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.900
A football team in the Super Bowl, pickaxing away at victory.

08:29.900 --> 08:30.900
Yeah.

08:30.900 --> 08:31.900
Like, working so hard.

08:31.900 --> 08:36.900
And it's so ironic that the team they'd go up against would also...

08:36.900 --> 08:37.900
Did you get the metaphor?

08:37.900 --> 08:39.900
What would you call the team, though?

08:39.900 --> 08:43.900
When you're a 49er and you're, like, you're, like, digging away,

08:43.900 --> 08:47.900
isn't it crazy to think that this thing, this animal...

08:47.900 --> 08:49.900
As a bird?

08:49.900 --> 08:50.900
This eagle would...

08:50.900 --> 08:51.900
No, no, no.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.900
This eagle-like creature.

08:53.900 --> 08:54.900
It's a darker...

08:54.900 --> 08:55.900
This hawk.

08:55.900 --> 08:56.900
It's a black bird.

08:56.900 --> 08:57.900
This mariner.

08:57.900 --> 08:58.900
It's more of a black bird.

08:58.900 --> 08:59.900
This pterodactyl.

08:59.900 --> 09:00.900
It's like a crow.

09:00.900 --> 09:01.900
This...

09:01.900 --> 09:02.900
It's closer to a crow.

09:02.900 --> 09:03.900
Raven?

09:03.900 --> 09:04.900
Raven?

09:04.900 --> 09:07.900
This Seattle raven?

09:07.900 --> 09:09.900
This Denver raven?

09:09.900 --> 09:11.900
It's the capital of Maryland.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.900
This Baltimore raven.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.900
There you go.

09:15.900 --> 09:20.900
Traditionally, like, in mythology, the 49er, even in the stories of our youth,

09:20.900 --> 09:23.900
is always waving off ravens with his pickaxe.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.900
Get out of here, you old coot.

09:25.900 --> 09:26.900
I'm trying to...

09:26.900 --> 09:29.900
I'm trying to dig the opposite of blackness with my pickaxe,

09:29.900 --> 09:34.900
and you're a black bird, and you're coming down and trying to get me gold.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.900
It's amazing that these fucking Titans giants...

09:37.900 --> 09:40.900
So, Dan, where do you put the money line on the...

09:40.900 --> 09:41.900
Here's the deal.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.900
When you put a 49er against a raven, just as an individual,

09:44.900 --> 09:46.900
take one random 49er.

09:46.900 --> 09:47.900
Take Johnson.

09:47.900 --> 09:48.900
Right.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.900
Take the best raven you can.

09:51.900 --> 09:52.900
I don't care.

09:52.900 --> 09:53.900
Take Pickens.

09:53.900 --> 09:58.900
Take Pickens out of the front line, put them up against Johnson.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.900
Call them the average 49er and the average raven.

10:01.900 --> 10:02.900
What are we looking at?

10:02.900 --> 10:07.900
We're looking at offensive yardage and defensive knee icing.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.900
So, where do they excel?

10:09.900 --> 10:10.900
Well, the 49ers...

10:10.900 --> 10:13.900
As a gambler, where do I put my money?

10:13.900 --> 10:14.900
What's the spread?

10:14.900 --> 10:17.900
Always on the Niners, Jeff, and I call them the Niners for short.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.900
I don't even bother to say the 49ers because there's no 60 Niners.

10:20.900 --> 10:21.900
There's no 30 Niners.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.900
I call them the Niners.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.900
I'm a sports fan.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.900
I'm an inveterated sports bettor.

10:27.900 --> 10:30.900
Now, do you feel that the Niners quarterback is up to snuff,

10:30.900 --> 10:34.900
or do you think they should bring in the young rookie off the bench?

10:34.900 --> 10:35.900
It's counterintuitive, Jeff.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.900
It won't win me any popularity contest,

10:37.900 --> 10:39.900
but I say lose the quarterback entirely.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.900
Don't use him.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.900
Like, what are we doing out there?

10:43.900 --> 10:46.900
We're throwing a ball and we're catching it and we're getting tackled every time.

10:46.900 --> 10:50.900
What precedes every tackle on the Raven side of things?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.900
It's a pass.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.900
It's a hike.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.900
It's a touchdown.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.900
It's a scrimmage.

10:58.900 --> 11:02.900
Back it up to the root of the quarterback.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.900
Sports Corner with Dan Harmon, everybody.

11:05.900 --> 11:09.900
Get rid of the quarterback and you've got a safe game.

11:09.900 --> 11:10.900
Sports Corner.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.900
Play it scrimmage for scrimmage down the top.

11:13.900 --> 11:17.900
See you by Tito's vodka.

11:17.900 --> 11:22.900
Tito's the vodka of vodka.

11:22.900 --> 11:26.900
Lease it up.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.900
Dan, you were already out on stage before the show.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.900
Yeah, I felt them out.

11:31.900 --> 11:32.900
On another show.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.900
And I thought there's a couple out here that was patched together by Erin McGathy

11:35.900 --> 11:37.900
in an ungodly manner.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.900
Brian and Lauren, right?

11:39.900 --> 11:44.900
Erin McGathy hooked up a serial womanizer with a self-proclaimed slut.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.900
I'm allowed to say that.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.900
You called yourself a slut.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.900
She hooked them up and they're going to watch Harmon.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.900
Have you guys made out yet?

11:52.900 --> 11:55.900
Can you make out right now?

11:55.900 --> 11:57.900
I don't know. That's not...

11:57.900 --> 11:59.900
Just fucking make out.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.900
This isn't New Orleans.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.900
San Francisco.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.900
Say what?

12:06.900 --> 12:07.900
Right, right.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.900
Well, do you want to come up? Just give us a quick report.

12:09.900 --> 12:10.900
Can you come up real quick?

12:10.900 --> 12:11.900
Lauren.

12:11.900 --> 12:12.900
If you want to. It's okay.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.900
Lauren, everybody.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.900
Just because we can't hear.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.900
It's John and Lauren. Is that it?

12:20.900 --> 12:21.900
Brian.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.900
Brian and Lauren. Okay.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.900
Close enough when you have a fucking chair.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.900
Well, I'm a Dan. I understand.

12:28.900 --> 12:32.900
It's like, Tim, name yourself Squid or something.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.900
If you want me to remember your name.

12:34.900 --> 12:39.900
If you intend to invent helium or something,

12:39.900 --> 12:41.900
be a Dave. Go ahead.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.900
But invent helium.

12:43.900 --> 12:46.900
Hey, my name is Ryan. Hey, Ryan, what do you do?

12:46.900 --> 12:49.900
I'm just standing here.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.900
Well, then I think you might be Steve.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.900
I'm Dan.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.900
I get it. I get it.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.900
We have a problem with naming in this country.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.900
The people that invented naming human beings

13:02.900 --> 13:06.900
didn't anticipate this population density, Jeff.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.900
The people that invented graveyards,

13:08.900 --> 13:09.900
you can see what we do.

13:09.900 --> 13:12.900
We put a headstone and there's a whole six-foot plot.

13:12.900 --> 13:16.900
Like, we didn't know there would be six billion people.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.900
We got to change our shit up, man.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.900
How are you guys doing tonight?

13:21.900 --> 13:22.900
Pretty good. Pretty good.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.900
I got a little drunk before the show.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.900
Good. That's how we like you.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.900
Before the show, you've been drunk for two weeks.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.900
It's all built up.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.900
I think I ate a giant cookie.

13:32.900 --> 13:35.900
Martha brought a fan named Martha.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.900
Oh, there you are. She brought a hot cookie.

13:38.900 --> 13:42.900
Camera crew put a camera in her boyfriend's head.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.900
That's what you get for your troubles.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.900
The hot cookie released from my spleen

13:47.900 --> 13:50.900
all of the alcohol for the last two weeks, Jeff.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.900
Alright, so Brian, Laura, you guys met earlier

13:52.900 --> 13:54.900
during Aaron's show, right?

13:54.900 --> 13:58.900
Can you guys see okay? Didn't think so.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.900
So, uh...

14:08.900 --> 14:11.900
So, Brian,

14:11.900 --> 14:16.900
what are the chances that you and Lauren make out tonight?

14:16.900 --> 14:17.900
I'm going to be...

14:17.900 --> 14:19.900
I want to be modest here.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.900
About 95%.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.900
Nice.

14:24.900 --> 14:28.900
So, it's almost... it's a lead pipe cinch.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.900
It's in the bag, you're saying.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.900
I want to say in the bag, like I said,

14:33.900 --> 14:35.900
5%, a lot can happen in that 5%.

14:35.900 --> 14:36.900
Right, but 95%.

14:36.900 --> 14:39.900
Lauren, what do you think?

14:39.900 --> 14:41.900
I would be hesitant to put a number on it,

14:41.900 --> 14:43.900
because the truth is, is that I came here

14:43.900 --> 14:45.900
wanting to make out with Spencer.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.900
That's sort of my...

14:47.900 --> 14:49.900
That's sort of my, like, MO...

14:49.900 --> 14:51.900
No offense!

14:51.900 --> 14:53.900
No offense!

14:53.900 --> 14:56.900
Hello, Spencer, to the stage.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.900
You hear your name.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.900
It boasts by a tempress.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.900
Your bag of holding holds your bag,

15:08.900 --> 15:11.900
but will it hold your bagging?

15:12.900 --> 15:15.900
Hello, Spencer.

15:15.900 --> 15:23.900
It's good to be back in California!

15:23.900 --> 15:25.900
That was, like, the minimal effort required

15:25.900 --> 15:27.900
to get you guys to do that.

15:27.900 --> 15:28.900
Spencer...

15:28.900 --> 15:29.900
You figured it out.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.900
You're a master of the tour.

15:31.900 --> 15:35.900
I have to take my shirt off in Portland.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.900
Why are you kneeling right now?

15:37.900 --> 15:39.900
Because I feel bad for these people.

15:39.900 --> 15:40.900
They paid 20 bucks.

15:40.900 --> 15:41.900
Fuck them.

15:41.900 --> 15:42.900
Fuck them.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.900
Fuck these people, Jeff. Hey, what's your name?

15:45.900 --> 15:47.900
Ryan.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.900
They're human beings, Jeff.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.900
Giraffe rap.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.900
Giraffe rap.

15:58.900 --> 15:59.900
I'm eating a leaf.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.900
Gotta go real high to get jumped to my treat.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.900
I got a long neck from Charles Darwin.

16:04.900 --> 16:07.900
I want to fuck your mama like it was a hard win.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.900
Put my neck in her pussy.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.900
It's not my neck.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.900
Jerry Busy.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.900
Giraffe rap.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.900
Alright.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.900
Did you hear the audience realize he...

16:22.900 --> 16:24.900
Oh, he's that dick a bit. He's really drunk.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.900
They're like, oh, shit.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.900
You have been drunker on this tour.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.900
In this corner, alcohol!

16:33.900 --> 16:38.900
Weighing in disproportionately!

16:38.900 --> 16:42.900
In this corner, let's get ready to mumble!

16:46.900 --> 16:50.900
Alright, so Lauren, you were saying you wanted to make out with Spencer?

16:50.900 --> 16:51.900
Yeah, yeah.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.900
He's right over there, fucking make it happen.

16:54.900 --> 16:55.900
Get it on.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.900
I don't want to rape him.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.900
Sitting across a table,

17:04.900 --> 17:08.900
looking rather taxful of dice.

17:08.900 --> 17:12.900
Doesn't it feel like a little bullish, though, to have Spencer?

17:12.900 --> 17:13.900
Well, how does Spencer feel?

17:13.900 --> 17:16.900
Yeah, no, that's the thing. I don't just want to attack.

17:16.900 --> 17:20.900
It feels like a weird, like, like, like, like, like, like porkies movie.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.900
They're like, do what you make out with them.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.900
Wrap your tits on Spencer.

17:25.900 --> 17:30.900
Hey, Spencer, you scorn a plus one against those titties?

17:30.900 --> 17:40.900
But meanwhile, Brian thought it was 95% certainty that he was going to make out with Lauren.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.900
Yeah, but if you had gotten to meet him during Aaron's segment,

17:43.900 --> 17:46.900
like, we know the archetype this guy represents.

17:46.900 --> 17:52.900
He's very, very honest about where he feeds in the aquarium.

17:52.900 --> 17:59.900
Like, he's, I have a personal problem with this archetype.

17:59.900 --> 18:04.900
Like, I, when I, when I, when I like a chick, I ask her out and I'm like, in her face,

18:04.900 --> 18:06.900
I go like, do you like me or not?

18:06.900 --> 18:12.900
Like, and this is the guy that works with her at Blockbuster.

18:12.900 --> 18:17.900
And, and understands her and watches Downton Abbey and that's,

18:17.900 --> 18:19.900
I, it's not, it's nothing against you.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.900
I've never lost anyone to you personally, but it's just like,

18:22.900 --> 18:25.900
whenever I meet a girl who's got a guy like you on the side,

18:25.900 --> 18:27.900
I'm like, like, you say whatever you want,

18:27.900 --> 18:29.900
because I know the first test is I'm supposed to go,

18:29.900 --> 18:31.900
why don't you fuck him? He's just a fucking good.

18:31.900 --> 18:32.900
So I know I'm not supposed to do that.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.900
And so because I know I'm not supposed to do that,

18:34.900 --> 18:39.900
I've watched like three girlfriends just go like over with the China,

18:39.900 --> 18:41.900
China don't care guy.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.900
And I just like, it's good.

18:44.900 --> 18:45.900
I'm 40 now.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.900
I'm supposed to have a 10 year old kids by now,

18:47.900 --> 18:51.900
but instead I'm a fucking expert on that shit.

18:51.900 --> 18:52.900
Sorry.

18:52.900 --> 18:56.900
Spencer, what kind of dice can we roll to find out how this plays out?

18:56.900 --> 19:00.900
If we're all characters in a certain campaign right now.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.900
That'd be a diplomacy check, man.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.900
That's a straightforward answer.

19:06.900 --> 19:10.900
So it's not always impressive or interesting.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.900
It's just rules.

19:12.900 --> 19:17.900
Look, I'm not trying to be a bully.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.900
I'm not trying to be a thug about this,

19:19.900 --> 19:23.900
but I want to find out because we have a woman on stage named Lauren.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.900
She said she wanted to make out with you.

19:26.900 --> 19:27.900
Yeah.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.900
Let's roll the dice on that.

19:29.900 --> 19:30.900
Let's see what happens.

19:30.900 --> 19:31.900
All right.

19:31.900 --> 19:32.900
Critical.

19:32.900 --> 19:35.900
Someone said that she took a critical tit,

19:35.900 --> 19:37.900
but that's probably stupid.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.900
It feels like, yeah, now we're, are we in Tarzana?

19:40.900 --> 19:41.900
Are we?

19:41.900 --> 19:43.900
Shall I roll a dice?

19:43.900 --> 19:44.900
Yes.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.900
Spencer, do you hear the music?

19:46.900 --> 19:47.900
What do I describe though?

19:47.900 --> 19:48.900
That's the describing music.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.900
You describe you making out on stage.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.900
Making out on the stage.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.900
Everybody leaves.

19:58.900 --> 20:07.900
All right.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.900
He's not, he's not, he's not corruptible.

20:09.900 --> 20:10.900
He's not viable.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.900
I don't even get what's happening right now.

20:13.900 --> 20:14.900
That's, that's the plan.

20:14.900 --> 20:15.900
No one wants you to.

20:15.900 --> 20:16.900
It's just over my head.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.900
I don't, I don't, I don't, yeah.

20:18.900 --> 20:19.900
I don't.

20:19.900 --> 20:20.900
Maybe I should sit up.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.900
I said, I declared in Portland,

20:22.900 --> 20:23.900
Portland hasn't aired yet, but.

20:23.900 --> 20:24.900
All right.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.900
How about Brian's going to make out with Dan?

20:26.900 --> 20:32.900
Roll the dice on that one.

20:32.900 --> 20:33.900
14 man.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.900
That's not bad.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.900
But Spencer describe me succumbing to a homoerotic

20:38.900 --> 20:39.900
encounter.

20:39.900 --> 20:40.900
Do it.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.900
Vibrant pink shirt approaching.

20:42.900 --> 20:45.900
You see what can only be described as a way fish man

20:45.900 --> 20:48.900
from San Francisco approaching.

20:48.900 --> 20:50.900
Caught in off guard by his charms.

20:50.900 --> 20:56.900
You take him to the green room.

20:56.900 --> 20:57.900
That's all.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.900
That's all.

21:00.900 --> 21:01.900
He can handle anything.

21:01.900 --> 21:02.900
All right.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.900
Let's check in with Ryan and Lauren later.

21:04.900 --> 21:05.900
Right?

21:05.900 --> 21:06.900
Yeah.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.900
You have to kiss Brian.

21:08.900 --> 21:09.900
Well, what?

21:09.900 --> 21:10.900
Brian or Ryan?

21:10.900 --> 21:12.900
It was a four, uh, Brian.

21:12.900 --> 21:13.900
Brian.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.900
It was a 14 make out roll.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.900
I'm going to.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.900
Yeah.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.900
Oh.

21:20.900 --> 21:21.900
It's Harmontown.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.900
Everyone's safe here.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.900
It's Harmontown and it's San Francisco.

21:25.900 --> 21:26.900
Like we're.

21:26.900 --> 21:28.900
This is where anything can happen and will.

21:28.900 --> 21:29.900
All right.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.900
Brian and Lauren.

21:31.900 --> 21:32.900
Right.

21:32.900 --> 21:33.900
Yeah.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.900
I know there, but someone be named Sasquatch or

21:35.900 --> 21:36.900
something.

21:36.900 --> 21:37.900
Brian and Lauren.

21:37.900 --> 21:38.900
Thank you guys.

21:38.900 --> 21:39.900
We'll.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.100
That's the other way around

38:13.860 --> 38:15.860
Well, that's the twist

38:16.460 --> 38:18.660
It's one of those body switching movies

38:19.460 --> 38:21.460
This was a sneak preview

38:21.460 --> 38:26.380
It's one of those movies that starts and then it's and then the title card says five years earlier

38:28.340 --> 38:31.620
Gabrielle, yeah, I found a magic skull

38:33.780 --> 38:38.340
You better not touch it at the same time as me or we'll both turn into each other

38:38.340 --> 38:43.420
I know where it'll make my like lick your remandement issues turn in mind

38:43.420 --> 38:51.420
You shut the hell up, you young bitch. If I if I had your life, I'd do everything different

38:51.420 --> 38:57.420
I'm a drunk old bitch. Don't you touch the skull. Oh no we're switching places

38:59.420 --> 39:01.420
Body switching movies

39:04.420 --> 39:10.420
I'm a neurobiology major. I say things like that. I'm 21 years old, but I'm still a bitch

39:10.420 --> 39:12.420
I

39:12.980 --> 39:16.420
Gotta go to your college classes. Give me your transcripts

39:18.260 --> 39:21.940
You go to my job as a CEO at pitchcorp

39:25.620 --> 39:27.620
Three hours later at pitchcorp

39:28.060 --> 39:33.020
But by the way worst worst worst musical score ever for a movie worst the worst

39:33.020 --> 39:43.340
She has really shade shitty taste in music. She doesn't like like old Queen. Oh, this is this is the commentary track

39:43.340 --> 39:47.860
Listen to the same stuff over and over again, then you're like fuck. Don't play that shit again

39:52.740 --> 39:56.900
I have some of the qualms about your taste so like chumbo umber

39:56.900 --> 40:02.740
Coldplay yeah in my day

40:03.820 --> 40:06.660
That was either cold or you're playing it. You can't do bad

40:07.940 --> 40:12.220
You know what let's not play it anymore. Yeah, okay. Oh, we're changing back

40:13.380 --> 40:18.700
Body switching resolve. It's like freakin Friday. I'm gonna be a different kind of bitch from now on

40:18.700 --> 40:31.660
Please do just take Hey take the keys to my car and

40:32.420 --> 40:34.420
What a good movie this was

40:43.100 --> 40:46.580
What are you doing, what are you doing I play Queen

40:46.580 --> 40:48.580
You said Queen

40:50.940 --> 40:54.900
Last show of the tour man, you know, it's a bummer

40:56.180 --> 41:01.940
What have you learned? Have we grown at all those people? I think we have I

41:03.340 --> 41:05.340
Know I have you guys

41:08.740 --> 41:11.140
From this one show that I've joined you on

41:11.140 --> 41:18.300
Well, how do you how do you think we've grown Steve? You know the road's hard you can deal and you move on

41:18.300 --> 41:21.580
I know I've grown to the point where I no longer need a belt like I

41:22.620 --> 41:26.380
Used to need a belt. I know that I know that I've grown to the point where I

41:27.380 --> 41:30.820
Can't wait to go go look at my mirror at home

41:30.820 --> 41:35.700
Which was twice as wide because I get the one in the bus like it's designed for people who fit on the bus

41:35.700 --> 41:39.380
I know that I know that the amount of sweat pouring out of me

41:39.380 --> 41:43.220
Uh per day is has reached Ron Jeremy proportions

41:44.300 --> 41:49.180
I've grown biologically. I've grown. I've grown organically

41:56.740 --> 41:58.740
No

41:58.740 --> 42:27.020
I didn't know that Greg even existed. I don't I don't actually exist. I'm an ephemeral me asthma that

42:29.700 --> 42:32.860
Stop stop great poops gonna break troops wrap

42:34.140 --> 42:37.580
Okay, yeah, have you ever walked through a swamp and seen green, you know

42:38.580 --> 42:42.700
Swamp gas coming up and you go like what was that for real? That's what it's like

42:45.740 --> 42:48.540
That's what it's like to do what to be me

42:48.540 --> 42:57.820
When you enter the punchline when you come to the financial district this late at night and go, it's all in order a

42:58.860 --> 43:01.940
Very special edition of sports corner with great poops

43:01.940 --> 43:13.900
And then what's going on with your guess great poops

43:18.260 --> 43:19.820
You know

43:19.820 --> 43:25.180
Even though the word the gayest team in the NFL we hate gays the most and that's what makes thank you

43:25.780 --> 43:27.780
That's what makes us awesome

43:27.780 --> 43:35.500
We apologize for it because we knew it was out of line, but fucking we said it and we didn't really mean it, okay?

43:36.100 --> 43:41.940
Our gay brothers and sisters help us win this Super Bowl by being there for us and holding our balls

43:43.460 --> 43:50.060
Greg do you know the two teams that are playing in the Super Bowl Steve? I do I'm uh, the ball

43:50.060 --> 43:53.140
I don't like your audience unlike your audience

43:53.140 --> 43:57.420
Dan I don't just read graphic novels all day. I I

43:58.580 --> 44:00.580
Participate that's right

44:00.820 --> 44:06.260
Straight white guy world is not a world that I'm unacquainted with I didn't vote for Mitt Romney and yet

44:06.260 --> 44:08.260
I know some of the things his people know

44:08.900 --> 44:16.020
For instance, I know that the Baltimore Ravens who hilariously are named after Edgar Allen Poe who would have been

44:16.740 --> 44:19.860
Absolutely stunned and shocked that an NFL team would have his name

44:19.860 --> 44:25.740
The Baltimore Ravens for real. Yeah, they should be called the Baltimore of Mankin's

44:26.420 --> 44:33.660
As all HL Mankin. Yeah. Yeah while I pondered we can worry once upon a midnight dreary for reals. That's a football team. Okay

44:34.580 --> 44:36.580
Is it really just because they're Ravens?

44:37.500 --> 44:41.580
Automatically is named after as you're on the phone. He's the bar to Baltimore. Yes, I can't think of it

44:42.300 --> 44:47.180
Okay, all right, and then the Niners my my beloved San Francisco Niners who I've I

44:47.180 --> 44:54.180
Didn't love them, you know, I'm not a Johnny come lately ever since they won their third Super Bowl. I've been down

44:56.060 --> 45:01.600
I'm joking a Super Bowl is an event that happens when never mind. You guys don't know in any case

45:03.220 --> 45:07.380
I don't know if they do or don't I do a bit called Sports Corner where I talk as

45:07.380 --> 45:17.260
It's earnestly as I can't about sports and it's funny because I know nothing about sports. That's what's gonna make this awesome

45:21.780 --> 45:27.180
We're getting okay new beginning so here we are at Sports Corner

45:31.660 --> 45:35.580
I think that the 49ers are gonna beat the Ravens and here's why

45:35.580 --> 45:36.940
I

45:36.940 --> 45:43.860
Think that that their yardage will be better. I think that though they're doing a Sports Corner where it's as though

45:43.860 --> 45:45.860
Ed Grahlin Poe was doing Sports Corner

45:48.340 --> 45:53.740
And all at Grahlin Poe themed Sports Center and Alex Smith whose head was bleary

45:55.100 --> 45:57.100
Smashed and smitten

45:57.100 --> 45:58.980
horrible and teary and

45:58.980 --> 46:05.900
Yet Keppernick did kiss his guns and upon this day did kiss his guns and many runs and many runs

46:10.220 --> 46:12.220
Vernon Davis

46:12.900 --> 46:14.900
With great temerity

46:15.180 --> 46:17.660
We did not upon his sincerity

46:18.820 --> 46:22.860
And Alex Smith sat upon the bench his head is spinning the phone of ringing

46:22.860 --> 46:28.380
The phone of ringing answer the phone the phone's not ringing, but Alice Smith thought the phone was ringing

46:30.500 --> 46:38.660
And hardball one and hardball two and hardball one and hardball you knew because hardball one was of that crew and

46:38.860 --> 46:41.860
Hardball two was of you two and

46:42.460 --> 46:48.300
We knew that hardball would say run there run. Oh negro in the field

46:48.300 --> 46:52.820
And the negro is running and the ball would be

47:01.540 --> 47:07.420
Greg since we have you here it's been a long time am I here? All right. How am I doing? All right? Yeah

47:08.180 --> 47:10.180
Are you in town?

47:10.380 --> 47:15.500
Maybe we could play since we have you and we have Steve Agee and we have Spencer. Maybe we could do a little

47:15.500 --> 47:18.180
Little D&D. Let's get it on

47:19.900 --> 47:21.900
Yeah

47:22.460 --> 47:27.220
Erin McGathy back to the stage Erin McGathy, is Aaron still here?

47:28.820 --> 47:30.820
Aaron could you

47:33.780 --> 47:36.020
Please seven microphones

47:37.260 --> 47:39.260
There you go

47:39.260 --> 47:48.480
Uh, Lauren and Brian, I'm so sorry all this pressure. Okay good. What pressure? Oh, I missed that

47:49.260 --> 47:50.900
I

47:50.900 --> 47:55.260
Set them up during the show and when I was backstage it sounded like they were they're being made to have sex on stage

47:55.740 --> 47:57.740
in front of everyone did they

47:58.580 --> 48:00.580
Oh, how disappointing

48:01.380 --> 48:07.460
Lauren you've ever been to Amsterdam you can see that and it's extraordinarily disappointing

48:07.460 --> 48:15.860
There really is nothing more disappointing than two people copulating in front of you unless it's been recorded on film by Czechslovakian coke slaves

48:16.700 --> 48:18.700
Then it's always titillating

48:19.460 --> 48:21.460
Who's with me?

48:23.500 --> 48:28.380
Greg the last time that Dan and I were here we watched your show Dan and I did and Jeff and afterwards

48:28.380 --> 48:32.500
It was the first time that Dan and I said I love you to each other after your show here. I

48:32.500 --> 48:38.620
Don't want to say that my show's a cataclysmic event that forces people to realize their deepest emotional needs

48:39.620 --> 48:45.980
But in this instance, I think it did precipitate a little bit of what only can be described now as an internal

48:47.340 --> 48:49.340
Alois and Abelard love

48:49.740 --> 48:58.100
Where letters will be writ. I hope that's good in future. Alois and Abelard were in a graphic novel a couple years ago

48:58.100 --> 49:00.100
Spencer

49:03.780 --> 49:09.100
We've forced you now to probably call a couple audibles and bring am I the only one who's been drinking?

49:11.740 --> 49:18.500
What do you think have you heard me hit one constant the entire night did you just say confident? Yes

49:18.500 --> 49:25.540
Greg if I find out you've been smoking dope or doing any fucking alcohol. What do you do?

49:29.900 --> 49:37.460
It's like it's it's like a party of friends and family. That's all I've been doing. It's sketch fast. We don't get paid

49:40.420 --> 49:43.180
We don't get paid, right? No, no, all right Spencer

49:43.180 --> 49:49.620
Ah, do your best or do your worst bring us up to date and our campaign if you if you would

49:51.700 --> 49:56.820
When we last met the party was still trapped in the confines of the infinite fish

49:57.460 --> 50:04.700
After taking out a lung and destroying the kidney the party took on a tricky slime and discovered a magical and bloody book

50:06.180 --> 50:07.540
All right

50:07.540 --> 50:14.700
Sliding through a sphincter the group faced off with a beast's heart guarded by an ice dock tentacles and gas venting tubes

50:15.220 --> 50:23.060
The fight grew fierce and our heroes were wounded in the shadow of desperation Jeff learned that his mysterious dagger was intelligent and could talk

50:26.140 --> 50:30.360
Regrouping against the nefarious organ system our heroes face down their fleshy

50:30.360 --> 50:38.920
The wounded heart thumps loudly as the whole fish quakes wildly you feel sickened from the orange powder drifting through the air from the

50:38.920 --> 50:47.160
Ceiling the ice stock reopens its injured eye the tendril gardening of the organ whips around wildly. It is time to fight

50:49.040 --> 50:51.040
Everybody Spencer

50:52.760 --> 50:54.760
Wow

50:54.760 --> 51:01.080
I want to I want to you warned us in the green room that we need to like

51:02.080 --> 51:06.360
Hit point up because we're about to die. Yeah, I guys want your character sheets

51:07.480 --> 51:14.840
Get the character heat out. I take my magical shards out my crystals, and I use them to heal up the group

51:15.480 --> 51:21.240
I take my healing crystals out to pulling the healing frisk crystals from your satchel

51:21.240 --> 51:25.160
You rub them on your body before tossing them towards your teammates

51:25.640 --> 51:31.160
There are people who there are people who know how to play D&D who listen to us play and who are keen to the fact that what

51:31.160 --> 51:33.400
We're playing is a kind of a latent version of it

51:33.400 --> 51:37.920
But they and they sometimes ask do you guys are is it possible for you to die?

51:37.920 --> 51:42.760
What would Spencer do? Is he just keeping you alive? He told us backstage. You're about to die

51:42.880 --> 51:48.360
You I require you to heal yourselves when we start the next round. It's important

51:48.360 --> 51:55.680
I I take I take out my loot and I I start strumming chords and I know that I can't summon animals

51:55.680 --> 51:57.680
I can speak to them and yet I

51:58.720 --> 52:01.960
Try my hardest as a known barbarian with my magical loot

52:01.960 --> 52:18.200
To play a song that will summon a unicorn to come to our aid

52:18.200 --> 52:32.600
What summoning is this? What festive music do I hear upon my ears like a thousand arboreal butterflies sent into my oral faculties?

52:32.600 --> 52:35.000
What gay wind blows?

52:35.000 --> 52:50.880
Because I come here there from Harky bulgy wood and oh my god the purple darkness stuff enveloped me and now once again

52:51.040 --> 52:56.640
Into the pink light. I am born how grateful I am to see thee once again all the three

52:56.640 --> 53:01.840
I and I'm so happy to see you since we last met I put on a belt now. I'm a woman

53:01.840 --> 53:10.040
Not only are you a woman. You are boomedroculus and even in my anodyne a unicorn state

53:10.040 --> 53:13.160
Which is ambisexual a giant horn. Have I for you?

53:16.680 --> 53:18.680
Tellin all

53:19.120 --> 53:24.160
Many weeks that we've been trapped inside this infinite fish. We've we've knocked out the heart the lungs

53:24.560 --> 53:28.360
But we're still not free. Do you have any advice advice?

53:28.360 --> 53:34.240
Further than advice I shall give thee for my magic horn is made of golden corn

53:35.440 --> 53:38.440
And is a key to most things infernal

53:38.840 --> 53:45.560
This infinite fish Doth not vex me in any way watch I but fart in its general direction

53:46.680 --> 53:52.040
Lavender violets that Doth winnow down its defenses in an immense way

53:53.520 --> 53:55.520
Lurch

53:55.520 --> 53:58.120
Unleashing a powerful flatulence from the rear

53:59.720 --> 54:02.720
It dissipates into the infinite fish's insides

54:04.040 --> 54:06.040
To no effect to no effect

54:08.280 --> 54:11.800
To but the first show I have another one twice nightly am I

54:13.080 --> 54:19.280
I examine our surroundings once again Spencer. You're being accosted by the forces of the interior infinite fish

54:19.280 --> 54:23.760
I leap aboard a board. I leap on top of a Tylenol

54:23.760 --> 54:25.520
and

54:25.520 --> 54:27.520
uses horn to ram

54:28.720 --> 54:33.640
The the indeed that horn is formidable thy man bag scant

54:38.280 --> 54:40.280
With my scant man bag I

54:41.440 --> 54:48.480
Leap I leap aboard the formidable horned unicorn and try to ram the exterior of the infinite fish well

54:48.480 --> 54:50.480
I use that okay with you

54:51.600 --> 54:53.280
Roger Dodger

54:53.280 --> 54:58.880
Leaping astride the horse with a horn on top of it colloquially referred to as a unicorn

54:59.560 --> 55:05.920
The two of you in unison charge directly towards the heart or the exterior the wall the wall

55:07.640 --> 55:09.640
The heart the heart

55:11.760 --> 55:17.280
Charging directly at the heart you do you slash or do you just ramble with the horn ramming speed?

55:17.280 --> 55:22.880
You fly right by the heart and play yourself in the far wall

55:24.040 --> 55:26.720
Gentlemen, I do feel that we would be greatly

55:27.440 --> 55:31.520
Helped by a cleric only there was a cleric

55:31.960 --> 55:33.960
Well, there's not

55:35.080 --> 55:39.680
However with a convenience to the loop of a sphincter

55:39.680 --> 55:46.360
Out pops valescent the prince you've met and only just before hey

55:49.680 --> 55:51.680
What's happening

55:52.800 --> 55:55.720
Tonight the role of Allison will be played by Steve a.g.

55:56.600 --> 56:01.000
Your enthusiasm has risen it is human in here

56:01.000 --> 56:06.840
Valescent use your far sword and swipe at the heart. I

56:08.320 --> 56:11.680
Swipe a mighty swipe at the heart of the infinite fish

56:13.080 --> 56:19.080
Brandishing your golden sword you swipe a mighty swipe towards the wall of the infinite fish Greg sit down

56:20.680 --> 56:28.080
You notice that your sword goes wide in the blast now emanated from your blade instead strikes one of the tentacles flailing about

56:28.080 --> 56:32.680
It severs the tentacle cleanly and the tip falls off onto the floor

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Could be worse

56:37.720 --> 56:39.720
Could be worse, but that was not bad

56:40.080 --> 56:46.280
So so the heart is done the heart isn't done you knock you missed and hit something else a tentacle the tentacle. Yeah

56:46.880 --> 56:48.880
You're getting attacked. I

56:49.120 --> 56:52.240
Look from side to side and I pull out of my

56:53.440 --> 56:55.440
As you're attacked

56:55.440 --> 56:58.920
As I'm attacked. Yeah, I was saying you're attacked

56:59.880 --> 57:01.880
Beneficious most vexing

57:02.760 --> 57:04.760
This I say

57:05.600 --> 57:10.400
Steady torpedo from my ass that I have born steady telling all steady

57:13.600 --> 57:15.600
Sorry exuberant I have become

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Backwards now tucks

57:19.920 --> 57:21.920
Yeah, I'll say it

57:21.920 --> 57:26.920
The heart gives an almighty thump and you feel the ground shaking

57:27.760 --> 57:33.680
Spikes and some sort of things fall from the ceiling the battleground has become very dangerous

57:35.680 --> 57:37.680
No one gets hurt though

57:40.840 --> 57:43.080
But be careful just be careful you guys

57:43.080 --> 57:52.280
Yes, the camera shook a little bit what power is does a unicorn has Spencer power is you can heal

57:52.280 --> 57:57.800
Um, you can teleport within a forest. You're not within a forest. Um, also the power of whoa. What's that?

57:58.360 --> 58:03.520
That's what the power of the shock. It's shocking. It's shocking and entertaining

58:03.520 --> 58:08.920
The the infinite fish may feel the unicorn see the unicorn inside of himself and be like wow

58:08.920 --> 58:15.760
Oh, cool that that's that's a good point. Please don't tweet me that I don't know about them to the dragon

58:15.760 --> 58:17.360
It's a bit. I'm sorry

58:17.360 --> 58:19.360
It's okay flaming sword

58:19.880 --> 58:23.880
It's good at the at the at the heart. I do a flaming sword attack

58:24.520 --> 58:29.040
Wielding your flaming sword in a vicious manner you brandish it towards the giant heart

58:31.440 --> 58:36.360
Striking the surface of the heart you score a flaming blow the wound is cauterized in

58:36.360 --> 58:38.920
Infants is the above ever it gets hurt

58:41.000 --> 58:44.600
Excellent I remove two arrows

58:47.720 --> 58:53.840
The arrows the good the good ones first the tadnodian one and then the Green Lantern

58:57.240 --> 58:59.840
Steady Tylenol I mount Tylenol

58:59.840 --> 59:04.520
So I so I'm able to see the heart and also because I would like to mount Tylenol

59:04.520 --> 59:08.200
Thou art not the first heart to mount me in this land

59:12.280 --> 59:14.280
She laughed gaily oh

59:15.320 --> 59:19.200
Your back is so broad and my haunches formidable

59:22.680 --> 59:28.600
Your mane your mane smells like lavender I've washed it and rinsed it in the recent past

59:28.600 --> 59:31.600
Oh

59:31.600 --> 59:36.980
You boxed and I put my my tooth on the microphone you you you're bucking I did not

59:37.360 --> 59:41.600
Like a zebra I rock you stripe after stripe and yet alternatively

59:43.640 --> 59:47.080
I've never been happier I orgasm as I shoot two arrows

59:48.640 --> 59:51.080
That was unanticipated and yet bonus

59:51.080 --> 59:58.800
Shaking wildly from the bucking of the horse and the orgasming of your hips

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.560
That's what I call a quiver

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Y'all ready for this

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.240
Aging yeah, all the same your arrows go wide and plant themselves in the membrane wall of the chamber

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.920
It's fine. I'm still smiling

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.080
You're still happy

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:48.080
Marching ray

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.080
You really fucked up right now

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.080
That's what they came to say isn't it?

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080
You sons of bitches

01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:00.200
You fucking robots you consumers

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.480
Sherry father, I want to fuck you

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.640
Scorching ray

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.840
I don't know I was doing it for the tour movie

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:24.440
Conjuring up magical flames you launch a scorching ray directly at the heart of the heart

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:44.560
It strikes directly in the heart and deals what appears to be 20 damage

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:57.200
Even though I am immortal this site shall I never forget

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.360
Dan Harmon is wearing camouflage boxers

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.800
Yeah for the podcast Dan took off his pants. He's wearing camo boxers and then he ingested two beverages at once

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.040
Both hands some things one can never unsee

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.040
This is our Vietnam

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.680
I I strike with my emerald emerald dagger towards the heart. Yeah, you'd like that wouldn't you I would love that

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:31.720
Judges that instead the heart shutters before glowing brightly it emits a blast of light and you all take 10 damage

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:38.480
Fucking how that shit sometimes you get damaged all right that I take my emerald dagger out and I go into okay

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:44.440
I go into a berserker rage. Hey, man. Do you think that's a good idea? Huh? That's your dagger talking

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.600
Hey, man. Do you think that's a good idea? Hey dagger you and I've been through a lot of bullshit together

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.320
Yeah, man now's no time to fucking fight. I need you as much as you need me

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.840
You should take out that other orange thing hanging from the ceiling that you killed one of in the last episode

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.360
tangerine of doom

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.280
I remember that there's another orange

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:08.320
Nerve sack yep apricot of killing I

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.040
Take my emerald dagger and I said I plunge myself

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.040
I I leap I

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:20.880
Jump on top of Tylenol with codeine and he and he circles around the room and ever increasing spirals

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:27.200
And as we arise up to the height of the orange nerve sack, I swiped with my emerald dagger

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:33.560
Leaping astride your horse with a horn colloquially you return to as I can't even talk

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:40.000
You ride across the four of the chamber and as you charge up the wall you leap off your unicorn

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:45.400
Plunging the mysterious emerald dagger directly into the heart of the orange apricot of doom

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.680
There's a brilliant green blast of light and it deals something around eight damage

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:59.320
Striking the nerve directly it explodes emitting a blast of purple powder

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.600
You feel dizzy and weak all the same you feel like you've accomplished something great

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.200
The Infinifish gives a great shudder as if it's been violently wounded. It's on the ropes

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.840
Hey guys, you guys have to try this purple powder man. It's fucking

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.320
Give me drugs. It's why give me drugs

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:25.360
Great leaping armadillos this can portend. No good

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.920
Like Liz Taylor at a banquet

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.440
You're informal before the main course

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.560
Steady Tylenol steady lad from the line that shall hold

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:46.160
How far away is the heart the heart's a good 20 feet off. Can I jump that far you can run that far?

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:53.320
I run that far and stab at the heart first slash at the heart or close sword. I mean either way close sword the heart close sordid

01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:01.480
Striking directly at the surface of the heart you managed to cut a wide blow on its side use the big dive

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:07.560
Dealing 14 damage

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:21.480
Y'all ready for this I take a single arrow and I am really really trying this time

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.040
And I shoot it directly at the heart

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:29.920
Mm-hmm. I smile at everyone. I wave my hair and I giggle and then I shoot the arrow

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.920
You know those things lessen your accuracy

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.840
Giggling giggling no like shaking will totally throw off your I mean

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:43.000
Just shoot an arrow that leave up leave us out of it. You shoot the arrow at the heart. Oh fuck

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.200
Yeah, shoot the arrow because I just rolled the attack who broke my heart

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:52.320
You did you did straight to the title?

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:59.960
I'll give you you think you're smart stupid stupid shoot that

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.160
ABC snaps

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.240
Pulling the arrow from your quiver and knocking it quickly along your bow

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:20.000
You have a song in your heart as you let the fly that arrow

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.480
It critically hits

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:36.640
Punching a wide hole in the heart. You give it. You see it give a flat a feeling about I can't even fucking talk. I'm leaving

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.720
Punching a hole in the arrow use earth fuck

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:48.760
The heart extrovers in a violent explosion gobbits and blood fly everywhere and you hear the beast give a final shutter

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:56.680
You feel yourself falling falling falling as if the beast you're inside is crashing crashing crashing to the ground it impacts

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.440
sanitary

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.440
with a violin

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:05.720
Everyone get into my portable hole so that we don't if it crashes. We don't get hurt

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:10.480
That seems like a really good idea. Everyone get my portable hole. That's what she's

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.920
Hiding inside the portable hole you take cover for what seems to be an eternity

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.960
Soon, you'll be out of there. It's not so bad

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:37.040
You're steady steady tellin off your heads are swimming down to be no down to be it makes the time pass

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.040
easy boy easy

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.880
After what's it anyway?

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.960
anyway

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.920
We're just gonna describe okay, okay

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:58.760
After what seems like an eternity your heads are beginning to swim the air supply at the portable hole is beginning to lessen

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.760
And you feel yourselves get slightly dizzy

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.760
Perhaps unicorn forts aren't so helpful to breathing. I

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.800
Open the portable hole

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:22.040
Opening the portable hole you see what you haven't seen in a very long time the blue rays of the daylight

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.040
Thank you, sir

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:42.040
Your gym teachers were wrong that's a way to spend an evening

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
mixed results

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.640

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000
How about fucking great groups coming out on stage?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
This is our swan song.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Make it count, everybody.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Dan.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Oh, no, no, no.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Dan.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Here we go.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Here we go.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I'm a human being.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
You're a little human being.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Oh, shit.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Oh.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000
We did it, America.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Harmontown is especially in the country.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Dan, Dan, Dan, make it to the bar.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Get me an angriestine and bring it back.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Thank you all.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
One more time for the mayor of Harmontown,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Mr. Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:33.000
You got a little sad, the club guy got a little sad.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Thank you.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Please tip your wait staff.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Thank you, first line.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Let's all go to the bar and have a few, shall we?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Let's go to the end of the tour.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:23.000
We got 15 seconds left.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Harmontown.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Harmontown.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
America is Harmontown.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
The greatest tour that's ever been done.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Thank you guys.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I think tonight officially all the merch is free.
