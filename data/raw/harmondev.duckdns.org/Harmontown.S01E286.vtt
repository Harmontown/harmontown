WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.840
Okay. Now, the key is with shingles is that it's not to exert myself. Hi, folks. I have

00:19.840 --> 00:27.120
a herpy virus called shingles. You can Google it, or I'll tell you a lot about it tonight.

00:27.120 --> 00:31.960
I've learned a lot about it, but it rides on the nervous system. It's a reactivation

00:31.960 --> 00:39.440
of the chicken pox from when you were a kid. It comes as a result of you either being 60,

00:39.440 --> 00:46.480
living in a third world country, or having my lifestyle, which apparently is high stress

00:46.480 --> 00:54.480
or low health. I'm going to go with the latter. So, you know, I went to New York with Dino,

00:54.480 --> 01:00.920
had a good time. And this is pretty shingles. I think I got the shingles. I think I got a

01:00.920 --> 01:07.280
fever for the flavor in New York. And then I got the flavor of the shingles on the way

01:07.280 --> 01:17.040
back to that. Some people call you shingles, Dick. Yeah. Sorry, is that my comedy car alarm

01:17.040 --> 01:26.480
went off outside? All right. Well, it's stuff like that. I want to thank the production

01:26.480 --> 01:34.280
crew because, well, first of all, I want to say to the subscribers, I hope so. I mean,

01:34.280 --> 01:41.360
this isn't helping. Here's some of the things that shingles loves car alarms. The doctor

01:41.360 --> 01:48.200
told me not to do work out, go to therapy. I didn't go to therapy. I didn't do the weekend

01:48.200 --> 01:53.200
Dracula show, the super tight like finale. Like these are fun things for me. But you

01:53.200 --> 01:58.720
know, I'm taking it easy. I have to not like even good stresses is bad stress because this

01:58.720 --> 02:04.840
is a nerve is a virus that lives in your nerve endings. So I'm trying to take it very easy.

02:04.840 --> 02:11.120
So we did a little soft open, a little soft warm open for those of you who are listening

02:11.120 --> 02:16.800
for free. That's cool. That doesn't make me. But what you don't know is that Dan is laying

02:16.800 --> 02:22.920
in a kind of a cool, like blonde wood. I'm sitting in bed with a bag of hard boiled eggs.

02:22.920 --> 02:29.360
It's got some Minecraft flavored bedding. Some egg lands best eggs. Can you open these

02:29.360 --> 02:35.440
for me? I'd love to. You're just eating eggs out of a bag. Yeah. Lysine. What? The herpes

02:35.440 --> 02:41.080
virus that makes up shingles doesn't like lysine, which is weird because the dinosaurs

02:41.080 --> 02:46.240
of Jurassic Park love it. They need it in the book. Anyway, they kind of fucked off

02:46.240 --> 02:49.720
with that in the movie. And then they didn't really talk about the lysine dependency. I

02:49.720 --> 02:53.440
love lysine. Do you think that lysine is the reason why the loss of raptor is cheetah

02:53.440 --> 03:00.120
speed? Yeah. You're eating a hard boiled egg out of a plastic pouch. It's full of vitamin

03:00.120 --> 03:11.520
A or something. Can you hear the herpes screaming? It's pissed. It's downright ornery. Anyways,

03:11.520 --> 03:14.520
now don't go. Is it going to scar on your head or is that going to go away? Well, you

03:14.520 --> 03:20.840
can see this one that's right in the middle of my forehead. It's a, I could leave a divot.

03:20.840 --> 03:24.800
It's kind of cool. I got to say, when you get a disease that's like has like a sci fi

03:24.800 --> 03:28.720
twist to it, I can at least get into that and get through the searing pain, which by

03:28.720 --> 03:33.000
the way has subsided. I'm not in any pain. Yay. I mean, I was a little tingling, but

03:33.000 --> 03:37.040
I think that's because I'm on these meds every time. I noticed like a half hour after I take

03:37.040 --> 03:40.960
the meds. All right, slow down, Harmon. Fucking stop talking a mile a minute. Eat your egg.

03:40.960 --> 03:49.160
Get your lysine, Harmon. Get your lysine. Just get your groovy voice back on. We've

03:49.160 --> 03:52.400
got some very low energy, mild mannered New York friends that are going to be joining

03:52.400 --> 03:56.480
us in a second. They're going to really keep me calm. They're from the east coast where

03:56.480 --> 04:03.800
the, where the vibes are chill. Yeah. Um, and where you get shingles. What was I, what

04:03.800 --> 04:09.840
was I just saying? I say we, uh, exactly got some music for us. Lay it on us. Well, cold

04:09.840 --> 04:19.520
open is over. Oh, okay. I think this opens about to heat up. You know what I'm saying?

04:19.520 --> 04:23.840
Where's that music? Oh, so it's sort of like, um, you know, when you get chicken pox when

04:23.840 --> 04:35.880
you're a kid, this is the cool stuff I get. Topical. Yo, if we're rapping, we're rapping

04:35.880 --> 04:46.920
low and slow beat down this chicken pox, turn up the rocks, make them like pebbles. Motherfucker

04:46.920 --> 04:54.800
face to the trouble. Whoa. Whoa. Don't fuck with me. Not today. Low energy. Gotta relax

04:54.800 --> 05:00.360
in my minecraft bed. Gotta do some rhymes off the top of my head. I saw a snoop, loop,

05:00.360 --> 05:06.080
a dupadee, dupadee. I fucked your mama in the laundry shoe. I put pajamas on the back

05:06.080 --> 05:11.720
of my neck. Beautiful uptown, Burbank, Harmontown is once again in sessions. We have a supine

05:11.720 --> 05:20.560
Dan Harmon eating hard boiled eggs out of a garage station fucking bag. I'm a cop

05:20.560 --> 05:24.960
troller. Jeff Davis, a game master. Start in there. Spencer Crittenden. Let's give it up

05:24.960 --> 05:32.720
for your shingles ridden mayor. Before he succumbs to illness and syphilitic madness.

05:32.720 --> 05:36.920
Your mayor is Dan Harmon. Thank you. See, I didn't understand your energy. Yeah, we didn't

05:36.920 --> 05:40.360
know what was happening. We just, we both just realized, oh, he's, he's a slave to the

05:40.360 --> 05:44.960
format. You're like, I mean, in a good way. You're a professional. You're like, guys,

05:44.960 --> 05:51.080
we haven't started to show you. I was more comfortable with a kind of just a totally

05:51.080 --> 05:56.240
awkward experimental, no title sequence show. You got the facial chicken pox, eating some

05:56.240 --> 06:04.120
eggs, eight and million cocks. Whoa. That's okay. I don't want you to be homophobic today

06:04.120 --> 06:08.880
because we got our East Coast friends coming up in a second. We're going to make amends

06:08.880 --> 06:14.280
with the whole nation and my chicken pox. Got the herpes virus, like bagels and locks.

06:14.280 --> 06:21.480
They go together. Birds of a feather. Podcasting pros in the sunny weather. They came out to

06:21.480 --> 06:29.120
visit. Fuck your mama like my name was. Can you wrap a little bit about your Minecraft

06:29.120 --> 06:38.520
pillows and medvedic? Yeah. I don't mind being told what to do because I'm, I need to keep

06:38.520 --> 06:47.920
my nervous system unexerted. So all right, I'll wrap about my blankets. Minecraft's on

06:47.920 --> 06:57.240
them. Word. Fuck it. Yeah, Christ. Congratulations. You have a slave rapper now. Fuck it. Hell

06:57.240 --> 07:02.200
yeah. All right, let's, uh, look, I want to, I want to bring company. Are you okay over

07:02.200 --> 07:07.720
there? I should feel really good. And I want Steve Levy, um, got on this. I don't know who

07:07.720 --> 07:13.720
put the, you know, the bulk of the physical work in. Steve Levy made it with Nolan. I'm

07:13.720 --> 07:17.600
obviously surrounded by a lot of people who care about me and I don't, I don't say that

07:17.600 --> 07:27.960
enough. Um, that's nice. Thank you. All right. Have you got the chicken pox before, Jeff?

07:27.960 --> 07:33.120
I did when I was like five golden. You're good. Um, see, am I going to, am I going to

07:33.120 --> 07:40.360
get face aids? Nope. It's face herpes. And no, did you have chicken pox when you were

07:40.360 --> 07:44.440
a kid? I did. So I'm good. Yeah. All right. Apparently you could potentially get to, well,

07:44.440 --> 07:47.240
that's the neat thing. I just want to say this and then we'll bring up our guests because,

07:47.240 --> 07:52.040
because our real guest is the face herpes that I have. So I want to introduce them too.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.360
Should we, should we bring your face herpes out and talk to them for a while? Well, they're,

07:55.360 --> 07:58.480
they've come out. That's what I think is kind of neat. It's like, cause it's like, that's

07:58.480 --> 08:04.560
why I think we like, uh, uh, uh, Ridley Scott's alien movie is because, uh, you know, it resonates

08:04.560 --> 08:10.160
that gig air, like stuff that parasitic, like something's bursting out of you. Um, uh, these

08:10.160 --> 08:15.120
are, when you had chicken pox when you were a kid, you know, you mostly like got rid of

08:15.120 --> 08:19.680
them out of your system. Like you basically killed most of them, whether you got vaccinated

08:19.680 --> 08:29.280
or, or had them, same difference. But, uh, they, they, there's, there's like bands of gorilla,

08:29.280 --> 08:35.040
GUER, gorilla, like, um, uh, the same virus, like it gets, it, it, it, it hides in this

08:35.040 --> 08:40.520
certain kind of nerve cell. I don't know why that nerve cell makes it possible for them

08:40.520 --> 08:47.000
to stay alive, but asleep. And so they just hang out. And if your immune system gets low

08:47.000 --> 08:52.280
enough, basically it's like your immune system is always on patrol. And I imagine these things

08:52.280 --> 08:57.800
poke their head out once in a while and get beat the fuck down. And then, so if you assume,

08:57.800 --> 09:02.920
if you're, I, I was talking to, uh, Julianne Smolinski, who I hope doesn't mind saying outing

09:02.920 --> 09:08.120
her as someone who's also had this, she said that a bunch of TV writers have had it. Like,

09:08.120 --> 09:12.600
like, like, it's like a vitamin D deficiency, kind of like, shlubby disease.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.880
Should, should we get all these star burns audio podcasts together and have a shingles

09:15.880 --> 09:19.120
party? Like, where we all, we all expose ourselves to.

09:19.120 --> 09:23.720
But it's kind of neat because it's like, it's a disease that you cured when you were a kid.

09:23.720 --> 09:28.240
It's like the same virus hid in one type of cell, which is your nerve cell. It's not like

09:28.240 --> 09:34.000
a nerve disease. It's a virus that could only hide in that type of nerve cell. And that's

09:34.000 --> 09:38.120
why it only ever happens on one side of your face or body. That's how my doctor like figured

09:38.120 --> 09:42.920
it out right away. And you can actually trace the cranial nerve path that mine are on. I'm

09:42.920 --> 09:47.600
lucky because they're on my face. You get them on your back, you get them on your leg,

09:47.600 --> 09:50.440
you don't notice them for two weeks. I'll take the back.

09:50.440 --> 09:54.760
Yeah, but if you don't notice them, then you get those, that belt of blisters and stuff.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.880
Oh, yeah. Because I did a little research and people get a big band of it on one side

09:57.880 --> 10:04.960
of their body. Yeah. But these, these little guys, they wake up and girls, you're welcome.

10:04.960 --> 10:11.280
You are so shingles woke. Take it back, babies. They, they, they wake up in these nerve cells

10:11.280 --> 10:15.880
and they go, Oh, shit. I think this guy's either 60 or living in Nicaragua and drinking

10:15.880 --> 10:21.080
like lead water, maybe Detroit and like, like, he's down for the count. It's let's, let's

10:21.080 --> 10:26.320
make a break for it. Red Rover. And, and, and, but they're, they're stuck on these nerve

10:26.320 --> 10:30.920
paths and they, they, they go straight for the surface of the skin. They're like, let's

10:30.920 --> 10:36.720
cause chickenpox again. So basically like, you can't give shingles to anybody. You can

10:36.720 --> 10:45.920
only give shingles to yourself. Shingles are a, a kind of like a sequel to chickenpox

10:45.920 --> 10:52.600
that you get because your immune system gets so low that the Riddler comes back to fuck

10:52.600 --> 10:56.520
with Batman, you know, like even though he was like beaten in the first movie, I'm not

10:56.520 --> 11:00.520
going to contract this by being in bed with you. The only thing you could possibly get

11:00.520 --> 11:04.520
is if you were chickenpox free as a kid for some reason, if you were like a boy in a bubble

11:04.520 --> 11:09.440
and they let you out. And then so you didn't have chickenpox ever. And you were next to

11:09.440 --> 11:15.520
me when my head exploded with these gross blisters, which they've already done and they're finished.

11:15.520 --> 11:21.720
But if two days ago you had rubbed your forehead on mine, you would have gotten chickenpox.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.920
I've already given you crabs just by being here for the last 10 minutes.

11:24.920 --> 11:32.040
And I've gotten bored of myself. Am I right, people? Let's bring up our, who applauded that?

11:32.040 --> 11:35.480
We all did. America did. That's that Schrab. I'm going to Schrab.

11:35.480 --> 11:38.920
No, I don't think it was. No, it was Schrab. Let's just believe it was.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.840
Oh, by the way, Schrab, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to take Schrab to Boston.

11:41.840 --> 11:48.440
I, you know, there was a huge outcry. I think about seven people retweeted him. It's just

11:48.440 --> 11:53.600
too much pressure from, from, from the seven people that, that, that, that he pretends

11:53.600 --> 11:57.280
to be when he changes accounts and so. And I just want to say that's a really generous

11:57.280 --> 12:00.480
thing that Schrab did to invite, to invite himself.

12:00.480 --> 12:04.280
Wait, you're accusing Schrab of, of making up false accounts so he can, he can.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.080
Get a free trip. Blast us.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.480
No, no, no, no. Let's not talk about finances right now. Let's bring up our guests.

12:10.480 --> 12:18.480
Like, you know, these two, like, I'm not gonna, I was just listening to their original podcast.

12:18.480 --> 12:23.280
You know, like, you know, we're in our 300s or something like that and it makes us feel

12:23.280 --> 12:28.520
like we should quit. Like, these, these guys have been doing podcasting since 2005.

12:28.520 --> 12:32.480
Like, they, I think, unless there's something about their episode codes that I'm not understanding,

12:32.480 --> 12:34.880
they're like in their mid 2000s.

12:34.880 --> 12:35.880
Is that right?

12:35.880 --> 12:40.880
On their original podcast, which is Keith and the Girl, right? Let's, let's just bring

12:40.880 --> 12:44.240
them up and, and we can ask them all of the questions that I don't know.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.760
I kind of want to stay in bed because of the blanket and my wool suit. I'm roasting in here.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.760
It's really warm.

12:48.760 --> 12:53.160
Well, I, you, you do what you want. I'm going to, let's, let's bring up, I want to make

12:53.160 --> 12:56.960
sure I don't fuck up their names, but let's bring up our new friends, Keith Malley and

12:56.960 --> 12:58.760
Hemda Khalili.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.040
All right.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.040
Hemda and Keith.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.040
Oh yeah.

13:02.040 --> 13:07.040
Hi, Keith. Hi, Hemda.

13:07.040 --> 13:11.160
Jeff, can you shake his hand for me?

13:11.160 --> 13:16.000
It's, I know, you know, it's weird. Is it changes my behavior too? Well, you know, you have

13:16.000 --> 13:21.120
a scab on your forehead and you have, like, I feel like I owe people, I have to tell people

13:21.120 --> 13:22.120
I have shingles.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.760
Like, normally you'd be in a three-piece suit and.

13:24.760 --> 13:29.360
Well, normally I'd at least shake hands or hug or whatever anyone else wanted to do.

13:29.360 --> 13:33.560
But like, it changes my behavior because I don't know what people's relationship with

13:33.560 --> 13:39.680
the word shingles is. And then you meet someone and they say, I have it. All right.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.360
Our relationship is now Dan Harmon.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.360
Yeah.

13:42.360 --> 13:47.320
Anyways, I met you guys awkwardly rolling out of an Uber with a gallon of green tea and

13:47.320 --> 13:48.960
a bag of hard boiled eggs.

13:48.960 --> 13:53.560
And 25 eggs. I thought it was funny how Jeff asked you, so it's not contagious. Is it

13:53.560 --> 13:58.560
too bad that I'm here after the fact? And then, no, I don't think so. That's good enough

13:58.560 --> 13:59.560
for me.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.560
Yeah.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.360
That's, that's how we try to have safe sex in 2018, right?

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
Yeah.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.360
You're good right?

14:05.360 --> 14:06.360
I'm good.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.360
I'm good. Okay.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.280
I mostly made a frenet broncher right now. I don't think viruses can live in the horrible

14:10.280 --> 14:11.920
caustic environment of my blood system.

14:11.920 --> 14:16.280
I mean, the only thing that you could do is, I mean, that's, I agree with you. Like, nothing

14:16.280 --> 14:20.960
really that lands on me can really set up shop there. Like, they'll be like, what the fuck

14:20.960 --> 14:23.800
is this Irish rock garden?

14:23.800 --> 14:28.480
When you first saw it, did you think, oh great, another blackout? Or do you really think it

14:28.480 --> 14:29.480
is medical?

14:29.480 --> 14:37.680
I thought that because I had a massive head, not massive, massive for a writer, a head wound.

14:37.680 --> 14:47.840
I had a blackout kind of weekend at Tribeca. And I, so I thought, I thought that what happened,

14:47.840 --> 14:52.960
was that since I couldn't remember how I had injured my head, and then I had this, like,

14:52.960 --> 14:59.800
I started feeling this pain going down half of my face. And I was like, oh, I guess since

14:59.800 --> 15:06.000
there's no such thing as coincidences, I must have like passed out and smacked my head on

15:06.000 --> 15:11.280
the nightstand and maybe just slept there like a, like a cartoon drunk for an hour or

15:11.280 --> 15:12.280
a real life drug.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.880
A cosmological thing that could have happened.

15:13.880 --> 15:18.760
Yeah, I was like piecing it together. I was like, maybe I, maybe I like fell down, slept

15:18.760 --> 15:25.880
on something weird that the hotel staff doesn't wash as much as the pillowcases or something.

15:25.880 --> 15:30.680
And then it just, then I could see, I looked close to the mirror after I got back to LA

15:30.680 --> 15:33.360
and I was like, no, there's something blooming.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.360
And then I,

15:34.360 --> 15:37.400
That's good news. Like for a split second, do you think, man, maybe I do have to quit

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
drinking.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
Right.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Oh, shingles.

15:40.400 --> 15:45.800
Yeah, for a while I started thinking, oh, I got shingles on my head too. And the doctor's

15:45.800 --> 15:50.840
like, no, you fell down drunk. I looked at your head wound very carefully. And I wanted

15:50.840 --> 15:55.400
to make sure it wasn't shingles on your head. It's not. You're an alcoholic.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.840
So what's the prognosis? Like it just drifts away after time. You're taking medication

15:58.840 --> 15:59.840
for this?

15:59.840 --> 16:04.520
Yeah, I'm one of the lucky ones. You'll never hear a shingle story this fortunate for most

16:04.520 --> 16:12.120
people because if you don't catch it in time, it can be a solid. My friend, Julianne, had

16:12.120 --> 16:13.120
it two years ago.

16:13.120 --> 16:21.120
She said it was for 19 days. It's like two weeks-ish, 20 days. And if it just runs its

16:21.120 --> 16:27.840
course, which it just will, for a lot of people, you get this like neuralgia, I think that's

16:27.840 --> 16:32.600
what it's called. It's like this deep nerve pain that can last for two years because of

16:32.600 --> 16:34.920
the damage it causes coming out.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.480
Have you ever spoken so sexy from bed?

16:37.480 --> 16:40.280
This is sexier. Why do I think that?

16:40.280 --> 16:45.080
I mean, I'd be remiss to that. Either of you guys want to spend some time in here, but

16:45.080 --> 16:46.080
I don't-

16:46.080 --> 16:48.080
It looks more comfortable than this seat. I'm going to give it a go.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.080
Okay, come on in.

16:49.080 --> 16:55.280
I'm going to take off my shoes because I'm not an animal like Jeff, but we're not judging.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.280
It's a safe space.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.880
I am an animal. You're right about that.

16:57.880 --> 17:01.760
I feel especially in the Akia blondewood futon.

17:01.760 --> 17:05.760
I'm one of those people for whom it's more rude to take my shoes off because of how gross

17:05.760 --> 17:06.760
my feet are.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.520
And Hemre, you came in wearing kind of what amounts to a blanket already. You came already

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
bedded.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.360
Yes, I understood what this podcast was about.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.520
So you guys have been at it since 2005.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.520
Yes.

17:17.520 --> 17:21.200
Like you were podcasting before. Maybe they even had a word for it.

17:21.200 --> 17:29.920
Honestly, yeah. There was still the iPod and there wasn't a category on iTunes for it.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.240
Why? How do you keep doing it? Because I was listening to your most recent episodes on

17:33.240 --> 17:39.560
the way here and you clearly, I don't know how you started energy-wise, but you seem

17:39.560 --> 17:42.000
very happy to be doing it still and very good at it.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.320
I do have a dream to take back. We have a premium program where you hear all our shows

17:47.320 --> 17:49.360
where you can hear everything from 13 years ago.

17:49.360 --> 17:53.600
So I want to take that first show and redo it and not tell anybody.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.360
Just like act like it's like an adaptation, like a Gus Van Sant remake.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.520
You're so polished for the first show.

18:00.520 --> 18:06.160
You guys do sound polished though. You sound like you have the right amount of radio people

18:06.160 --> 18:07.160
in you.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.480
I'll take right amount.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.480
Thank you.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.440
Like you're not, it would be an insult, I think, to podcasters to say you sound like

18:12.440 --> 18:13.440
radio people.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.240
Right, but I get it. I'll take it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:15.240 --> 18:20.200
But I mean, it's like you guys are professional is what I mean. You sound like you don't do

18:20.200 --> 18:22.600
what I do and just have people on and just talk over them.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.760
But how great is that though? To be able to just, what am I wearing today? Who gives

18:26.760 --> 18:27.760
us a shit?

18:27.760 --> 18:29.000
Like how fun that is.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.040
How much do you guys plan your...

18:31.040 --> 18:34.400
We plan probably at least three hours for an hour show.

18:34.400 --> 18:38.320
So you get, always right before it, you have a meeting in the middle of the week.

18:38.320 --> 18:42.720
We get together three hours before the show to prep for that with our producer Andrea

18:42.720 --> 18:48.600
and a couple interns sometimes and then they prep us for the guest and also news and then

18:48.600 --> 18:51.720
I have to fight with Keith about how many rape cases we have to talk about on the show

18:51.720 --> 18:52.720
that day.

18:52.720 --> 18:53.720
There's a lot.

18:53.720 --> 18:54.720
He's fascinated by weird stories.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.080
These are just Keith's open rape cases.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.880
I'm like, listen, what do we think?

18:59.880 --> 19:00.880
What's the...

19:00.880 --> 19:04.280
What's Keith's angle on those cases?

19:04.280 --> 19:05.280
He's just...

19:05.280 --> 19:09.160
I am not pleased. That's my catchphrase.

19:09.160 --> 19:13.720
It's his version of me too. He's just like, I'm giving them all the attention.

19:13.720 --> 19:18.240
Oh, is it really more like that? Is it like, hey, did you hear about this monster so and

19:18.240 --> 19:20.360
so or is it like a true crimey kind of thing?

19:20.360 --> 19:24.200
I think when the story is so amazing, I have to tell it.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.880
But then it's sad news.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.320
It's a woman got into the wrong car.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.320
The worst thing happens.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.640
She gets into another car for help.

19:30.640 --> 19:31.640
The worst thing happens.

19:31.640 --> 19:32.640
I'm like, I don't know.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.640
I wish somebody told me the story.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.400
And then he looks at me and goes and we're a comedy podcast and I'm like, I'm supposed

19:37.400 --> 19:40.200
to find the funniest thing about this rape story that you just told me.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.200
Yeah.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.200
Then I say, good luck.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
I say, go.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.920
Forgive me for not knowing what your show is because I don't listen to a whole lot of

19:47.920 --> 19:49.080
podcasts.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.080
What is the...

19:50.080 --> 19:52.640
Well, the one we should be plugging is the one that said Star Burns.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.520
Yeah, who cares about Keith and the Girl?

19:54.520 --> 20:00.220
So we also started because five days, five shows a week wasn't enough.

20:00.220 --> 20:04.160
We started my opening line and that's where we talked to artists and comedians about

20:04.160 --> 20:06.520
the very first humiliating times on stage.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.520
Okay.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.320
Oh, so that's not the one that's been going since 2005.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.280
The one since 2005 is Keith and the Girl.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.280
That's five days a week.

20:12.280 --> 20:17.040
It's mostly a comedy show, but we will talk about Cosby being found guilty, this kind

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
of thing.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.040
Yeah, that was fun, wasn't it?

20:19.040 --> 20:20.040
That was...

20:20.040 --> 20:21.040
It was fun.

20:21.040 --> 20:25.480
So he's a hero when you're a kid and then also you find out he's been a villain since

20:25.480 --> 20:26.480
we were kids.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.480
Right.

20:27.480 --> 20:31.720
And I was talking to a handleburst, the person that did the stand-up that got everything

20:31.720 --> 20:32.720
started.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.720
Yeah.

20:33.720 --> 20:34.720
And by the...

20:34.720 --> 20:35.720
And hooray for him on that one.

20:35.720 --> 20:36.720
Hooray for him.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.360
He doesn't like it though because he's afraid he's being seen as that's the person when

20:39.360 --> 20:43.520
meanwhile he has jokes, but I'm like, you're a superhero.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.160
You'll get your jokes in there.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.160
I don't know.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.840
I think it would be great to...

20:47.840 --> 20:51.000
It's not his favorite thing to be associated directly with that.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, but...

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, I can imagine.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.280
But he still provided a service.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.280
Yes.

20:55.280 --> 21:00.720
And all this teaches too is that, yes, when you're at a comedy club, record the show.

21:00.720 --> 21:04.440
You don't know what they're going to say, right?

21:04.440 --> 21:07.000
If some asshole wasn't there with their phone...

21:07.000 --> 21:08.440
Jeff, can't tell if you're serious or not.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.240
I honestly don't know if I am or not.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.800
I just saw the big sick.

21:11.800 --> 21:15.080
Yes, we wouldn't know if Kramer was racist.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.640
Right.

21:16.640 --> 21:20.520
I watched the big sick and you know, the guys do a stand-up and then there's a heckler in

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
the audience.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.680
Well, long story short, they fall in love.

21:23.680 --> 21:24.680
What am I learning?

21:24.680 --> 21:26.680
Heckle, take out your phone.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.680
Do whatever you want.

21:27.680 --> 21:28.680
Yes.

21:28.680 --> 21:29.680
You don't want to know.

21:29.680 --> 21:30.680
Do what you want.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
Do what you want.

21:31.680 --> 21:32.680
Do what you want.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.560
This is off topic, but you took out a light bulb in New York in your hotel and then smashed

21:36.560 --> 21:37.560
it on the ground.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.560
Thank you for listening.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.080
Did you ever find out why your brain did that?

21:41.080 --> 21:42.080
No.

21:42.080 --> 21:46.760
Do you think maybe it was the beginning of the herpes virus, making me do things?

21:46.760 --> 21:47.760
You think so?

21:47.760 --> 21:48.920
You think your herpes was like talking to you?

21:48.920 --> 21:53.520
I want to give myself the benefit of the doubt, or rather, I should say, the reason I say

21:53.520 --> 21:58.360
I did it on purpose is because I don't want to let myself off the hook and say, oh, I

21:58.360 --> 21:59.360
slipped.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.720
But because here's what I definitely did on purpose.

22:01.720 --> 22:07.720
I looked at a light bulb bulb cover and I was like, huh, and I just wanted to pull it

22:07.720 --> 22:08.720
off.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.720
Wow.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.720
What was fascinating about the light bulb?

22:10.720 --> 22:14.400
I wanted to see how easy, does that just come right off?

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
And it did.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
It just pulled it off.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.480
You're talking about the casing that enclosed the bulb.

22:18.480 --> 22:22.280
Like a globe of glass over the bulb to make it a little softer.

22:22.280 --> 22:27.160
And I was like, oh, it's keeping that on, just not being pulled?

22:27.160 --> 22:31.680
Your own curiosity is the only thing that keeps it on there.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.360
Lack of curiosity keeps it on.

22:33.360 --> 22:37.280
When he tells you stories, is it tempting to say, were you drinking, or do you just

22:37.280 --> 22:38.280
have to?

22:38.280 --> 22:41.480
No, because Dan and I live in a state of half inebriation.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.120
Sometimes he asks, were you sober?

22:43.120 --> 22:48.560
If it gets confusing, like if it's a story about me finding my car keys.

22:48.560 --> 22:54.240
Our friend Greg Proops severed a tendon in his thumb by doing the exact same thing.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.880
He was in London and pulled the...

22:55.880 --> 22:57.400
Does he have shingles too?

22:57.400 --> 22:59.040
No, not that I'm aware of.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.280
It might be in his back.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.280
Yeah.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.280
We'll have to check.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.720
A bulb went out and he tried to pull the casing off and the glass shattered.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.240
But the bulb went out.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.320
That's like half a reason to do it, right?

23:10.320 --> 23:11.320
That's a full reason.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.320
It is a full reason.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.320
I did the math on it.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.480
I still would have called somebody and said, hey, would you do this one?

23:16.480 --> 23:17.480
Well, I'm Polish.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.480
I would have called two people.

23:18.480 --> 23:23.480
We just went back to 1980.

23:23.480 --> 23:30.320
How many Polish people does it take to tell this joke in 2018?

23:30.320 --> 23:32.720
That guy you can hear in the back is Rob Schrab.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.920
Don't worry about him.

23:34.920 --> 23:35.920
The...

23:35.920 --> 23:42.160
He should just be lafmiked over there, because he's in a row.

23:42.160 --> 23:47.440
I wanted to think that because we all evolved from the same amoeba, basically, and then

23:47.440 --> 23:50.360
like, even though we branched off, like we...

23:50.360 --> 23:54.120
That there's some part of us that's similar to the moth when we get that drunk that we're

23:54.120 --> 23:55.120
just like...

23:55.120 --> 24:00.480
That that's why drunk guys do what a moth would do if it had hands, which is just fuck

24:00.480 --> 24:01.480
with a light bulb.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.480
Yeah.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.480
A dantel flame.

24:03.480 --> 24:04.480
You're in a hotel room.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.480
Take it.

24:05.480 --> 24:06.480
What's that?

24:06.480 --> 24:07.480
You're in a hotel?

24:07.480 --> 24:08.480
Yeah.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.480
Yeah, there's also a lack of permanence in hotels.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.480
Well, it's also a mystery too.

24:10.480 --> 24:11.480
None of this exists.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.480
All the light fixtures work.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.480
Do you really?

24:13.480 --> 24:14.480
Yeah.

24:14.480 --> 24:19.960
Well, when you first get a new place, you don't and remember all the business that you have

24:19.960 --> 24:22.840
to go through when that first light goes out in that first room and you're like, what

24:22.840 --> 24:23.840
the fuck?

24:23.840 --> 24:24.840
How does this flower work?

24:24.840 --> 24:25.840
Okay.

24:25.840 --> 24:26.840
Yeah.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
You're like...

24:27.840 --> 24:28.840
In a hotel, it's all your first day.

24:28.840 --> 24:29.840
Yeah.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.840
And you're like, what the fuck?

24:30.840 --> 24:31.840
What's this thing?

24:31.840 --> 24:32.840
Okay.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.840
So that makes sense.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
But then you have it in your hand.

24:34.840 --> 24:35.840
Now you want to smash it.

24:35.840 --> 24:36.840
I don't...

24:36.840 --> 24:37.840
I want to say I didn't like...

24:37.840 --> 24:38.840
Because that seems so juvenile.

24:38.840 --> 24:39.840
You want to say a lot of things.

24:39.840 --> 24:40.840
But...

24:40.840 --> 24:46.000
In my hand, how do I get it out of my hand?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.280
You wanted to hear it smash.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.800
You wanted to see how it smashed.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.360
You wanted to see what you can get away with.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.360
It's a new place.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.360
How did the floors work?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.440
There's two things that cause me rage in hotel rooms.

24:54.440 --> 24:58.440
I'm in a hotel a lot because they do travel comedy gigs.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.440
Humblebrag.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.440
No.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.440
That is a humblebrag.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.600
Some of you might just be in hotels sometimes.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
I'm in them a lot.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.440
The TV remotes never work.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.120
You have to fight with the TV remotely constantly.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.960
And then when you shut the door and you got to do not disturb, I always put the do not

25:12.960 --> 25:16.640
disturb thing on because I don't need the housekeeping to come every five seconds.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.960
Because if I want to come back under there, every time you shut the door, thing flies

25:20.960 --> 25:21.960
off.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.680
Like make it so that it stays on the door knob.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.080
I'm glad we talk about the real issues on this show.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.080
Yeah.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.080
We're not afraid to...

25:29.080 --> 25:30.080
Maybe tackle the real shit.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.080
It's true.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.160
I got a little nervous as you were talking, but I'm back on board now.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.160
As captain...

25:35.160 --> 25:36.160
Right.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.160
As captain, fantastic.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.480
Let me tell you the greatest thing I can do with my stretchy arms.

25:39.480 --> 25:44.360
I can put on the do not disturb sign and slink right back in as it closes.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.960
I'm not talking about that.

25:45.960 --> 25:50.280
It usually stays on when it goes back because the air sucks it back in.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.440
It's when you leave and you open the door and when it shuts, it wants to...

25:53.440 --> 25:55.720
There's something about leaving.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.280
They could come up with something better in the brainstorming sessions that they spent

25:59.280 --> 26:02.560
trying to come up with new ways of saying do not disturb.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.560
Yeah.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.040
Like, I'm a lotus.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.040
Let me bloom.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.480
What the fuck are you talking about?

26:07.480 --> 26:11.280
It's like trying to figure out which is the men's room in a fucking art gallery.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.680
What do you mean, Picasso's?

26:13.680 --> 26:14.680
What is that?

26:14.680 --> 26:15.680
Yes.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.680
I'm shingling in here.

26:16.680 --> 26:23.320
I just pictured you looking for the bathroom and you're like, fuck it, you take your dick

26:23.320 --> 26:25.160
out and people start pointing.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.760
I don't know why I'm sorry.

26:26.760 --> 26:27.760
Maybe it's the shingles.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.400
What is the origin story of your friendship between you and Keith and Hemda?

26:31.400 --> 26:32.400
We don't talk about it.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.400
Yeah, we don't.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.640
But it's working out and that's what matters.

26:35.640 --> 26:36.640
Are you friends?

26:36.640 --> 26:37.640
We are friends.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.640
We try to be.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.640
I'd say we're friends.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.640
Yes.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.640
I mean, how long have you known each other?

26:41.640 --> 26:42.640
What's your backstory?

26:42.640 --> 26:45.280
I think we've known each other for like 15 years now.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.440
We met at an open mic.

26:46.440 --> 26:51.480
It was a weird open mic where you got to do literally anything for eight minutes.

26:51.480 --> 26:56.440
So we've watched someone, you know, drink their own urine or, you know.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.440
Joy.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.440
That is the weirdest.

27:00.440 --> 27:04.840
Now everyone's going to wonder for the rest of their lives if this was the worst written

27:04.840 --> 27:05.840
sketch.

27:05.840 --> 27:08.040
That's what he looks like when you have shingles.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.040
Yeah.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.040
Wait till you go for the eggs.

27:10.040 --> 27:14.080
He pulled up a jug of what he's choosing to call green tea.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.080
It says green tea.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.320
Well, it might be green pea.

27:17.320 --> 27:18.320
Oh, okay.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.320
Sorry.

27:19.320 --> 27:23.200
That's how you met, but it's weird that I pulled up a container of urine.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.200
Enjoy.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.200
Yeah.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.200
So yeah.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.200
Oh yeah.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.200
One time we saw someone at that open mic.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.200
Dripping period.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.200
Blood and drawing with it.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.200
Oh, he's good.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.200
He's good.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.200
That would have been.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.200
What was that?

27:34.200 --> 27:35.200
You trying to flimax him?

27:35.200 --> 27:36.200
Yeah.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.200
Okay.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.200
You care.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.200
You can't shake him.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.200
I see that.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.200
When Dan gets a green tea, hankering.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.200
He's.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.200
I'm also a terrible listener.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.200
So we'd have.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.200
Yeah.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.920
So somebody drank their own pee on stage and you thought, let's do a podcast.

27:47.920 --> 27:54.800
Well, he was doing stand up and I was singing and then I was half offended by his jokes,

27:54.800 --> 27:57.320
but I love that he was, you know, going for it.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.160
And so I spoke to him after one of his sets.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.600
We started dating shortly after.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.600
And yeah, don't, don't fist pound that.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.600
No, no, no.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
Are you still?

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
Are you still?

28:09.600 --> 28:10.600
Fuck.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.600
No, bro.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
Fist pump.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.600
All right.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.600
Everything that happened.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.600
So it's cool.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.600
It's just cool.

28:16.600 --> 28:17.600
So she broke your heart and you couldn't.

28:17.600 --> 28:22.160
And you decided to keep your phony baloney relationship alive via podcast.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.160
Yes.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
Yeah.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.160
Yeah.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.000
Actually, I think we, we would have broken up a year before we did, but the podcast

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
I think kept us together.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.720
And then you were like, wait, let's keep the thing that works.

28:31.720 --> 28:32.720
Yeah.

28:32.720 --> 28:36.640
Cause I was like, oh my God, I hate you for 23 hours, but then for that one hour of podcasting,

28:36.640 --> 28:37.640
you're super fun.

28:37.640 --> 28:38.640
But the math wasn't adding up.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.640
So we had to break up.

28:39.640 --> 28:40.640
All right.

28:40.640 --> 28:43.680
I, I keep wanting to ask, I don't, I don't know how many more times I'm going to say

28:43.680 --> 28:46.480
your name, but I, and I know you have to have this conversation every time, but I just,

28:46.480 --> 28:51.920
I'm just curious what your, what is your take on the, how much, how much do, do, do you

28:51.920 --> 28:54.240
prefer being put behind the CH?

28:54.240 --> 28:56.960
Like how do you, how do you say your own name?

28:56.960 --> 28:57.960
Hemda.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.200
So you go for it.

28:59.200 --> 29:03.800
But, but, but, but if I, if I do that, I feel it's, say it, say it, say my name.

29:03.800 --> 29:04.800
Hemda.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.680
Like it feels like I'm doing like a character.

29:06.680 --> 29:07.680
Say it again.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.680
Hemda.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.680
How does it feel now?

29:09.680 --> 29:10.680
It felt still weird.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.680
Go back to when you were five.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.680
Hemda.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.680
No, dad.

29:13.680 --> 29:17.880
Not with the buckle and now say, Hemda, how does it feel now?

29:17.880 --> 29:18.880
Oh good.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.880
It's like, it's like a crackerjack and apple pie.

29:20.880 --> 29:21.880
I've been saying Hemda and I'm wrong.

29:21.880 --> 29:22.880
It's, it's got a hug in it.

29:22.880 --> 29:23.880
It's got a hug.

29:23.880 --> 29:24.880
Got a hug.

29:24.880 --> 29:25.880
Yeah.

29:25.880 --> 29:26.880
All right.

29:26.880 --> 29:31.400
You were born in Israel, but raised in New York since you were four.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.400
Yes.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.400
Really?

29:33.400 --> 29:34.400
This is why we broke up.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.400
He's the worst listener.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.600
And your eyes are hazel.

29:39.600 --> 29:44.600
What you, you, you had a whole, you've got, you have a whole singing thing.

29:44.600 --> 29:45.600
I did some singing.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.600
Yeah.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.600
That's all I know is singing things.

29:47.600 --> 29:53.240
Like you have an album in addition to, like you, you, you, you've done backup on other

29:53.240 --> 29:55.280
like people's stuff.

29:55.280 --> 30:01.120
I've collaborated with people on world music and dance music and all kinds of different

30:01.120 --> 30:02.120
things.

30:02.120 --> 30:06.800
There's probably one of the most, I don't know which, it's popular in different genres,

30:06.800 --> 30:10.840
but conjure one, which was from delirium, which is world music.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.320
Some people know that in the.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.320
With Poe and Shineto Connor.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.320
Oh yeah.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.320
I was on an album with Poe and Shineto Connor.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.440
Does it, can you tell I feel weird talking about this?

30:18.440 --> 30:19.440
It's like the, I just.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.440
She's an amazing.

30:20.440 --> 30:23.440
You're talking to a man drinking urine and eating eggs out of a sack.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.400
No, that's why she doesn't want to come off too pretentious.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.240
You don't want to, you don't want to take it too seriously.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.240
Right.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.240
Okay.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.240
Let's put it in this way.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.240
She's been a lot of hotel rooms.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.920
So she did pretty well.

30:34.920 --> 30:40.160
Are you guys kind of like in your partnership as far as like your dynamic?

30:40.160 --> 30:43.560
Are you, are you, do you think of yourself as more of the.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.560
The will they won't take kind, right?

30:45.560 --> 30:46.560
Right.

30:46.560 --> 30:53.200
The, the, the, does she bring in the, is there a, is there a contrast?

30:53.200 --> 30:57.800
Are you like, are you like, bro and down and fist bumping and, and she's like mother

30:57.800 --> 31:01.280
Gaia like, like, like trying to make you more likable or.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.280
Yes.

31:02.280 --> 31:03.280
Yeah.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.280
Yeah.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.280
She's more, she's definitely more spiritual.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.160
She's definitely deeper.

31:07.160 --> 31:11.000
She thinks people that everybody has good qualities.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
He thinks that's weird.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.200
Do you think everybody has good qualities?

31:16.200 --> 31:17.840
I think, I think.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.440
I think that nobody has good.

31:19.440 --> 31:23.160
I go through, I go through those phases, you know, like I'm not in that phase right

31:23.160 --> 31:28.880
now, but when I'm, when I'm down, I don't even think anyone has any good qualities.

31:28.880 --> 31:35.400
Like I, but then when I'm, when I'm relatively stabilized, like or up, I feel like everybody's

31:35.400 --> 31:36.720
the hero of their own story.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.680
Like there's no such thing as a bad person.

31:38.680 --> 31:41.080
But you think everyone's stupid.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.600
That's me, like pretty down.

31:42.600 --> 31:48.600
Like, I mean, when I'm, when I'm up, I'm like, well, what's stupid, you know, like, what

31:48.600 --> 31:49.600
is that?

31:49.600 --> 31:53.960
Like, like, like who says that guy over there eating a brick is like smarter than me or

31:53.960 --> 31:54.960
dumber than me.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.640
Like maybe he's a genius at brick eating.

31:56.640 --> 32:03.880
Like I kind of, I don't really feel dumber than, you know, some people about other stuff.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.840
I do see some people talking to themselves in New York, you know, just having conversations

32:07.840 --> 32:11.120
with nobody across the street, you know, and then responding.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.120
And I go, what if they're right?

32:13.120 --> 32:15.920
What if they see something that we don't see?

32:15.920 --> 32:17.840
And what if there is a person over there?

32:17.840 --> 32:25.120
And over time and become like, I can, I can relate to them because I do a lot of talking

32:25.120 --> 32:28.840
to myself at home and I think it's just me having fun and doing voices.

32:28.840 --> 32:29.840
But no, I'm crazy.

32:29.840 --> 32:36.000
I sing and rap and talk while I make a sandwich or take a shower like I'm, I'm, I'm only

32:36.000 --> 32:40.040
a paycheck away from being the guy in the street who's rapping on the street corner.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.040
That's why you wear a tie.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.040
You're trying to fool everybody.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.040
My suit is the only thing holding me up.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.040
Yeah.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.560
Cause not to be glib about it, but like if they're homeless, then that's the, you know,

32:48.560 --> 32:52.680
they're going to do a couple of things that you do it in your own home, like out on the

32:52.680 --> 32:53.680
sidewalk.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.000
But I don't think that's the real reason why someone's talking to themselves on the

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
sidewalk.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.120
That's like, that's they're singing in the shower.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.840
I think they're, I think they're mentally ill.

33:01.840 --> 33:09.320
And I get myself into, into a person that if I were homeless and out of work, then I

33:09.320 --> 33:12.120
would probably be a guy that was making a lot of noise out in the street.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.560
Like I, for different reasons, maybe or maybe not.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.560
I don't know.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.560
Yeah.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.480
If I wasn't worried about like, oh man, I hope someone reads my screenplay and I don't

33:18.480 --> 33:25.320
want to, you know, like I, once I was committed to homelessness, yeah, I'd be like, I'd,

33:25.320 --> 33:27.880
yeah, I'd be like talking about it a lot.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.520
I'd be like, this is great.

33:29.520 --> 33:33.920
Like like, or this sucks or look at me like, like, what are you, what are you eating over

33:33.920 --> 33:34.920
there?

33:34.920 --> 33:35.920
It looks stupid.

33:35.920 --> 33:36.920
Like a nice dog.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.480
How do you know when you're finished?

33:38.480 --> 33:39.480
That kind of stuff.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.480
Like heckling.

33:40.480 --> 33:41.480
Right.

33:41.480 --> 33:45.640
I'm just mad about you right now as every homeless person watching you being in a comfy

33:45.640 --> 33:48.960
bed that someone brought you because talking about how I'd out homeless them.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.240
I wasn't saying I'd do it better.

33:51.240 --> 33:55.400
I saw, I saw, you know, this is the freakiest thing I ever saw when I, when I was a, when

33:55.400 --> 34:00.280
I was like younger in Milwaukee, I was like a 20 something, like, you know, I think about

34:00.280 --> 34:04.800
this all the time too, even when I hear people that are like, you know, like, that I get

34:04.800 --> 34:09.000
like, oh, you're so stupid, like you're fucking Nazi on Twitter or whatever.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.080
Like, I remember being like, like, I just thought all homeless people were like bums

34:13.080 --> 34:17.360
that didn't, couldn't get it, that were like, like, oh, I don't want to get a job.

34:17.360 --> 34:22.240
So someone give me some money, like, and I remember talking to this, this, uh, the friend

34:22.240 --> 34:28.560
of mine, like, who was a comic and she was like doing some volunteer thing for homeless

34:28.560 --> 34:29.560
people.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.360
And I made some comment and she's like, what the fuck is that?

34:31.360 --> 34:32.360
What are you talking about?

34:32.360 --> 34:33.360
What do you think homeless people are?

34:33.360 --> 34:34.360
And I'm like, I don't know.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.800
They're like people that don't have jobs and stuff.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.200
She's like, they're mentally ill people that don't have a support system.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.080
Like, do you know what schizophrenia is?

34:40.080 --> 34:44.480
You know, there's a kind of like, blew my mind and like, but before that, I was still

34:44.480 --> 34:49.960
an adult and still a smart and still thought that I was right about everything and it just,

34:49.960 --> 34:52.880
it's not like she was an encyclopedia or showed me anything.

34:52.880 --> 34:58.400
It was just like one person going like, you moron, like, you don't even know what these

34:58.400 --> 35:00.760
things are because you don't even think about them.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.760
And then when I moved to LA, one of the first things I saw that freaked me out because in

35:03.760 --> 35:07.720
Milwaukee, all the homeless people die off like once a year, they break into everyone's

35:07.720 --> 35:10.520
cars and just die while they're trying to get warm.

35:10.520 --> 35:19.440
And like mosquitoes, I was on the third steep promenade and there was this guy and he looked

35:19.440 --> 35:22.080
like, he basically looked like Danny Trejo.

35:22.080 --> 35:28.000
Like he was so like, prison tatted and like scary looking like he looked like he could,

35:28.000 --> 35:37.480
he just looked like you would cast him as like a no nonsense, street lethal, like gangster.

35:37.480 --> 35:41.760
And but he was like, he was just shrieking and like crying.

35:41.760 --> 35:45.280
He was like, like, like he was, he was crying like a baby.

35:45.280 --> 35:50.520
He was at, he was crying like, like, like somebody had taken his balloon and he was six years

35:50.520 --> 35:51.520
old.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.360
And I remember thinking, oh, he's probably like 22 years old.

35:54.360 --> 36:01.200
Maybe he just started to like go, you know, like, like, like, like some chemical imbalance

36:01.200 --> 36:06.240
is kicking in and he doesn't have a family that's like gonna, you know, say,

36:06.240 --> 36:07.680
what do you do when you pass?

36:07.680 --> 36:08.680
I support you.

36:08.680 --> 36:09.680
Exactly.

36:09.680 --> 36:13.040
I was like, you can see everybody like, what do you do?

36:13.040 --> 36:16.840
You just, you have to treat the person like a ghost, you know, because you walk up to

36:16.840 --> 36:20.440
somebody who's like, but it's weird to have this, like, they're not always just like talking

36:20.440 --> 36:21.440
to a fire hydrant.

36:21.440 --> 36:27.240
It's like the person was simply emoting, but, but it's funny how, how strict our standards

36:27.240 --> 36:30.760
are for what you're supposed to be doing and feeling and how empathic we are.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.680
We're like, oh, that guy's not supposed to be that sad about anything.

36:33.680 --> 36:36.600
Like, nobody was looking around for his missing kid.

36:36.600 --> 36:45.080
We knew he was crazy because, and I did air quotes for the people listening, like, because,

36:45.080 --> 36:50.000
because we just knew immediately, but it's funny how like that amount of empathy results

36:50.000 --> 36:55.080
in just like, we're like insects too, like we just go, oh, he's a dysfunctional aunt.

36:55.080 --> 36:59.360
So like clear path and anyways, you look like you're probably gonna say something 20 minutes

36:59.360 --> 37:00.360
ago.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.920
I'm just enjoy this is so surreal.

37:02.920 --> 37:07.160
I'm just, I'm like, oh, nighttime stories with Dan Harmon.

37:07.160 --> 37:12.080
I was gonna say that I feel like a lot of people experience that in New York, like you,

37:12.080 --> 37:14.800
you're constantly around people and we don't really have cars.

37:14.800 --> 37:15.800
We don't have a car.

37:15.800 --> 37:20.840
So we're riding in public all the time and you'll have these breakdown moments and maybe

37:20.840 --> 37:24.320
more women than men because men's tear ducts are kind of blocked.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.320
But fuck.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.320
Yeah, bro.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.320
I know.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.320
With our hard dicks.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.320
Yes.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.320
With your very, very super hard.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.320
Yeah.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.320
Giant balls.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.320
They carry those things.

37:33.320 --> 37:34.320
In our tear ducts.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.320
Yeah.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.320
Maybe I see.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.320
Yeah.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.560
A lot of women don't know is that when we're not showing our balls, they're right up in

37:39.560 --> 37:40.560
our tear ducts.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.560
Oh man.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.560
Keeping us from crying.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.560
That clears up so much.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.560
And when they're soft, we go to four hymns.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.560
Oh, I thought you were playing the, I thought that was ad music.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.240
I accidentally hit my iPad with one of my balls.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.240
Sorry.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.240
What were you saying?

37:52.240 --> 37:56.480
So, so I think every woman I know has this story where she was crying on the train and

37:56.480 --> 37:58.160
there's like different responses.

37:58.160 --> 38:02.520
Most of the time, another woman will pass you a napkin or a tissue from her purse.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.520
And that's it.

38:03.520 --> 38:04.520
That's all you get.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.520
It's like, we feel you.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.960
Now, you know, shut that shit down by the time you get to the office.

38:08.960 --> 38:09.960
Wow.

38:09.960 --> 38:10.960
Yeah.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.960
I get my phone number.

38:13.960 --> 38:14.960
Like for help call.

38:14.960 --> 38:15.960
We'll see.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.960
Should we bring up?

38:17.960 --> 38:21.680
When I was like, like when I was 10 or 11, I was in New York with my mom.

38:21.680 --> 38:27.200
We were in a subway and like double A or whatever that one is.

38:27.200 --> 38:33.880
And there was a guy that was ranting and raving about Reaganomics and trickle down and he

38:33.880 --> 38:37.400
was screaming at everybody and nobody just gave him the time of day.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.920
Everyone's reading the newspaper, looking at their shit, doing anything.

38:40.920 --> 38:45.680
And he was screaming, screaming, screaming and pulled out a knife like a small knife.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.480
Still nobody gave him the time of day.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.600
Like, like he's not going to do anything.

38:49.600 --> 38:54.160
But the moment he walked up to my mom and started screaming, all the men stood up.

38:54.160 --> 38:58.640
They all put their newspaper down, like, OK, like you can bluster around me.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.360
But like the moment he started doing that to a woman, they took out their knives.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.160
We were here first.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.400
You never alone.

39:06.400 --> 39:11.440
I thought that I was going to turn out to be Alan Greenspan because he was raving about

39:11.440 --> 39:12.440
economics.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.440
All right.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.440
Let's.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.360
And that's why I broke the light bulb.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.360
Thank you.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.360
Yeah.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.360
That was a good story.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.360
I think I maybe just held it.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.360
You want to crawl in there?

39:21.360 --> 39:22.360
You want to make this a.

39:22.360 --> 39:28.400
Do you ever get so drunk that, like, you just turn into a, you're just an animal.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.200
That's right before you pass out.

39:30.200 --> 39:35.520
Hopefully you're off the road, out of public, but you're just like, you have reduced yourself

39:35.520 --> 39:38.880
to nothing but cortex.

39:38.880 --> 39:44.000
So I think if I did break that thing on purpose, it was because I had been, that's what I had

39:44.000 --> 39:45.160
achieved that state.

39:45.160 --> 39:50.720
I was like, just looking at it like, like I was on an alien planet and wanted to know

39:50.720 --> 39:52.240
how gravity worked.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.240
Like I was like.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.240
It feels good.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.240
It feels like it would feel good.

39:55.240 --> 39:59.800
I remember, I remember my emotional response to it shattering and going like, I just stood

39:59.800 --> 40:06.360
there and then I remember going, huh, but it was more like, it wasn't about the thing

40:06.360 --> 40:09.960
because it did exactly what glass is supposed to do when it breaks, but I was looking at

40:09.960 --> 40:12.080
myself and going, huh.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.680
That's what I do with my time.

40:13.680 --> 40:16.280
Broken person.

40:16.280 --> 40:23.640
You can just drop a human being from even, even, even the height of comfort and privilege.

40:23.640 --> 40:26.440
And it'll just, it'll just like, it just shatters.

40:26.440 --> 40:31.040
Like what I'm just, I just, it was like I pulled myself out of like, because I have nothing

40:31.040 --> 40:33.440
to, because I had nothing to be upset about.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.200
I, I did this thing.

40:35.200 --> 40:39.040
I think that's why rock stars like trash hotel rooms, because it's like you just, you can't

40:39.040 --> 40:42.000
manage all of the, everything's fine.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.960
Oh, here's another thing that would make me want to trash your hotel room is when I've

40:44.960 --> 40:49.600
spoken about it before, when they ornamentally put the, the Kleenex, like in a little beautiful

40:49.600 --> 40:54.960
lotus shape, you know, and then you take those out because those have been handled and folded

40:54.960 --> 40:59.840
into origami by the person who presumably had been cleaning up somebody else's poop.

40:59.840 --> 41:06.480
Uh, like no offense to the housekeeping industry, which is a noble, uh, wonderful, uh, profession.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.480
You take that out.

41:07.480 --> 41:08.480
So where the offense would have came from.

41:08.480 --> 41:09.480
And then.

41:09.480 --> 41:10.480
No offense, poop handlers.

41:10.480 --> 41:11.480
And we need that.

41:11.480 --> 41:17.840
And we take out the lotus blossom with five or to 12 Kleenexes and that's all of them.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.720
And then you fucking throw it out and you'd have no Kleenex now, except the ones that

41:20.720 --> 41:22.640
have been origami into sadness.

41:22.640 --> 41:26.720
Speaking of Kleenex, let's bring to the stage, uh, uh, he's performed for clubs and colleges

41:26.720 --> 41:38.040
all over America, uh, Rob Schrab, Rob Schrab, uh, uh, he looks pissed off.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.040
This doesn't bode well.

41:40.040 --> 41:44.120
Haven't they got out of the bed like it's like the couch at Johnny Carson where she

41:44.120 --> 41:46.120
had to move down to the, uh, to the panel.

41:46.120 --> 41:48.120
I want to give everyone a chance.

41:48.120 --> 41:49.120
Why don't you get in bed?

41:49.120 --> 41:50.120
Get Sped Shrek.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.120
Hello, Dan.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.120
Hello.

41:52.120 --> 42:03.120
Should I get in the bed like Lolly gets into the bed with Kate and I?

42:03.120 --> 42:10.360
That's it.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.360
Does she go under the covers?

42:12.360 --> 42:13.360
Yeah.

42:13.360 --> 42:15.040
Ah, go deep.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.040
Go deep.

42:16.040 --> 42:17.040
Yeah.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.040
That's Nigel.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.040
Except night.

42:19.040 --> 42:31.040
I find it hard to believe your job does this pretty much wraps butts right in Dan's face.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.480
I really didn't do that right, did I?

42:33.480 --> 42:36.280
No, you didn't get the wrong answers.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.760
It's really hot in there, right?

42:37.760 --> 42:41.640
He looked over at Kendo like, wow, New Yorkers are prudes.

42:41.640 --> 42:47.160
Like Nigel, Nigel does this, does it, but he doesn't, he, the way he digs is with both

42:47.160 --> 42:49.320
front paws in unison.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.320
So he like, oh really?

42:50.320 --> 42:52.400
Yeah, it's kind of funny.

42:52.400 --> 42:57.280
Also he's, he's back to full health now because he, he humped the fuck out of Harvey today.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.960
Does he know that that's not going to go anywhere?

42:59.960 --> 43:04.440
He's not doing it, he's absolutely doing it when, when they play fetch and Harvey gets

43:04.440 --> 43:09.200
the ball, he waits for Harvey to come back with the ball and then he humps him and then

43:09.200 --> 43:16.080
he like, he just like finishes, he does an orgasm, but he finishes dominating him and

43:16.080 --> 43:22.400
then he does this like hind leg like cat, cat, cat kind of burying a turd kind of move.

43:22.400 --> 43:26.040
Like he scrapes dirt, phantom dirt at Harvey.

43:26.040 --> 43:27.040
That's him spiking the football?

43:27.040 --> 43:28.040
Yeah.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.800
You just grate your giant so you get the ball whenever you want, but guess who, guess who

43:31.800 --> 43:33.880
gets the phantom fuck you?

43:33.880 --> 43:40.560
So when you went into the doctor and he opened the door and you're sitting, you know, in

43:40.560 --> 43:47.200
the robe and everything and you just pointed at your forehead, did it, did it take a look

43:47.200 --> 43:53.400
at it a long time and then went, oh you got this form of herpes, it's shingles?

43:53.400 --> 43:58.840
Yeah, well he, at first I told him about, I was like, look, I fell, but I think I also

43:58.840 --> 44:02.440
got a rash from like a New York pillowcase or something.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.480
Is that what they call them now?

44:05.480 --> 44:07.320
And he like zoomed in on the rash.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.400
A New York pillowcase is when you poop on somebody's chest.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.400
Yeah.

44:10.400 --> 44:14.240
I guess my doctor's really good or sees a ton of people with shingles because he was just

44:14.240 --> 44:22.360
like, I talked to him for like 10 seconds, I have, I have, I always record my doctor

44:22.360 --> 44:25.400
sessions in case he says something that I need to remember later.

44:25.400 --> 44:30.720
And the, the audio file from me walking, from him walking in, not me walking him, but him

44:30.720 --> 44:35.800
walking in to see me, to me walking out the door and remembering to hit stop, five minutes

44:35.800 --> 44:37.480
and seven seconds.

44:37.480 --> 44:43.920
And the guy like, like, boom, he like, I was like, I said a couple things about what, what

44:43.920 --> 44:44.920
I was thinking.

44:44.920 --> 44:45.920
I was all over the place.

44:45.920 --> 44:50.240
He's like looking at me while I was talking and he's like, you know what, worst case scenario,

44:50.240 --> 44:53.040
shingles, let's treat it like shingles because that's the worst.

44:53.040 --> 44:54.040
We got to treat that right away.

44:54.040 --> 44:55.040
If that's what it is.

44:55.040 --> 44:59.160
If it's something else who gives a fuck, when did he say herpes?

44:59.160 --> 45:00.160
He never said the word herpes.

45:00.160 --> 45:02.360
I had to find that out online.

45:02.360 --> 45:05.000
It's post herpetic something, right?

45:05.000 --> 45:06.560
I had the same thing.

45:06.560 --> 45:14.040
I had, I was on a bad flight like back from San Francisco and it was like, like going

45:14.040 --> 45:26.880
like over the intercom, like the stewardess was like, people just sit down, just sit down.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.480
You know, that's how bad it was.

45:28.480 --> 45:32.240
And I was just like holding on, holding my breath the entire time.

45:32.240 --> 45:39.720
And when I got off the plane, I had like this rash that was grew above my, my eyelid.

45:39.720 --> 45:46.280
And I went to the doctor and he looked at it and he was, oh, you got herpes, roster,

45:46.280 --> 45:47.280
zoster, zoster.

45:47.280 --> 45:48.280
Zoster, yeah.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.280
That's shingles.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.280
Yeah.

45:50.280 --> 45:51.280
I can't believe he called it that.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.280
Yeah.

45:52.280 --> 45:57.280
But, but I went, what, herpes, no, I mean, what, I mean, like, that's impossible.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.280
Yeah.

45:58.280 --> 45:59.280
Why do they give shingles such a fun name?

45:59.280 --> 46:00.520
I guess we're finding out why.

46:00.520 --> 46:06.880
You know, but, but he said it like, oh, that's herpes and that guy and the, and what he should

46:06.880 --> 46:13.600
have done was not the kind you think of, because that's the only kind anybody thinks of.

46:13.600 --> 46:14.600
They don't think of it.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.600
Right.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.600
Is this the kind I have to say on dates?

46:16.600 --> 46:17.600
Yeah.

46:17.600 --> 46:18.600
Yeah.

46:18.600 --> 46:19.600
So, you know.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.480
That was his moment for that day to get some excitement or something.

46:21.480 --> 46:22.480
Yeah.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.480
He needed a response.

46:23.480 --> 46:28.880
But, but he didn't like, you know, so I was like, but it, what, I didn't rub my head on

46:28.880 --> 46:33.080
a thing that gives you the herpes I'm thinking.

46:33.080 --> 46:39.280
And, and he was, and he was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's, let's do wear one

46:39.280 --> 46:40.680
of the pussy hats though.

46:40.680 --> 46:41.680
Not one of those.

46:41.680 --> 46:43.920
That's why they made those pussy hats.

46:43.920 --> 46:52.880
So Keith Hymda, try to do it, to try to natural one there, Hymda, Keith more of a cut on it.

46:52.880 --> 46:53.880
I noticed that.

46:53.880 --> 46:54.880
How do you do it?

46:54.880 --> 46:55.880
Kick.

46:55.880 --> 46:56.880
No, how do you say her name?

46:56.880 --> 46:57.880
Hymda.

46:57.880 --> 46:58.880
And then now you say it.

46:58.880 --> 46:59.880
Hymda.

46:59.880 --> 47:00.880
See, it's different.

47:00.880 --> 47:01.880
He puts more of a cut.

47:01.880 --> 47:02.880
He was born in a different place.

47:02.880 --> 47:03.880
I'm finally getting it right.

47:03.880 --> 47:04.880
Took 13 years.

47:04.880 --> 47:08.880
You guys ever, you guys ever have a fight in all those thousands of episodes?

47:08.880 --> 47:09.880
Yes.

47:09.880 --> 47:15.440
Like, like, I mean, like, like, like a bad one, not like it's, oh, this is such provocative

47:15.440 --> 47:20.120
entertainment because they disagree so much, but like you fight and it's like, shit, they're

47:20.120 --> 47:21.120
like pissed.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.120
Yeah.

47:22.120 --> 47:23.120
Yeah.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.120
What was it called?

47:24.120 --> 47:27.200
That there's the first one that we had, we don't bring up old fights.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.200
I don't know.

47:28.200 --> 47:29.880
He, he shed it off in the middle.

47:29.880 --> 47:31.240
He's like, well, now we're really fighting.

47:31.240 --> 47:35.560
I was like, but we do everything else on air, so just turn it back on and let's finish.

47:35.560 --> 47:40.240
And it was, it actually helped because a lot of times he'll just stare at me when I'm,

47:40.240 --> 47:44.360
when I'm trying to argue with him and it's like, how boring is that and how much, like,

47:44.360 --> 47:45.360
how far he can go.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.360
She has all the points anyway, you know.

47:46.360 --> 47:47.360
Yeah.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.360
And he just really just literally stares.

47:48.360 --> 47:50.400
But if, if he's in front of a mic, he can't stare.

47:50.400 --> 47:52.040
So he was forced to respond to me.

47:52.040 --> 47:56.480
Are you in new relationships now or is this still like, are you, oh, no, this is like

47:56.480 --> 47:57.480
10, 10 years ago.

47:57.480 --> 47:58.480
She's married now.

47:58.480 --> 47:59.480
Oh, okay.

47:59.480 --> 48:00.480
Yeah.

48:00.480 --> 48:01.480
Yes.

48:01.480 --> 48:02.920
Whereas Keith is holding on to this for dear life.

48:02.920 --> 48:03.920
Who knows?

48:03.920 --> 48:05.920
You just live the universe will give what the universe gives, right?

48:05.920 --> 48:09.000
It's going to all be the universe fucking with me.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.200
Keith, do you think there are good and bad people?

48:12.200 --> 48:14.240
Yeah, of course.

48:14.240 --> 48:16.160
Like what do you think is responsible for that?

48:16.160 --> 48:19.600
Do you think they're boring, good and bad or do you think it's their, they just get

48:19.600 --> 48:21.640
the luck of the draw and they're no better.

48:21.640 --> 48:24.120
A lot of it starts with, you know, it just is what it is.

48:24.120 --> 48:29.480
And then you, you take your personality, whichever way you want, you realize people

48:29.480 --> 48:36.120
need help and you're here to serve or you don't and you're selfish.

48:36.120 --> 48:37.120
I think it's that simple.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.120
I think.

48:38.120 --> 48:43.320
So we're being tested every day in big and small ways to like, like usually we can get

48:43.320 --> 48:46.440
by by probably not like doing too much of an extreme choice.

48:46.440 --> 48:51.920
But basically there are people who are like, you know what, it's, it's been three Wednesdays

48:51.920 --> 48:55.960
in a row since Mercury's in retrograde and I'm just going to kill this dog with a knife

48:55.960 --> 48:59.840
first, something like, like, like, like, like, I guess that's a bad example because it sounds

48:59.840 --> 49:01.840
like a compulsion that someone would have example.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.080
I feel like I missed the step.

49:03.080 --> 49:08.480
I'm trying to think of like, because I don't know if I, I think it's like being healthy.

49:08.480 --> 49:13.280
I think everybody prefers to be in shape, but they don't want to do the work.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.280
Yes.

49:14.280 --> 49:15.280
You know, they don't want to exercise.

49:15.280 --> 49:16.480
They don't want to eat healthy.

49:16.480 --> 49:19.480
But if they did, they would look better and probably feel better.

49:19.480 --> 49:24.720
And I think that's what it's like to be, I think when you're bad, when you're evil,

49:24.720 --> 49:28.120
when you're being lazy, and when you're being good, you're actually putting some effort

49:28.120 --> 49:29.120
into life.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.120
Yes.

49:30.120 --> 49:31.120
I don't know.

49:31.120 --> 49:32.120
I have a problem.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.120
I have a problem.

49:33.120 --> 49:34.120
I mean, I don't have a problem.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.560
You guys are allowed to think that way because I'm a good person.

49:37.560 --> 49:44.160
But I just, I just feel like then I, but then I start to like micro scope that and go, well,

49:44.160 --> 49:52.440
yeah, but if I'm, if I'm lazy and then I decide to start working out, like, okay, now I feel

49:52.440 --> 49:56.460
like I'm a good person because it was harder to do that than it was, but it's still what

49:56.460 --> 49:57.960
I felt like doing.

49:57.960 --> 49:58.960
I mean, you get it.

49:58.960 --> 50:03.520
I guess it gets into that whole stupid philosophical, like, free will versus fate thing.

50:03.520 --> 50:08.320
I mean, like, if my brain chemistry is going to result, are we onto some synaptic level

50:08.320 --> 50:10.520
making fucking choices?

50:10.520 --> 50:16.480
Like, and it's like this, like, if I'm like, if Kate says, hey, let's go for a hike, I

50:16.480 --> 50:31.440
go, like I'm there, and then, but if I go, I, I'm walking and I'm having a good time

50:31.440 --> 50:32.440
and it's nice.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.080
And then I go, I'm glad I did that.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.960
I like doing that.

50:35.960 --> 50:36.960
That's fun.

50:36.960 --> 50:46.320
I always say, what if she says, whenever I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I

50:46.320 --> 50:48.600
go, whenever she says, let's go for a hike.

50:48.600 --> 50:52.200
So the next time she says, let's go for a hike, I know this time I'm not going to do

50:52.200 --> 50:53.200
that noise.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.200
But do you do it anyway?

50:54.200 --> 50:55.200
I do it anyway.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.200
All right.

50:56.200 --> 50:57.200
Yeah.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.200
Yeah.

50:58.200 --> 51:01.880
I kind of like, maybe, maybe good and bad is maybe the way I can buy into it is, is healthy

51:01.880 --> 51:02.880
and unhealthy.

51:02.880 --> 51:04.000
Like, we all get depressed.

51:04.000 --> 51:09.040
We all get like, and, and so, or like, it's like a sink full of dishes, like nobody wants

51:09.040 --> 51:15.000
to do the dishes, but like, you don't, it's not like, oh, this battle of, it's just sort

51:15.000 --> 51:20.320
of like, like, I don't know, if somebody told you that eating a dog turd made you live another

51:20.320 --> 51:24.680
50 years, you either, you either eat the dog turd or you don't.

51:24.680 --> 51:27.520
And I don't think that makes you a good or a bad person.

51:27.520 --> 51:32.560
But you, if you eat it and they were telling the truth and you live for another 50 years,

51:32.560 --> 51:34.360
there might be all kinds of other side effects too.

51:34.360 --> 51:38.360
Like, oh, the reason for that is because there's like an enzyme in dog turds that like also

51:38.360 --> 51:43.640
like lifts your psychology or it's like, there's vitamin D in dog turds and all this stuff.

51:43.640 --> 51:46.920
So along the way, you're gaining all these benefits and you're like thinking more clearly

51:46.920 --> 51:51.360
and you're, so then, and then you're like, well, dude, I ate dog shit the other day and

51:51.360 --> 51:52.640
I feel like a million bucks.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.760
So then this homeless guy goes, hey, can I have two dollars?

51:54.760 --> 51:58.480
And you're like, you know what, fuck it, here's two dollars and that Jim Carrey movie kind

51:58.480 --> 51:59.480
of thing.

51:59.480 --> 52:01.960
And you're like, so the whole time, it's like, it's like, you could, I think it's like, you

52:01.960 --> 52:06.680
could, that's the way I look at it is like, there's people who are in, in like, they're

52:06.680 --> 52:10.840
like resonating with the, they're like sick and there's people who are.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.840
So yeah, he's kind of talking about that.

52:12.840 --> 52:16.120
He eats is more black and white and I'm more gray on the show and off.

52:16.120 --> 52:21.880
So for example, a close friend of mine, we actually were roommates with each other with

52:21.880 --> 52:22.880
my husband.

52:22.880 --> 52:23.880
What's that?

52:23.880 --> 52:24.880
Bill Johnny.

52:24.880 --> 52:25.880
You were close.

52:25.880 --> 52:26.880
Yes.

52:26.880 --> 52:27.880
Johnny.

52:27.880 --> 52:30.520
You know, and he was, he was our roommate for a little while and we could sense that

52:30.520 --> 52:36.440
he was the stress of life was starting to kind of skew his thinking and skew like his

52:36.440 --> 52:40.640
response to life in general and to go into work and things like that.

52:40.640 --> 52:43.400
And then we had to separate ways.

52:43.400 --> 52:49.400
We were all moving and he got butt hurt about it and spray painted the entire house and

52:49.400 --> 52:53.760
just let me be clear how bad the spray painting was, not only on all the walls, but like an

52:53.760 --> 52:55.960
asshole in all the corners.

52:55.960 --> 52:59.800
So when you repay, you have to repaint the corner.

52:59.800 --> 53:00.800
Fuck you.

53:00.800 --> 53:05.200
So, so it didn't happen hurt by painting before.

53:05.200 --> 53:06.200
It's not good.

53:06.200 --> 53:07.200
I'd rather eat dog shit.

53:07.200 --> 53:08.200
I'm not exaggerating.

53:08.200 --> 53:09.200
It makes you live long.

53:09.200 --> 53:11.360
I'm hearing good things.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.960
So his point was this guy is just bad news.

53:13.960 --> 53:17.160
He's a bad person and, you know, no one should deal with him.

53:17.160 --> 53:22.920
He should be locked up for however long and, and my thing is he should be spray painted.

53:22.920 --> 53:31.160
His brain glitched and I should stay away from him for now, but I believe that he can,

53:31.160 --> 53:36.640
he can find another path and become a good person until he does.

53:36.640 --> 53:37.640
Keith is right.

53:37.640 --> 53:40.560
Well, it's not about that.

53:40.560 --> 53:41.560
It just is.

53:41.560 --> 53:42.560
Yeah.

53:42.560 --> 53:47.520
I remember, I've told this story before because like I broke up with a girlfriend or she,

53:47.520 --> 53:48.520
she broke up with me.

53:48.520 --> 53:53.800
So I was all fucked off about it and she was mutual friends with all my friends and like,

53:53.800 --> 53:58.440
and then I was, I was just handling the breakup really poorly and I just like, I couldn't

53:58.440 --> 54:04.640
stop thinking about her and all this stuff and I was just a drag to be around and, and,

54:04.640 --> 54:10.000
and I found out that everybody was in Palm Springs without me and, and I was like, what

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
the fuck?

54:11.000 --> 54:12.800
You guys don't even like me now.

54:12.800 --> 54:16.120
You like her more than me and all this stuff and I was like, it's just having this terrible

54:16.120 --> 54:22.520
day and, and, and my friend Dino said, look, I know we love you.

54:22.520 --> 54:26.680
We just, it's, it's not a, it's not a bad, it doesn't make you a bad person if people

54:26.680 --> 54:28.480
don't want to be around you.

54:28.480 --> 54:29.480
It's like you have a cold.

54:29.480 --> 54:31.400
It's like you have snot dripping out of your face.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.360
Like we can't wait for you to get better.

54:33.360 --> 54:38.160
And I was like, oh, oh, and then I was just like, yeah, okay, so I'm sick.

54:38.160 --> 54:44.000
Like I have a sickness called like I, I hate myself and I hate my girlfriend and I hate

54:44.000 --> 54:48.680
my friends and I hate everybody and I wish that, you know, it's like, it's just all sickness.

54:48.680 --> 54:53.160
She had a sickness called forgetting to bring tense water and food to a camping trip.

54:53.160 --> 54:54.160
Well, that's what you get.

54:54.160 --> 54:56.160
Don't fucking choose her.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.160
That's true.

54:57.160 --> 54:59.040
I went to a hospital, a hospital, Jesus Christ.

54:59.040 --> 55:00.840
I went to a hotel.

55:00.840 --> 55:01.840
We heard.

55:01.840 --> 55:09.600
We heard because I, I just didn't trust that camping would be fun with that group of friends.

55:09.600 --> 55:14.680
And sure enough, they forgot to bring everything essential and they all had to like go back

55:14.680 --> 55:20.240
on making fun of me for getting the hotel and they all came and stayed in my hotel jerks.

55:20.240 --> 55:23.000
What do they think a camping trip is?

55:23.000 --> 55:26.600
They think it's bringing tents and bringing food and water, but they forgot to do all

55:26.600 --> 55:27.600
those things.

55:27.600 --> 55:28.600
Oh.

55:28.600 --> 55:29.600
They left it all back at home.

55:29.600 --> 55:30.600
That sounds like the good drugs.

55:30.600 --> 55:31.600
Yeah.

55:31.600 --> 55:36.360
And I did the acid and found myself sitting on a rock in the moonlight talking to a rattlesnake.

55:36.360 --> 55:38.360
We were wondering if you were homeless.

55:38.360 --> 55:41.320
We were like, we'll support you.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.320
What did the rattlesnake say?

55:43.320 --> 55:44.320
Rattlesnake was being groovy.

55:44.320 --> 55:46.600
I'm afraid of snakes.

55:46.600 --> 55:49.040
I sat on a rock and the rock was talking to me.

55:49.040 --> 55:50.040
Going on, Jeff.

55:50.040 --> 55:51.040
Oh, it's a status.

55:51.040 --> 55:52.040
Oh, it's a status.

55:52.040 --> 55:53.040
And it was talking to me.

55:53.040 --> 55:54.560
Did he tell you to eat the apple?

55:54.560 --> 55:56.840
But I kept hearing a bug going.

55:56.840 --> 55:57.840
Eat these apples.

55:57.840 --> 55:58.840
It's a sketch.

55:58.840 --> 55:59.840
It's a sketch.

55:59.840 --> 56:00.840
It's a sketch, Davis.

56:00.840 --> 56:02.840
You're in a thing right now.

56:02.840 --> 56:03.840
You're in my thing.

56:03.840 --> 56:04.840
Oh, yeah.

56:04.840 --> 56:06.600
You should totally eat the apple.

56:06.600 --> 56:07.600
Eat my nuts.

56:07.600 --> 56:10.240
Is it a nut tree?

56:10.240 --> 56:13.440
Eat my nuts.

56:13.440 --> 56:14.440
Eat my balls.

56:14.440 --> 56:15.440
Eat my nuts.

56:15.440 --> 56:20.400
Wait, is this the rattlesnake talking and sitting next to me on the rock?

56:20.400 --> 56:22.120
Eat my nuts, Dan.

56:22.120 --> 56:24.520
Why are you calling me Dan?

56:24.520 --> 56:25.520
Sorry.

56:25.520 --> 56:26.520
Okay.

56:26.520 --> 56:27.520
This is a snake, not me.

56:27.520 --> 56:28.520
Oh.

56:28.520 --> 56:37.200
I'm afraid of snakes, especially poisonous snakes, kill you in the middle of the night

56:37.200 --> 56:38.200
snakes.

56:38.200 --> 56:41.200
And baby snakes are going to bite you first because they're not trained to kind of keep

56:41.200 --> 56:42.200
it cool.

56:42.200 --> 56:43.200
And they eat you from the toes up.

56:43.200 --> 56:46.680
The snake is not going to eat me from the toes up.

56:46.680 --> 56:47.680
Eat, they eat you from.

56:47.680 --> 56:48.680
Did you see that elephant?

56:48.680 --> 56:49.680
They got eaten.

56:49.680 --> 56:52.120
I think you're dead by the time it starts eating you, though.

56:52.120 --> 56:53.120
That's how they do it.

56:53.120 --> 56:54.120
That's how they get you.

56:54.120 --> 56:55.120
Yeah.

56:55.120 --> 56:56.120
Start with the toes.

56:56.120 --> 56:57.120
So you can't run away.

56:57.120 --> 56:58.420
They have bugs in them.

56:58.420 --> 57:01.760
And the rock is talking to me.

57:01.760 --> 57:04.880
And look over, and now it's a rattlesnake.

57:04.880 --> 57:09.040
A little baby rattlesnake sitting right next to me, I'm like, hey, little buddy.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.080
You should move on.

57:11.080 --> 57:16.540
And Mark Rivers comes up with a big floodlight, and he goes, Jeff, get the fuck out of there.

57:16.540 --> 57:19.580
I was like, hey, man, I'm fucking high.

57:19.580 --> 57:20.580
I was grooving.

57:20.580 --> 57:22.040
I was groovedastic with a rattlesnake.

57:22.040 --> 57:23.940
Next day it was not on acid.

57:23.940 --> 57:26.360
And duck taped my pants around my boots.

57:26.360 --> 57:29.440
because there were snakes all over the goddamn giant.

57:29.440 --> 57:30.680
All right, I got one.

57:30.680 --> 57:33.160
So you guys brought duct tape but not a tent.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.960
Just wondering.

57:34.960 --> 57:35.800
I came quite prepared.

57:35.800 --> 57:38.480
There's a lot of ducts out in the desert.

57:38.480 --> 57:39.520
A lot of people don't know that.

57:39.520 --> 57:41.160
And then you can make tape out of them.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.000
How ignorant of me.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.080
Desert ducts are dangerous, the most dangerous.

57:44.080 --> 57:44.680
The worst.

57:44.680 --> 57:46.720
Because they're like, how the fuck did I end up out here

57:46.720 --> 57:48.680
where I can't even use a third of my ability?

57:48.680 --> 57:51.280
I can't even use a third of my ability.

57:51.280 --> 57:53.400
Sketch idea, duck desert.

57:53.400 --> 57:55.760
And damn it, I'm an all-terrain chicken.

57:55.760 --> 57:58.520
What am I doing in the one place where I can't rub

57:58.520 --> 57:59.520
that in the chicken's face?

57:59.520 --> 58:00.360
All right, come on.

58:00.360 --> 58:01.720
Here's the one thing.

58:01.720 --> 58:03.200
How handsome is Jeff?

58:03.200 --> 58:04.120
Yeah, it's too much.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.200
He's good-looking.

58:05.200 --> 58:06.200
But he's so handsome.

58:06.200 --> 58:07.200
Let's move on.

58:07.200 --> 58:08.040
Let's move on.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.200
Let's keep talking about it.

58:09.200 --> 58:09.700
I got my eyes.

58:09.700 --> 58:12.640
We're going to do the whole show about how good looking Jeff is.

58:12.640 --> 58:14.640
DeMorge, you were asleep for a while there.

58:14.640 --> 58:15.480
Were you not?

58:15.480 --> 58:16.480
Oh, Jesus Christ.

58:16.480 --> 58:17.280
DeMorge had passed out.

58:17.280 --> 58:18.680
Spencer, see her.

58:18.680 --> 58:21.280
Also, congratulations on Arsenal.

58:21.280 --> 58:23.160
I'm curious, do you grow out your hair

58:23.160 --> 58:24.160
and where your pajamas.

58:24.160 --> 58:26.440
And it's like, you can't even get close to comparing me

58:26.440 --> 58:27.920
to Jeff, because obviously.

58:27.920 --> 58:29.320
Yeah, I mean, that's my only hope.

58:29.320 --> 58:30.520
I'm not even trying to make it a contest.

58:30.520 --> 58:31.020
Exactly.

58:31.020 --> 58:31.880
He's a beautiful man.

58:31.880 --> 58:33.560
And he was a beautiful child.

58:33.560 --> 58:36.680
Stay under Jeff's bridge and charge to the toll

58:36.680 --> 58:40.120
for whoever comes over it.

58:40.120 --> 58:42.120
There's one thing now that my nervous system has jacked up.

58:42.120 --> 58:44.200
I wasn't going to save this for a non-Shingles.

58:44.200 --> 58:47.920
But now I can feel the herpes coursing through my fibers.

58:47.920 --> 58:50.840
I just wanted to bring up one thing

58:50.840 --> 58:56.280
and get to the bottom of it, Venetian blinds.

58:56.280 --> 58:57.880
What the fuck?

58:57.880 --> 59:00.840
Like, what is the fucking rule with what direction

59:00.840 --> 59:06.200
to pull the fucking string in to make them stay?

59:06.200 --> 59:09.440
Are you supposed to pull them to the left or the right?

59:09.440 --> 59:12.600
You pull them inward at a diagonal angle

59:12.600 --> 59:16.680
to have them go up and down, right?

59:16.680 --> 59:17.840
And stay?

59:17.840 --> 59:20.520
And then you pull it straight down for them

59:20.520 --> 59:22.320
to stop.

59:22.320 --> 59:24.040
It's like a hand job, kind of.

59:24.040 --> 59:27.360
What if I want to pull my Venetian blinds up halfway

59:27.360 --> 59:29.080
and lock them in place halfway?

59:29.080 --> 59:29.840
What am I doing?

59:29.840 --> 59:32.640
Yeah, so you pull diagonal until it's about halfway,

59:32.640 --> 59:35.360
and then you would then swivel over.

59:35.360 --> 59:40.120
Yeah, and then bring it, wheel it down so it's vertical.

59:40.120 --> 59:43.840
What the fuck is up with this backboard?

59:43.840 --> 59:44.960
Look at this shit.

59:44.960 --> 59:46.800
I get three sticks.

59:46.800 --> 59:47.520
He's got three sticks.

59:47.520 --> 59:49.320
No wonder my back hurts.

59:49.320 --> 59:53.120
The folks at home, the bed frame has three sticks

59:53.120 --> 59:56.400
and a large hole for a pillow to fall through.

59:56.400 --> 59:56.920
Yeah, it hurts.

59:56.920 --> 59:59.040
They just assume we've got a wall.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.840
I used the fact that I was hot to get out of there

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.520
because it was killing me.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.080
He said he was hot, but it was really the three sticks.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.040
Oh my god.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:07.680
It did my homework.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.320
Why is that even an option?

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.200
Do you want a backboard?

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.640
How about just the frame?

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.560
Not any of them.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.320
Just the frame.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.880
We've got to set this thing up before the show,

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.640
and putting the whole backboard up

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.080
is going to take some time.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.160
Grown-ass adults were finally tackling

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.240
the intricacies of Venetian blinds and Ikea headboards.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.120
How do you do you know how to work the fucking blinds

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.520
when you want to make them like, how about this?

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.960
Forget about how to lift them up and make them lock

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.160
because that's easy.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.600
Suppose they're halfway up, and what you want to do

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.640
is very quickly, very quickly, because you've

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.840
got other things on your mind.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.360
There's a reason you're going to close the blinds.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.480
How do you release them, and they go all the way down

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.640
without stopping a quarter of the way down?

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.520
You pull them at a diagonal slightly.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.920
You got to get after you do the diagonal,

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.120
you got to get a little lube.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.520
Schrab is about to play a dreamditch.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.440
Pull, you know, get some hymns.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.200
I think Ken's the cutest.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.480
I think Ken's the cutest.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.880
Diagonal.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.440
It's not intuitive, but once you get it down,

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.320
you're like, holy shit, am I a wizard?

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.040
If you look at the mechanism, if you look at the little sprocket

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.800
up there when you're doing it, it makes sense.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.560
No, I will.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.440
When you look at it, it does not make sense.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.600
It just looks confusing as fuck.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.680
Well, I'm an engineer.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.800
Yeah, no.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.920
Jeff's a genius, and I'm sure he understands it.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.840
Don't get me wrong.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.360
I come from a long line of levelers.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.400
And nobs.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.200
We changed our name to Davis during World War II

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.800
because levelers were also hoarding Nazi gold.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.360
Are you an outdoorsman, Keith?

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.160
No.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.620
I can play along for a little bit.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:50.260
I enjoy, I do enjoy camping because you're doing nothing.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.040
But no, I'm here in LA and it keeps running,

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.400
running in canyon and trying to get me to go.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.400
And I go, ah.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.280
I caught one of the conversations you were having.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.560
It caught a little piece of you talking about the landmark.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.600
Well, mind your fucking business.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.720
Did you really go to the landmark forum?

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.840
Yeah, Landmark is this it's a group setting. It's a therapy, but group therapy

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.920
So and I do not believe these guys can do one-on-one therapy

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:27.960
But my ex-wife when she left me and Landmark pushed her to do it she paid for me to go to so I thought that was sweet

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:33.440
No, I've had that but I've never gone because it just seems like like you know, yeah

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.160
You get your two or three lessons you could have got anywhere else

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:43.920
It's upwards of a thousand dollars and then other lessons they throw in are how to stand up for yourself

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.000
For and they have us doing an example and in this example

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.480
I will say to you

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:54.200
Why don't you come to a Landmark seminar and you tell me no right and then I will keep trying to convince you

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:59.120
You keep saying no until you've given me a thousand yeah, that is you standing up for yourself

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.560
I remember a friend of several friends who told me about it and then I got like

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.400
I remember one of them is that oh, I do this Landmark thing and I said is that a cult and

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:16.040
You know the tea hadn't in cult hadn't come out of my mouth and she without anger like a well-trained like a

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.640
aquarium

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.720
Creature like like like just like that that that saw a glint of a herring spoon and knows exactly which hoops to jump there was like

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.920
Do what do you know what a cult is the definition of a cult is the following things and she ran through the entire definition of a cult

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:36.000
I was like, can I add one thing which is that you have a rehearsed like speech about whether you're a cult?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.200
I think it's in their FAQs our guy no joke the guy leading the thing is like people are gonna ask you is it a cult and I'm like

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.200
All right, let me hear how you answer that. Well, then that's a cult. I want to be a part of

01:03:48.200 --> 01:04:02.800
I mean we are totally unfair to cult is like the word hipster in terms of religion like we just we just use it for things that we

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.120
Don't like I mean we we just like oh, it's creepy or it's weird or we don't like it like we

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:15.040
I'll tell you the definition later because you could be a Mormon and talk about someone else's religion as if it's a cult

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:21.480
I remember when I was in like senior year of high school and I was like gonna go to Madison

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:28.000
We're gonna drive up to Madison and and parents are like why are you going to Madison? It's like, oh, I'm gonna go see this

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.400
Move this cult movie at midnight. It's gonna be cool and they sat me down

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:42.680
And I had they gave me this lecture about like how cults are bad and that it's against Jesus Christ

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:49.200
And we're really really upset. We really are concerned about what you're going to do why you want to see this

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.240
I'm gonna see the Toxic Avenger. What the fuck?

01:04:52.880 --> 01:05:01.040
Are you serious Dave and Donna? That's what you think I'm gonna go see the Toxic of fucking Avenger at midnight at Madison

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.400
And you're worried about my immortal soul

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.080
So close to your mom movie

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.580
Well, they had been the see death race

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:14.980
2000 did you go fuck? Yeah, I went man. Did you join the cult? Yeah?

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:19.660
I bought the t-shirt and drank the Kool-Aid man. Did you buy the sneakers?

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.780
We're just I have been going to Buddhist temple

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:36.460
It's quite it's been quite good. Are you like it? Are you meditating and yeah, it's great. Yeah, are you Zen?

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:41.740
Yeah, yeah, it's going good. Is that why you shaved recently? What's that like?

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.660
To fit in with the monks. No, I'm bald. I know but it looks good

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.340
Thank you

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:55.620
It's like you you freshen you freshen it up. I freshened it up. How regularly do you go? Huh?

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:58.340

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:03.100
So so you chill every last Monday

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:16.100
For the next hour. I want you to go out to the phones

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:22.100
I want you to call five people for every five people you get into Buddhism. You come back. I know that actually didn't happen

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:28.780
That's not what they did but the guy the leader the whatever the what the president that sits in the front

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:33.540
What is the president? What's the guy the president Buddha? No, no, no

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:37.460
Dale Buddha no

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:44.900
He's crazy the Bodhisattva like Jim Carrey type, you know, he would like oh, so we do Jim Carrey. We do this

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:52.460
We do this a little bit like he would be like so does anybody have any questions

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.140
He was

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.500
It's 9-eleven what's happening

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:10.660
It's every time you look isn't it it's too late it's actually 11 6 Steve Levy you think of everything

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.180
Not in front of the New Yorkers

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:21.820
It's a big joke to us out here wow we give all the shingles we do all the 9-elevens

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:27.660
Okay, okay. Hey, let me ask you guys this if you want to get out of this new bed some bugs

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:35.380
Right, right, right. I told my I told my landlord once. I'm like I'm very sure that I saw one bed bug

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.980
He's like oh, okay. You think I should call somebody

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.700
Like it's your place

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.980
I'm like it's your place should I should I call one exterminator

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:56.300
So Keith and Kimda that was the what at this point

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:05.700
Do we podcast for other people or for ourselves, why do you keep doing it since you've been doing it longer?

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.540
We're changing the road a little bit each time. We'll be done in two and a half years. Oh

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.460
We both both we

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:18.620
There's obviously just egomaniacs and haven't figured it out and as soon as we do we'll stop

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:21.900
There's a nerds to do it and also pays our bills

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:27.860
But you know obviously getting in letters about that sound almost like we save the person's life

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:32.780
That's beyond thrilling. So you're saying it's possible to do a podcast for years and years and make money at it. Yes

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:40.540
Wait a second. Well, we might need to look at this. I mean now that we're on Starburns. We're rich

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.540
Huh, wait a second

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:48.580
We'll be talking maybe I mean all I've gotten is underwear out of this and which is underwear

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:54.940
Huh, and me socks. I don't have any me socks and blue apron. We never give me a fucking anything

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:59.420
Well, that's because he didn't ask because they would if you wanted for a boner pill company

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.420
I don't need a boner pill company

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:06.700
Up your eyeballs and boner dick works and I'm fucking shilling prove it prove

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:13.420
Yeah, four hymns isn't about making your dick work. It's about making sure your dick doesn't stop working

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:17.580
Do you think I could fit under this bed? Yes. Yeah, no, definitely. I

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.900
Was it right? Oh

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.020
No, what happened at work today sweetheart

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:36.740
Oh, what do you guys do the bed and hurt himself really bad yourself? It's not like

01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.860
They're not a sturdy frame. This is the opposite of stage diving

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.420
Now that you guys have a guest driven

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:50.420
podcast like what what do you have any pointers on like like how to do good interviews or

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.100
like like like is there anything to when you're in the when you're but

01:09:54.100 --> 01:10:00.020
Is it I think it's about being present and you don't want distractions going on perhaps

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:06.380
So that you can have a real connection with the guest because it's like the word guest is like they're your guests

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:12.780
Like you want to treat them with respect and know that you know, you're there and they're gonna make your show

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:19.180
They're there for you. They're there for you as much as they are for them. Yeah, so just do do do unto others

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:23.820
Yes, just show that you care and that you respected their time

01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.580
Right. Who is your favorite?

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:30.300
guest that you guys have ever had we had a guest that just

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.780
The chair was normal

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.300
That was a good time

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:41.500
That sounds really fun. How did that go? It went very well because then you can get to know them

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.100
They share what's happening on in their lives

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:50.100
You're you're saying something that you can relate to and you actually leave there. Everybody learn something

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:54.560
We'd be out of it. Right. And you're probably cementing

01:10:55.060 --> 01:11:00.260
forming new relationships. You're forming new bonds. You're forming new bonds people

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:04.260
And I think that's the excitement and even after doing this for over 13 years

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:11.300
You still you still learn from each person you learn from new people when you open yourself up to new people

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.460
You can really learn a lot that you couldn't otherwise if you close yourself off

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:19.260
Yeah, and I'm not saying 44 is old but even at 44 you think all right

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:24.940
Did I meet every different kind of person and when you get people to open up you really didn't so you're my age

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.260
You're my age. You're actually

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.620
That means you've been doing this for so long. I'm not your age. I knew your age

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:36.780
And I wanted to get you to say it. Oh, I'm 32. Oh, Jesus. No, I'm 24. Oh because you would have been eight when

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.780
All right

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:47.000
Now Dan, yeah, are we worried about your drinking? Uh, I don't know. Okay. I mean I did all I can go ahead

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:51.180
Worry away if that's what you drunk. You fought like a line

01:11:54.340 --> 01:12:00.380
Everybody everybody's got their own medicine for a lot of people worrying about my drinking seems to get them through the day I

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.660
Got my own methods

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.620
How's he doing under there? He's he's he's he's he's making some headway

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.620
literally I

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:17.340
Don't I don't want to check with him about what his goals were he I remember him saying do you think I can get under the bed?

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:22.100
I think I I think I got under. Yeah, he's definitely under. I got under the bed

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:28.540
Whoever uses the space I only I could get out. No, I don't think I could get out of the well

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:34.060
That's yeah, I don't you should have done that before you tried to go into the bed, Schrab. I think I'm stuck under the bed now

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.420
That might be okay. Did you find the honey?

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:42.180
Yeah, it's there any under there. I think I found the honey. Winnie the Pooh. Oh, okay

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:46.740
His way that poos. He's notoriously stuck under. Oh, he gets. Oh, yeah

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.860
He gets stuck in his little took us a stick and out of the

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:54.460
And then somebody puts a vodka bottle up his butt. It's like the same thing. Everyone's having a good time

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:56.460
I didn't think that was funny

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:59.580
You did right. Yeah, it's a different time. I'm pretty sure it was funny

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.020
Look at what you were wearing gross, right?

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:08.020
Sure, if you didn't want a giant kettle one bottle up your butt, you don't know that I

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:15.900
Just found out that my favorite children's book is there's a live adaptation of it happening somewhere in the area

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.060
Rancho Cucamuca, what's it called? Cucamonga?

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:28.780
Yeah, Ricky Tickey Tavi. No, that's not my favorite little puppy. Nope. That's not it

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:34.460
Dr. But see spot run. Nope. My favorite is the hard-to-get turtle. No, I

01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.940
Guess that was a yeah, I love that one

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:47.580
With all those animals with all those turtles and colors hard to get and word problems and word problems

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:52.180
My favorite is Frederick by Leo Leonee boo. Oh, God

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.180
Jesus

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:06.860
My mom hated the hungry hungry caterpillar and she used to talk to other moms that were like my son's reading the hungry hungry

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.180
Caterpillar and she's like fucking hipsters. I

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:16.820
Like I was a good book, but you know, whatever I liked there's a monster at the end of this book

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:22.940
Oh, yeah, and it was you all along. No, it was Grover. Oh, I thought it was a mirror

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:28.140
Yeah, it was a mirror. Did you get like a used book and so I just drew Grover

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.620
His mom was a cheapy-peepie

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:39.160

Too too much like

I don't want to bring them into this world or too much like responsibility like I still have to be a baby

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.560
I yeah, I can't even believe that I'm in my 40s

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.640
I I still want somebody to make me dinner and do the things

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.120
so I don't know why I would get up and also my brothers both had had kids and

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:28.000
And they both said it's so much more work than we thought and I was like, that's all mom and dad talked about that

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.920
We were just a big pain in the ass only there was a book on it

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.960
I like being a lazy uncle, you know

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.240
You get to buy impractical gifts, and you don't have to fucking hang out. I've never changed a poopy poops

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.880
Well, there's good people there's bad people right? I'm a bad person

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:50.520
I don't want the poops or the peas or the thing you should probably wait until you have an uncontrollable like oh my god

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:54.360
I got to have one and not that other feeling which is like, oh, I bet they're great

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.120
Yeah, I don't I never I think I got that because I was

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:04.560
Um, they were teaching me to want that so like at 18 I felt my clock ticking

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.300
But then when I turned 30, I was like, oh everything they said was bullshit, and then I just went about my day

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:14.600
It was great. What a revelation to realize that's like a nightmare so many lies

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.800
Yeah, you got a fucking hang out with them all the time, and what if they're a dick?

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.760
Yeah, I mean you don't even know for years, and then it's like too late to take it back

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.720
It's like crazy. There's no way you have a bad kid

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.840
There's no way that I would have a child and the child be just mellow, right?

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:33.000
And then they blame you yeah, and I would they would be right and I would want to not hang out

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Yeah, always wearing a suit

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960
Jeff's kid

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.960
This guy's cramp in my style trying to wear my suits, but you're not fucking tall enough for that shit

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:49.680
Yeah, you can't I'll be into Minecraft pretty heavily and then I'll be like thinking about the dog needing to go out

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:53.400
And I'm kind of like you know it's an animal I can hold it

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.880
You know and I'm like if you had a kid you never know way right, but then I think about

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:01.320
You know

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.320
Making a little Cody

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.160
You got the name. Oh, no my girlfriend's name is Cody and

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:12.040
And and you know you're not gonna get a little Cody you're gonna get a giant damn

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.720
Cody half fucking horrible shit monster everyone wants a girl

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:25.720
Yeah, that's true get a girl you have to like think about every true crime podcast you've heard and if you have a guy

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:31.360
You can just be like where you going? Oh, no. All right, fine. Let me tell you a rape story. I read what's that a rape story?

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:37.400
Yes, please get the least we can provide you with as a guest, please have a rape corner

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:42.520
You have your own segment here. It's deadly. What's the what's the latest one that you?

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.440
Do I'm sure this will be good

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.840
Welcome to Keith Malley

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.400
He was right, okay

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.440
So this kid thinks he has a relationship with his teacher because he's very mature

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:16.280
But no the teachers just using them and invites him over to his house and a sex with the child

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.640
Keith Malley. Oh Keith Malley

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.520
That really happened probably

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.800
How about that golden state which one of those characters was you Keith?

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.720
Don't worry. It happened. Do you guys not care about the Golden State killer getting caught because you're in the Eagle State?

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.600
We're still crying about 9-11 too busy not forgetting. What's that? You guys moved on quick. No, we never forget

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.360
Yeah, we set the alarm. That was 11 minutes ago. Keith get over it. I think that alarm was to show off

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:49.480
You want someone to pull you out by the feet Rob. No, no, no do not do that if New York is

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.040
Nickname we've never said it to each other and what's the New York?

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.320
Equivalent of the Golden State the Big Apple is no, that's the city

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:06.580
The entire salad the whole state is fruit salad. I don't care. I can't I can't stay mad at you fruit basket

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:11.960
Yeah, I don't I feel bad. I don't know. All right, then the Empire State, right? Oh the Empire State

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:19.560
Jeff I totally got credit for that. That was that was amazing that you've had that trivia Handa. Thank you

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:25.320
How did you think of that? That's a crazy sometimes it comes to you. It's like when you've been podcasting this long, right?

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:31.800
It's just the experience. Yeah, we don't have that. It's like a light bulb, but then you don't throw it on the ground and let it chatter

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.960
Right, it's like a light bulb that you hold

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:41.320
Have you gone back to Israel since you were four? I have yeah, we used to go a lot every summer every other summer and then

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:48.200
Like ten years ago, my parents moved back. I went a couple times, but we no longer speak. So you don't speak to your parents anywhere

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.440
I can't tell if I don't speak to them or if they don't speak to me, but we're not speaking Wow

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:56.780
Yeah, it's just kind of like fell apart. That's like you Dan and your folks

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:04.920
Well, I speak to my folks, but I could see I mean, I don't want my parents to hear me say I could see but it's it's like

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:11.240
It's not held together with the kind of talk to your brother anymore, right? You have a niece that you don't know

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.200
I've never met. It's like Sesame Street bullshit

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.120
Why don't you talk to your brother anymore?

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:23.000
My brother guy I talked shit about him on the podcast. What'd you say? What'd you say about him?

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.400
I implied that that there was a strange kind of thing when I was growing up between him and my mom

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.760
I was just trying to be more glib than anything, you know

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:39.120
I don't see what the big deal about that is that sounds like fine, but I like I thought after I after I did it

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.040
No, you know, it's like I was like, oh shit my brother. I don't want my brother to hear that

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:49.720
I don't want my brother to stumble onto this by himself, you know, like so even though it sucks to like turn him on to it

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.040
Because it could just get away with it

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.040
I'm gonna it would be so much worse if he just

01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:00.720
Wandered into it that I have to it's hard to guess that though because maybe if only it's only telling him

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.400
It must be so bad if you felt you had to give it to him

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:09.640
Exactly, I just but at that point it's kind of like it was the only right thing to do after the wrong

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.480
I had done was it's like you probably shouldn't talk about other people you should try not to I mean say was it was it real

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:21.160
Oh, it was that's why it was so mad. Well, I mean it was it wasn't

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:27.360
subjective though, it was it was it was it was I was sharing a subjective like kind of feeling as it's just like

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.600
My mom and my brother had like an intense more intense relationship than

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:36.000
Then then then me and my mom had got I was like in front of a crowd

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.040
So I kind of like you know as I said, I like I don't know I like I like I like being like

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:48.040
When I I don't like talking about my family anymore has to go running or something just there for

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.000
Like I like I've now since like I've been I've been doing this for so long

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.160
And now I've gone through phases and one of them is like I don't like I just try to avoid talking about anybody

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.160
But myself as much as I can

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.560
And but back then I didn't really have any kind of rules

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.040
I was still coming from a zone of like, you know, what whatever the fuck, you know

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.960
If you encountered me in your life, then you're part of my fucking

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.720
Tapestry and and so I

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:19.600
When I heard it afterwards and I was like I better I better email my brother so that

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:26.240
And then I emailed him and the problem the email is do you think you should listen to it? I don't think it's too much

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.600
It's probably silly, but you should anyway. I'm definitely gonna keep it in my show. Oh, yeah

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:37.920
Well, I'm not gonna fucking respect your brother. Yeah, because it's not like I gave his address and like like said go talk to him about it

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.840
It's just like I mean it was just implied you have sex with mom. It was

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:48.440
I'd be more alarmed that someone referred to me as my own chosen nickname Darth Vader

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.200
Well, yeah, I mean, I think it was all in there

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.760
I think I kind of did a run where I was like

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.360
Let me tell you about my brother and then so I heard it

01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:01.920
I was like I better I better I better tip him off that I clowned him if I want to try to salvage anything because he might get mad

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.800
He might he might not though. He might be like whatever you fucking turd like like

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.000
And I any he must have listened to it and then he emailed me back

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.720
And he was like he was just really kind of inconsolable about it

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.280
I probably also wasn't very good at resolving that kind of thing back then so I

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:25.120
Like that's why I don't talk to him. It was also kind of coincided with him having the kid that I've never met because and I think it was

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:31.280
In some in some respects. I like what he said sounded healthy to me, which is like, oh, I just had a kid

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:37.920
I'm sick of this family like I have a chance at a fresh start here, which is something that my therapist constantly echoes, too

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.920
She's like you don't have to don't let people tell you that you have to like, you know

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.920
Have this connection to these Walton mountains that you grew up on, you know

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.480
Like that sometimes like just let them be, you know, like, you know, like thanks

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.640
Like like like you got to find your own thing and like like like so and my brother was like

01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:00.880
Yeah, it's my chance to start my own thing and like start it fresh and like my daughter will never know this weird

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:09.760
Right, she'll never she'll never know is her her her uncle. This is uncomfortable, but I hope okay. Let's bring him out

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:17.240
Oh, how old is your nephew that you've never met me sneeze me? Sorry, I don't know

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.560
Over over over 10 and you've never spoken to her never

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.280
any drive-bys

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:31.840
No, no start crying. No, I think my mom sent me a couple pictures. What's the last time you cry? Oh

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.400
Really really recently like I cried I crying therapy

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.680
I'll cry I cried at cocoa

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.720
Give a cry happy that just like to see some beautiful weather or something like that

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.280
I guess cocoa is kind of a happy cry right you crying because you're happy for the

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.960
Mexican people they're

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:53.880
Happy they're dead or whatever. Well, I think you missed the point, but yeah

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.320
I haven't seen cocoa so don't spoil it for me, but I assume he's wrong

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.920
No, you're supposed to be happy the they're the dead Mexican people it sounds bad when you say it

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:14.000
But it's the truth of the movie is you're crying with happiness for the for the dead Mexican

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Okay, I want to come out now. I want to oh well should have thought of that

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.400
I think if those characters were here they'd say well, how do you do the Mexican?

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.800
It's a very Mexican movie, which also made it good

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:33.160
Rob, you only have a half hour of show left you can you can tough it out. Yeah, you got this to my face is starting to hurt

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.440
Well, that's shingles

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.440
You might have just one side

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:45.860
Well, it's the one I'm resting my weight on are you dusting I I used snorting dust under there dusting

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.880
Let me ask you this

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.560
Rookie to Pro

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:56.240
Broadcasting, how do you how do you find an ending? You know like what do you what if you get caught in a rut where your show is?

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.840
Apparently two hours long. What do you do you keep making it two hours?

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.920
I've been I have fantasy where I keep like I keep like roll it back five minutes. Yeah, why can't you do that?

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.880
I don't know we could do we could do that

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.480
I guess the same reason why it became two hours because I don't know well

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:18.360
I don't know in a vacuum. How do you say the magic words and we could just well that week we couldn't do that feels awkward to me

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.640
That's not that's literally not possible. I

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.400
Think what we need well, we don't need it now because we're you know pretty soon

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.600
We'll be in front of an audience again, and we'll do you miss that? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:35.600
You know, so what's the status now? I've been away for a while. What's going on with the audience thing?

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:40.440
We're gonna we're getting one back. We're gonna we're gonna be doing a residency at a theater

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960
Yeah

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:54.720
I would we're reversing the trope of the guy under the bed having to hide while the people on top are doing it

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.640
There's a guy under my bed doing it

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.880
You're gonna believe any kids now. Let's say there's monsters under the bed

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:09.520
Yeah, Rob. Are you thinking it was a good idea or a bad idea to go under there? He's happy. Oh

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.400
He's coming hold on I

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.000
Yeah, okay, he's finishing. I think it might be a

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I don't think it's a good idea. Yeah, this is a great idea

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:26.040
Option ever comes up. Just don't assume that you should he wants everybody to know I think you should feel accomplished

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:30.400
You said I wonder if I can get under the bed and now he's on you don't have to wonder anymore

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.920
I wanted to come out but then Jeff started sticking that thing in my ass

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.920
So so you want to stay there longer so you can keep doing it

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:45.560
No, I guess you wanted to yeah hide under the bed. I don't know him them getting a mom vibe here

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.320
The New York Squares

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.520
Thanks, buddy. Well, of course, I think anyone who says they don't want to be a mom would make a great mom

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.440
You're saying that you're being sarcastic that's what everybody says, right?

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.920
Like we all jump on the women that say they don't want to be not literally jump on them

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:10.520
But that like like like we act like they're refusing the mother. Yeah, you would I do get annoyed when I say

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.920
I don't want to hold your baby and people there's like that. That's like a guy thing

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.960
I think like like because everybody thinks it's like a trope where like oh, you're gonna hold the baby

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.760
And then you're gonna turn into like a dad that wants a baby

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:31.160
Jurassic Park when he's got the two sleepy kids on him and Lord during yeah, like I don't answer John Cusack in

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.600
good point blank

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:38.240
Gross point blank like like it's not it's that that's not gonna happen all the time and that's not me saying

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.160
I hate your baby or I hate babies

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.440
They're just so like I don't want to hold your baby like like just because you need your baby held at this particular time because you

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.240
Want to experience a brief taste of what it's like to be a normal human for a couple seconds?

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.760
Like that doesn't that's not gonna just sync up with me wanting to hold a baby. I

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.480
Warned people that I'm not good at holding babies and they keep insisting on the third time

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.000
I run with the baby. Yeah, you know, I just realized if people would just characterize it as what it is

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:12.360
Which is a favor if they would go would you mind holding this baby like like it's like like what you do with a bowling ball full

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:18.320
Of hornets, you know, like would you do you mind so I can get a drink so I can retaste my youth?

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:22.760
No, I will do that favor as a friend because you've done shit for me

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:28.400
But they're always like you want to hold them you want to hold them don't you you're doing them the favor

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:33.040
Yeah, you have to be the one thinking. Oh, thanks for giving this chalice of fucking

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.320
Magic I

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.240
Sorry, I know I'm sitting here pretending like I'm a curmudgeon

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.960
Yeah

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:45.680
There's a very there's a ripping sound

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.960
That's a tendon. I think I'm actually so old now. That's I

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.720
It's been eight years since anyone's made me hold a baby

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:59.120
It's not even I'm at a party where there's where there's fertile people wouldn't run it around, you know

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.100
Like like all of my friends kids are in college

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.560
Have you ever been given the ultimatum have a baby or we're breaking up?

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.160
No, Rob, you want me to get the kettle out so we can scoot you along here

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.480
Should we all grab one side and just see who's stronger

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.040
Cody and I are up in the air. I think we you know, we made a decision like let's be the couple that doesn't know if they're gonna

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:26.000
Have a kid, you know, I'm like we like we like that. It's like why do you have a favorite color?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.600
What does that mean legs is what if I say my favorite color is orange like

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:37.120
Orange is it's slipping. What's your favorite movie? It doesn't make any sense, right? It doesn't but do you have a favorite color?

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:42.960
There's metal leg. No, I don't like it's slipping of what a t-shirt

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.520
of a t-shirt burgundy

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:50.480
Oh, good one. What if Rob is dying and we're just it's

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:58.200
Gorschting my hand. I picked your uh Dan being a kid though and then ask in the elementary school class like what is your favorite color?

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.800
I was what is it? What is a favorite color? Now everything's that color

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:07.000
I wish I could go back and be that kid like like I think I was that kid in ways that I didn't understand

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.440
I was being that kid, but I want to go back and taste being that kid and like actually draw a line in the fucking Santa

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:18.200
Go fuck you stop tickling me, you know, you know, that's a thing now like non-consensual tickling like you I

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.440
I'm watching my girlfriend's sister and

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:27.880
They're raising their kids and they're like they're doing all the like those kids have never been hit

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:31.680
They've never been like like they they they're there

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:37.520
It's all the tropes that you would roll your eyes at for modern parenting, you know, but they're they're great kids

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:43.640
They're they're totally like happy and healthy and they like look the the boy is two years older than the girl and he like

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.920
loves her and like hugs her and says I love my sister and stuff and

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.360
They give them a thought process instead of telling them what to do

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:55.800
Yeah, like they engage with them like in a way that I'm like when I first was watching them do it

01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:01.080
I was like don't just fucking don't you know that kid is fucking manipulating you like teach him

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:06.760
Who's the fucking boss, you know like in the back of my head? I was just like don't let that piece of shit run your life

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.120
But you and the kid you lean over you don't have me

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:17.840
Yeah, you want to have a fun exercise or you stand up real quick. Oh sure sure

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:27.240
Okay, yeah, we're worried about Rob thrashing under the bed might have caused the bed to because I'm stable. He seems so resilient

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:37.320
Are you kidding on Ikea furniture that would be a fucking crazy way for Rob to have died

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:40.920
It would be very fitting I think it would be a horrible way for him to die

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:44.120
But it would be the best way for your friend to have died

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:51.680
Like oh, how'd your friend died I crushed him I crushed him

01:32:51.680 --> 01:33:02.840
How you doing okay, hey Dan this is it's not really my place to say this but well, we had three endings that we passed

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.560
In answer your question

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.760
Yeah

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.320
Never never let a guest make you get out of bed

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:19.640
Okay, see this is good at you everything just changed. I wish I knew these tips. Well, I mean Spencer's he's the game master

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:24.520
He's not really a guest. He's like kind of a permanent resident. I'd like to think of myself as a guest

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.120
Because it gives me more clout. I meant the gentleman actually under your bed, but I see what you're saying

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:35.680
I like to think of Rob as a guest. I don't even know what he is. He's a is the Hamburglar

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:40.320
He's a ward of the of the podcast. I just started showing up

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:47.760
Felt sorry for me. All right. Well, I think the answer to my own question is

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:48.840
Is

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:54.480
There's a little bit of format needed so that you know, you know, we used we were playing D&D and we'd know okay

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:58.000
Well, then we're gonna end the show with D&D, but you know

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:04.560
It's you miss that Spencer. Those were the days, right? Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm a really structure-driven person

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:10.920
So I just crave it. I'm like a vine. I need one of those trellises. Otherwise. I'll just trip everybody

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:17.080
Did you do you ever bring a D&D game that you wrote anyway, even though he says we don't do that anymore?

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:24.740
I even though he says he we don't do shadow run anymore. Yeah, I actually I still bring I get I bring a session for every game

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:26.440
We've abandoned

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.440
And I bring a Balder dash

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:34.960
It's good, but it doesn't it doesn't often come up, but I like to be prepared you're

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.960
into your your NPR

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:43.760
Remote piece about the right the permits. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I've done all that stuff

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.400
We didn't play a single one of those. I think I prepare will we do we do two hours?

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:52.600
So I prepare six hours for every show we do most of it doesn't matter

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:58.240
But I do I do commit does that bother you at all because you do all that and Dan went out and bought some eggs

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:01.640
Yeah, I did buy those you got the eggs too

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.840
It was part of he was like we're gonna need some eggs on the show

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.840
No, I love it. I appreciate it

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:17.080
I like not having to do the work that I did right does anything does anything bother you about the whole setup

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.040
You can say no, I think the bed's a little loud, right?

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.800
It's a bit garish

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.960
Like me like an inch more underneath I

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:34.040
Could have used it to be like three times rickety here if you go down there and look at the three little posts that are holding up

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.960
The center of this bed. It's it's not structurally. Yeah, you think a grown man was

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.000
Thrashing around while someone was like

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.520
Laying on it. It looks really shaky. I

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.880
Was really worried that Rob is actually just going to get demolished. Well, he was yeah

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:54.400
It was very we was warping at pretty intensely while he was under it. Do you guys want to play high-low?

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.120
Oh, wait, that's where how do you play that? It's like red is red like green light?

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.000
Sure, but differ. Yeah. Well, how do you play it?

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Okay, you say that funny because I will not agree to it. So I know how to play first take your dick out

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.680
I'm glad I said. Yeah, this is right. What's the rules?

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:17.360
I knew it the simplest version is you say the high of the day and you're low of the day

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:22.800
We expanded a little to say what the lesson is of the low and what you're grateful for but we can start with just high-low

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.160
What's the high of the day? What's the low of the day? That sounds like a show closer. I like that

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:29.160
I think the high of the day for me was

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.080
Rob being hilarious and under the bed

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.080
And what was your low?

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:40.680
Was my low I just been kind of in a

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.360
Like I can't turn on the news kind of depression and so

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.600
Watching Twitter freak out about Michelle

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.320
and all that stuff and

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.200
Feeling the pressure that you have to catch up with it

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:06.200
What does that be? It's like it's like come on like we have a fucking rapey racist fuck face

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:13.200
And that's our fucking issue is that that a woman made a funny ass joke that you can't take it

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.040
Then we're the bad guys. So yeah, I just got into a mild

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.360
The world is full of bullshit

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:27.440
Spiral today, what do you do when that happens? How do you get out of it?

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:34.720
You put on a suit. I took a nap and put a suit on. Okay. That's nice a suit actually kind of makes up for lots of

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:42.240
Spends things. Yes, he comes in with a five-piece suit look over a day if you ever seen with a 11-piece suit

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.320
That means I have face shingles. There's a tie on the back

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:49.920
Is everything or it was yours? Let's go. Let's let's go down the line

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.560
That's it. My my highs being here. It's very exciting nice

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:59.720
And the low is for a split second. I thought Rob would die, but then he started

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:09.840
Yeah, so her high was being on this show and look what you did for the whole show you caused her low

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:15.480
I caused I caused her low. I'm sorry. That's actually made low as I told a rape joke earlier

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:19.680
And I can't tell if it was appropriate or not, but I went for it. It's hard these days

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.280
It is back in the old days. You say it was so safe. I

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.880
Made this space not

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:33.960
It was on the show don't you remember you were here and not disgusted at all. Yeah

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.080
Keith Malley, I think my high would be being a resident of Harmontown for a minute

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.080
My low is the poor homeless person that's gonna come across his bed and be so

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.400
Excited and then laying it for a second and it breaks and he has shingles

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:58.100
That's tough. That's a tough day. That's the day you put on a couple suits and he went. Yeah

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:03.120
Schrab, hello. My high was having lunch with Kate

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.200
we've been

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:13.160
We we've been we watched this this on have you seen this on Netflix the chef's table. Have you seen?

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:19.600
No, yeah, it's it there's like episode about like how this is how we start got it interesting going to

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:26.700
Buddhist temple, but there is like this Buddhist woman chef who was like talking about like how to eat and and

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:31.320
preparing food and and the thing that we've been trying lately is

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.080
eating silence and

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.200
like

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:41.760
taking a bite putting your spoon or fork down and chewing it and being present and

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.920
feeling the food in your mouth and because like

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:51.520
Usually usually people are like eating while they're watching TV or checking their email or multi-tasking or whatever

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:57.840
You're not really and you're just shoving food in your mouth. Have you had the celestine prophecy? What's that the celestine prophecy?

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.680
Say again. Have you read the celestine prophecy? No, I guess no

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:07.760
Well because they talk about they talk about the prophecy. Yeah

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:16.640
Yeah, yeah, but it's but it is it is like that. It's just being very mindful and present and I know I've found by doing that that

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:24.680
The food that I'm eating tastes better and I'm more satisfied and I've have like this more kind

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:29.220
It's just it's a it's a great time of the day not for the waiter. That is a pain in the ass

01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:36.460
Well, we made our own food at home. Yeah, but but then the blue apron they provide you the ingredients and

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:46.540
The the the low point I'm having the chicken fried cuckoosy with raisin bread barnesies

01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:51.940
My low low point is is Dan interrupting me

01:40:51.940 --> 01:41:01.980
Dan Hilo my low point was saying goodbye to Cody before she had to go and I knew I'd come to the show and like she can't

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:06.580
Stay over tonight because she's got work in the morning and and you know, who knows if we'll see each other tomorrow

01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:11.100
So it's like, you know, it's at the end of a weekend me having to come do this show

01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:13.740
No offense to the people that enjoy it. Although I

01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.100
Don't understand your enjoyment

01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:19.940
during for the last few episodes, but I

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.540
I

01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:23.060
I

01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:28.740
It's just like traditionally Sunday nights before I come here are kind of a low because I'm like a weekend's over and

01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:31.660
like no more sleepovers with Cody and

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:39.100
And we kind of wasted our time together sometimes I feel like we watched that we tried to watch that Hugh Jackman

01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:41.260
PT Barnum

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:47.300
Musical and I was like Wolverine Hugh Jackman's playing Barnum. Yeah, it's I wasn't that play when I was a kid

01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:52.140
And my hi for real was just now when you guys started with your lows

01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:57.660
Who my hi was realizing that because I went off a Twitter when I got the shingles. It was like, okay

01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:59.260
I'm not gonna think

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:04.100
Like I this Michelle Wolf thing. I don't even know who that is what happened

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:09.660
I know it sounds like totally aggravating and upsetting and I totally have no clue about it

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:14.140
And it's not like not knowing about the polar ice caps. It's like that sounds like it's not knowing about some shit

01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:20.420
That's like just kind of you can avoid. Yeah, like it sounds like I wasn't gonna help that subject

01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:25.700
It was only gonna make me upset, you know, so I kind of feel like dodged a bullet kind of high

01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:29.100
Get off that. I'm like, wow that encourages me to stay off of

01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:34.460
Twitter and then of the word snowflakes got really hurt by a woman doing a joke about makeup and

01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:36.740
Everybody really went off the fucking handle

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:39.140
We're gonna make you know anyway

01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:40.900
What this world's like

01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:45.940
No, it's kind of like I mean, I don't mind hearing all about the bullet I dodged. It's like, oh, yeah

01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:49.020
It was like a 22 with the you know, yeah

01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:50.820
That can't really be my low

01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:54.700
I think that was just I think my low is being in a place where that was affecting me

01:42:54.700 --> 01:43:00.780
Like it's like there's something lower than that that makes that even a thing that is on my radar

01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:06.120
Oh, my new low is is is this having to be witnessed to this low backpedaling

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:13.160
I don't I don't like this low like finding out that lows are changing my low that my low is this awful horrible fake

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.160
Ficus is behind you. This is this stricken

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:20.840
I said you're gonna say like this fit this fern on your forehead like I was gonna start like shingle shaming me

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:25.800
I like I like that your low isn't even your shingles. So do you have other lows? Oh, yeah, you know what you're right

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:30.160
I had shingles with it and it should either be that my high is that oh, they're kind of like done

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.040
You know like I had a kind of a pain-free day

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:37.920
I might be imagining this but they look less red than when the show started. I think you're actually healing as we watch

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.840
It's been passing them off. The irony is that the rest of your face is catching up

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:47.320
You want to see them get scabbier like that that's good news like when you the scabbier they get just don't pick them

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.600
You'll get a scar. Yeah, I wasn't gonna pick the fucking

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:56.360
Just just don't just don't worry him to death. You gotta if you start picking at it

01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:02.720
You're gonna get a scar. I'm not free and it's not on my knee. It's a fucking herpes scar on my head. It hurts to

01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.120
Right, just don't pick at it. Damn. You're not you're not concerned that DeMorge has been sleeping

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.120
He has every right to sleep

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:16.040
It's a boring show. It works hard. What do you want DeMorge to do? He's taking it in. Give him the bed. No

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.400
Oh, yeah, sure. Okay. DeMorge, you want to get up here and crawl in the bed?

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.520
Get some of that Harmon Jingle. Rob's kind of in it.

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:27.000
If you if you share a if you share a good high low in the bed, you can

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:31.880
You can close the show unless you had to go underneath the bed again church. You had a church

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:37.240
Spencer high low. Oh

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:41.320
Is it look like I could do fucking Dungeons and Dragons again. I'm high as a kite my man

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.600
And my low is

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:53.240
Just the rest of existence, I think it's rough

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.760
You got high low rodent then

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.400
Yeah, Dan fucking

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:03.880
Stick it to that. The only problem I have with a high low is that you is it you no matter what you're ending on a low

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:08.000
And there's no way it's gonna close the show. Yeah, we should we added a what do you like?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.840
What did you learn from low and what are you grateful for? Oh, right, right?

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:16.840
Yeah, I mean we should have played you guys go last because you probably use it to close your shows and are good at making them good

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:21.120
What are you doing? You're like a fucking cat

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.720
Stop it he fucking read it was so sad

01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:32.520
He like it's I got I got a tweet in my timeline back when I was on Twitter and it said

01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:39.400
There was it was a guy saying like I think you should bring Rob to Boston and it said above it Rob

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:42.080
Schrab retweeted because that's why I was in my time line

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.080
Island I was like three retweets and you know that one of them is Rob. Yeah

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.960
By the way, I like all his talking about not being on Twitter anymore. That was yesterday, Dan

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:59.400
It was like two days ago. That's a long time for a Twitter junkie. That's like, you know, baby steps one day at a time

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:05.200
Did you get your chip? Yeah, I deserve a big big old chip for not knowing who Michelle Wolf is

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:08.640

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:40.060
