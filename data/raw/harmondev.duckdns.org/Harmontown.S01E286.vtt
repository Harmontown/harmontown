{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:19.840\nOkay. Now, the key is with shingles is that it's not to exert myself. Hi, folks. I have\n\n00:19.840 --> 00:27.120\na herpy virus called shingles. You can Google it, or I'll tell you a lot about it tonight.\n\n00:27.120 --> 00:31.960\nI've learned a lot about it, but it rides on the nervous system. It's a reactivation\n\n00:31.960 --> 00:39.440\nof the chicken pox from when you were a kid. It comes as a result of you either being 60,\n\n00:39.440 --> 00:46.480\nliving in a third world country, or having my lifestyle, which apparently is high stress\n\n00:46.480 --> 00:54.480\nor low health. I'm going to go with the latter. So, you know, I went to New York with Dino,\n\n00:54.480 --> 01:00.920\nhad a good time. And this is pretty shingles. I think I got the shingles. I think I got a\n\n01:00.920 --> 01:07.280\nfever for the flavor in New York. And then I got the flavor of the shingles on the way\n\n01:07.280 --> 01:17.040\nback to that. Some people call you shingles, Dick. Yeah. Sorry, is that my comedy car alarm\n\n01:17.040 --> 01:26.480\nwent off outside? All right. Well, it's stuff like that. I want to thank the production\n\n01:26.480 --> 01:34.280\ncrew because, well, first of all, I want to say to the subscribers, I hope so. I mean,\n\n01:34.280 --> 01:41.360\nthis isn't helping. Here's some of the things that shingles loves car alarms. The doctor\n\n01:41.360 --> 01:48.200\ntold me not to do work out, go to therapy. I didn't go to therapy. I didn't do the weekend\n\n01:48.200 --> 01:53.200\nDracula show, the super tight like finale. Like these are fun things for me. But you\n\n01:53.200 --> 01:58.720\nknow, I'm taking it easy. I have to not like even good stresses is bad stress because this\n\n01:58.720 --> 02:04.840\nis a nerve is a virus that lives in your nerve endings. So I'm trying to take it very easy.\n\n02:04.840 --> 02:11.120\nSo we did a little soft open, a little soft warm open for those of you who are listening\n\n02:11.120 --> 02:16.800\nfor free. That's cool. That doesn't make me. But what you don't know is that Dan is laying\n\n02:16.800 --> 02:22.920\nin a kind of a cool, like blonde wood. I'm sitting in bed with a bag of hard boiled eggs.\n\n02:22.920 --> 02:29.360\nIt's got some Minecraft flavored bedding. Some egg lands best eggs. Can you open these\n\n02:29.360 --> 02:35.440\nfor me? I'd love to. You're just eating eggs out of a bag. Yeah. Lysine. What? The herpes\n\n02:35.440 --> 02:41.080\nvirus that makes up shingles doesn't like lysine, which is weird because the dinosaurs\n\n02:41.080 --> 02:46.240\nof Jurassic Park love it. They need it in the book. Anyway, they kind of fucked off\n\n02:46.240 --> 02:49.720\nwith that in the movie. And then they didn't really talk about the lysine dependency. I\n\n02:49.720 --> 02:53.440\nlove lysine. Do you think that lysine is the reason why the loss of raptor is cheetah\n\n02:53.440 --> 03:00.120\nspeed? Yeah. You're eating a hard boiled egg out of a plastic pouch. It's full of vitamin\n\n03:00.120 --> 03:11.520\nA or something. Can you hear the herpes screaming? It's pissed. It's downright ornery. Anyways,\n\n03:11.520 --> 03:14.520\nnow don't go. Is it going to scar on your head or is that going to go away? Well, you\n\n03:14.520 --> 03:20.840\ncan see this one that's right in the middle of my forehead. It's a, I could leave a divot.\n\n03:20.840 --> 03:24.800\nIt's kind of cool. I got to say, when you get a disease that's like has like a sci fi\n\n03:24.800 --> 03:28.720\ntwist to it, I can at least get into that and get through the searing pain, which by\n\n03:28.720 --> 03:33.000\nthe way has subsided. I'm not in any pain. Yay. I mean, I was a little tingling, but\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.040\nI think that's because I'm on these meds every time. I noticed like a half hour after I take\n\n03:37.040 --> 03:40.960\nthe meds. All right, slow down, Harmon. Fucking stop talking a mile a minute. Eat your egg.\n\n03:40.960 --> 03:49.160\nGet your lysine, Harmon. Get your lysine. Just get your groovy voice back on. We've\n\n03:49.160 --> 03:52.400\ngot some very low energy, mild mannered New York friends that are going to be joining\n\n03:52.400 --> 03:56.480\nus in a second. They're going to really keep me calm. They're from the east coast where\n\n03:56.480 --> 04:03.800\nthe, where the vibes are chill. Yeah. Um, and where you get shingles. What was I, what\n\n04:03.800 --> 04:09.840\nwas I just saying? I say we, uh, exactly got some music for us. Lay it on us. Well, cold\n\n04:09.840 --> 04:19.520\nopen is over. Oh, okay. I think this opens about to heat up. You know what I'm saying?\n\n04:19.520 --> 04:23.840\nWhere's that music? Oh, so it's sort of like, um, you know, when you get chicken pox when\n\n04:23.840 --> 04:35.880\nyou're a kid, this is the cool stuff I get. Topical. Yo, if we're rapping, we're rapping\n\n04:35.880 --> 04:46.920\nlow and slow beat down this chicken pox, turn up the rocks, make them like pebbles. Motherfucker\n\n04:46.920 --> 04:54.800\nface to the trouble. Whoa. Whoa. Don't fuck with me. Not today. Low energy. Gotta relax\n\n04:54.800 --> 05:00.360\nin my minecraft bed. Gotta do some rhymes off the top of my head. I saw a snoop, loop,\n\n05:00.360 --> 05:06.080\na dupadee, dupadee. I fucked your mama in the laundry shoe. I put pajamas on the back\n\n05:06.080 --> 05:11.720\nof my neck. Beautiful uptown, Burbank, Harmontown is once again in sessions. We have a supine\n\n05:11.720 --> 05:20.560\nDan Harmon eating hard boiled eggs out of a garage station fucking bag. I'm a cop\n\n05:20.560 --> 05:24.960\ntroller. Jeff Davis, a game master. Start in there. Spencer Crittenden. Let's give it up\n\n05:24.960 --> 05:32.720\nfor your shingles ridden mayor. Before he succumbs to illness and syphilitic madness.\n\n05:32.720 --> 05:36.920\nYour mayor is Dan Harmon. Thank you. See, I didn't understand your energy. Yeah, we didn't\n\n05:36.920 --> 05:40.360\nknow what was happening. We just, we both just realized, oh, he's, he's a slave to the\n\n05:40.360 --> 05:44.960\nformat. You're like, I mean, in a good way. You're a professional. You're like, guys,\n\n05:44.960 --> 05:51.080\nwe haven't started to show you. I was more comfortable with a kind of just a totally\n\n05:51.080 --> 05:56.240\nawkward experimental, no title sequence show. You got the facial chicken pox, eating some\n\n05:56.240 --> 06:04.120\neggs, eight and million cocks. Whoa. That's okay. I don't want you to be homophobic today\n\n06:04.120 --> 06:08.880\nbecause we got our East Coast friends coming up in a second. We're going to make amends\n\n06:08.880 --> 06:14.280\nwith the whole nation and my chicken pox. Got the herpes virus, like bagels and locks.\n\n06:14.280 --> 06:21.480\nThey go together. Birds of a feather. Podcasting pros in the sunny weather. They came out to\n\n06:21.480 --> 06:29.120\nvisit. Fuck your mama like my name was. Can you wrap a little bit about your Minecraft\n\n06:29.120 --> 06:38.520\npillows and medvedic? Yeah. I don't mind being told what to do because I'm, I need to keep\n\n06:38.520 --> 06:47.920\nmy nervous system unexerted. So all right, I'll wrap about my blankets. Minecraft's on\n\n06:47.920 --> 06:57.240\nthem. Word. Fuck it. Yeah, Christ. Congratulations. You have a slave rapper now. Fuck it. Hell\n\n06:57.240 --> 07:02.200\nyeah. All right, let's, uh, look, I want to, I want to bring company. Are you okay over\n\n07:02.200 --> 07:07.720\nthere? I should feel really good. And I want Steve Levy, um, got on this. I don't know who\n\n07:07.720 --> 07:13.720\nput the, you know, the bulk of the physical work in. Steve Levy made it with Nolan. I'm\n\n07:13.720 --> 07:17.600\nobviously surrounded by a lot of people who care about me and I don't, I don't say that\n\n07:17.600 --> 07:27.960\nenough. Um, that's nice. Thank you. All right. Have you got the chicken pox before, Jeff?\n\n07:27.960 --> 07:33.120\nI did when I was like five golden. You're good. Um, see, am I going to, am I going to\n\n07:33.120 --> 07:40.360\nget face aids? Nope. It's face herpes. And no, did you have chicken pox when you were\n\n07:40.360 --> 07:44.440\na kid? I did. So I'm good. Yeah. All right. Apparently you could potentially get to, well,\n\n07:44.440 --> 07:47.240\nthat's the neat thing. I just want to say this and then we'll bring up our guests because,\n\n07:47.240 --> 07:52.040\nbecause our real guest is the face herpes that I have. So I want to introduce them too.\n\n07:52.040 --> 07:55.360\nShould we, should we bring your face herpes out and talk to them for a while? Well, they're,\n\n07:55.360 --> 07:58.480\nthey've come out. That's what I think is kind of neat. It's like, cause it's like, that's\n\n07:58.480 --> 08:04.560\nwhy I think we like, uh, uh, uh, Ridley Scott's alien movie is because, uh, you know, it resonates\n\n08:04.560 --> 08:10.160\nthat gig air, like stuff that parasitic, like something's bursting out of you. Um, uh, these\n\n08:10.160 --> 08:15.120\nare, when you had chicken pox when you were a kid, you know, you mostly like got rid of\n\n08:15.120 --> 08:19.680\nthem out of your system. Like you basically killed most of them, whether you got vaccinated\n\n08:19.680 --> 08:29.280\nor, or had them, same difference. But, uh, they, they, there's, there's like bands of gorilla,\n\n08:29.280 --> 08:35.040\nGUER, gorilla, like, um, uh, the same virus, like it gets, it, it, it, it hides in this\n\n08:35.040 --> 08:40.520\ncertain kind of nerve cell. I don't know why that nerve cell makes it possible for them\n\n08:40.520 --> 08:47.000\nto stay alive, but asleep. And so they just hang out. And if your immune system gets low\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.280\nenough, basically it's like your immune system is always on patrol. And I imagine these things\n\n08:52.280 --> 08:57.800\npoke their head out once in a while and get beat the fuck down. And then, so if you assume,\n\n08:57.800 --> 09:02.920\nif you're, I, I was talking to, uh, Julianne Smolinski, who I hope doesn't mind saying outing\n\n09:02.920 --> 09:08.120\nher as someone who's also had this, she said that a bunch of TV writers have had it. Like,\n\n09:08.120 --> 09:12.600\nlike, like, it's like a vitamin D deficiency, kind of like, shlubby disease.\n\n09:12.600 --> 09:15.880\nShould, should we get all these star burns audio podcasts together and have a shingles\n\n09:15.880 --> 09:19.120\nparty? Like, where we all, we all expose ourselves to.\n\n09:19.120 --> 09:23.720\nBut it's kind of neat because it's like, it's a disease that you cured when you were a kid.\n\n09:23.720 --> 09:28.240\nIt's like the same virus hid in one type of cell, which is your nerve cell. It's not like\n\n09:28.240 --> 09:34.000\na nerve disease. It's a virus that could only hide in that type of nerve cell. And that's\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.120\nwhy it only ever happens on one side of your face or body. That's how my doctor like figured\n\n09:38.120 --> 09:42.920\nit out right away. And you can actually trace the cranial nerve path that mine are on. I'm\n\n09:42.920 --> 09:47.600\nlucky because they're on my face. You get them on your back, you get them on your leg,\n\n09:47.600 --> 09:50.440\nyou don't notice them for two weeks. I'll take the back.\n\n09:50.440 --> 09:54.760\nYeah, but if you don't notice them, then you get those, that belt of blisters and stuff.\n\n09:54.760 --> 09:57.880\nOh, yeah. Because I did a little research and people get a big band of it on one side\n\n09:57.880 --> 10:04.960\nof their body. Yeah. But these, these little guys, they wake up and girls, you're welcome.\n\n10:04.960 --> 10:11.280\nYou are so shingles woke. Take it back, babies. They, they, they wake up in these nerve cells\n\n10:11.280 --> 10:15.880\nand they go, Oh, shit. I think this guy's either 60 or living in Nicaragua and drinking\n\n10:15.880 --> 10:21.080\nlike lead water, maybe Detroit and like, like, he's down for the count. It's let's, let's\n\n10:21.080 --> 10:26.320\nmake a break for it. Red Rover. And, and, and, but they're, they're stuck on these nerve\n\n10:26.320 --> 10:30.920\npaths and they, they, they go straight for the surface of the skin. They're like, let's\n\n10:30.920 --> 10:36.720\ncause chickenpox again. So basically like, you can't give shingles to anybody. You can\n\n10:36.720 --> 10:45.920\nonly give shingles to yourself. Shingles are a, a kind of like a sequel to chickenpox\n\n10:45.920 --> 10:52.600\nthat you get because your immune system gets so low that the Riddler comes back to fuck\n\n10:52.600 --> 10:56.520\nwith Batman, you know, like even though he was like beaten in the first movie, I'm not\n\n10:56.520 --> 11:00.520\ngoing to contract this by being in bed with you. The only thing you could possibly get\n\n11:00.520 --> 11:04.520\nis if you were chickenpox free as a kid for some reason, if you were like a boy in a bubble\n\n11:04.520 --> 11:09.440\nand they let you out. And then so you didn't have chickenpox ever. And you were next to\n\n11:09.440 --> 11:15.520\nme when my head exploded with these gross blisters, which they've already done and they're finished.\n\n11:15.520 --> 11:21.720\nBut if two days ago you had rubbed your forehead on mine, you would have gotten chickenpox.\n\n11:21.720 --> 11:24.920\nI've already given you crabs just by being here for the last 10 minutes.\n\n11:24.920 --> 11:32.040\nAnd I've gotten bored of myself. Am I right, people? Let's bring up our, who applauded that?\n\n11:32.040 --> 11:35.480\nWe all did. America did. That's that Schrab. I'm going to Schrab.\n\n11:35.480 --> 11:38.920\nNo, I don't think it was. No, it was Schrab. Let's just believe it was.\n\n11:38.920 --> 11:41.840\nOh, by the way, Schrab, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to take Schrab to Boston.\n\n11:41.840 --> 11:48.440\nI, you know, there was a huge outcry. I think about seven people retweeted him. It's just\n\n11:48.440 --> 11:53.600\ntoo much pressure from, from, from the seven people that, that, that, that he pretends\n\n11:53.600 --> 11:57.280\nto be when he changes accounts and so. And I just want to say that's a really generous\n\n11:57.280 --> 12:00.480\nthing that Schrab did to invite, to invite himself.\n\n12:00.480 --> 12:04.280\nWait, you're accusing Schrab of, of making up false accounts so he can, he can.\n\n12:04.280 --> 12:06.080\nGet a free trip. Blast us.\n\n12:06.080 --> 12:10.480\nNo, no, no, no. Let's not talk about finances right now. Let's bring up our guests.\n\n12:10.480 --> 12:18.480\nLike, you know, these two, like, I'm not gonna, I was just listening to their original podcast.\n\n12:18.480 --> 12:23.280\nYou know, like, you know, we're in our 300s or something like that and it makes us feel\n\n12:23.280 --> 12:28.520\nlike we should quit. Like, these, these guys have been doing podcasting since 2005.\n\n12:28.520 --> 12:32.480\nLike, they, I think, unless there's something about their episode codes that I'm not understanding,\n\n12:32.480 --> 12:34.880\nthey're like in their mid 2000s.\n\n12:34.880 --> 12:35.880\nIs that right?\n\n12:35.880 --> 12:40.880\nOn their original podcast, which is Keith and the Girl, right? Let's, let's just bring\n\n12:40.880 --> 12:44.240\nthem up and, and we can ask them all of the questions that I don't know.\n\n12:44.240 --> 12:47.760\nI kind of want to stay in bed because of the blanket and my wool suit. I'm roasting in here.\n\n12:47.760 --> 12:48.760\nIt's really warm.\n\n12:48.760 --> 12:53.160\nWell, I, you, you do what you want. I'm going to, let's, let's bring up, I want to make\n\n12:53.160 --> 12:56.960\nsure I don't fuck up their names, but let's bring up our new friends, Keith Malley and\n\n12:56.960 --> 12:58.760\nHemda Khalili.\n\n12:58.760 --> 13:00.040\nAll right.\n\n13:00.040 --> 13:01.040\nHemda and Keith.\n\n13:01.040 --> 13:02.040\nOh yeah.\n\n13:02.040 --> 13:07.040\nHi, Keith. Hi, Hemda.\n\n13:07.040 --> 13:11.160\nJeff, can you shake his hand for me?\n\n13:11.160 --> 13:16.000\nIt's, I know, you know, it's weird. Is it changes my behavior too? Well, you know, you have\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:21.120\na scab on your forehead and you have, like, I feel like I owe people, I have to tell people\n\n13:21.120 --> 13:22.120\nI have shingles.\n\n13:22.120 --> 13:24.760\nLike, normally you'd be in a three-piece suit and.\n\n13:24.760 --> 13:29.360\nWell, normally I'd at least shake hands or hug or whatever anyone else wanted to do.\n\n13:29.360 --> 13:33.560\nBut like, it changes my behavior because I don't know what people's relationship with\n\n13:33.560 --> 13:39.680\nthe word shingles is. And then you meet someone and they say, I have it. All right.\n\n13:39.680 --> 13:41.360\nOur relationship is now Dan Harmon.\n\n13:41.360 --> 13:42.360\nYeah.\n\n13:42.360 --> 13:47.320\nAnyways, I met you guys awkwardly rolling out of an Uber with a gallon of green tea and\n\n13:47.320 --> 13:48.960\na bag of hard boiled eggs.\n\n13:48.960 --> 13:53.560\nAnd 25 eggs. I thought it was funny how Jeff asked you, so it's not contagious. Is it\n\n13:53.560 --> 13:58.560\ntoo bad that I'm here after the fact? And then, no, I don't think so. That's good enough\n\n13:58.560 --> 13:59.560\nfor me.\n\n13:59.560 --> 14:00.560\nYeah.\n\n14:00.560 --> 14:03.360\nThat's, that's how we try to have safe sex in 2018, right?\n\n14:03.360 --> 14:04.360\nYeah.\n\n14:04.360 --> 14:05.360\nYou're good right?\n\n14:05.360 --> 14:06.360\nI'm good.\n\n14:06.360 --> 14:07.360\nI'm good. Okay.\n\n14:07.360 --> 14:10.280\nI mostly made a frenet broncher right now. I don't think viruses can live in the horrible\n\n14:10.280 --> 14:11.920\ncaustic environment of my blood system.\n\n14:11.920 --> 14:16.280\nI mean, the only thing that you could do is, I mean, that's, I agree with you. Like, nothing\n\n14:16.280 --> 14:20.960\nreally that lands on me can really set up shop there. Like, they'll be like, what the fuck\n\n14:20.960 --> 14:23.800\nis this Irish rock garden?\n\n14:23.800 --> 14:28.480\nWhen you first saw it, did you think, oh great, another blackout? Or do you really think it\n\n14:28.480 --> 14:29.480\nis medical?\n\n14:29.480 --> 14:37.680\nI thought that because I had a massive head, not massive, massive for a writer, a head wound.\n\n14:37.680 --> 14:47.840\nI had a blackout kind of weekend at Tribeca. And I, so I thought, I thought that what happened,\n\n14:47.840 --> 14:52.960\nwas that since I couldn't remember how I had injured my head, and then I had this, like,\n\n14:52.960 --> 14:59.800\nI started feeling this pain going down half of my face. And I was like, oh, I guess since\n\n14:59.800 --> 15:06.000\nthere's no such thing as coincidences, I must have like passed out and smacked my head on\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:11.280\nthe nightstand and maybe just slept there like a, like a cartoon drunk for an hour or\n\n15:11.280 --> 15:12.280\na real life drug.\n\n15:12.280 --> 15:13.880\nA cosmological thing that could have happened.\n\n15:13.880 --> 15:18.760\nYeah, I was like piecing it together. I was like, maybe I, maybe I like fell down, slept\n\n15:18.760 --> 15:25.880\non something weird that the hotel staff doesn't wash as much as the pillowcases or something.\n\n15:25.880 --> 15:30.680\nAnd then it just, then I could see, I looked close to the mirror after I got back to LA\n\n15:30.680 --> 15:33.360\nand I was like, no, there's something blooming.\n\n15:33.360 --> 15:34.360\nAnd then I,\n\n15:34.360 --> 15:37.400\nThat's good news. Like for a split second, do you think, man, maybe I do have to quit\n\n15:37.400 --> 15:38.400\ndrinking.\n\n15:38.400 --> 15:39.400\nRight.\n\n15:39.400 --> 15:40.400\nOh, shingles.\n\n15:40.400 --> 15:45.800\nYeah, for a while I started thinking, oh, I got shingles on my head too. And the doctor's\n\n15:45.800 --> 15:50.840\nlike, no, you fell down drunk. I looked at your head wound very carefully. And I wanted\n\n15:50.840 --> 15:55.400\nto make sure it wasn't shingles on your head. It's not. You're an alcoholic.\n\n15:55.400 --> 15:58.840\nSo what's the prognosis? Like it just drifts away after time. You're taking medication\n\n15:58.840 --> 15:59.840\nfor this?\n\n15:59.840 --> 16:04.520\nYeah, I'm one of the lucky ones. You'll never hear a shingle story this fortunate for most\n\n16:04.520 --> 16:12.120\npeople because if you don't catch it in time, it can be a solid. My friend, Julianne, had\n\n16:12.120 --> 16:13.120\nit two years ago.\n\n16:13.120 --> 16:21.120\nShe said it was for 19 days. It's like two weeks-ish, 20 days. And if it just runs its\n\n16:21.120 --> 16:27.840\ncourse, which it just will, for a lot of people, you get this like neuralgia, I think that's\n\n16:27.840 --> 16:32.600\nwhat it's called. It's like this deep nerve pain that can last for two years because of\n\n16:32.600 --> 16:34.920\nthe damage it causes coming out.\n\n16:34.920 --> 16:37.480\nHave you ever spoken so sexy from bed?\n\n16:37.480 --> 16:40.280\nThis is sexier. Why do I think that?\n\n16:40.280 --> 16:45.080\nI mean, I'd be remiss to that. Either of you guys want to spend some time in here, but\n\n16:45.080 --> 16:46.080\nI don't-\n\n16:46.080 --> 16:48.080\nIt looks more comfortable than this seat. I'm going to give it a go.\n\n16:48.080 --> 16:49.080\nOkay, come on in.\n\n16:49.080 --> 16:55.280\nI'm going to take off my shoes because I'm not an animal like Jeff, but we're not judging.\n\n16:55.280 --> 16:56.280\nIt's a safe space.\n\n16:56.280 --> 16:57.880\nI am an animal. You're right about that.\n\n16:57.880 --> 17:01.760\nI feel especially in the Akia blondewood futon.\n\n17:01.760 --> 17:05.760\nI'm one of those people for whom it's more rude to take my shoes off because of how gross\n\n17:05.760 --> 17:06.760\nmy feet are.\n\n17:06.760 --> 17:10.520\nAnd Hemre, you came in wearing kind of what amounts to a blanket already. You came already\n\n17:10.520 --> 17:11.520\nbedded.\n\n17:11.520 --> 17:14.360\nYes, I understood what this podcast was about.\n\n17:14.360 --> 17:16.520\nSo you guys have been at it since 2005.\n\n17:16.520 --> 17:17.520\nYes.\n\n17:17.520 --> 17:21.200\nLike you were podcasting before. Maybe they even had a word for it.\n\n17:21.200 --> 17:29.920\nHonestly, yeah. There was still the iPod and there wasn't a category on iTunes for it.\n\n17:29.920 --> 17:33.240\nWhy? How do you keep doing it? Because I was listening to your most recent episodes on\n\n17:33.240 --> 17:39.560\nthe way here and you clearly, I don't know how you started energy-wise, but you seem\n\n17:39.560 --> 17:42.000\nvery happy to be doing it still and very good at it.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:47.320\nI do have a dream to take back. We have a premium program where you hear all our shows\n\n17:47.320 --> 17:49.360\nwhere you can hear everything from 13 years ago.\n\n17:49.360 --> 17:53.600\nSo I want to take that first show and redo it and not tell anybody.\n\n17:53.600 --> 17:57.360\nJust like act like it's like an adaptation, like a Gus Van Sant remake.\n\n17:57.360 --> 18:00.520\nYou're so polished for the first show.\n\n18:00.520 --> 18:06.160\nYou guys do sound polished though. You sound like you have the right amount of radio people\n\n18:06.160 --> 18:07.160\nin you.\n\n18:07.160 --> 18:08.480\nI'll take right amount.\n\n18:08.480 --> 18:09.480\nThank you.\n\n18:09.480 --> 18:12.440\nLike you're not, it would be an insult, I think, to podcasters to say you sound like\n\n18:12.440 --> 18:13.440\nradio people.\n\n18:13.440 --> 18:15.240\nRight, but I get it. I'll take it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n18:15.240 --> 18:20.200\nBut I mean, it's like you guys are professional is what I mean. You sound like you don't do\n\n18:20.200 --> 18:22.600\nwhat I do and just have people on and just talk over them.\n\n18:22.600 --> 18:26.760\nBut how great is that though? To be able to just, what am I wearing today? Who gives\n\n18:26.760 --> 18:27.760\nus a shit?\n\n18:27.760 --> 18:29.000\nLike how fun that is.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.040\nHow much do you guys plan your...\n\n18:31.040 --> 18:34.400\nWe plan probably at least three hours for an hour show.\n\n18:34.400 --> 18:38.320\nSo you get, always right before it, you have a meeting in the middle of the week.\n\n18:38.320 --> 18:42.720\nWe get together three hours before the show to prep for that with our producer Andrea\n\n18:42.720 --> 18:48.600\nand a couple interns sometimes and then they prep us for the guest and also news and then\n\n18:48.600 --> 18:51.720\nI have to fight with Keith about how many rape cases we have to talk about on the show\n\n18:51.720 --> 18:52.720\nthat day.\n\n18:52.720 --> 18:53.720\nThere's a lot.\n\n18:53.720 --> 18:54.720\nHe's fascinated by weird stories.\n\n18:54.720 --> 18:57.080\nThese are just Keith's open rape cases.\n\n18:57.080 --> 18:59.880\nI'm like, listen, what do we think?\n\n18:59.880 --> 19:00.880\nWhat's the...\n\n19:00.880 --> 19:04.280\nWhat's Keith's angle on those cases?\n\n19:04.280 --> 19:05.280\nHe's just...\n\n19:05.280 --> 19:09.160\nI am not pleased. That's my catchphrase.\n\n19:09.160 --> 19:13.720\nIt's his version of me too. He's just like, I'm giving them all the attention.\n\n19:13.720 --> 19:18.240\nOh, is it really more like that? Is it like, hey, did you hear about this monster so and\n\n19:18.240 --> 19:20.360\nso or is it like a true crimey kind of thing?\n\n19:20.360 --> 19:24.200\nI think when the story is so amazing, I have to tell it.\n\n19:24.200 --> 19:26.880\nBut then it's sad news.\n\n19:26.880 --> 19:28.320\nIt's a woman got into the wrong car.\n\n19:28.320 --> 19:29.320\nThe worst thing happens.\n\n19:29.320 --> 19:30.640\nShe gets into another car for help.\n\n19:30.640 --> 19:31.640\nThe worst thing happens.\n\n19:31.640 --> 19:32.640\nI'm like, I don't know.\n\n19:32.640 --> 19:33.640\nI wish somebody told me the story.\n\n19:33.640 --> 19:37.400\nAnd then he looks at me and goes and we're a comedy podcast and I'm like, I'm supposed\n\n19:37.400 --> 19:40.200\nto find the funniest thing about this rape story that you just told me.\n\n19:40.200 --> 19:41.200\nYeah.\n\n19:41.200 --> 19:42.200\nThen I say, good luck.\n\n19:42.200 --> 19:43.200\nI say, go.\n\n19:43.200 --> 19:47.920\nForgive me for not knowing what your show is because I don't listen to a whole lot of\n\n19:47.920 --> 19:49.080\npodcasts.\n\n19:49.080 --> 19:50.080\nWhat is the...\n\n19:50.080 --> 19:52.640\nWell, the one we should be plugging is the one that said Star Burns.\n\n19:52.640 --> 19:54.520\nYeah, who cares about Keith and the Girl?\n\n19:54.520 --> 20:00.220\nSo we also started because five days, five shows a week wasn't enough.\n\n20:00.220 --> 20:04.160\nWe started my opening line and that's where we talked to artists and comedians about\n\n20:04.160 --> 20:06.520\nthe very first humiliating times on stage.\n\n20:06.520 --> 20:07.520\nOkay.\n\n20:07.520 --> 20:09.320\nOh, so that's not the one that's been going since 2005.\n\n20:09.320 --> 20:11.280\nThe one since 2005 is Keith and the Girl.\n\n20:11.280 --> 20:12.280\nThat's five days a week.\n\n20:12.280 --> 20:17.040\nIt's mostly a comedy show, but we will talk about Cosby being found guilty, this kind\n\n20:17.040 --> 20:18.040\nof thing.\n\n20:18.040 --> 20:19.040\nYeah, that was fun, wasn't it?\n\n20:19.040 --> 20:20.040\nThat was...\n\n20:20.040 --> 20:21.040\nIt was fun.\n\n20:21.040 --> 20:25.480\nSo he's a hero when you're a kid and then also you find out he's been a villain since\n\n20:25.480 --> 20:26.480\nwe were kids.\n\n20:26.480 --> 20:27.480\nRight.\n\n20:27.480 --> 20:31.720\nAnd I was talking to a handleburst, the person that did the stand-up that got everything\n\n20:31.720 --> 20:32.720\nstarted.\n\n20:32.720 --> 20:33.720\nYeah.\n\n20:33.720 --> 20:34.720\nAnd by the...\n\n20:34.720 --> 20:35.720\nAnd hooray for him on that one.\n\n20:35.720 --> 20:36.720\nHooray for him.\n\n20:36.720 --> 20:39.360\nHe doesn't like it though because he's afraid he's being seen as that's the person when\n\n20:39.360 --> 20:43.520\nmeanwhile he has jokes, but I'm like, you're a superhero.\n\n20:43.520 --> 20:45.160\nYou'll get your jokes in there.\n\n20:45.160 --> 20:46.160\nI don't know.\n\n20:46.160 --> 20:47.840\nI think it would be great to...\n\n20:47.840 --> 20:51.000\nIt's not his favorite thing to be associated directly with that.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nYeah, but...\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nYeah, I can imagine.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.280\nBut he still provided a service.\n\n20:54.280 --> 20:55.280\nYes.\n\n20:55.280 --> 21:00.720\nAnd all this teaches too is that, yes, when you're at a comedy club, record the show.\n\n21:00.720 --> 21:04.440\nYou don't know what they're going to say, right?\n\n21:04.440 --> 21:07.000\nIf some asshole wasn't there with their phone...\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.440\nJeff, can't tell if you're serious or not.\n\n21:08.440 --> 21:10.240\nI honestly don't know if I am or not.\n\n21:10.240 --> 21:11.800\nI just saw the big sick.\n\n21:11.800 --> 21:15.080\nYes, we wouldn't know if Kramer was racist.\n\n21:15.080 --> 21:16.640\nRight.\n\n21:16.640 --> 21:20.520\nI watched the big sick and you know, the guys do a stand-up and then there's a heckler in\n\n21:20.520 --> 21:21.520\nthe audience.\n\n21:21.520 --> 21:23.680\nWell, long story short, they fall in love.\n\n21:23.680 --> 21:24.680\nWhat am I learning?\n\n21:24.680 --> 21:26.680\nHeckle, take out your phone.\n\n21:26.680 --> 21:27.680\nDo whatever you want.\n\n21:27.680 --> 21:28.680\nYes.\n\n21:28.680 --> 21:29.680\nYou don't want to know.\n\n21:29.680 --> 21:30.680\nDo what you want.\n\n21:30.680 --> 21:31.680\nDo what you want.\n\n21:31.680 --> 21:32.680\nDo what you want.\n\n21:32.680 --> 21:36.560\nThis is off topic, but you took out a light bulb in New York in your hotel and then smashed\n\n21:36.560 --> 21:37.560\nit on the ground.\n\n21:37.560 --> 21:38.560\nThank you for listening.\n\n21:38.560 --> 21:41.080\nDid you ever find out why your brain did that?\n\n21:41.080 --> 21:42.080\nNo.\n\n21:42.080 --> 21:46.760\nDo you think maybe it was the beginning of the herpes virus, making me do things?\n\n21:46.760 --> 21:47.760\nYou think so?\n\n21:47.760 --> 21:48.920\nYou think your herpes was like talking to you?\n\n21:48.920 --> 21:53.520\nI want to give myself the benefit of the doubt, or rather, I should say, the reason I say\n\n21:53.520 --> 21:58.360\nI did it on purpose is because I don't want to let myself off the hook and say, oh, I\n\n21:58.360 --> 21:59.360\nslipped.\n\n21:59.360 --> 22:01.720\nBut because here's what I definitely did on purpose.\n\n22:01.720 --> 22:07.720\nI looked at a light bulb bulb cover and I was like, huh, and I just wanted to pull it\n\n22:07.720 --> 22:08.720\noff.\n\n22:08.720 --> 22:09.720\nWow.\n\n22:09.720 --> 22:10.720\nWhat was fascinating about the light bulb?\n\n22:10.720 --> 22:14.400\nI wanted to see how easy, does that just come right off?\n\n22:14.400 --> 22:15.400\nAnd it did.\n\n22:15.400 --> 22:16.400\nIt just pulled it off.\n\n22:16.400 --> 22:18.480\nYou're talking about the casing that enclosed the bulb.\n\n22:18.480 --> 22:22.280\nLike a globe of glass over the bulb to make it a little softer.\n\n22:22.280 --> 22:27.160\nAnd I was like, oh, it's keeping that on, just not being pulled?\n\n22:27.160 --> 22:31.680\nYour own curiosity is the only thing that keeps it on there.\n\n22:31.680 --> 22:33.360\nLack of curiosity keeps it on.\n\n22:33.360 --> 22:37.280\nWhen he tells you stories, is it tempting to say, were you drinking, or do you just\n\n22:37.280 --> 22:38.280\nhave to?\n\n22:38.280 --> 22:41.480\nNo, because Dan and I live in a state of half inebriation.\n\n22:41.480 --> 22:43.120\nSometimes he asks, were you sober?\n\n22:43.120 --> 22:48.560\nIf it gets confusing, like if it's a story about me finding my car keys.\n\n22:48.560 --> 22:54.240\nOur friend Greg Proops severed a tendon in his thumb by doing the exact same thing.\n\n22:54.240 --> 22:55.880\nHe was in London and pulled the...\n\n22:55.880 --> 22:57.400\nDoes he have shingles too?\n\n22:57.400 --> 22:59.040\nNo, not that I'm aware of.\n\n22:59.040 --> 23:00.280\nIt might be in his back.\n\n23:00.280 --> 23:01.280\nYeah.\n\n23:01.280 --> 23:02.280\nWe'll have to check.\n\n23:02.280 --> 23:06.720\nA bulb went out and he tried to pull the casing off and the glass shattered.\n\n23:06.720 --> 23:08.240\nBut the bulb went out.\n\n23:08.240 --> 23:10.320\nThat's like half a reason to do it, right?\n\n23:10.320 --> 23:11.320\nThat's a full reason.\n\n23:11.320 --> 23:12.320\nIt is a full reason.\n\n23:12.320 --> 23:13.320\nI did the math on it.\n\n23:13.320 --> 23:16.480\nI still would have called somebody and said, hey, would you do this one?\n\n23:16.480 --> 23:17.480\nWell, I'm Polish.\n\n23:17.480 --> 23:18.480\nI would have called two people.\n\n23:18.480 --> 23:23.480\nWe just went back to 1980.\n\n23:23.480 --> 23:30.320\nHow many Polish people does it take to tell this joke in 2018?\n\n23:30.320 --> 23:32.720\nThat guy you can hear in the back is Rob Schrab.\n\n23:32.720 --> 23:34.920\nDon't worry about him.\n\n23:34.920 --> 23:35.920\nThe...\n\n23:35.920 --> 23:42.160\nHe should just be lafmiked over there, because he's in a row.\n\n23:42.160 --> 23:47.440\nI wanted to think that because we all evolved from the same amoeba, basically, and then\n\n23:47.440 --> 23:50.360\nlike, even though we branched off, like we...\n\n23:50.360 --> 23:54.120\nThat there's some part of us that's similar to the moth when we get that drunk that we're\n\n23:54.120 --> 23:55.120\njust like...\n\n23:55.120 --> 24:00.480\nThat that's why drunk guys do what a moth would do if it had hands, which is just fuck\n\n24:00.480 --> 24:01.480\nwith a light bulb.\n\n24:01.480 --> 24:02.480\nYeah.\n\n24:02.480 --> 24:03.480\nA dantel flame.\n\n24:03.480 --> 24:04.480\nYou're in a hotel room.\n\n24:04.480 --> 24:05.480\nTake it.\n\n24:05.480 --> 24:06.480\nWhat's that?\n\n24:06.480 --> 24:07.480\nYou're in a hotel?\n\n24:07.480 --> 24:08.480\nYeah.\n\n24:08.480 --> 24:09.480\nYeah, there's also a lack of permanence in hotels.\n\n24:09.480 --> 24:10.480\nWell, it's also a mystery too.\n\n24:10.480 --> 24:11.480\nNone of this exists.\n\n24:11.480 --> 24:12.480\nAll the light fixtures work.\n\n24:12.480 --> 24:13.480\nDo you really?\n\n24:13.480 --> 24:14.480\nYeah.\n\n24:14.480 --> 24:19.960\nWell, when you first get a new place, you don't and remember all the business that you have\n\n24:19.960 --> 24:22.840\nto go through when that first light goes out in that first room and you're like, what\n\n24:22.840 --> 24:23.840\nthe fuck?\n\n24:23.840 --> 24:24.840\nHow does this flower work?\n\n24:24.840 --> 24:25.840\nOkay.\n\n24:25.840 --> 24:26.840\nYeah.\n\n24:26.840 --> 24:27.840\nYou're like...\n\n24:27.840 --> 24:28.840\nIn a hotel, it's all your first day.\n\n24:28.840 --> 24:29.840\nYeah.\n\n24:29.840 --> 24:30.840\nAnd you're like, what the fuck?\n\n24:30.840 --> 24:31.840\nWhat's this thing?\n\n24:31.840 --> 24:32.840\nOkay.\n\n24:32.840 --> 24:33.840\nSo that makes sense.\n\n24:33.840 --> 24:34.840\nBut then you have it in your hand.\n\n24:34.840 --> 24:35.840\nNow you want to smash it.\n\n24:35.840 --> 24:36.840\nI don't...\n\n24:36.840 --> 24:37.840\nI want to say I didn't like...\n\n24:37.840 --> 24:38.840\nBecause that seems so juvenile.\n\n24:38.840 --> 24:39.840\nYou want to say a lot of things.\n\n24:39.840 --> 24:40.840\nBut...\n\n24:40.840 --> 24:46.000\nIn my hand, how do I get it out of my hand?\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.280\nYou wanted to hear it smash.\n\n24:47.280 --> 24:48.800\nYou wanted to see how it smashed.\n\n24:48.800 --> 24:50.360\nYou wanted to see what you can get away with.\n\n24:50.360 --> 24:51.360\nIt's a new place.\n\n24:51.360 --> 24:52.360\nHow did the floors work?\n\n24:52.360 --> 24:54.440\nThere's two things that cause me rage in hotel rooms.\n\n24:54.440 --> 24:58.440\nI'm in a hotel a lot because they do travel comedy gigs.\n\n24:58.440 --> 24:59.440\nHumblebrag.\n\n24:59.440 --> 25:00.440\nNo.\n\n25:00.440 --> 25:01.440\nThat is a humblebrag.\n\n25:01.440 --> 25:03.600\nSome of you might just be in hotels sometimes.\n\n25:03.600 --> 25:04.600\nI'm in them a lot.\n\n25:04.600 --> 25:07.440\nThe TV remotes never work.\n\n25:07.440 --> 25:10.120\nYou have to fight with the TV remotely constantly.\n\n25:10.120 --> 25:12.960\nAnd then when you shut the door and you got to do not disturb, I always put the do not\n\n25:12.960 --> 25:16.640\ndisturb thing on because I don't need the housekeeping to come every five seconds.\n\n25:16.640 --> 25:20.960\nBecause if I want to come back under there, every time you shut the door, thing flies\n\n25:20.960 --> 25:21.960\noff.\n\n25:21.960 --> 25:24.680\nLike make it so that it stays on the door knob.\n\n25:24.680 --> 25:27.080\nI'm glad we talk about the real issues on this show.\n\n25:27.080 --> 25:28.080\nYeah.\n\n25:28.080 --> 25:29.080\nWe're not afraid to...\n\n25:29.080 --> 25:30.080\nMaybe tackle the real shit.\n\n25:30.080 --> 25:31.080\nIt's true.\n\n25:31.080 --> 25:34.160\nI got a little nervous as you were talking, but I'm back on board now.\n\n25:34.160 --> 25:35.160\nAs captain...\n\n25:35.160 --> 25:36.160\nRight.\n\n25:36.160 --> 25:37.160\nAs captain, fantastic.\n\n25:37.160 --> 25:39.480\nLet me tell you the greatest thing I can do with my stretchy arms.\n\n25:39.480 --> 25:44.360\nI can put on the do not disturb sign and slink right back in as it closes.\n\n25:44.360 --> 25:45.960\nI'm not talking about that.\n\n25:45.960 --> 25:50.280\nIt usually stays on when it goes back because the air sucks it back in.\n\n25:50.280 --> 25:53.440\nIt's when you leave and you open the door and when it shuts, it wants to...\n\n25:53.440 --> 25:55.720\nThere's something about leaving.\n\n25:55.720 --> 25:59.280\nThey could come up with something better in the brainstorming sessions that they spent\n\n25:59.280 --> 26:02.560\ntrying to come up with new ways of saying do not disturb.\n\n26:02.560 --> 26:03.560\nYeah.\n\n26:03.560 --> 26:05.040\nLike, I'm a lotus.\n\n26:05.040 --> 26:06.040\nLet me bloom.\n\n26:06.040 --> 26:07.480\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n26:07.480 --> 26:11.280\nIt's like trying to figure out which is the men's room in a fucking art gallery.\n\n26:11.280 --> 26:13.680\nWhat do you mean, Picasso's?\n\n26:13.680 --> 26:14.680\nWhat is that?\n\n26:14.680 --> 26:15.680\nYes.\n\n26:15.680 --> 26:16.680\nI'm shingling in here.\n\n26:16.680 --> 26:23.320\nI just pictured you looking for the bathroom and you're like, fuck it, you take your dick\n\n26:23.320 --> 26:25.160\nout and people start pointing.\n\n26:25.160 --> 26:26.760\nI don't know why I'm sorry.\n\n26:26.760 --> 26:27.760\nMaybe it's the shingles.\n\n26:27.760 --> 26:31.400\nWhat is the origin story of your friendship between you and Keith and Hemda?\n\n26:31.400 --> 26:32.400\nWe don't talk about it.\n\n26:32.400 --> 26:33.400\nYeah, we don't.\n\n26:33.400 --> 26:35.640\nBut it's working out and that's what matters.\n\n26:35.640 --> 26:36.640\nAre you friends?\n\n26:36.640 --> 26:37.640\nWe are friends.\n\n26:37.640 --> 26:38.640\nWe try to be.\n\n26:38.640 --> 26:39.640\nI'd say we're friends.\n\n26:39.640 --> 26:40.640\nYes.\n\n26:40.640 --> 26:41.640\nI mean, how long have you known each other?\n\n26:41.640 --> 26:42.640\nWhat's your backstory?\n\n26:42.640 --> 26:45.280\nI think we've known each other for like 15 years now.\n\n26:45.280 --> 26:46.440\nWe met at an open mic.\n\n26:46.440 --> 26:51.480\nIt was a weird open mic where you got to do literally anything for eight minutes.\n\n26:51.480 --> 26:56.440\nSo we've watched someone, you know, drink their own urine or, you know.\n\n26:56.440 --> 26:57.440\nJoy.\n\n26:57.440 --> 27:00.440\nThat is the weirdest.\n\n27:00.440 --> 27:04.840\nNow everyone's going to wonder for the rest of their lives if this was the worst written\n\n27:04.840 --> 27:05.840\nsketch.\n\n27:05.840 --> 27:08.040\nThat's what he looks like when you have shingles.\n\n27:08.040 --> 27:09.040\nYeah.\n\n27:09.040 --> 27:10.040\nWait till you go for the eggs.\n\n27:10.040 --> 27:14.080\nHe pulled up a jug of what he's choosing to call green tea.\n\n27:14.080 --> 27:15.080\nIt says green tea.\n\n27:15.080 --> 27:17.320\nWell, it might be green pea.\n\n27:17.320 --> 27:18.320\nOh, okay.\n\n27:18.320 --> 27:19.320\nSorry.\n\n27:19.320 --> 27:23.200\nThat's how you met, but it's weird that I pulled up a container of urine.\n\n27:23.200 --> 27:24.200\nEnjoy.\n\n27:24.200 --> 27:25.200\nYeah.\n\n27:25.200 --> 27:26.200\nSo yeah.\n\n27:26.200 --> 27:27.200\nOh yeah.\n\n27:27.200 --> 27:28.200\nOne time we saw someone at that open mic.\n\n27:28.200 --> 27:29.200\nDripping period.\n\n27:29.200 --> 27:30.200\nBlood and drawing with it.\n\n27:30.200 --> 27:31.200\nOh, he's good.\n\n27:31.200 --> 27:32.200\nHe's good.\n\n27:32.200 --> 27:33.200\nThat would have been.\n\n27:33.200 --> 27:34.200\nWhat was that?\n\n27:34.200 --> 27:35.200\nYou trying to flimax him?\n\n27:35.200 --> 27:36.200\nYeah.\n\n27:36.200 --> 27:37.200\nOkay.\n\n27:37.200 --> 27:38.200\nYou care.\n\n27:38.200 --> 27:39.200\nYou can't shake him.\n\n27:39.200 --> 27:40.200\nI see that.\n\n27:40.200 --> 27:41.200\nWhen Dan gets a green tea, hankering.\n\n27:41.200 --> 27:42.200\nHe's.\n\n27:42.200 --> 27:43.200\nI'm also a terrible listener.\n\n27:43.200 --> 27:44.200\nSo we'd have.\n\n27:44.200 --> 27:45.200\nYeah.\n\n27:45.200 --> 27:47.920\nSo somebody drank their own pee on stage and you thought, let's do a podcast.\n\n27:47.920 --> 27:54.800\nWell, he was doing stand up and I was singing and then I was half offended by his jokes,\n\n27:54.800 --> 27:57.320\nbut I love that he was, you know, going for it.\n\n27:57.320 --> 28:00.160\nAnd so I spoke to him after one of his sets.\n\n28:00.160 --> 28:02.600\nWe started dating shortly after.\n\n28:02.600 --> 28:05.600\nAnd yeah, don't, don't fist pound that.\n\n28:05.600 --> 28:07.600\nNo, no, no.\n\n28:07.600 --> 28:08.600\nAre you still?\n\n28:08.600 --> 28:09.600\nAre you still?\n\n28:09.600 --> 28:10.600\nFuck.\n\n28:10.600 --> 28:11.600\nNo, bro.\n\n28:11.600 --> 28:12.600\nFist pump.\n\n28:12.600 --> 28:13.600\nAll right.\n\n28:13.600 --> 28:14.600\nEverything that happened.\n\n28:14.600 --> 28:15.600\nSo it's cool.\n\n28:15.600 --> 28:16.600\nIt's just cool.\n\n28:16.600 --> 28:17.600\nSo she broke your heart and you couldn't.\n\n28:17.600 --> 28:22.160\nAnd you decided to keep your phony baloney relationship alive via podcast.\n\n28:22.160 --> 28:23.160\nYes.\n\n28:23.160 --> 28:24.160\nYeah.\n\n28:24.160 --> 28:25.160\nYeah.\n\n28:25.160 --> 28:27.000\nActually, I think we, we would have broken up a year before we did, but the podcast\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:28.000\nI think kept us together.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:31.720\nAnd then you were like, wait, let's keep the thing that works.\n\n28:31.720 --> 28:32.720\nYeah.\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:36.640\nCause I was like, oh my God, I hate you for 23 hours, but then for that one hour of podcasting,\n\n28:36.640 --> 28:37.640\nyou're super fun.\n\n28:37.640 --> 28:38.640\nBut the math wasn't adding up.\n\n28:38.640 --> 28:39.640\nSo we had to break up.\n\n28:39.640 --> 28:40.640\nAll right.\n\n28:40.640 --> 28:43.680\nI, I keep wanting to ask, I don't, I don't know how many more times I'm going to say\n\n28:43.680 --> 28:46.480\nyour name, but I, and I know you have to have this conversation every time, but I just,\n\n28:46.480 --> 28:51.920\nI'm just curious what your, what is your take on the, how much, how much do, do, do you\n\n28:51.920 --> 28:54.240\nprefer being put behind the CH?\n\n28:54.240 --> 28:56.960\nLike how do you, how do you say your own name?\n\n28:56.960 --> 28:57.960\nHemda.\n\n28:57.960 --> 28:59.200\nSo you go for it.\n\n28:59.200 --> 29:03.800\nBut, but, but, but if I, if I do that, I feel it's, say it, say it, say my name.\n\n29:03.800 --> 29:04.800\nHemda.\n\n29:04.800 --> 29:06.680\nLike it feels like I'm doing like a character.\n\n29:06.680 --> 29:07.680\nSay it again.\n\n29:07.680 --> 29:08.680\nHemda.\n\n29:08.680 --> 29:09.680\nHow does it feel now?\n\n29:09.680 --> 29:10.680\nIt felt still weird.\n\n29:10.680 --> 29:11.680\nGo back to when you were five.\n\n29:11.680 --> 29:12.680\nHemda.\n\n29:12.680 --> 29:13.680\nNo, dad.\n\n29:13.680 --> 29:17.880\nNot with the buckle and now say, Hemda, how does it feel now?\n\n29:17.880 --> 29:18.880\nOh good.\n\n29:18.880 --> 29:20.880\nIt's like, it's like a crackerjack and apple pie.\n\n29:20.880 --> 29:21.880\nI've been saying Hemda and I'm wrong.\n\n29:21.880 --> 29:22.880\nIt's, it's got a hug in it.\n\n29:22.880 --> 29:23.880\nIt's got a hug.\n\n29:23.880 --> 29:24.880\nGot a hug.\n\n29:24.880 --> 29:25.880\nYeah.\n\n29:25.880 --> 29:26.880\nAll right.\n\n29:26.880 --> 29:31.400\nYou were born in Israel, but raised in New York since you were four.\n\n29:31.400 --> 29:32.400\nYes.\n\n29:32.400 --> 29:33.400\nReally?\n\n29:33.400 --> 29:34.400\nThis is why we broke up.\n\n29:34.400 --> 29:36.400\nHe's the worst listener.\n\n29:36.400 --> 29:39.600\nAnd your eyes are hazel.\n\n29:39.600 --> 29:44.600\nWhat you, you, you had a whole, you've got, you have a whole singing thing.\n\n29:44.600 --> 29:45.600\nI did some singing.\n\n29:45.600 --> 29:46.600\nYeah.\n\n29:46.600 --> 29:47.600\nThat's all I know is singing things.\n\n29:47.600 --> 29:53.240\nLike you have an album in addition to, like you, you, you, you've done backup on other\n\n29:53.240 --> 29:55.280\nlike people's stuff.\n\n29:55.280 --> 30:01.120\nI've collaborated with people on world music and dance music and all kinds of different\n\n30:01.120 --> 30:02.120\nthings.\n\n30:02.120 --> 30:06.800\nThere's probably one of the most, I don't know which, it's popular in different genres,\n\n30:06.800 --> 30:10.840\nbut conjure one, which was from delirium, which is world music.\n\n30:10.840 --> 30:12.320\nSome people know that in the.\n\n30:12.320 --> 30:13.320\nWith Poe and Shineto Connor.\n\n30:13.320 --> 30:14.320\nOh yeah.\n\n30:14.320 --> 30:16.320\nI was on an album with Poe and Shineto Connor.\n\n30:16.320 --> 30:18.440\nDoes it, can you tell I feel weird talking about this?\n\n30:18.440 --> 30:19.440\nIt's like the, I just.\n\n30:19.440 --> 30:20.440\nShe's an amazing.\n\n30:20.440 --> 30:23.440\nYou're talking to a man drinking urine and eating eggs out of a sack.\n\n30:23.440 --> 30:26.400\nNo, that's why she doesn't want to come off too pretentious.\n\n30:26.400 --> 30:28.240\nYou don't want to, you don't want to take it too seriously.\n\n30:28.240 --> 30:29.240\nRight.\n\n30:29.240 --> 30:30.240\nOkay.\n\n30:30.240 --> 30:31.240\nLet's put it in this way.\n\n30:31.240 --> 30:32.240\nShe's been a lot of hotel rooms.\n\n30:32.240 --> 30:34.920\nSo she did pretty well.\n\n30:34.920 --> 30:40.160\nAre you guys kind of like in your partnership as far as like your dynamic?\n\n30:40.160 --> 30:43.560\nAre you, are you, do you think of yourself as more of the.\n\n30:43.560 --> 30:45.560\nThe will they won't take kind, right?\n\n30:45.560 --> 30:46.560\nRight.\n\n30:46.560 --> 30:53.200\nThe, the, the, does she bring in the, is there a, is there a contrast?\n\n30:53.200 --> 30:57.800\nAre you like, are you like, bro and down and fist bumping and, and she's like mother\n\n30:57.800 --> 31:01.280\nGaia like, like, like trying to make you more likable or.\n\n31:01.280 --> 31:02.280\nYes.\n\n31:02.280 --> 31:03.280\nYeah.\n\n31:03.280 --> 31:04.280\nYeah.\n\n31:04.280 --> 31:05.280\nShe's more, she's definitely more spiritual.\n\n31:05.280 --> 31:07.160\nShe's definitely deeper.\n\n31:07.160 --> 31:11.000\nShe thinks people that everybody has good qualities.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:12.000\nHe thinks that's weird.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:16.200\nDo you think everybody has good qualities?\n\n31:16.200 --> 31:17.840\nI think, I think.\n\n31:17.840 --> 31:19.440\nI think that nobody has good.\n\n31:19.440 --> 31:23.160\nI go through, I go through those phases, you know, like I'm not in that phase right\n\n31:23.160 --> 31:28.880\nnow, but when I'm, when I'm down, I don't even think anyone has any good qualities.\n\n31:28.880 --> 31:35.400\nLike I, but then when I'm, when I'm relatively stabilized, like or up, I feel like everybody's\n\n31:35.400 --> 31:36.720\nthe hero of their own story.\n\n31:36.720 --> 31:38.680\nLike there's no such thing as a bad person.\n\n31:38.680 --> 31:41.080\nBut you think everyone's stupid.\n\n31:41.080 --> 31:42.600\nThat's me, like pretty down.\n\n31:42.600 --> 31:48.600\nLike, I mean, when I'm, when I'm up, I'm like, well, what's stupid, you know, like, what\n\n31:48.600 --> 31:49.600\nis that?\n\n31:49.600 --> 31:53.960\nLike, like, like who says that guy over there eating a brick is like smarter than me or\n\n31:53.960 --> 31:54.960\ndumber than me.\n\n31:54.960 --> 31:56.640\nLike maybe he's a genius at brick eating.\n\n31:56.640 --> 32:03.880\nLike I kind of, I don't really feel dumber than, you know, some people about other stuff.\n\n32:03.880 --> 32:07.840\nI do see some people talking to themselves in New York, you know, just having conversations\n\n32:07.840 --> 32:11.120\nwith nobody across the street, you know, and then responding.\n\n32:11.120 --> 32:13.120\nAnd I go, what if they're right?\n\n32:13.120 --> 32:15.920\nWhat if they see something that we don't see?\n\n32:15.920 --> 32:17.840\nAnd what if there is a person over there?\n\n32:17.840 --> 32:25.120\nAnd over time and become like, I can, I can relate to them because I do a lot of talking\n\n32:25.120 --> 32:28.840\nto myself at home and I think it's just me having fun and doing voices.\n\n32:28.840 --> 32:29.840\nBut no, I'm crazy.\n\n32:29.840 --> 32:36.000\nI sing and rap and talk while I make a sandwich or take a shower like I'm, I'm, I'm only\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:40.040\na paycheck away from being the guy in the street who's rapping on the street corner.\n\n32:40.040 --> 32:41.040\nThat's why you wear a tie.\n\n32:41.040 --> 32:42.040\nYou're trying to fool everybody.\n\n32:42.040 --> 32:44.040\nMy suit is the only thing holding me up.\n\n32:44.040 --> 32:45.040\nYeah.\n\n32:45.040 --> 32:48.560\nCause not to be glib about it, but like if they're homeless, then that's the, you know,\n\n32:48.560 --> 32:52.680\nthey're going to do a couple of things that you do it in your own home, like out on the\n\n32:52.680 --> 32:53.680\nsidewalk.\n\n32:53.680 --> 32:57.000\nBut I don't think that's the real reason why someone's talking to themselves on the\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nsidewalk.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.120\nThat's like, that's they're singing in the shower.\n\n33:00.120 --> 33:01.840\nI think they're, I think they're mentally ill.\n\n33:01.840 --> 33:09.320\nAnd I get myself into, into a person that if I were homeless and out of work, then I\n\n33:09.320 --> 33:12.120\nwould probably be a guy that was making a lot of noise out in the street.\n\n33:12.120 --> 33:14.560\nLike I, for different reasons, maybe or maybe not.\n\n33:14.560 --> 33:15.560\nI don't know.\n\n33:15.560 --> 33:16.560\nYeah.\n\n33:16.560 --> 33:18.480\nIf I wasn't worried about like, oh man, I hope someone reads my screenplay and I don't\n\n33:18.480 --> 33:25.320\nwant to, you know, like I, once I was committed to homelessness, yeah, I'd be like, I'd,\n\n33:25.320 --> 33:27.880\nyeah, I'd be like talking about it a lot.\n\n33:27.880 --> 33:29.520\nI'd be like, this is great.\n\n33:29.520 --> 33:33.920\nLike like, or this sucks or look at me like, like, what are you, what are you eating over\n\n33:33.920 --> 33:34.920\nthere?\n\n33:34.920 --> 33:35.920\nIt looks stupid.\n\n33:35.920 --> 33:36.920\nLike a nice dog.\n\n33:36.920 --> 33:38.480\nHow do you know when you're finished?\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:39.480\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n33:39.480 --> 33:40.480\nLike heckling.\n\n33:40.480 --> 33:41.480\nRight.\n\n33:41.480 --> 33:45.640\nI'm just mad about you right now as every homeless person watching you being in a comfy\n\n33:45.640 --> 33:48.960\nbed that someone brought you because talking about how I'd out homeless them.\n\n33:48.960 --> 33:51.240\nI wasn't saying I'd do it better.\n\n33:51.240 --> 33:55.400\nI saw, I saw, you know, this is the freakiest thing I ever saw when I, when I was a, when\n\n33:55.400 --> 34:00.280\nI was like younger in Milwaukee, I was like a 20 something, like, you know, I think about\n\n34:00.280 --> 34:04.800\nthis all the time too, even when I hear people that are like, you know, like, that I get\n\n34:04.800 --> 34:09.000\nlike, oh, you're so stupid, like you're fucking Nazi on Twitter or whatever.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:13.080\nLike, I remember being like, like, I just thought all homeless people were like bums\n\n34:13.080 --> 34:17.360\nthat didn't, couldn't get it, that were like, like, oh, I don't want to get a job.\n\n34:17.360 --> 34:22.240\nSo someone give me some money, like, and I remember talking to this, this, uh, the friend\n\n34:22.240 --> 34:28.560\nof mine, like, who was a comic and she was like doing some volunteer thing for homeless\n\n34:28.560 --> 34:29.560\npeople.\n\n34:29.560 --> 34:31.360\nAnd I made some comment and she's like, what the fuck is that?\n\n34:31.360 --> 34:32.360\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n34:32.360 --> 34:33.360\nWhat do you think homeless people are?\n\n34:33.360 --> 34:34.360\nAnd I'm like, I don't know.\n\n34:34.360 --> 34:35.800\nThey're like people that don't have jobs and stuff.\n\n34:35.800 --> 34:38.200\nShe's like, they're mentally ill people that don't have a support system.\n\n34:38.200 --> 34:40.080\nLike, do you know what schizophrenia is?\n\n34:40.080 --> 34:44.480\nYou know, there's a kind of like, blew my mind and like, but before that, I was still\n\n34:44.480 --> 34:49.960\nan adult and still a smart and still thought that I was right about everything and it just,\n\n34:49.960 --> 34:52.880\nit's not like she was an encyclopedia or showed me anything.\n\n34:52.880 --> 34:58.400\nIt was just like one person going like, you moron, like, you don't even know what these\n\n34:58.400 --> 35:00.760\nthings are because you don't even think about them.\n\n35:00.760 --> 35:03.760\nAnd then when I moved to LA, one of the first things I saw that freaked me out because in\n\n35:03.760 --> 35:07.720\nMilwaukee, all the homeless people die off like once a year, they break into everyone's\n\n35:07.720 --> 35:10.520\ncars and just die while they're trying to get warm.\n\n35:10.520 --> 35:19.440\nAnd like mosquitoes, I was on the third steep promenade and there was this guy and he looked\n\n35:19.440 --> 35:22.080\nlike, he basically looked like Danny Trejo.\n\n35:22.080 --> 35:28.000\nLike he was so like, prison tatted and like scary looking like he looked like he could,\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:37.480\nhe just looked like you would cast him as like a no nonsense, street lethal, like gangster.\n\n35:37.480 --> 35:41.760\nAnd but he was like, he was just shrieking and like crying.\n\n35:41.760 --> 35:45.280\nHe was like, like, like he was, he was crying like a baby.\n\n35:45.280 --> 35:50.520\nHe was at, he was crying like, like, like somebody had taken his balloon and he was six years\n\n35:50.520 --> 35:51.520\nold.\n\n35:51.520 --> 35:54.360\nAnd I remember thinking, oh, he's probably like 22 years old.\n\n35:54.360 --> 36:01.200\nMaybe he just started to like go, you know, like, like, like, like some chemical imbalance\n\n36:01.200 --> 36:06.240\nis kicking in and he doesn't have a family that's like gonna, you know, say,\n\n36:06.240 --> 36:07.680\nwhat do you do when you pass?\n\n36:07.680 --> 36:08.680\nI support you.\n\n36:08.680 --> 36:09.680\nExactly.\n\n36:09.680 --> 36:13.040\nI was like, you can see everybody like, what do you do?\n\n36:13.040 --> 36:16.840\nYou just, you have to treat the person like a ghost, you know, because you walk up to\n\n36:16.840 --> 36:20.440\nsomebody who's like, but it's weird to have this, like, they're not always just like talking\n\n36:20.440 --> 36:21.440\nto a fire hydrant.\n\n36:21.440 --> 36:27.240\nIt's like the person was simply emoting, but, but it's funny how, how strict our standards\n\n36:27.240 --> 36:30.760\nare for what you're supposed to be doing and feeling and how empathic we are.\n\n36:30.760 --> 36:33.680\nWe're like, oh, that guy's not supposed to be that sad about anything.\n\n36:33.680 --> 36:36.600\nLike, nobody was looking around for his missing kid.\n\n36:36.600 --> 36:45.080\nWe knew he was crazy because, and I did air quotes for the people listening, like, because,\n\n36:45.080 --> 36:50.000\nbecause we just knew immediately, but it's funny how like that amount of empathy results\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:55.080\nin just like, we're like insects too, like we just go, oh, he's a dysfunctional aunt.\n\n36:55.080 --> 36:59.360\nSo like clear path and anyways, you look like you're probably gonna say something 20 minutes\n\n36:59.360 --> 37:00.360\nago.\n\n37:00.360 --> 37:02.920\nI'm just enjoy this is so surreal.\n\n37:02.920 --> 37:07.160\nI'm just, I'm like, oh, nighttime stories with Dan Harmon.\n\n37:07.160 --> 37:12.080\nI was gonna say that I feel like a lot of people experience that in New York, like you,\n\n37:12.080 --> 37:14.800\nyou're constantly around people and we don't really have cars.\n\n37:14.800 --> 37:15.800\nWe don't have a car.\n\n37:15.800 --> 37:20.840\nSo we're riding in public all the time and you'll have these breakdown moments and maybe\n\n37:20.840 --> 37:24.320\nmore women than men because men's tear ducts are kind of blocked.\n\n37:24.320 --> 37:25.320\nBut fuck.\n\n37:25.320 --> 37:26.320\nYeah, bro.\n\n37:26.320 --> 37:27.320\nI know.\n\n37:27.320 --> 37:28.320\nWith our hard dicks.\n\n37:28.320 --> 37:29.320\nYes.\n\n37:29.320 --> 37:30.320\nWith your very, very super hard.\n\n37:30.320 --> 37:31.320\nYeah.\n\n37:31.320 --> 37:32.320\nGiant balls.\n\n37:32.320 --> 37:33.320\nThey carry those things.\n\n37:33.320 --> 37:34.320\nIn our tear ducts.\n\n37:34.320 --> 37:35.320\nYeah.\n\n37:35.320 --> 37:36.320\nMaybe I see.\n\n37:36.320 --> 37:37.320\nYeah.\n\n37:37.320 --> 37:39.560\nA lot of women don't know is that when we're not showing our balls, they're right up in\n\n37:39.560 --> 37:40.560\nour tear ducts.\n\n37:40.560 --> 37:41.560\nOh man.\n\n37:41.560 --> 37:42.560\nKeeping us from crying.\n\n37:42.560 --> 37:43.560\nThat clears up so much.\n\n37:43.560 --> 37:44.560\nAnd when they're soft, we go to four hymns.\n\n37:44.560 --> 37:47.560\nOh, I thought you were playing the, I thought that was ad music.\n\n37:47.560 --> 37:50.240\nI accidentally hit my iPad with one of my balls.\n\n37:50.240 --> 37:51.240\nSorry.\n\n37:51.240 --> 37:52.240\nWhat were you saying?\n\n37:52.240 --> 37:56.480\nSo, so I think every woman I know has this story where she was crying on the train and\n\n37:56.480 --> 37:58.160\nthere's like different responses.\n\n37:58.160 --> 38:02.520\nMost of the time, another woman will pass you a napkin or a tissue from her purse.\n\n38:02.520 --> 38:03.520\nAnd that's it.\n\n38:03.520 --> 38:04.520\nThat's all you get.\n\n38:04.520 --> 38:05.520\nIt's like, we feel you.\n\n38:05.520 --> 38:08.960\nNow, you know, shut that shit down by the time you get to the office.\n\n38:08.960 --> 38:09.960\nWow.\n\n38:09.960 --> 38:10.960\nYeah.\n\n38:10.960 --> 38:13.960\nI get my phone number.\n\n38:13.960 --> 38:14.960\nLike for help call.\n\n38:14.960 --> 38:15.960\nWe'll see.\n\n38:15.960 --> 38:17.960\nShould we bring up?\n\n38:17.960 --> 38:21.680\nWhen I was like, like when I was 10 or 11, I was in New York with my mom.\n\n38:21.680 --> 38:27.200\nWe were in a subway and like double A or whatever that one is.\n\n38:27.200 --> 38:33.880\nAnd there was a guy that was ranting and raving about Reaganomics and trickle down and he\n\n38:33.880 --> 38:37.400\nwas screaming at everybody and nobody just gave him the time of day.\n\n38:37.400 --> 38:40.920\nEveryone's reading the newspaper, looking at their shit, doing anything.\n\n38:40.920 --> 38:45.680\nAnd he was screaming, screaming, screaming and pulled out a knife like a small knife.\n\n38:45.680 --> 38:47.480\nStill nobody gave him the time of day.\n\n38:47.480 --> 38:49.600\nLike, like he's not going to do anything.\n\n38:49.600 --> 38:54.160\nBut the moment he walked up to my mom and started screaming, all the men stood up.\n\n38:54.160 --> 38:58.640\nThey all put their newspaper down, like, OK, like you can bluster around me.\n\n38:58.640 --> 39:02.360\nBut like the moment he started doing that to a woman, they took out their knives.\n\n39:02.360 --> 39:04.160\nWe were here first.\n\n39:04.160 --> 39:06.400\nYou never alone.\n\n39:06.400 --> 39:11.440\nI thought that I was going to turn out to be Alan Greenspan because he was raving about\n\n39:11.440 --> 39:12.440\neconomics.\n\n39:12.440 --> 39:13.440\nAll right.\n\n39:13.440 --> 39:14.440\nLet's.\n\n39:14.440 --> 39:16.360\nAnd that's why I broke the light bulb.\n\n39:16.360 --> 39:17.360\nThank you.\n\n39:17.360 --> 39:18.360\nYeah.\n\n39:18.360 --> 39:19.360\nThat was a good story.\n\n39:19.360 --> 39:20.360\nI think I maybe just held it.\n\n39:20.360 --> 39:21.360\nYou want to crawl in there?\n\n39:21.360 --> 39:22.360\nYou want to make this a.\n\n39:22.360 --> 39:28.400\nDo you ever get so drunk that, like, you just turn into a, you're just an animal.\n\n39:28.400 --> 39:30.200\nThat's right before you pass out.\n\n39:30.200 --> 39:35.520\nHopefully you're off the road, out of public, but you're just like, you have reduced yourself\n\n39:35.520 --> 39:38.880\nto nothing but cortex.\n\n39:38.880 --> 39:44.000\nSo I think if I did break that thing on purpose, it was because I had been, that's what I had\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:45.160\nachieved that state.\n\n39:45.160 --> 39:50.720\nI was like, just looking at it like, like I was on an alien planet and wanted to know\n\n39:50.720 --> 39:52.240\nhow gravity worked.\n\n39:52.240 --> 39:53.240\nLike I was like.\n\n39:53.240 --> 39:54.240\nIt feels good.\n\n39:54.240 --> 39:55.240\nIt feels like it would feel good.\n\n39:55.240 --> 39:59.800\nI remember, I remember my emotional response to it shattering and going like, I just stood\n\n39:59.800 --> 40:06.360\nthere and then I remember going, huh, but it was more like, it wasn't about the thing\n\n40:06.360 --> 40:09.960\nbecause it did exactly what glass is supposed to do when it breaks, but I was looking at\n\n40:09.960 --> 40:12.080\nmyself and going, huh.\n\n40:12.080 --> 40:13.680\nThat's what I do with my time.\n\n40:13.680 --> 40:16.280\nBroken person.\n\n40:16.280 --> 40:23.640\nYou can just drop a human being from even, even, even the height of comfort and privilege.\n\n40:23.640 --> 40:26.440\nAnd it'll just, it'll just like, it just shatters.\n\n40:26.440 --> 40:31.040\nLike what I'm just, I just, it was like I pulled myself out of like, because I have nothing\n\n40:31.040 --> 40:33.440\nto, because I had nothing to be upset about.\n\n40:33.440 --> 40:35.200\nI, I did this thing.\n\n40:35.200 --> 40:39.040\nI think that's why rock stars like trash hotel rooms, because it's like you just, you can't\n\n40:39.040 --> 40:42.000\nmanage all of the, everything's fine.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.960\nOh, here's another thing that would make me want to trash your hotel room is when I've\n\n40:44.960 --> 40:49.600\nspoken about it before, when they ornamentally put the, the Kleenex, like in a little beautiful\n\n40:49.600 --> 40:54.960\nlotus shape, you know, and then you take those out because those have been handled and folded\n\n40:54.960 --> 40:59.840\ninto origami by the person who presumably had been cleaning up somebody else's poop.\n\n40:59.840 --> 41:06.480\nUh, like no offense to the housekeeping industry, which is a noble, uh, wonderful, uh, profession.\n\n41:06.480 --> 41:07.480\nYou take that out.\n\n41:07.480 --> 41:08.480\nSo where the offense would have came from.\n\n41:08.480 --> 41:09.480\nAnd then.\n\n41:09.480 --> 41:10.480\nNo offense, poop handlers.\n\n41:10.480 --> 41:11.480\nAnd we need that.\n\n41:11.480 --> 41:17.840\nAnd we take out the lotus blossom with five or to 12 Kleenexes and that's all of them.\n\n41:17.840 --> 41:20.720\nAnd then you fucking throw it out and you'd have no Kleenex now, except the ones that\n\n41:20.720 --> 41:22.640\nhave been origami into sadness.\n\n41:22.640 --> 41:26.720\nSpeaking of Kleenex, let's bring to the stage, uh, uh, he's performed for clubs and colleges\n\n41:26.720 --> 41:38.040\nall over America, uh, Rob Schrab, Rob Schrab, uh, uh, he looks pissed off.\n\n41:38.040 --> 41:40.040\nThis doesn't bode well.\n\n41:40.040 --> 41:44.120\nHaven't they got out of the bed like it's like the couch at Johnny Carson where she\n\n41:44.120 --> 41:46.120\nhad to move down to the, uh, to the panel.\n\n41:46.120 --> 41:48.120\nI want to give everyone a chance.\n\n41:48.120 --> 41:49.120\nWhy don't you get in bed?\n\n41:49.120 --> 41:50.120\nGet Sped Shrek.\n\n41:50.120 --> 41:51.120\nHello, Dan.\n\n41:51.120 --> 41:52.120\nHello.\n\n41:52.120 --> 42:03.120\nShould I get in the bed like Lolly gets into the bed with Kate and I?\n\n42:03.120 --> 42:10.360\nThat's it.\n\n42:10.360 --> 42:12.360\nDoes she go under the covers?\n\n42:12.360 --> 42:13.360\nYeah.\n\n42:13.360 --> 42:15.040\nAh, go deep.\n\n42:15.040 --> 42:16.040\nGo deep.\n\n42:16.040 --> 42:17.040\nYeah.\n\n42:17.040 --> 42:18.040\nThat's Nigel.\n\n42:18.040 --> 42:19.040\nExcept night.\n\n42:19.040 --> 42:31.040\nI find it hard to believe your job does this pretty much wraps butts right in Dan's face.\n\n42:31.040 --> 42:33.480\nI really didn't do that right, did I?\n\n42:33.480 --> 42:36.280\nNo, you didn't get the wrong answers.\n\n42:36.280 --> 42:37.760\nIt's really hot in there, right?\n\n42:37.760 --> 42:41.640\nHe looked over at Kendo like, wow, New Yorkers are prudes.\n\n42:41.640 --> 42:47.160\nLike Nigel, Nigel does this, does it, but he doesn't, he, the way he digs is with both\n\n42:47.160 --> 42:49.320\nfront paws in unison.\n\n42:49.320 --> 42:50.320\nSo he like, oh really?\n\n42:50.320 --> 42:52.400\nYeah, it's kind of funny.\n\n42:52.400 --> 42:57.280\nAlso he's, he's back to full health now because he, he humped the fuck out of Harvey today.\n\n42:57.280 --> 42:59.960\nDoes he know that that's not going to go anywhere?\n\n42:59.960 --> 43:04.440\nHe's not doing it, he's absolutely doing it when, when they play fetch and Harvey gets\n\n43:04.440 --> 43:09.200\nthe ball, he waits for Harvey to come back with the ball and then he humps him and then\n\n43:09.200 --> 43:16.080\nhe like, he just like finishes, he does an orgasm, but he finishes dominating him and\n\n43:16.080 --> 43:22.400\nthen he does this like hind leg like cat, cat, cat kind of burying a turd kind of move.\n\n43:22.400 --> 43:26.040\nLike he scrapes dirt, phantom dirt at Harvey.\n\n43:26.040 --> 43:27.040\nThat's him spiking the football?\n\n43:27.040 --> 43:28.040\nYeah.\n\n43:28.040 --> 43:31.800\nYou just grate your giant so you get the ball whenever you want, but guess who, guess who\n\n43:31.800 --> 43:33.880\ngets the phantom fuck you?\n\n43:33.880 --> 43:40.560\nSo when you went into the doctor and he opened the door and you're sitting, you know, in\n\n43:40.560 --> 43:47.200\nthe robe and everything and you just pointed at your forehead, did it, did it take a look\n\n43:47.200 --> 43:53.400\nat it a long time and then went, oh you got this form of herpes, it's shingles?\n\n43:53.400 --> 43:58.840\nYeah, well he, at first I told him about, I was like, look, I fell, but I think I also\n\n43:58.840 --> 44:02.440\ngot a rash from like a New York pillowcase or something.\n\n44:02.440 --> 44:05.480\nIs that what they call them now?\n\n44:05.480 --> 44:07.320\nAnd he like zoomed in on the rash.\n\n44:07.320 --> 44:09.400\nA New York pillowcase is when you poop on somebody's chest.\n\n44:09.400 --> 44:10.400\nYeah.\n\n44:10.400 --> 44:14.240\nI guess my doctor's really good or sees a ton of people with shingles because he was just\n\n44:14.240 --> 44:22.360\nlike, I talked to him for like 10 seconds, I have, I have, I always record my doctor\n\n44:22.360 --> 44:25.400\nsessions in case he says something that I need to remember later.\n\n44:25.400 --> 44:30.720\nAnd the, the audio file from me walking, from him walking in, not me walking him, but him\n\n44:30.720 --> 44:35.800\nwalking in to see me, to me walking out the door and remembering to hit stop, five minutes\n\n44:35.800 --> 44:37.480\nand seven seconds.\n\n44:37.480 --> 44:43.920\nAnd the guy like, like, boom, he like, I was like, I said a couple things about what, what\n\n44:43.920 --> 44:44.920\nI was thinking.\n\n44:44.920 --> 44:45.920\nI was all over the place.\n\n44:45.920 --> 44:50.240\nHe's like looking at me while I was talking and he's like, you know what, worst case scenario,\n\n44:50.240 --> 44:53.040\nshingles, let's treat it like shingles because that's the worst.\n\n44:53.040 --> 44:54.040\nWe got to treat that right away.\n\n44:54.040 --> 44:55.040\nIf that's what it is.\n\n44:55.040 --> 44:59.160\nIf it's something else who gives a fuck, when did he say herpes?\n\n44:59.160 --> 45:00.160\nHe never said the word herpes.\n\n45:00.160 --> 45:02.360\nI had to find that out online.\n\n45:02.360 --> 45:05.000\nIt's post herpetic something, right?\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:06.560\nI had the same thing.\n\n45:06.560 --> 45:14.040\nI had, I was on a bad flight like back from San Francisco and it was like, like going\n\n45:14.040 --> 45:26.880\nlike over the intercom, like the stewardess was like, people just sit down, just sit down.\n\n45:26.880 --> 45:28.480\nYou know, that's how bad it was.\n\n45:28.480 --> 45:32.240\nAnd I was just like holding on, holding my breath the entire time.\n\n45:32.240 --> 45:39.720\nAnd when I got off the plane, I had like this rash that was grew above my, my eyelid.\n\n45:39.720 --> 45:46.280\nAnd I went to the doctor and he looked at it and he was, oh, you got herpes, roster,\n\n45:46.280 --> 45:47.280\nzoster, zoster.\n\n45:47.280 --> 45:48.280\nZoster, yeah.\n\n45:48.280 --> 45:49.280\nThat's shingles.\n\n45:49.280 --> 45:50.280\nYeah.\n\n45:50.280 --> 45:51.280\nI can't believe he called it that.\n\n45:51.280 --> 45:52.280\nYeah.\n\n45:52.280 --> 45:57.280\nBut, but I went, what, herpes, no, I mean, what, I mean, like, that's impossible.\n\n45:57.280 --> 45:58.280\nYeah.\n\n45:58.280 --> 45:59.280\nWhy do they give shingles such a fun name?\n\n45:59.280 --> 46:00.520\nI guess we're finding out why.\n\n46:00.520 --> 46:06.880\nYou know, but, but he said it like, oh, that's herpes and that guy and the, and what he should\n\n46:06.880 --> 46:13.600\nhave done was not the kind you think of, because that's the only kind anybody thinks of.\n\n46:13.600 --> 46:14.600\nThey don't think of it.\n\n46:14.600 --> 46:15.600\nRight.\n\n46:15.600 --> 46:16.600\nIs this the kind I have to say on dates?\n\n46:16.600 --> 46:17.600\nYeah.\n\n46:17.600 --> 46:18.600\nYeah.\n\n46:18.600 --> 46:19.600\nSo, you know.\n\n46:19.600 --> 46:21.480\nThat was his moment for that day to get some excitement or something.\n\n46:21.480 --> 46:22.480\nYeah.\n\n46:22.480 --> 46:23.480\nHe needed a response.\n\n46:23.480 --> 46:28.880\nBut, but he didn't like, you know, so I was like, but it, what, I didn't rub my head on\n\n46:28.880 --> 46:33.080\na thing that gives you the herpes I'm thinking.\n\n46:33.080 --> 46:39.280\nAnd, and he was, and he was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's, let's do wear one\n\n46:39.280 --> 46:40.680\nof the pussy hats though.\n\n46:40.680 --> 46:41.680\nNot one of those.\n\n46:41.680 --> 46:43.920\nThat's why they made those pussy hats.\n\n46:43.920 --> 46:52.880\nSo Keith Hymda, try to do it, to try to natural one there, Hymda, Keith more of a cut on it.\n\n46:52.880 --> 46:53.880\nI noticed that.\n\n46:53.880 --> 46:54.880\nHow do you do it?\n\n46:54.880 --> 46:55.880\nKick.\n\n46:55.880 --> 46:56.880\nNo, how do you say her name?\n\n46:56.880 --> 46:57.880\nHymda.\n\n46:57.880 --> 46:58.880\nAnd then now you say it.\n\n46:58.880 --> 46:59.880\nHymda.\n\n46:59.880 --> 47:00.880\nSee, it's different.\n\n47:00.880 --> 47:01.880\nHe puts more of a cut.\n\n47:01.880 --> 47:02.880\nHe was born in a different place.\n\n47:02.880 --> 47:03.880\nI'm finally getting it right.\n\n47:03.880 --> 47:04.880\nTook 13 years.\n\n47:04.880 --> 47:08.880\nYou guys ever, you guys ever have a fight in all those thousands of episodes?\n\n47:08.880 --> 47:09.880\nYes.\n\n47:09.880 --> 47:15.440\nLike, like, I mean, like, like, like a bad one, not like it's, oh, this is such provocative\n\n47:15.440 --> 47:20.120\nentertainment because they disagree so much, but like you fight and it's like, shit, they're\n\n47:20.120 --> 47:21.120\nlike pissed.\n\n47:21.120 --> 47:22.120\nYeah.\n\n47:22.120 --> 47:23.120\nYeah.\n\n47:23.120 --> 47:24.120\nWhat was it called?\n\n47:24.120 --> 47:27.200\nThat there's the first one that we had, we don't bring up old fights.\n\n47:27.200 --> 47:28.200\nI don't know.\n\n47:28.200 --> 47:29.880\nHe, he shed it off in the middle.\n\n47:29.880 --> 47:31.240\nHe's like, well, now we're really fighting.\n\n47:31.240 --> 47:35.560\nI was like, but we do everything else on air, so just turn it back on and let's finish.\n\n47:35.560 --> 47:40.240\nAnd it was, it actually helped because a lot of times he'll just stare at me when I'm,\n\n47:40.240 --> 47:44.360\nwhen I'm trying to argue with him and it's like, how boring is that and how much, like,\n\n47:44.360 --> 47:45.360\nhow far he can go.\n\n47:45.360 --> 47:46.360\nShe has all the points anyway, you know.\n\n47:46.360 --> 47:47.360\nYeah.\n\n47:47.360 --> 47:48.360\nAnd he just really just literally stares.\n\n47:48.360 --> 47:50.400\nBut if, if he's in front of a mic, he can't stare.\n\n47:50.400 --> 47:52.040\nSo he was forced to respond to me.\n\n47:52.040 --> 47:56.480\nAre you in new relationships now or is this still like, are you, oh, no, this is like\n\n47:56.480 --> 47:57.480\n10, 10 years ago.\n\n47:57.480 --> 47:58.480\nShe's married now.\n\n47:58.480 --> 47:59.480\nOh, okay.\n\n47:59.480 --> 48:00.480\nYeah.\n\n48:00.480 --> 48:01.480\nYes.\n\n48:01.480 --> 48:02.920\nWhereas Keith is holding on to this for dear life.\n\n48:02.920 --> 48:03.920\nWho knows?\n\n48:03.920 --> 48:05.920\nYou just live the universe will give what the universe gives, right?\n\n48:05.920 --> 48:09.000\nIt's going to all be the universe fucking with me.\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:12.200\nKeith, do you think there are good and bad people?\n\n48:12.200 --> 48:14.240\nYeah, of course.\n\n48:14.240 --> 48:16.160\nLike what do you think is responsible for that?\n\n48:16.160 --> 48:19.600\nDo you think they're boring, good and bad or do you think it's their, they just get\n\n48:19.600 --> 48:21.640\nthe luck of the draw and they're no better.\n\n48:21.640 --> 48:24.120\nA lot of it starts with, you know, it just is what it is.\n\n48:24.120 --> 48:29.480\nAnd then you, you take your personality, whichever way you want, you realize people\n\n48:29.480 --> 48:36.120\nneed help and you're here to serve or you don't and you're selfish.\n\n48:36.120 --> 48:37.120\nI think it's that simple.\n\n48:37.120 --> 48:38.120\nI think.\n\n48:38.120 --> 48:43.320\nSo we're being tested every day in big and small ways to like, like usually we can get\n\n48:43.320 --> 48:46.440\nby by probably not like doing too much of an extreme choice.\n\n48:46.440 --> 48:51.920\nBut basically there are people who are like, you know what, it's, it's been three Wednesdays\n\n48:51.920 --> 48:55.960\nin a row since Mercury's in retrograde and I'm just going to kill this dog with a knife\n\n48:55.960 --> 48:59.840\nfirst, something like, like, like, like, like, I guess that's a bad example because it sounds\n\n48:59.840 --> 49:01.840\nlike a compulsion that someone would have example.\n\n49:01.840 --> 49:03.080\nI feel like I missed the step.\n\n49:03.080 --> 49:08.480\nI'm trying to think of like, because I don't know if I, I think it's like being healthy.\n\n49:08.480 --> 49:13.280\nI think everybody prefers to be in shape, but they don't want to do the work.\n\n49:13.280 --> 49:14.280\nYes.\n\n49:14.280 --> 49:15.280\nYou know, they don't want to exercise.\n\n49:15.280 --> 49:16.480\nThey don't want to eat healthy.\n\n49:16.480 --> 49:19.480\nBut if they did, they would look better and probably feel better.\n\n49:19.480 --> 49:24.720\nAnd I think that's what it's like to be, I think when you're bad, when you're evil,\n\n49:24.720 --> 49:28.120\nwhen you're being lazy, and when you're being good, you're actually putting some effort\n\n49:28.120 --> 49:29.120\ninto life.\n\n49:29.120 --> 49:30.120\nYes.\n\n49:30.120 --> 49:31.120\nI don't know.\n\n49:31.120 --> 49:32.120\nI have a problem.\n\n49:32.120 --> 49:33.120\nI have a problem.\n\n49:33.120 --> 49:34.120\nI mean, I don't have a problem.\n\n49:34.120 --> 49:37.560\nYou guys are allowed to think that way because I'm a good person.\n\n49:37.560 --> 49:44.160\nBut I just, I just feel like then I, but then I start to like micro scope that and go, well,\n\n49:44.160 --> 49:52.440\nyeah, but if I'm, if I'm lazy and then I decide to start working out, like, okay, now I feel\n\n49:52.440 --> 49:56.460\nlike I'm a good person because it was harder to do that than it was, but it's still what\n\n49:56.460 --> 49:57.960\nI felt like doing.\n\n49:57.960 --> 49:58.960\nI mean, you get it.\n\n49:58.960 --> 50:03.520\nI guess it gets into that whole stupid philosophical, like, free will versus fate thing.\n\n50:03.520 --> 50:08.320\nI mean, like, if my brain chemistry is going to result, are we onto some synaptic level\n\n50:08.320 --> 50:10.520\nmaking fucking choices?\n\n50:10.520 --> 50:16.480\nLike, and it's like this, like, if I'm like, if Kate says, hey, let's go for a hike, I\n\n50:16.480 --> 50:31.440\ngo, like I'm there, and then, but if I go, I, I'm walking and I'm having a good time\n\n50:31.440 --> 50:32.440\nand it's nice.\n\n50:32.440 --> 50:34.080\nAnd then I go, I'm glad I did that.\n\n50:34.080 --> 50:35.960\nI like doing that.\n\n50:35.960 --> 50:36.960\nThat's fun.\n\n50:36.960 --> 50:46.320\nI always say, what if she says, whenever I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I\n\n50:46.320 --> 50:48.600\ngo, whenever she says, let's go for a hike.\n\n50:48.600 --> 50:52.200\nSo the next time she says, let's go for a hike, I know this time I'm not going to do\n\n50:52.200 --> 50:53.200\nthat noise.\n\n50:53.200 --> 50:54.200\nBut do you do it anyway?\n\n50:54.200 --> 50:55.200\nI do it anyway.\n\n50:55.200 --> 50:56.200\nAll right.\n\n50:56.200 --> 50:57.200\nYeah.\n\n50:57.200 --> 50:58.200\nYeah.\n\n50:58.200 --> 51:01.880\nI kind of like, maybe, maybe good and bad is maybe the way I can buy into it is, is healthy\n\n51:01.880 --> 51:02.880\nand unhealthy.\n\n51:02.880 --> 51:04.000\nLike, we all get depressed.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:09.040\nWe all get like, and, and so, or like, it's like a sink full of dishes, like nobody wants\n\n51:09.040 --> 51:15.000\nto do the dishes, but like, you don't, it's not like, oh, this battle of, it's just sort\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:20.320\nof like, like, I don't know, if somebody told you that eating a dog turd made you live another\n\n51:20.320 --> 51:24.680\n50 years, you either, you either eat the dog turd or you don't.\n\n51:24.680 --> 51:27.520\nAnd I don't think that makes you a good or a bad person.\n\n51:27.520 --> 51:32.560\nBut you, if you eat it and they were telling the truth and you live for another 50 years,\n\n51:32.560 --> 51:34.360\nthere might be all kinds of other side effects too.\n\n51:34.360 --> 51:38.360\nLike, oh, the reason for that is because there's like an enzyme in dog turds that like also\n\n51:38.360 --> 51:43.640\nlike lifts your psychology or it's like, there's vitamin D in dog turds and all this stuff.\n\n51:43.640 --> 51:46.920\nSo along the way, you're gaining all these benefits and you're like thinking more clearly\n\n51:46.920 --> 51:51.360\nand you're, so then, and then you're like, well, dude, I ate dog shit the other day and\n\n51:51.360 --> 51:52.640\nI feel like a million bucks.\n\n51:52.640 --> 51:54.760\nSo then this homeless guy goes, hey, can I have two dollars?\n\n51:54.760 --> 51:58.480\nAnd you're like, you know what, fuck it, here's two dollars and that Jim Carrey movie kind\n\n51:58.480 --> 51:59.480\nof thing.\n\n51:59.480 --> 52:01.960\nAnd you're like, so the whole time, it's like, it's like, you could, I think it's like, you\n\n52:01.960 --> 52:06.680\ncould, that's the way I look at it is like, there's people who are in, in like, they're\n\n52:06.680 --> 52:10.840\nlike resonating with the, they're like sick and there's people who are.\n\n52:10.840 --> 52:12.840\nSo yeah, he's kind of talking about that.\n\n52:12.840 --> 52:16.120\nHe eats is more black and white and I'm more gray on the show and off.\n\n52:16.120 --> 52:21.880\nSo for example, a close friend of mine, we actually were roommates with each other with\n\n52:21.880 --> 52:22.880\nmy husband.\n\n52:22.880 --> 52:23.880\nWhat's that?\n\n52:23.880 --> 52:24.880\nBill Johnny.\n\n52:24.880 --> 52:25.880\nYou were close.\n\n52:25.880 --> 52:26.880\nYes.\n\n52:26.880 --> 52:27.880\nJohnny.\n\n52:27.880 --> 52:30.520\nYou know, and he was, he was our roommate for a little while and we could sense that\n\n52:30.520 --> 52:36.440\nhe was the stress of life was starting to kind of skew his thinking and skew like his\n\n52:36.440 --> 52:40.640\nresponse to life in general and to go into work and things like that.\n\n52:40.640 --> 52:43.400\nAnd then we had to separate ways.\n\n52:43.400 --> 52:49.400\nWe were all moving and he got butt hurt about it and spray painted the entire house and\n\n52:49.400 --> 52:53.760\njust let me be clear how bad the spray painting was, not only on all the walls, but like an\n\n52:53.760 --> 52:55.960\nasshole in all the corners.\n\n52:55.960 --> 52:59.800\nSo when you repay, you have to repaint the corner.\n\n52:59.800 --> 53:00.800\nFuck you.\n\n53:00.800 --> 53:05.200\nSo, so it didn't happen hurt by painting before.\n\n53:05.200 --> 53:06.200\nIt's not good.\n\n53:06.200 --> 53:07.200\nI'd rather eat dog shit.\n\n53:07.200 --> 53:08.200\nI'm not exaggerating.\n\n53:08.200 --> 53:09.200\nIt makes you live long.\n\n53:09.200 --> 53:11.360\nI'm hearing good things.\n\n53:11.360 --> 53:13.960\nSo his point was this guy is just bad news.\n\n53:13.960 --> 53:17.160\nHe's a bad person and, you know, no one should deal with him.\n\n53:17.160 --> 53:22.920\nHe should be locked up for however long and, and my thing is he should be spray painted.\n\n53:22.920 --> 53:31.160\nHis brain glitched and I should stay away from him for now, but I believe that he can,\n\n53:31.160 --> 53:36.640\nhe can find another path and become a good person until he does.\n\n53:36.640 --> 53:37.640\nKeith is right.\n\n53:37.640 --> 53:40.560\nWell, it's not about that.\n\n53:40.560 --> 53:41.560\nIt just is.\n\n53:41.560 --> 53:42.560\nYeah.\n\n53:42.560 --> 53:47.520\nI remember, I've told this story before because like I broke up with a girlfriend or she,\n\n53:47.520 --> 53:48.520\nshe broke up with me.\n\n53:48.520 --> 53:53.800\nSo I was all fucked off about it and she was mutual friends with all my friends and like,\n\n53:53.800 --> 53:58.440\nand then I was, I was just handling the breakup really poorly and I just like, I couldn't\n\n53:58.440 --> 54:04.640\nstop thinking about her and all this stuff and I was just a drag to be around and, and,\n\n54:04.640 --> 54:10.000\nand I found out that everybody was in Palm Springs without me and, and I was like, what\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:11.000\nthe fuck?\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:12.800\nYou guys don't even like me now.\n\n54:12.800 --> 54:16.120\nYou like her more than me and all this stuff and I was like, it's just having this terrible\n\n54:16.120 --> 54:22.520\nday and, and, and my friend Dino said, look, I know we love you.\n\n54:22.520 --> 54:26.680\nWe just, it's, it's not a, it's not a bad, it doesn't make you a bad person if people\n\n54:26.680 --> 54:28.480\ndon't want to be around you.\n\n54:28.480 --> 54:29.480\nIt's like you have a cold.\n\n54:29.480 --> 54:31.400\nIt's like you have snot dripping out of your face.\n\n54:31.400 --> 54:33.360\nLike we can't wait for you to get better.\n\n54:33.360 --> 54:38.160\nAnd I was like, oh, oh, and then I was just like, yeah, okay, so I'm sick.\n\n54:38.160 --> 54:44.000\nLike I have a sickness called like I, I hate myself and I hate my girlfriend and I hate\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:48.680\nmy friends and I hate everybody and I wish that, you know, it's like, it's just all sickness.\n\n54:48.680 --> 54:53.160\nShe had a sickness called forgetting to bring tense water and food to a camping trip.\n\n54:53.160 --> 54:54.160\nWell, that's what you get.\n\n54:54.160 --> 54:56.160\nDon't fucking choose her.\n\n54:56.160 --> 54:57.160\nThat's true.\n\n54:57.160 --> 54:59.040\nI went to a hospital, a hospital, Jesus Christ.\n\n54:59.040 --> 55:00.840\nI went to a hotel.\n\n55:00.840 --> 55:01.840\nWe heard.\n\n55:01.840 --> 55:09.600\nWe heard because I, I just didn't trust that camping would be fun with that group of friends.\n\n55:09.600 --> 55:14.680\nAnd sure enough, they forgot to bring everything essential and they all had to like go back\n\n55:14.680 --> 55:20.240\non making fun of me for getting the hotel and they all came and stayed in my hotel jerks.\n\n55:20.240 --> 55:23.000\nWhat do they think a camping trip is?\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:26.600\nThey think it's bringing tents and bringing food and water, but they forgot to do all\n\n55:26.600 --> 55:27.600\nthose things.\n\n55:27.600 --> 55:28.600\nOh.\n\n55:28.600 --> 55:29.600\nThey left it all back at home.\n\n55:29.600 --> 55:30.600\nThat sounds like the good drugs.\n\n55:30.600 --> 55:31.600\nYeah.\n\n55:31.600 --> 55:36.360\nAnd I did the acid and found myself sitting on a rock in the moonlight talking to a rattlesnake.\n\n55:36.360 --> 55:38.360\nWe were wondering if you were homeless.\n\n55:38.360 --> 55:41.320\nWe were like, we'll support you.\n\n55:41.320 --> 55:43.320\nWhat did the rattlesnake say?\n\n55:43.320 --> 55:44.320\nRattlesnake was being groovy.\n\n55:44.320 --> 55:46.600\nI'm afraid of snakes.\n\n55:46.600 --> 55:49.040\nI sat on a rock and the rock was talking to me.\n\n55:49.040 --> 55:50.040\nGoing on, Jeff.\n\n55:50.040 --> 55:51.040\nOh, it's a status.\n\n55:51.040 --> 55:52.040\nOh, it's a status.\n\n55:52.040 --> 55:53.040\nAnd it was talking to me.\n\n55:53.040 --> 55:54.560\nDid he tell you to eat the apple?\n\n55:54.560 --> 55:56.840\nBut I kept hearing a bug going.\n\n55:56.840 --> 55:57.840\nEat these apples.\n\n55:57.840 --> 55:58.840\nIt's a sketch.\n\n55:58.840 --> 55:59.840\nIt's a sketch.\n\n55:59.840 --> 56:00.840\nIt's a sketch, Davis.\n\n56:00.840 --> 56:02.840\nYou're in a thing right now.\n\n56:02.840 --> 56:03.840\nYou're in my thing.\n\n56:03.840 --> 56:04.840\nOh, yeah.\n\n56:04.840 --> 56:06.600\nYou should totally eat the apple.\n\n56:06.600 --> 56:07.600\nEat my nuts.\n\n56:07.600 --> 56:10.240\nIs it a nut tree?\n\n56:10.240 --> 56:13.440\nEat my nuts.\n\n56:13.440 --> 56:14.440\nEat my balls.\n\n56:14.440 --> 56:15.440\nEat my nuts.\n\n56:15.440 --> 56:20.400\nWait, is this the rattlesnake talking and sitting next to me on the rock?\n\n56:20.400 --> 56:22.120\nEat my nuts, Dan.\n\n56:22.120 --> 56:24.520\nWhy are you calling me Dan?\n\n56:24.520 --> 56:25.520\nSorry.\n\n56:25.520 --> 56:26.520\nOkay.\n\n56:26.520 --> 56:27.520\nThis is a snake, not me.\n\n56:27.520 --> 56:28.520\nOh.\n\n56:28.520 --> 56:37.200\nI'm afraid of snakes, especially poisonous snakes, kill you in the middle of the night\n\n56:37.200 --> 56:38.200\nsnakes.\n\n56:38.200 --> 56:41.200\nAnd baby snakes are going to bite you first because they're not trained to kind of keep\n\n56:41.200 --> 56:42.200\nit cool.\n\n56:42.200 --> 56:43.200\nAnd they eat you from the toes up.\n\n56:43.200 --> 56:46.680\nThe snake is not going to eat me from the toes up.\n\n56:46.680 --> 56:47.680\nEat, they eat you from.\n\n56:47.680 --> 56:48.680\nDid you see that elephant?\n\n56:48.680 --> 56:49.680\nThey got eaten.\n\n56:49.680 --> 56:52.120\nI think you're dead by the time it starts eating you, though.\n\n56:52.120 --> 56:53.120\nThat's how they do it.\n\n56:53.120 --> 56:54.120\nThat's how they get you.\n\n56:54.120 --> 56:55.120\nYeah.\n\n56:55.120 --> 56:56.120\nStart with the toes.\n\n56:56.120 --> 56:57.120\nSo you can't run away.\n\n56:57.120 --> 56:58.420\nThey have bugs in them.\n\n56:58.420 --> 57:01.760\nAnd the rock is talking to me.\n\n57:01.760 --> 57:04.880\nAnd look over, and now it's a rattlesnake.\n\n57:04.880 --> 57:09.040\nA little baby rattlesnake sitting right next to me, I'm like, hey, little buddy.\n\n57:09.040 --> 57:11.080\nYou should move on.\n\n57:11.080 --> 57:16.540\nAnd Mark Rivers comes up with a big floodlight, and he goes, Jeff, get the fuck out of there.\n\n57:16.540 --> 57:19.580\nI was like, hey, man, I'm fucking high.\n\n57:19.580 --> 57:20.580\nI was grooving.\n\n57:20.580 --> 57:22.040\nI was groovedastic with a rattlesnake.\n\n57:22.040 --> 57:23.940\nNext day it was not on acid.\n\n57:23.940 --> 57:26.360\nAnd duck taped my pants around my boots.\n\n57:26.360 --> 57:29.440\nbecause there were snakes all over the goddamn giant.\n\n57:29.440 --> 57:30.680\nAll right, I got one.\n\n57:30.680 --> 57:33.160\nSo you guys brought duct tape but not a tent.\n\n57:33.160 --> 57:34.960\nJust wondering.\n\n57:34.960 --> 57:35.800\nI came quite prepared.\n\n57:35.800 --> 57:38.480\nThere's a lot of ducts out in the desert.\n\n57:38.480 --> 57:39.520\nA lot of people don't know that.\n\n57:39.520 --> 57:41.160\nAnd then you can make tape out of them.\n\n57:41.160 --> 57:42.000\nHow ignorant of me.\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.080\nDesert ducts are dangerous, the most dangerous.\n\n57:44.080 --> 57:44.680\nThe worst.\n\n57:44.680 --> 57:46.720\nBecause they're like, how the fuck did I end up out here\n\n57:46.720 --> 57:48.680\nwhere I can't even use a third of my ability?\n\n57:48.680 --> 57:51.280\nI can't even use a third of my ability.\n\n57:51.280 --> 57:53.400\nSketch idea, duck desert.\n\n57:53.400 --> 57:55.760\nAnd damn it, I'm an all-terrain chicken.\n\n57:55.760 --> 57:58.520\nWhat am I doing in the one place where I can't rub\n\n57:58.520 --> 57:59.520\nthat in the chicken's face?\n\n57:59.520 --> 58:00.360\nAll right, come on.\n\n58:00.360 --> 58:01.720\nHere's the one thing.\n\n58:01.720 --> 58:03.200\nHow handsome is Jeff?\n\n58:03.200 --> 58:04.120\nYeah, it's too much.\n\n58:04.120 --> 58:05.200\nHe's good-looking.\n\n58:05.200 --> 58:06.200\nBut he's so handsome.\n\n58:06.200 --> 58:07.200\nLet's move on.\n\n58:07.200 --> 58:08.040\nLet's move on.\n\n58:08.040 --> 58:09.200\nLet's keep talking about it.\n\n58:09.200 --> 58:09.700\nI got my eyes.\n\n58:09.700 --> 58:12.640\nWe're going to do the whole show about how good looking Jeff is.\n\n58:12.640 --> 58:14.640\nDeMorge, you were asleep for a while there.\n\n58:14.640 --> 58:15.480\nWere you not?\n\n58:15.480 --> 58:16.480\nOh, Jesus Christ.\n\n58:16.480 --> 58:17.280\nDeMorge had passed out.\n\n58:17.280 --> 58:18.680\nSpencer, see her.\n\n58:18.680 --> 58:21.280\nAlso, congratulations on Arsenal.\n\n58:21.280 --> 58:23.160\nI'm curious, do you grow out your hair\n\n58:23.160 --> 58:24.160\nand where your pajamas.\n\n58:24.160 --> 58:26.440\nAnd it's like, you can't even get close to comparing me\n\n58:26.440 --> 58:27.920\nto Jeff, because obviously.\n\n58:27.920 --> 58:29.320\nYeah, I mean, that's my only hope.\n\n58:29.320 --> 58:30.520\nI'm not even trying to make it a contest.\n\n58:30.520 --> 58:31.020\nExactly.\n\n58:31.020 --> 58:31.880\nHe's a beautiful man.\n\n58:31.880 --> 58:33.560\nAnd he was a beautiful child.\n\n58:33.560 --> 58:36.680\nStay under Jeff's bridge and charge to the toll\n\n58:36.680 --> 58:40.120\nfor whoever comes over it.\n\n58:40.120 --> 58:42.120\nThere's one thing now that my nervous system has jacked up.\n\n58:42.120 --> 58:44.200\nI wasn't going to save this for a non-Shingles.\n\n58:44.200 --> 58:47.920\nBut now I can feel the herpes coursing through my fibers.\n\n58:47.920 --> 58:50.840\nI just wanted to bring up one thing\n\n58:50.840 --> 58:56.280\nand get to the bottom of it, Venetian blinds.\n\n58:56.280 --> 58:57.880\nWhat the fuck?\n\n58:57.880 --> 59:00.840\nLike, what is the fucking rule with what direction\n\n59:00.840 --> 59:06.200\nto pull the fucking string in to make them stay?\n\n59:06.200 --> 59:09.440\nAre you supposed to pull them to the left or the right?\n\n59:09.440 --> 59:12.600\nYou pull them inward at a diagonal angle\n\n59:12.600 --> 59:16.680\nto have them go up and down, right?\n\n59:16.680 --> 59:17.840\nAnd stay?\n\n59:17.840 --> 59:20.520\nAnd then you pull it straight down for them\n\n59:20.520 --> 59:22.320\nto stop.\n\n59:22.320 --> 59:24.040\nIt's like a hand job, kind of.\n\n59:24.040 --> 59:27.360\nWhat if I want to pull my Venetian blinds up halfway\n\n59:27.360 --> 59:29.080\nand lock them in place halfway?\n\n59:29.080 --> 59:29.840\nWhat am I doing?\n\n59:29.840 --> 59:32.640\nYeah, so you pull diagonal until it's about halfway,\n\n59:32.640 --> 59:35.360\nand then you would then swivel over.\n\n59:35.360 --> 59:40.120\nYeah, and then bring it, wheel it down so it's vertical.\n\n59:40.120 --> 59:43.840\nWhat the fuck is up with this backboard?\n\n59:43.840 --> 59:44.960\nLook at this shit.\n\n59:44.960 --> 59:46.800\nI get three sticks.\n\n59:46.800 --> 59:47.520\nHe's got three sticks.\n\n59:47.520 --> 59:49.320\nNo wonder my back hurts.\n\n59:49.320 --> 59:53.120\nThe folks at home, the bed frame has three sticks\n\n59:53.120 --> 59:56.400\nand a large hole for a pillow to fall through.\n\n59:56.400 --> 59:56.920\nYeah, it hurts.\n\n59:56.920 --> 59:59.040\nThey just assume we've got a wall.\n\n59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.840\nI used the fact that I was hot to get out of there\n\n01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.520\nbecause it was killing me.\n\n01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.080\nHe said he was hot, but it was really the three sticks.\n\n01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.040\nOh my god.\n\n01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:07.680\nIt did my homework.\n\n01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.320\nWhy is that even an option?\n\n01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.200\nDo you want a backboard?\n\n01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.640\nHow about just the frame?\n\n01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.560\nNot any of them.\n\n01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.320\nJust the frame.\n\n01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.880\nWe've got to set this thing up before the show,\n\n01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.640\nand putting the whole backboard up\n\n01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.080\nis going to take some time.\n\n01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.160\nGrown-ass adults were finally tackling\n\n01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.240\nthe intricacies of Venetian blinds and Ikea headboards.\n\n01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.120\nHow do you do you know how to work the fucking blinds\n\n01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.520\nwhen you want to make them like, how about this?\n\n01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.960\nForget about how to lift them up and make them lock\n\n01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.160\nbecause that's easy.\n\n01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.600\nSuppose they're halfway up, and what you want to do\n\n01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.640\nis very quickly, very quickly, because you've\n\n01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.840\ngot other things on your mind.\n\n01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.360\nThere's a reason you're going to close the blinds.\n\n01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.480\nHow do you release them, and they go all the way down\n\n01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.640\nwithout stopping a quarter of the way down?\n\n01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.520\nYou pull them at a diagonal slightly.\n\n01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.920\nYou got to get after you do the diagonal,\n\n01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.120\nyou got to get a little lube.\n\n01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.520\nSchrab is about to play a dreamditch.\n\n01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.440\nPull, you know, get some hymns.\n\n01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.200\nI think Ken's the cutest.\n\n01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.480\nI think Ken's the cutest.\n\n01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.880\nDiagonal.\n\n01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.440\nIt's not intuitive, but once you get it down,\n\n01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.320\nyou're like, holy shit, am I a wizard?\n\n01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.040\nIf you look at the mechanism, if you look at the little sprocket\n\n01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.800\nup there when you're doing it, it makes sense.\n\n01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.560\nNo, I will.\n\n01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.440\nWhen you look at it, it does not make sense.\n\n01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.600\nIt just looks confusing as fuck.\n\n01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.680\nWell, I'm an engineer.\n\n01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.800\nYeah, no.\n\n01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.920\nJeff's a genius, and I'm sure he understands it.\n\n01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.840\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.360\nI come from a long line of levelers.\n\n01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.400\nAnd nobs.\n\n01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.200\nWe changed our name to Davis during World War II\n\n01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.800\nbecause levelers were also hoarding Nazi gold.\n\n01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.360\nAre you an outdoorsman, Keith?\n\n01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.160\nNo.\n\n01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.620\nI can play along for a little bit.\n\n01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:50.260\nI enjoy, I do enjoy camping because you're doing nothing.\n\n01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.040\nBut no, I'm here in LA and it keeps running,\n\n01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.400\nrunning in canyon and trying to get me to go.\n\n01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.400\nAnd I go, ah.\n\n01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.280\nI caught one of the conversations you were having.\n\n01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.560\nIt caught a little piece of you talking about the landmark.\n\n01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.600\nWell, mind your fucking business.\n\n01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.720\nDid you really go to the landmark forum?\n\n01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.840\nYeah, Landmark is this it's a group setting. It's a therapy, but group therapy\n\n01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.920\nSo and I do not believe these guys can do one-on-one therapy\n\n01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:27.960\nBut my ex-wife when she left me and Landmark pushed her to do it she paid for me to go to so I thought that was sweet\n\n01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:33.440\nNo, I've had that but I've never gone because it just seems like like you know, yeah\n\n01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.160\nYou get your two or three lessons you could have got anywhere else\n\n01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:43.920\nIt's upwards of a thousand dollars and then other lessons they throw in are how to stand up for yourself\n\n01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.000\nFor and they have us doing an example and in this example\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.480\nI will say to you\n\n01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:54.200\nWhy don't you come to a Landmark seminar and you tell me no right and then I will keep trying to convince you\n\n01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:59.120\nYou keep saying no until you've given me a thousand yeah, that is you standing up for yourself\n\n01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.560\nI remember a friend of several friends who told me about it and then I got like\n\n01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.400\nI remember one of them is that oh, I do this Landmark thing and I said is that a cult and\n\n01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:16.040\nYou know the tea hadn't in cult hadn't come out of my mouth and she without anger like a well-trained like a\n\n01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.640\naquarium\n\n01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.720\nCreature like like like just like that that that saw a glint of a herring spoon and knows exactly which hoops to jump there was like\n\n01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.920\nDo what do you know what a cult is the definition of a cult is the following things and she ran through the entire definition of a cult\n\n01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:36.000\nI was like, can I add one thing which is that you have a rehearsed like speech about whether you're a cult?\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.200\nI think it's in their FAQs our guy no joke the guy leading the thing is like people are gonna ask you is it a cult and I'm like\n\n01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.200\nAll right, let me hear how you answer that. Well, then that's a cult. I want to be a part of\n\n01:03:48.200 --> 01:04:02.800\nI mean we are totally unfair to cult is like the word hipster in terms of religion like we just we just use it for things that we\n\n01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.120\nDon't like I mean we we just like oh, it's creepy or it's weird or we don't like it like we\n\n01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:15.040\nI'll tell you the definition later because you could be a Mormon and talk about someone else's religion as if it's a cult\n\n01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:21.480\nI remember when I was in like senior year of high school and I was like gonna go to Madison\n\n01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:28.000\nWe're gonna drive up to Madison and and parents are like why are you going to Madison? It's like, oh, I'm gonna go see this\n\n01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.400\nMove this cult movie at midnight. It's gonna be cool and they sat me down\n\n01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:42.680\nAnd I had they gave me this lecture about like how cults are bad and that it's against Jesus Christ\n\n01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:49.200\nAnd we're really really upset. We really are concerned about what you're going to do why you want to see this\n\n01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.240\nI'm gonna see the Toxic Avenger. What the fuck?\n\n01:04:52.880 --> 01:05:01.040\nAre you serious Dave and Donna? That's what you think I'm gonna go see the Toxic of fucking Avenger at midnight at Madison\n\n01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.400\nAnd you're worried about my immortal soul\n\n01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.080\nSo close to your mom movie\n\n01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.580\nWell, they had been the see death race\n\n01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:14.980\n2000 did you go fuck? Yeah, I went man. Did you join the cult? Yeah?\n\n01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:19.660\nI bought the t-shirt and drank the Kool-Aid man. Did you buy the sneakers?\n\n01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.780\nWe're just I have been going to Buddhist temple\n\n01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:36.460\nIt's quite it's been quite good. Are you like it? Are you meditating and yeah, it's great. Yeah, are you Zen?\n\n01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:41.740\nYeah, yeah, it's going good. Is that why you shaved recently? What's that like?\n\n01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.660\nTo fit in with the monks. No, I'm bald. I know but it looks good\n\n01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.340\nThank you\n\n01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:55.620\nIt's like you you freshen you freshen it up. I freshened it up. How regularly do you go? Huh?\n\n01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:58.340\nHow regularly do you go? Oh, that's a good I've only gone once\n\n01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:03.100\nSo so you chill every last Monday\n\n01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:09.300\nOkay, so they haven't done the thing yet where where the Buddhist monk comes out and he goes like now listen\n\n01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.460\nthat was all\n\n01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.460\nfree, but I\n\n01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:16.100\nFor the next hour. I want you to go out to the phones\n\n01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:22.100\nI want you to call five people for every five people you get into Buddhism. You come back. I know that actually didn't happen\n\n01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:28.780\nThat's not what they did but the guy the leader the whatever the what the president that sits in the front\n\n01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:33.540\nWhat is the president? What's the guy the president Buddha? No, no, no\n\n01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:37.460\nDale Buddha no\n\n01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:44.900\nHe's crazy the Bodhisattva like Jim Carrey type, you know, he would like oh, so we do Jim Carrey. We do this\n\n01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:52.460\nWe do this a little bit like he would be like so does anybody have any questions\n\n01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.140\nHe was\n\n01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.500\nIt's 9-eleven what's happening\n\n01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:10.660\nIt's every time you look isn't it it's too late it's actually 11 6 Steve Levy you think of everything\n\n01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.180\nNot in front of the New Yorkers\n\n01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:21.820\nIt's a big joke to us out here wow we give all the shingles we do all the 9-elevens\n\n01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:27.660\nOkay, okay. Hey, let me ask you guys this if you want to get out of this new bed some bugs\n\n01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:35.380\nRight, right, right. I told my I told my landlord once. I'm like I'm very sure that I saw one bed bug\n\n01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.980\nHe's like oh, okay. You think I should call somebody\n\n01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.700\nLike it's your place\n\n01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.980\nI'm like it's your place should I should I call one exterminator\n\n01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:56.300\nSo Keith and Kimda that was the what at this point\n\n01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:05.700\nDo we podcast for other people or for ourselves, why do you keep doing it since you've been doing it longer?\n\n01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.540\nWe're changing the road a little bit each time. We'll be done in two and a half years. Oh\n\n01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.460\nWe both both we\n\n01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:18.620\nThere's obviously just egomaniacs and haven't figured it out and as soon as we do we'll stop\n\n01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:21.900\nThere's a nerds to do it and also pays our bills\n\n01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:27.860\nBut you know obviously getting in letters about that sound almost like we save the person's life\n\n01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:32.780\nThat's beyond thrilling. So you're saying it's possible to do a podcast for years and years and make money at it. Yes\n\n01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:40.540\nWait a second. Well, we might need to look at this. I mean now that we're on Starburns. We're rich\n\n01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.540\nHuh, wait a second\n\n01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:48.580\nWe'll be talking maybe I mean all I've gotten is underwear out of this and which is underwear\n\n01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:54.940\nHuh, and me socks. I don't have any me socks and blue apron. We never give me a fucking anything\n\n01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:59.420\nWell, that's because he didn't ask because they would if you wanted for a boner pill company\n\n01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.420\nI don't need a boner pill company\n\n01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:06.700\nUp your eyeballs and boner dick works and I'm fucking shilling prove it prove\n\n01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:13.420\nYeah, four hymns isn't about making your dick work. It's about making sure your dick doesn't stop working\n\n01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:17.580\nDo you think I could fit under this bed? Yes. Yeah, no, definitely. I\n\n01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.900\nWas it right? Oh\n\n01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.020\nNo, what happened at work today sweetheart\n\n01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:36.740\nOh, what do you guys do the bed and hurt himself really bad yourself? It's not like\n\n01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.860\nThey're not a sturdy frame. This is the opposite of stage diving\n\n01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.420\nNow that you guys have a guest driven\n\n01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:50.420\npodcast like what what do you have any pointers on like like how to do good interviews or\n\n01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.100\nlike like like is there anything to when you're in the when you're but\n\n01:09:54.100 --> 01:10:00.020\nIs it I think it's about being present and you don't want distractions going on perhaps\n\n01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:06.380\nSo that you can have a real connection with the guest because it's like the word guest is like they're your guests\n\n01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:12.780\nLike you want to treat them with respect and know that you know, you're there and they're gonna make your show\n\n01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:19.180\nThey're there for you. They're there for you as much as they are for them. Yeah, so just do do do unto others\n\n01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:23.820\nYes, just show that you care and that you respected their time\n\n01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.580\nRight. Who is your favorite?\n\n01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:30.300\nguest that you guys have ever had we had a guest that just\n\n01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.780\nThe chair was normal\n\n01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.300\nThat was a good time\n\n01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:41.500\nThat sounds really fun. How did that go? It went very well because then you can get to know them\n\n01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.100\nThey share what's happening on in their lives\n\n01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:50.100\nYou're you're saying something that you can relate to and you actually leave there. Everybody learn something\n\n01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:54.560\nWe'd be out of it. Right. And you're probably cementing\n\n01:10:55.060 --> 01:11:00.260\nforming new relationships. You're forming new bonds. You're forming new bonds people\n\n01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:04.260\nAnd I think that's the excitement and even after doing this for over 13 years\n\n01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:11.300\nYou still you still learn from each person you learn from new people when you open yourself up to new people\n\n01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.460\nYou can really learn a lot that you couldn't otherwise if you close yourself off\n\n01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:19.260\nYeah, and I'm not saying 44 is old but even at 44 you think all right\n\n01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:24.940\nDid I meet every different kind of person and when you get people to open up you really didn't so you're my age\n\n01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.260\nYou're my age.

Thank you\n\n01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:25.320\nHow did you think of that? That's a crazy sometimes it comes to you. It's like when you've been podcasting this long, right?\n\n01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:31.800\nIt's just the experience. Yeah, we don't have that. It's like a light bulb, but then you don't throw it on the ground and let it chatter\n\n01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.960\nRight, it's like a light bulb that you hold\n\n01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:41.320\nHave you gone back to Israel since you were four? I have yeah, we used to go a lot every summer every other summer and then\n\n01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:48.200\nLike ten years ago, my parents moved back. I went a couple times, but we no longer speak. So you don't speak to your parents anywhere\n\n01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.440\nI can't tell if I don't speak to them or if they don't speak to me, but we're not speaking Wow\n\n01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:56.780\nYeah, it's just kind of like fell apart. That's like you Dan and your folks\n\n01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:04.920\nWell, I speak to my folks, but I could see I mean, I don't want my parents to hear me say I could see but it's it's like\n\n01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:11.240\nIt's not held together with the kind of talk to your brother anymore, right? You have a niece that you don't know\n\n01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.200\nI've never met. It's like Sesame Street bullshit\n\n01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.120\nWhy don't you talk to your brother anymore?\n\n01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:23.000\nMy brother guy I talked shit about him on the podcast. What'd you say? What'd you say about him?\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.400\nI implied that that there was a strange kind of thing when I was growing up between him and my mom\n\n01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.760\nI was just trying to be more glib than anything, you know\n\n01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:39.120\nI don't see what the big deal about that is that sounds like fine, but I like I thought after I after I did it\n\n01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.040\nNo, you know, it's like I was like, oh shit my brother. I don't want my brother to hear that\n\n01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:49.720\nI don't want my brother to stumble onto this by himself, you know, like so even though it sucks to like turn him on to it\n\n01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.040\nBecause it could just get away with it\n\n01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.040\nI'm gonna it would be so much worse if he just\n\n01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:00.720\nWandered into it that I have to it's hard to guess that though because maybe if only it's only telling him\n\n01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.400\nIt must be so bad if you felt you had to give it to him\n\n01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:09.640\nExactly, I just but at that point it's kind of like it was the only right thing to do after the wrong\n\n01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.480\nI had done was it's like you probably shouldn't talk about other people you should try not to I mean say was it was it real\n\n01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:21.160\nOh, it was that's why it was so mad. Well, I mean it was it wasn't\n\n01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:27.360\nsubjective though, it was it was it was it was I was sharing a subjective like kind of feeling as it's just like\n\n01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.600\nMy mom and my brother had like an intense more intense relationship than\n\n01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:36.000\nThen then then me and my mom had got I was like in front of a crowd\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.040\nSo I kind of like you know as I said, I like I don't know I like I like I like being like\n\n01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:48.040\nWhen I I don't like talking about my family anymore has to go running or something just there for\n\n01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.000\nLike I like I've now since like I've been I've been doing this for so long\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.160\nAnd now I've gone through phases and one of them is like I don't like I just try to avoid talking about anybody\n\n01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.160\nBut myself as much as I can\n\n01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.560\nAnd but back then I didn't really have any kind of rules\n\n01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.040\nI was still coming from a zone of like, you know, what whatever the fuck, you know\n\n01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.960\nIf you encountered me in your life, then you're part of my fucking\n\n01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.720\nTapestry and and so I\n\n01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:19.600\nWhen I heard it afterwards and I was like I better I better email my brother so that\n\n01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:26.240\nAnd then I emailed him and the problem the email is do you think you should listen to it? I don't think it's too much\n\n01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.600\nIt's probably silly, but you should anyway. I'm definitely gonna keep it in my show. Oh, yeah\n\n01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:37.920\nWell, I'm not gonna fucking respect your brother. Yeah, because it's not like I gave his address and like like said go talk to him about it\n\n01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.840\nIt's just like I mean it was just implied you have sex with mom. It was\n\n01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:48.440\nI'd be more alarmed that someone referred to me as my own chosen nickname Darth Vader\n\n01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.200\nWell, yeah, I mean, I think it was all in there\n\n01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.760\nI think I kind of did a run where I was like\n\n01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.360\nLet me tell you about my brother and then so I heard it\n\n01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:01.920\nI was like I better I better I better tip him off that I clowned him if I want to try to salvage anything because he might get mad\n\n01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.800\nHe might he might not though. He might be like whatever you fucking turd like like\n\n01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.000\nAnd I any he must have listened to it and then he emailed me back\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.720\nAnd he was like he was just really kind of inconsolable about it\n\n01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.280\nI probably also wasn't very good at resolving that kind of thing back then so I\n\n01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:25.120\nLike that's why I don't talk to him. It was also kind of coincided with him having the kid that I've never met because and I think it was\n\n01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:31.280\nIn some in some respects.

Yeah, you got this to my face is starting to hurt\n\n01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.440\nWell, that's shingles\n\n01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.440\nYou might have just one side\n\n01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:45.860\nWell, it's the one I'm resting my weight on are you dusting I I used snorting dust under there dusting\n\n01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.880\nLet me ask you this\n\n01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.560\nRookie to Pro\n\n01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:56.240\nBroadcasting, how do you how do you find an ending? You know like what do you what if you get caught in a rut where your show is?\n\n01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.840\nApparently two hours long. What do you do you keep making it two hours?\n\n01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.920\nI've been I have fantasy where I keep like I keep like roll it back five minutes. Yeah, why can't you do that?\n\n01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.880\nI don't know we could do we could do that\n\n01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.480\nI guess the same reason why it became two hours because I don't know well\n\n01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:18.360\nI don't know in a vacuum. How do you say the magic words and we could just well that week we couldn't do that feels awkward to me\n\n01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.640\nThat's not that's literally not possible. I\n\n01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.400\nThink what we need well, we don't need it now because we're you know pretty soon\n\n01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.600\nWe'll be in front of an audience again, and we'll do you miss that? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course\n\n01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:35.600\nYou know, so what's the status now? I've been away for a while. What's going on with the audience thing?\n\n01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:40.440\nWe're gonna we're getting one back. We're gonna we're gonna be doing a residency at a theater\n\n01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960\nYeah\n\n01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:54.720\nI would we're reversing the trope of the guy under the bed having to hide while the people on top are doing it\n\n01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.640\nThere's a guy under my bed doing it\n\n01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.880\nYou're gonna believe any kids now. Let's say there's monsters under the bed\n\n01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:09.520\nYeah, Rob. Are you thinking it was a good idea or a bad idea to go under there? He's happy. Oh\n\n01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.400\nHe's coming hold on I\n\n01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.000\nYeah, okay, he's finishing. I think it might be a\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nI don't think it's a good idea. Yeah, this is a great idea\n\n01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:26.040\nOption ever comes up. Just don't assume that you should he wants everybody to know I think you should feel accomplished\n\n01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:30.400\nYou said I wonder if I can get under the bed and now he's on you don't have to wonder anymore\n\n01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.920\nI wanted to come out but then Jeff started sticking that thing in my ass\n\n01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.920\nSo so you want to stay there longer so you can keep doing it\n\n01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:45.560\nNo, I guess you wanted to yeah hide under the bed. I don't know him them getting a mom vibe here\n\n01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.320\nThe New York Squares\n\n01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.520\nThanks, buddy. Well, of course, I think anyone who says they don't want to be a mom would make a great mom\n\n01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.440\nYou're saying that you're being sarcastic that's what everybody says, right?\n\n01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.920\nLike we all jump on the women that say they don't want to be not literally jump on them\n\n01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:10.520\nBut that like like like we act like they're refusing the mother. Yeah, you would I do get annoyed when I say\n\n01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.920\nI don't want to hold your baby and people there's like that. That's like a guy thing\n\n01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.960\nI think like like because everybody thinks it's like a trope where like oh, you're gonna hold the baby\n\n01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.760\nAnd then you're gonna turn into like a dad that wants a baby\n\n01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:31.160\nJurassic Park when he's got the two sleepy kids on him and Lord during yeah, like I don't answer John Cusack in\n\n01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.600\ngood point blank\n\n01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:38.240\nGross point blank like like it's not it's that that's not gonna happen all the time and that's not me saying\n\n01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.160\nI hate your baby or I hate babies\n\n01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.440\nThey're just so like I don't want to hold your baby like like just because you need your baby held at this particular time because you\n\n01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.240\nWant to experience a brief taste of what it's like to be a normal human for a couple seconds?\n\n01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.760\nLike that doesn't that's not gonna just sync up with me wanting to hold a baby. I\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.480\nWarned people that I'm not good at holding babies and they keep insisting on the third time\n\n01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.000\nI run with the baby. Yeah, you know, I just realized if people would just characterize it as what it is\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:12.360\nWhich is a favor if they would go would you mind holding this baby like like it's like like what you do with a bowling ball full\n\n01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:18.320\nOf hornets, you know, like would you do you mind so I can get a drink so I can retaste my youth?\n\n01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:22.760\nNo, I will do that favor as a friend because you've done shit for me\n\n01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:28.400\nBut they're always like you want to hold them you want to hold them don't you you're doing them the favor\n\n01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:33.040\nYeah, you have to be the one thinking. Oh, thanks for giving this chalice of fucking\n\n01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.320\nMagic I\n\n01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.240\nSorry, I know I'm sitting here pretending like I'm a curmudgeon\n\n01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.960\nYeah\n\n01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:45.680\nThere's a very there's a ripping sound\n\n01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.960\nThat's a tendon. I think I'm actually so old now. That's I\n\n01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.720\nIt's been eight years since anyone's made me hold a baby\n\n01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:59.120\nIt's not even I'm at a party where there's where there's fertile people wouldn't run it around, you know\n\n01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.100\nLike like all of my friends kids are in college\n\n01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.560\nHave you ever been given the ultimatum have a baby or we're breaking up?\n\n01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.160\nNo, Rob, you want me to get the kettle out so we can scoot you along here\n\n01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.480\nShould we all grab one side and just see who's stronger\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.040\nCody and I are up in the air. I think we you know, we made a decision like let's be the couple that doesn't know if they're gonna\n\n01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:26.000\nHave a kid, you know, I'm like we like we like that. It's like why do you have a favorite color?\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.600\nWhat does that mean legs is what if I say my favorite color is orange like\n\n01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:37.120\nOrange is it's slipping. What's your favorite movie? It doesn't make any sense, right? It doesn't but do you have a favorite color?\n\n01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:42.960\nThere's metal leg. No, I don't like it's slipping of what a t-shirt\n\n01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.520\nof a t-shirt burgundy\n\n01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:50.480\nOh, good one. What if Rob is dying and we're just it's\n\n01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:58.200\nGorschting my hand. I picked your uh Dan being a kid though and then ask in the elementary school class like what is your favorite color?\n\n01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.800\nI was what is it? What is a favorite color? Now everything's that color\n\n01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:07.000\nI wish I could go back and be that kid like like I think I was that kid in ways that I didn't understand\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.440\nI was being that kid, but I want to go back and taste being that kid and like actually draw a line in the fucking Santa\n\n01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:18.200\nGo fuck you stop tickling me, you know, you know, that's a thing now like non-consensual tickling like you I\n\n01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.440\nI'm watching my girlfriend's sister and\n\n01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:27.880\nThey're raising their kids and they're like they're doing all the like those kids have never been hit\n\n01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:31.680\nThey've never been like like they they they're there\n\n01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:37.520\nIt's all the tropes that you would roll your eyes at for modern parenting, you know, but they're they're great kids\n\n01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:43.640\nThey're they're totally like happy and healthy and they like look the the boy is two years older than the girl and he like\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.920\nloves her and like hugs her and says I love my sister and stuff and\n\n01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.360\nThey give them a thought process instead of telling them what to do\n\n01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:55.800\nYeah, like they engage with them like in a way that I'm like when I first was watching them do it\n\n01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:01.080\nI was like don't just fucking don't you know that kid is fucking manipulating you like teach him\n\n01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:06.760\nWho's the fucking boss, you know like in the back of my head? I was just like don't let that piece of shit run your life\n\n01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.120\nBut you and the kid you lean over you don't have me\n\n01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:17.840\nYeah, you want to have a fun exercise or you stand up real quick. Oh sure sure\n\n01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:27.240\nOkay, yeah, we're worried about Rob thrashing under the bed might have caused the bed to because I'm stable. He seems so resilient\n\n01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:37.320\nAre you kidding on Ikea furniture that would be a fucking crazy way for Rob to have died\n\n01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:40.920\nIt would be very fitting I think it would be a horrible way for him to die\n\n01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:44.120\nBut it would be the best way for your friend to have died\n\n01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:51.680\nLike oh, how'd your friend died I crushed him I crushed him\n\n01:32:51.680 --> 01:33:02.840\nHow you doing okay, hey Dan this is it's not really my place to say this but well, we had three endings that we passed\n\n01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.560\nIn answer your question\n\n01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.760\nYeah\n\n01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.320\nNever never let a guest make you get out of bed\n\n01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:19.640\nOkay, see this is good at you everything just changed. I wish I knew these tips. Well, I mean Spencer's he's the game master\n\n01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:24.520\nHe's not really a guest. He's like kind of a permanent resident. I'd like to think of myself as a guest\n\n01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.120\nBecause it gives me more clout. I meant the gentleman actually under your bed, but I see what you're saying\n\n01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:35.680\nI like to think of Rob as a guest. I don't even know what he is. He's a is the Hamburglar\n\n01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:40.320\nHe's a ward of the of the podcast. I just started showing up\n\n01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:47.760\nFelt sorry for me. All right. Well, I think the answer to my own question is\n\n01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:48.840\nIs\n\n01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:54.480\nThere's a little bit of format needed so that you know, you know, we used we were playing D&D and we'd know okay\n\n01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:58.000\nWell, then we're gonna end the show with D&D, but you know\n\n01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:04.560\nIt's you miss that Spencer. Those were the days, right? Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm a really structure-driven person\n\n01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:10.920\nSo I just crave it. I'm like a vine. I need one of those trellises. Otherwise. I'll just trip everybody\n\n01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:17.080\nDid you do you ever bring a D&D game that you wrote anyway, even though he says we don't do that anymore?\n\n01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:24.740\nI even though he says he we don't do shadow run anymore. Yeah, I actually I still bring I get I bring a session for every game\n\n01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:26.440\nWe've abandoned\n\n01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.440\nAnd I bring a Balder dash\n\n01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:34.960\nIt's good, but it doesn't it doesn't often come up, but I like to be prepared you're\n\n01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.960\ninto your your NPR\n\n01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:43.760\nRemote piece about the right the permits. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I've done all that stuff\n\n01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.400\nWe didn't play a single one of those. I think I prepare will we do we do two hours?\n\n01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:52.600\nSo I prepare six hours for every show we do most of it doesn't matter\n\n01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:58.240\nBut I do I do commit does that bother you at all because you do all that and Dan went out and bought some eggs\n\n01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:01.640\nYeah, I did buy those you got the eggs too\n\n01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.840\nIt was part of he was like we're gonna need some eggs on the show\n\n01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.840\nNo, I love it. I appreciate it\n\n01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:17.080\nI like not having to do the work that I did right does anything does anything bother you about the whole setup\n\n01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.040\nYou can say no, I think the bed's a little loud, right?\n\n01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.800\nIt's a bit garish\n\n01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.960\nLike me like an inch more underneath I\n\n01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:34.040\nCould have used it to be like three times rickety here if you go down there and look at the three little posts that are holding up\n\n01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.960\nThe center of this bed. It's it's not structurally. Yeah, you think a grown man was\n\n01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.000\nThrashing around while someone was like\n\n01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.520\nLaying on it. It looks really shaky. I\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.880\nWas really worried that Rob is actually just going to get demolished. Well, he was yeah\n\n01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:54.400\nIt was very we was warping at pretty intensely while he was under it. Do you guys want to play high-low?\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.120\nOh, wait, that's where how do you play that? It's like red is red like green light?\n\n01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.000\nSure, but differ. Yeah. Well, how do you play it?\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nOkay, you say that funny because I will not agree to it. So I know how to play first take your dick out\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.680\nI'm glad I said. Yeah, this is right. What's the rules?\n\n01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:17.360\nI knew it the simplest version is you say the high of the day and you're low of the day\n\n01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:22.800\nWe expanded a little to say what the lesson is of the low and what you're grateful for but we can start with just high-low\n\n01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.160\nWhat's the high of the day? What's the low of the day? That sounds like a show closer. I like that\n\n01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:29.160\nI think the high of the day for me was\n\n01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.080\nRob being hilarious and under the bed\n\n01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.080\nAnd what was your low?\n\n01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:40.680\nWas my low I just been kind of in a\n\n01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.360\nLike I can't turn on the news kind of depression and so\n\n01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.600\nWatching Twitter freak out about Michelle\n\n01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.320\nand all that stuff and\n\n01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.200\nFeeling the pressure that you have to catch up with it\n\n01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:06.200\nWhat does that be? It's like it's like come on like we have a fucking rapey racist fuck face\n\n01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:13.200\nAnd that's our fucking issue is that that a woman made a funny ass joke that you can't take it\n\n01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.040\nThen we're the bad guys. So yeah, I just got into a mild\n\n01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.360\nThe world is full of bullshit\n\n01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:27.440\nSpiral today, what do you do when that happens? How do you get out of it?\n\n01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:34.720\nYou put on a suit. I took a nap and put a suit on. Okay. That's nice a suit actually kind of makes up for lots of\n\n01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:42.240\nSpends things. Yes, he comes in with a five-piece suit look over a day if you ever seen with a 11-piece suit\n\n01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.320\nThat means I have face shingles. There's a tie on the back\n\n01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:49.920\nIs everything or it was yours? Let's go. Let's let's go down the line\n\n01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.560\nThat's it. My my highs being here. It's very exciting nice\n\n01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:59.720\nAnd the low is for a split second. I thought Rob would die, but then he started\n\n01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:09.840\nYeah, so her high was being on this show and look what you did for the whole show you caused her low\n\n01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:15.480\nI caused I caused her low. I'm sorry. That's actually made low as I told a rape joke earlier\n\n01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:19.680\nAnd I can't tell if it was appropriate or not, but I went for it. It's hard these days\n\n01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.280\nIt is back in the old days. You say it was so safe. I\n\n01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.880\nMade this space not\n\n01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:33.960\nIt was on the show don't you remember you were here and not disgusted at all. Yeah\n\n01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.080\nKeith Malley, I think my high would be being a resident of Harmontown for a minute\n\n01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.080\nMy low is the poor homeless person that's gonna come across his bed and be so\n\n01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.400\nExcited and then laying it for a second and it breaks and he has shingles\n\n01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:58.100\nThat's tough. That's a tough day. That's the day you put on a couple suits and he went. Yeah\n\n01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:03.120\nSchrab, hello. My high was having lunch with Kate\n\n01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.200\nwe've been\n\n01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:13.160\nWe we've been we watched this this on have you seen this on Netflix the chef's table. Have you seen?\n\n01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:19.600\nNo, yeah, it's it there's like episode about like how this is how we start got it interesting going to\n\n01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:26.700\nBuddhist temple, but there is like this Buddhist woman chef who was like talking about like how to eat and and\n\n01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:31.320\npreparing food and and the thing that we've been trying lately is\n\n01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.080\neating silence and\n\n01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.200\nlike\n\n01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:41.760\ntaking a bite putting your spoon or fork down and chewing it and being present and\n\n01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.920\nfeeling the food in your mouth and because like\n\n01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:51.520\nUsually usually people are like eating while they're watching TV or checking their email or multi-tasking or whatever\n\n01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:57.840\nYou're not really and you're just shoving food in your mouth. Have you had the celestine prophecy? What's that the celestine prophecy?\n\n01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.680\nSay again. Have you read the celestine prophecy? No, I guess no\n\n01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:07.760\nWell because they talk about they talk about the prophecy. Yeah\n\n01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:16.640\nYeah, yeah, but it's but it is it is like that. It's just being very mindful and present and I know I've found by doing that that\n\n01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:24.680\nThe food that I'm eating tastes better and I'm more satisfied and I've have like this more kind\n\n01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:29.220\nIt's just it's a it's a great time of the day not for the waiter. That is a pain in the ass\n\n01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:36.460\nWell, we made our own food at home. Yeah, but but then the blue apron they provide you the ingredients and\n\n01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:46.540\nThe the the low point I'm having the chicken fried cuckoosy with raisin bread barnesies\n\n01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:51.940\nMy low low point is is Dan interrupting me\n\n01:40:51.940 --> 01:41:01.980\nDan Hilo my low point was saying goodbye to Cody before she had to go and I knew I'd come to the show and like she can't\n\n01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:06.580\nStay over tonight because she's got work in the morning and and you know, who knows if we'll see each other tomorrow\n\n01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:11.100\nSo it's like, you know, it's at the end of a weekend me having to come do this show\n\n01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:13.740\nNo offense to the people that enjoy it. Although I\n\n01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.100\nDon't understand your enjoyment\n\n01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:19.940\nduring for the last few episodes, but I\n\n01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.540\nI\n\n01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:23.060\nI\n\n01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:28.740\nIt's just like traditionally Sunday nights before I come here are kind of a low because I'm like a weekend's over and\n\n01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:31.660\nlike no more sleepovers with Cody and\n\n01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:39.100\nAnd we kind of wasted our time together sometimes I feel like we watched that we tried to watch that Hugh Jackman\n\n01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:41.260\nPT Barnum\n\n01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:47.300\nMusical and I was like Wolverine Hugh Jackman's playing Barnum. Yeah, it's I wasn't that play when I was a kid\n\n01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:52.140\nAnd my hi for real was just now when you guys started with your lows\n\n01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:57.660\nWho my hi was realizing that because I went off a Twitter when I got the shingles. It was like, okay\n\n01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:59.260\nI'm not gonna think\n\n01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:04.100\nLike I this Michelle Wolf thing. I don't even know who that is what happened\n\n01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:09.660\nI know it sounds like totally aggravating and upsetting and I totally have no clue about it\n\n01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:14.140\nAnd it's not like not knowing about the polar ice caps. It's like that sounds like it's not knowing about some shit\n\n01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:20.420\nThat's like just kind of you can avoid. Yeah, like it sounds like I wasn't gonna help that subject\n\n01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:25.700\nIt was only gonna make me upset, you know, so I kind of feel like dodged a bullet kind of high\n\n01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:29.100\nGet off that. I'm like, wow that encourages me to stay off of\n\n01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:34.460\nTwitter and then of the word snowflakes got really hurt by a woman doing a joke about makeup and\n\n01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:36.740\nEverybody really went off the fucking handle\n\n01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:39.140\nWe're gonna make you know anyway\n\n01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:40.900\nWhat this world's like\n\n01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:45.940\nNo, it's kind of like I mean, I don't mind hearing all about the bullet I dodged. It's like, oh, yeah\n\n01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:49.020\nIt was like a 22 with the you know, yeah\n\n01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:50.820\nThat can't really be my low\n\n01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:54.700\nI think that was just I think my low is being in a place where that was affecting me\n\n01:42:54.700 --> 01:43:00.780\nLike it's like there's something lower than that that makes that even a thing that is on my radar\n\n01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:06.120\nOh, my new low is is is this having to be witnessed to this low backpedaling\n\n01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:13.160\nI don't I don't like this low like finding out that lows are changing my low that my low is this awful horrible fake\n\n01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.160\nFicus is behind you. This is this stricken\n\n01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:20.840\nI said you're gonna say like this fit this fern on your forehead like I was gonna start like shingle shaming me\n\n01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:25.800\nI like I like that your low isn't even your shingles. So do you have other lows? Oh, yeah, you know what you're right\n\n01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:30.160\nI had shingles with it and it should either be that my high is that oh, they're kind of like done\n\n01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.040\nYou know like I had a kind of a pain-free day\n\n01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:37.920\nI might be imagining this but they look less red than when the show started. I think you're actually healing as we watch\n\n01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.840\nIt's been passing them off. The irony is that the rest of your face is catching up\n\n01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:47.320\nYou want to see them get scabbier like that that's good news like when you the scabbier they get just don't pick them\n\n01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.600\nYou'll get a scar.

What do you want DeMorge to do? He's taking it in. Give him the bed. No\n\n01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.400\nOh, yeah, sure. Okay.

The only problem I have with a high low is that you is it you no matter what you're ending on a low\n\n01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:08.000\nAnd there's no way it's gonna close the show. Yeah, we should we added a what do you like?\n\n01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.840\nWhat did you learn from low and what are you grateful for?
