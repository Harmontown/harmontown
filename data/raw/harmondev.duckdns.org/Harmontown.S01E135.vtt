{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:19.000\nThe Hollywood California Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:29.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:39.000\nThank you very much. Bad show tonight, bad show.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:43.000\nIt's not feeling it. Yesterday was Valentine's Day.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:49.000\nI'm not at liberty to say whether or not I use recreational drugs,\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:54.000\nbut if they're in a hypothetical universe where there was one that facilitated\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:00.000\nintimate coupling, maybe some sort of like ecstatic sensations.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:06.000\nSomething that would have been prescribed to couples before it was illegalized\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:10.000\nback in the 80s, I think. I would have probably taken that yesterday\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:14.000\nand I would be having a serotonin depletion right now\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:18.000\nwith just pleasant memories of seeing Wicked at the Pantages.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nYou went? How was it?\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:22.000\nIt was good.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:24.000\nWas it a big musical theater guide? You enjoyed it?\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:28.000\nI like a good musical. I mean, I don't like a bad one. No one does.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:33.000\nI don't know what that makes me. A regular old musical consumer.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nI used to go, when I was a kid, we went to every play at the Pantages.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:41.000\nThat's a very fond childhood kind of memory for me.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:47.000\nIt's about a witch.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:50.000\nIs she the protagonist of the tale?\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:52.000\nEven though she's a witch?\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nWe'll do a little reversal.\n\n01:54.000 --> 02:01.000\nWere you theoretically on this ecstatic sort of possible thing during the show?\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:07.000\nI don't know why. I mean, I'm especially not allowed to talk about\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:10.000\nthe possibility of my wife going near this stuff.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:14.000\nBut if she had, I would have said to her,\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:18.000\nwould you really want to do that during this?\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:23.000\nI would have said yes, but we didn't.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:26.000\nBut if I had, then I would have been sitting there with my eyeballs kind of going,\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.000\nDo you think that would possibly have enhanced your wicked viewing pleasure,\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:36.000\nor was it distracting? Hypothetically?\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:41.000\nIt's a synthetic drug. I think you kind of, if you take mushrooms or acid,\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:45.000\nnot that I ever have, but if you, those change your experience,\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nlike your perception of things, I think that, you know,\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:53.000\nmy experience with the ecstasy family of drugs,\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:57.000\nit's a very small family.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:03.000\nI think it's just that guy at Molly, his friend Molly, right?\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:07.000\nIt just kind of, you know, it kind of puts you in a certain mood,\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nbut everything that's happening around you, you know,\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nyou're not, you're emotionally receiving it differently,\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:16.000\nbut you're not like, you know, experiencing anything other than what's actually happening.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nSo I guess I was kind of like, this musical puts me in a great mood,\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:23.000\nwhich may not be true, but I don't know.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nMaybe it was bad. I don't know. It seemed good to me.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nShe was green. She flew.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:34.000\nI mean, don't let this guy, like, tell you whether or not I had a good time yesterday.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:39.000\nIt'll sound terrible. I'm, this is what happens.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nThis is the price you pay for your disco drugs.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:50.000\nAll those highs you kids are on, they have lows.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nYeah, I'm rotten as a fucking chop today, man.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:58.000\nI apparently drank 100,000 drinks in Anacord as Washington yesterday.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nI was telling them backstage, I was on the plane,\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nand I had to go into the lavatory just to get it together.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:07.000\nLike, I just sat in there like, it was really nice in there too.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:12.000\nI was like, I can't be around human beings right now.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.000\nThat's called delirium tremens, I believe is the word.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nIt's not good.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:27.000\nWell, good news is I guess I'm bored with the black people now.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nI think we kind of...\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nYou got that out of your system?\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nYeah.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nWe really double dipped last time too.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:38.000\nI didn't mean for that to happen, but I wanted anybody that did come\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\njust for the asking to be rewarded for it for sure.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nI don't know if either of those two guys, Brian and Max,\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nif they actually, it sounded like they had those coincidences that they were here.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nBecause there were other people tweeting me going,\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nI'm going to come to the show because I'm black and you asked for it.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:55.000\nAnd I thought if they do that, then that's very sacrificial of them.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nThey should be given a reward of some kind.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nA spotlight, for instance.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:03.000\nBut having their race acknowledged and having them be dehumanized through it.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:07.000\nAnatolia, are you having a weird psychotic episode over here?\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:13.000\nCan we get a camera on this guy?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nWhat is happening?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nAnatolia, you kind of have to.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nNormally we ask if you want to, but if you're going to sit in the front row\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nand do that, you have to show people what you're doing.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nAt least stand up and face the audience and give them what I'm getting here.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nThis is very horrifying.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nCompletely nightmare inducing.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:42.000\nHow are you?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nOh boy.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nOh no.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nCareful.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nOh boy.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nOh no, I thought you were going to fall.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nDo you want to talk for a little bit?\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nOkay.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:02.000\nHave a seat over there.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nI'm enjoying the sweater of this space kitten.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nI love that.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nIt's got those earbud laces.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nYeah, and I can do it like get listened to the music.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nAnd it goes like right to my nipples.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:21.000\nSo the cat is listening and sorry your nipples.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:25.000\nHave you heard of these bone shaking headphones?\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:30.000\nThey use your bone, your skull to conduct the music.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nSo there's no actual sound happening.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nIt's just using your skull as a speaker.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nThat makes sense.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nAt least for me.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nYeah, you look like you could use some disruption.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nI just hear music constantly, like every time.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nObviously we're not going to ask, what are you doing?\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nWhy are you doing that?\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nThat's what you want us to do.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nAnd then you'll be like, I don't know.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:05.000\nHere's your medal for whatever this movement is.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:10.000\nI'm not going to play the role of your father\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:15.000\nshooting you looks over the top of my newspaper.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nI'm going to support you.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:25.000\nOne of those dads, the dads that you end up calling by his first name when you move out.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nYeah, that's good.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:37.000\nSo what, have you been directing anything lately?\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nI know you came out here to direct.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:46.000\nI'm kind of trying to make my desert film right now, my desert short.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nDesert Shield?\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nNo, it doesn't sound like that.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nMy final short in my program.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nOh, you're short.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nAre you talented enough to justify this level of eccentricity?\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:01.000\nYeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure I am.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:05.000\nOne would hope that you can back that up.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:13.000\nYou can't just start wearing kitten costumes and stuff.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:18.000\nI mean, well, you got to go, never mind.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:23.000\nI mean, yeah, okay.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nSo what's your short about?\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nCan you tell us?\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nIt's called about love, but it's not about love.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:33.000\nNice.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nWhat's it about?\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:40.000\nIt's just like shots of a factory.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nAnd then a razor blade on a coffee table.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nAs a tea kettle whistles.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:51.000\nAbout love.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nI'm a little bit lost.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nWhat's happening right now?\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nThat's all it took in the 70s.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nYou were working for Spielberg after that.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nWhat?\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nFor real?\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nIs it 70s right now?\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:12.000\nAre you on anything?\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nOh, I mean, oh, fuck.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nIt's a safe place to tell us.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.000\nYeah?\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nYeah.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nNo.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:25.000\nI mean, yeah.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nI'm never on anything.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:32.000\nIt just costs a lot of money to be on something, so I don't do it.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:36.000\nSo the thing keeping you from being a drug addict is the financial aspect?\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nYeah, because I mean, that's like my main problem.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:48.000\nBecause as I see it, you always have risk of becoming heavily addicted to it.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nAnd then you need a lot of money for rehabs and stuff.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nSo I don't start with it.\n\n09:54.000 --> 10:04.000\nBecause when you have no money and start drugs, it's like your future is not bright.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nIt might be not bright.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:13.000\nSo I just kind of want to get some money first and then start with drugs.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nIt's good thinking.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:20.000\nSo in the meantime, you're just drinking?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nI don't drink.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nDo you have an inner ear infection?\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:28.000\nThere must be some explanation.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nYou seem a little wobbly and eccentric.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nI'm just an artist.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nOh, okay.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nAll right, okay.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nI won't keep pushing it then.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:44.000\nYou're just a wobbly, dizzy magazine page wearing sober Russian...\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:49.000\nIt's like my entire life is my art project.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:55.000\nAnd it goes from, yeah, and it doesn't mean anything, at least for me.\n\n10:55.000 --> 11:00.000\nBut it might mean something for people around.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:05.000\nAnd they will see me in my art and that's how art exists.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:08.000\nCan we start a fun to get you really high for next week?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:14.000\nI wanted to see, because when we checked in with you, when we met you,\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:19.000\nyou said you came out here to be a director and we tried to have you direct us.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:23.000\nAnd you just told us, talk louder or something?\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nA lot of costume notes.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:30.000\nI mean, because it's the most important thing, at least in film directing,\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:35.000\nif it's going on camera, it should look real.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:41.000\nIf I remember correctly, it was a scene from a madman,\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nand you were Don Draper and you were dressed like you.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:52.000\nAnd on an episode of a madman, Don Draper would be dressed like that.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nIt won't be a madman.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nIt's for real, it's the first note.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nThe most important thing.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nIf you're a crew of one, then you are also the wardrobe supervisor.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:09.000\nYou should be like, alright.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:16.000\nSo until we get you a 200 person crew, we'll never get a taste of your directing.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nI wanted to see how far you've come as a director,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nand you've been going to film school all this time.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nYeah, I'm pretty far.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nYeah, I mean, if Jeff and I were to do another scene from Madman,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\ncould you get beyond our wardrobe?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nOkay, okay, I'll pretend like you're dressed fine, yeah.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nOkay.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:42.000\nAlright, in this scene, Don Draper is coming into Peggy's office.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:48.000\nOh, hello Don.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nWhat's going on with that Heinz report?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nI was going to have it on your desk.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nI just got distracted.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nMy husband and I have been having problems at home.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nCan I make a few things perfectly clear?\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:02.000\nIt's not going to be one of those sexist monologues you go into, is it?\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:11.000\nThere's two things you're good for around here.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nThe Heinz account.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.000\nAnd the Heinz account.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nI said it twice, because it's twice as important.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nThis whole firm relies on the Heinz account.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nI don't watch Madman.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nThank you.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nYeah, I noticed that.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:34.000\nAlright, so you have some notes?\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nBy the way, this is now just starting to seem natural, this whole thing now.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nYeah.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nNow we're strangely all okay with this.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\nYeah, I mean the main note is you should watch Madman.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nOh, alright.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:48.000\nOkay.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nAlright, well, okay, I mean, so...\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nShould we try...\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nCan we do like a Russian film?\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nCan we do like some kind of like artistic...\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nSolaris.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nSolaris?\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nSolaris, yeah.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nTarkovsky's movie.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nYeah, about space and shit.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nCan we do a Tartovsky in space movie?\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nWell, can I predict his first note?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:17.000\nWill he be in space?\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nThis seems like a lot of convenience.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nI mean, I put this work in and then he's like,\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:28.000\ncome back when you're in space.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:33.000\nThen I did it.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nI don't know, I'm getting offended.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nYeah, I'm offended, but...\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.000\nWe exposed ourselves during that and you just, you know,\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nyou get to sit there in your little director's chair\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nwith hiding behind a...\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nI love Lucy.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nWhat is this you got on your face?\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nI have no idea.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nAll right, we'll give you one more chance.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nWe'll do Tartovsky in space.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nTarkovsky, Tarkovsky in space, okay.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:57.000\nCaptain.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:04.000\nThere is a potato shortage in the potato locker.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nPotato is not important right now.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nGo to airlock.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:11.000\nCaptain, how can you say that?\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nThe airlock is leaking.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nThere is a leak in the airlock.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nWith all due respect, Captain, it will not matter\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:21.000\nif we have air or not, if we don't have potatoes.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:25.000\nYou need air more than potatoes.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:30.000\nWe'll just see.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:36.000\nYes, I'm just kidding.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:41.000\nTartovsky in space.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.000\nAll right, so...\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nWait, he looks excited about this one.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nHe's getting into this one.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nI didn't even get what just happened in this scene.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nSomeone died or...\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nYeah, he had an oxygen mask.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nI just haven't seen it, but yeah.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nI just, I can't see stuff around me with this mask.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:04.000\nSo, yeah.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:07.000\nThe little eye holes are not cut out like in a certain aspect ratio\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nso you're always seeing the frame.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:12.000\nCome on, direct us.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nGive us some fucking notes.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nSome fucking notes on your improv.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nOh, the story?\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:21.000\nHow would you, if that was the starting point of our rehearsal\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nand we were going to shoot this thing,\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nwhat would your direction be?\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:29.000\nMy direction would be, don't do stupid accent\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nbecause it doesn't make sense.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:35.000\nIf you're Russian, you either speak Russian\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nor if it's in a movie, you speak perfect English.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:42.000\nYou're speaking in a stupid Russian accent right now.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:45.000\nI mean, it's kind of the...\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nI'm not in the movie.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:50.000\nThe pot calling the Samovar black.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nWhere have you seen reality in movies?\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nWhere have you seen something real in movies?\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:57.000\nI'm not in a movie, so I can't speak however I want.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nIt's pretty, pretty defensive.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nNo.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nWell, check in with you again in the next semester\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nto see if you've learned anything.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:12.000\nLet's have a hand for Wobbly,\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nEdgy,\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:18.000\nDangerous, and Atoli.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nTo be fair, my Russian accent was pretty crap.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nIt was kind of a real Euro rail pass.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:28.000\nYeah, but, you know, lame.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:31.000\nLame directing.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nI'm supposed to tell us to get angry\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nand then we get angry.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nWe would have gone, like, good job directing us.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nWe got angry. That's all you had to do.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nGiving them, like, force.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nNow he's just flipping you off from the front row.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:50.000\nAll right, so that was the energy boost I needed to...\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:58.000\nThat was, like, taking another capsule of Molly.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nWhen did they start calling it Molly?\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nWhy did that happen?\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nThey just keep moving that goalpost.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:08.000\nWhen I first encountered it, we called it X.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nLike, Jamie Kennedy X.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nBut then the kids were like, that's lame.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:18.000\nIt's E. I called it E for X to see.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:23.000\nAnd then it's Molly.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:27.000\nIs Molly just more of a pure MDMA kind of thing?\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nIt's cut with amphetamine?\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nI thought Molly's pure MDMA.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nIt's the other way around.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nI think X to C always had a little speedy component to it.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:41.000\nAnd then MDMA is more like, this is...\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:44.000\nYou can just wiggle your eyeballs and...\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nYeah, I went to the Hollywood Bowl\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:49.000\nand saw Horst's Planets.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nAnd on a little bit of Molly, and it was a groovy.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nIt was very good.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:56.000\nI recommend that.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nOh, boy.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nI mean, I say we're going to have bad shows a lot,\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:04.000\nbut I really meant it this time.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nI feel like we can coast on Tartosky in space\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nfor another half hour.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nI don't think that was that good.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nI think they're being nice.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nThey want us to entertain them.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nThey feel stupid for paying $10.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nThey're going to tend to jump on anything they can.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:21.000\nYeah, we don't even have Spencer tonight.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:24.000\nSpencer, do you hear that?\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nSpencer, can you hear me?\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:30.000\nWell, let's try an experiment.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nEventually, I want to get these monitors in here\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nso that we can do, for the live stream,\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nwe can do a feed,\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nand then people can tweet at us.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:43.000\nAnd then we can respond to them, kind of.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:46.000\nBut like...\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nFor now, let's just do...\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:53.000\nThis show is like a fucking freight train of entertainment.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:56.000\nThis is some breathless shit.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:01.000\nOh, my God.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nI feel like a bum.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nAll right, pick a hashtag.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:09.000\nUh, hashtag, uh, Tartosky in space.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nThat's too hard to spell.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nWe'll just make it...\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nHashtag, potato locker.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nPotato shortage.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:18.000\nOkay, hashtag...\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:22.000\nWell, okay, potato shortage.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:27.000\nOkay, so if you're watching on the live feed,\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nI guess these guys can too,\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nbut there goes there's eight laughs we were getting.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:41.000\nJust tweet something at hashtag, potato shortage.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:44.000\nAnd then we can address their issues.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nI love it.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nThe future is now.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nYeah, let's just wait for that.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nSo you're saying that we would have a monitor,\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nmeaning that this would be happening live during the show?\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nLike, up here?\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nWell, yeah, something so that they can see.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nBecause the idea would be if you were watching the live stream,\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nthen it would be like a lower third.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nBut then they have to see the same thing\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nthat the people on the live stream are seeing.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nThat's the difficulty.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nI'd like to do more visual stuff,\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\njust to make people mad,\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nthat are listening for free.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nThey're gonna wonder what the hell was on\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nAnatoly's face the entire time.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:17.000\nLike, we'll start playing, like, fun, like,\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nphotos from a safari.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nIs Erin here tonight,\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:24.000\nor is she recovering from hypothetical serotonin levels?\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nShe went with a group of, like, 50 girls\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nto see 50 Shades of Grey.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nThey did a whole outing.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:35.000\nI don't know if those were groans of pleasure,\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:40.000\nor pain, as the source material, I guess,\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nwould want me to be confused, right?\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:45.000\nI'm assuming, as a blurred line.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:46.000\nI don't know, isn't it?\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\nIt's about S&M stuff.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nOh, fuck, I left my book on the plane.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nGod damn it.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nNot 50 Shades of Grey.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nI was reading another book.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nWhat book were you reading?\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt's called Rubicon.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nIt's about the last days of the Roman Empire.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:00.000\nIt was very good.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nAnybody read it?

50:10.000\nAnd I can't imagine people were trying to explain\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nto him what was going on.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nIt was all live feeds with people telling him\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nwhat was happening and he just kept\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nrepeating the same question over\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nand people were getting angry with

50:28.000\nI don't know what he was doing,\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nbut it was just him and his own rhetoric\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\ntrying to parlay this into a real sports interview.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nIf it was a hypothetical\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nthen the backdrop\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nchanges and now there's no building\n\n50:38.000 -->

01:00:38.000\nthis is wild\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.600\nIt's doing whatever you pull it to.\n\n01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.120\nOK, so it's recording a video.\n\n01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.240\nSo if I talk real loud right now, and then it'll do 10 seconds,\n\n01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.600\nand then it'll stop.\n\n01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.960\nAnd then if you replay the video, then it'll come out.\n\n01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.320\nA speaker here on the side.\n\n01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.480\nOK, that's 10 seconds.\n\n01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:51.960\nAll right.\n\n01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.000\nOh, I heard that.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.440\nSo now, tap it.\n\n01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.960\nYeah, tap it to hit play, and it'll say play video.\n\n01:00:58.960 -->

conduction\n\n01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.520\nis when it's playing, if you push this against your skull,\n\n01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.520\nit'll get louder.\n\n01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.400\nOr if you close your ears like this,\n\n01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.240\nthen it gets louder because it's making your head vibrate.\n\n01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.480\nNothing's happening.\n\n01:01:15.480 -->

I felt like an enormous piece, but I\n\n01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.400\ndon't know what I'm saying.\n\n01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.480\nThat's a primary purpose question.\n\n01:01:38.480 -->

radio.\n\n01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.120\nNormal speakers, and you, so like if you're at a concert\n\n01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.320\nand you're listening to it, you can plug your ears,\n\n01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.600\nand you can, like if you're having a phone conversation\n\n01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.200\nwith someone, and then you can hear it,\n\n01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.760\neven though

--> 01:02:48.600\nI took vows that preclude me from playing\n\n01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.120\nfuck, murder, kill, ever again.\n\n01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.560\nI'll save it for you.\n\n01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.800\nJust fuck.\n\n01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.000\nMurder and kill are the same thing, so yeah.\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.800\nWell, Mary, Mary, it's Mary.\n\n01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.080\nOh, Mary.\n\n01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.040\nProbably her.\n\n01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.160\nYou can kill me, I don't care.\n\n01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.200\nI don't know where to live.\n\n01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.560\nAll right, great.\n\n01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.560\nIt's all about the shirt.\n\n01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.000\nI didn't mean to make this dark.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.960\nYeah, that didn't seem like a sincere threat or anything.\n\n01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.400\nAll right, well, let's, why don't we thank these young ladies\n\n01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.400\nand get them out of here.\n\n01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.400\nThank you, Angela and Laura.\n\n01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:29.920\nThanks, ladies, thanks for your 50 Shades of Grey report.\n\n01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.360\nAnd they added some energy, right?\n\n01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.360\nYeah.\n\n01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.360\nRight.\n\n01:03:33.360 -->

something every 9-11.\n\n01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240\nAll right.\n\n01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240\nI'm always going to notice it.\n\n01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.840\nSo what do we do every 9-11?\n\n01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.840\nUh, what?\n\n01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.840\nMake a wish.\n\n01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840\nMake a wish?\n\n01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.840\nMake a wish?\n\n01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:05.280\nIf you use that wish for anything other than there to be no more 9-11s, you're an asshole,\n\n01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.280\nright?\n\n01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.800\nI would like you to do it every 9-11.\n\n01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.240\nI want you to go into some sort of weird Michael Cain scene.\n\n01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:22.360\nYou see Michael Cain on acting, right?\n\n01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.160\nWho's the comic, the Michael Cain in the love scene?\n\n01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.160\nI love you.\n\n01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.760\nMichael, let's do it again, but a little more romantic this time.\n\n01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:31.760\nAll right.\n\n01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.400\nI bloody love you.\n\n01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.960\nWho is that comic?\n\n01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.920\nWe'll find out.\n\n01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.360\nIs Rob Schrab in the house?\n\n01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.200\nI hear his dumb laugh.\n\n01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.480\nHe has to get prepped to shoot the Matt Barry episode.\n\n01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.480\nTake off the pants.\n\n01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.480\nWhat do you have to lose?\n\n01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.480\nI'll tell you.\n\n01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.480\nI'll tell you what I have to lose.\n\n01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:58.800\nUh, the, uh, the, the, the secret of my skit mark is what I, uh, I, I am, I'm, I'm pretty\n\n01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.640\ncertain that, uh, that it'll be, yeah, gross if I take off my pants.\n\n01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.640\nWhat sort of underwear do you wear?\n\n01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640\nYou're like, you a tidy whitey guy?\n\n01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640\nWhat do you got?\n\n01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.720\nUh, I think boxers, what do you wear?\n\n01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720\nI can't remember.\n\n01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.320\nLike they're like box, they're like, they're like boxer briefs.\n\n01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320\nBoxer briefs.\n\n01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:20.680\nYou can't remember the underwear you wear because I put them on like, you know, each pair is\n\n01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.680\nlike three weeks.\n\n01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:33.360\nSo, you know, I can't, then I just throw them in the garbage and buy a new pack.\n\n01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.280\nThey're so different.\n\n01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.400\nWhat does the Latin on the Harmontown seem to, I mean, uh, I think it means, uh, we,\n\n01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.680\nuh, we, we, we found a city without tyranny.\n\n01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.120\nWe write in Latin without understanding.\n\n01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:56.200\nUh, you're welcome.\n\n01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.080\nUh, Caesar back there.\n\n01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.080\nUh, Jeff, Jeff Rapp, please.\n\n01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.080\nNBA rap.\n\n01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.080\nNBA rap.\n\n01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.080\nYeah.\n\n01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.080\nYou don't like the NBA?\n\n01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.560\nAre you, are you racist, bro?\n\n01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560\nI used to like the NBA.\n\n01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560\nI grew up as a Laker fan, man.\n\n01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560\nIt was awesome.\n\n01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560\nBack in the days.\n\n01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.560\nDo an NBA rap.\n\n01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:23.080\nUh, Lakers, Lakers going down the court, wearing aphoros and shorts that are short.\n\n01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:28.160\nOh, I've got skills.\n\n01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.240\nThis guy, Aaron Nelson says he needs to write a 9-11 song for us to play and sing along\n\n01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.240\nto at 9-11.\n\n01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.240\nThat would be a good thing.\n\n01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.240\nOkay.\n\n01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.240\nEvery 9-11.\n\n01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.240\nBut you know, don't make it.\n\n01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.240\nWell, I don't know.\n\n01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.240\nI'm not going to say don't make it, whatever.\n\n01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.160\nI mean, it'll, it'll, it'll be perceived as offensive if that's how you want to perceive\n\n01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160\nit.\n\n01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:52.600\nBut I think we should, it'll be a solemn moment, 9-11, obviously it refers to a national tragedy.\n\n01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.960\nAnd then we'll do something with that moment to this guy's music, maybe.\n\n01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.560\nWe'll try that.\n\n01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.920\nAnd I guessed Dungeon Master.\n\n01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920\nAre you here?\n\n01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.920\nThis person that asked this?\n\n01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920\nYeah.\n\n01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.920\nHow would you do that?\n\n01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.920\nImprobable.\n\n01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:12.560\nLet me, look, we're going to put a pin in that.\n\n01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:19.080\nIn the realm of ideas of that quality, this person says, bring Adam Goldberg up.\n\n01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.560\nI don't think there's any way he could be here, right?\n\n01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.960\nHe, he, he, he, he, he'll materialize.\n\n01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:26.440\nThis would have been a, it's like, it's like Candyman.\n\n01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.040\nBut, historically, he, he, he's made his presence known already if he's here, right?\n\n01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040\nYeah.\n\n01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.000\nOh, give something away at 9-11, this person suggests.\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nThat's a good idea.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nOkay.\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nCan't, nobody.\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nWe auction him off at 9-11.\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.440\nPlay, on the other side of the spectrum, this person's saying, play Jenga at 9-11.\n\n01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.440\nThat's, yeah.\n\n01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.440\nYeah.\n\n01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.440\nYeah.\n\n01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.440\nBad person.\n\n01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.440\nYou're a bad person.\n\n01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.440\nYou hear that?\n\n01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:59.440\nThat's what you do to people when you think?\n\n01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:11.440\nUh, I just tuned in what the hell is going on.\n\n01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.440\nWhat was, what was the last movie you saw?\n\n01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440\nUh...\n\n01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.080\nDidn't you say Monuments Men?\n\n01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.640\nWell, I tried to watch it Nightcrawler.\n\n01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.640\nI kept falling asleep.\n\n01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.840\nI, I, I was really into it, but I just, very sleepy.\n\n01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.760\nI really want to finish watching Nightcrawler, but I keep, I, I keep falling asleep.\n\n01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.760\nNightcrawler's awesome.\n\n01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.760\nYou ever gonna write a movie?\n\n01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.760\nWe've talked about this before.\n\n01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.760\nYeah.\n\n01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:37.160\nI gotta, I just gotta, I just gotta write a bad enough season of community, that they\n\n01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:44.000\nstop making me do more, uh, and then I'm gonna write on those movies.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.640\nI think you should write your 9-11 movie.\n\n01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.000\nWait, what is it, Dan Harmon Potato Shortage is now showing up as a trending hashtag next\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.360\nto Chevy Chase?\n\n01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.360\nNot really.\n\n01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360\nOh, just in Chicago.\n\n01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.360\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:59.360\nIt's an improvised podcast.\n\n01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:06.600\nYeah, Chevy did the, uh, SNL thing tonight.\n\n01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600\nHe made an appearance.\n\n01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600\nI saw that on Twitter.\n\n01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:14.840\nAnd so did Eddie Murphy, who long has not appeared near SNL.\n\n01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.840\nWasn't he kind of banned from it or something like that?\n\n01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:22.000\nI think it was more like, wasn't he more, was he banned or was he like the other way around?\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nLike he wouldn't go.\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nWho knows.\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nAll right.\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nWell, okay.\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.120\nThat was Twitter interaction.\n\n01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120\nKind of hot, huh?\n\n01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.600\nI mean, it kind of works.\n\n01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:43.480\nLike imagine if, imagine if I didn't have to look at my phone, that applause was so sad.\n\n01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:49.040\nI think that if we had like a little monitor down there, and then we could see it, or you\n\n01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.040\ncould curate it.\n\n01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.040\nYou're the comptroller.\n\n01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.040\nRight.\n\n01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.040\nAlright.\n\n01:09:53.040 --> 01:10:01.280\nIt is hot up here, so I might as well just, I just feel, I mean, it's like somebody tweeted\n\n01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280\na picture.\n\n01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:08.280\nI know what I look like.\n\n01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:16.520\nEveryone I love that married this, she has to, she has to look at this tonight.\n\n01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:26.280\nAfter watching Fifty Shades of Grey, you better buy a lot of pizza.\n\n01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.280\nAlright.\n\n01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.680\nHave you ever done any bondage, sadal masticism stuff?\n\n01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.800\nDo you guys ever do like kinky shit?\n\n01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.800\nYou guys mean Aaron?\n\n01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.800\nYeah.\n\n01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.720\nOr previous gals, or?\n\n01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.320\nWhen I was younger, because I thought you had to try everything, I tried all the, you\n\n01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:52.440\nknow, I tried a little bit of tying somebody, you know, down, I'm like, okay, now you're\n\n01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.440\ntied down.\n\n01:10:53.440 --> 01:11:02.240\nI mean, it kind of felt like you were obligated to stay here before that, you know, like social\n\n01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:08.400\nanxiety is more, more pressing to me than like my dad's neckties.\n\n01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.920\nWere you ever tied up?\n\n01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.400\nDid you ever get tied down?\n\n01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.400\nI think, well, I think we took turns this, I was like young enough that I was like, well,\n\n01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.400\nlet's do that.\n\n01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:23.640\nAnd then I also like, I went by, oh, let's get the food, let's do the food, so the dumbest.\n\n01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.000\nYou see people in the movies with the food, with the whipped cream and the, it's just\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.800\nlike, oh, this is sticky and gross.\n\n01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.960\nAnd now it's more like hot dairy products, that's gross.\n\n01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.680\nSex is pretty dumb.\n\n01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:48.280\nI mean, the people that enjoy it, like, they don't stop doing it, they like have to keep\n\n01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:54.920\ndoing it, which is a good sign that it's dumb, right?\n\n01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.960\nLike it's not, it's not like they can do it for like, and then, oh, hey, Marissa, I didn't\n\n01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.560\nknow you were in town.\n\n01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:09.760\nIt's the strangest show.\n\n01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:19.200\nThat's Marissa, she does the, she hosts, has created the Having Changed Tumblr blog, which\n\n01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:25.000\nhas been up since the start of this podcast, really, right?\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.280\nBecause I made some comment about how there's no Tumblr blogs about me, and then you made\n\n01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.280\none.\n\n01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:38.640\nSo she's been in our corner ever since, she was at our wedding.\n\n01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.120\nSo what other kind of food did you guys do?\n\n01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120\nDo you whip the whipped cream?\n\n01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.120\nWhat else?\n\n01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.960\nI have whipped cream and chocolate sauce or some shit.\n\n01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:49.200\nI just remember whipped cream, I'm like, I think maybe honey, I can't remember.\n\n01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:56.000\nOnly thing I remember is it being, just dumb, just being, it's like sex, you know, sex is\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:11.200\nsomething that you do with someone you love because, you know, the alternative is masturbating,\n\n01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:19.200\nwhich is an exclusive act, an exclusionary, it's a bad message to send.\n\n01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:37.000\nSo you invite the other person in, let's do this together.\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:56.520\nAnd every once in a while, a new life is created by this act.\n\n01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:09.480\nThat person germinates in the uterus, is extracted from it, placed on a stainless steel scale,\n\n01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:28.080\neven a barcode, sent home after several vaccinations, which, oh, and then 18 years later goes to\n\n01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:34.200\nwork at Verizon.\n\n01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:45.200\nAnd so does she, oh, that's special someone, and then they go, and then Verizon keeps growing.\n\n01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:56.080\nIt's a great species, it's really fun, I'm sure 50 shades of gray really put the magic\n\n01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.080\nback in it.\n\n01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.680\nDid you ever, like, dress up or do any, like, costumes or something like that?\n\n01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.680\nDress up?\n\n01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:10.880\nWell, I mean, yeah, I guess, well, not like a panda or anything, I don't know, I'm 42\n\n01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:16.040\nyears old, I've tried everything once.\n\n01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:28.000\nSomebody's bone conductor's turned off, yeah, I've tried everything once, yeah, yeah, once.\n\n01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nGang bang?\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000\nNot scapula, no, no, no.\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.080\nI didn't, I haven't done pee and poop and, yeah, the pee and the poo and the blood thing\n\n01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.160\nis not for me, I don't need any of that in my life.\n\n01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.320\nI mean, I haven't tried everything, everything, yeah, that's silly for me to say, I've tried\n\n01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.360\neverything like a normal person, like, like, like, consider, like, like, like, this is\n\n01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:53.840\nlike three things, like, it's like 900 things I haven't tried, I haven't put a toe in my\n\n01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.920\nbutt, that's the, it's like, and you could do all 10 toes and that's 10 things I haven't\n\n01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.920\ndone.\n\n01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.920\nYou put a Schrab. up your butt?\n\n01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.920\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.920\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.920\nYeah, I did.\n\n01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.360\nMass, the mask work?\n\n01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:18.640\nHow are we, how are we gonna, how are we gonna get through tonight?\n\n01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.680\nHow are we gonna do, how are we gonna do a show?\n\n01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.680\nAre we warmed up yet?\n\n01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.200\nI'm warm, I'm shaking, I'm stopped.\n\n01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:35.560\nOh, that's my post supervisor, he's canceling the, canceling post tomorrow, he's probably\n\n01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:44.560\nfigured out I'm not gonna be editing, yeah, yeah, I'll have to be writing, thank you.\n\n01:16:44.560 --> 01:17:02.400\nSorry, I'm on the stage, okay, there we go, post super, podcast gold, do you guys have\n\n01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:09.360\nany Minecraft questions?\n\n01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360\nWhat mod am I running?\n\n01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:16.320\nI'm running a mod pack called Feed the Beast Infinity, it's available at FeedtheBeast.com,\n\n01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:25.560\nit's called the Infinity Mod Pack, it's brand new, it's for 1.7 and it's very stable and\n\n01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:29.760\nit has applied EnerGistix 2 in it, which I've been looking forward to for a while and just\n\n01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:34.400\ngotten on my feet with that and I'm having a real good time.\n\n01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.200\nIt's a very balanced mod pack, very balanced, previous mod packs have done strange things,\n\n01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:43.720\nexperimental things like magical crops added, now you can grow everything, you don't even\n\n01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.120\nhave to do anything else, this is a good mod pack.\n\n01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.560\nHow many hours do you spend playing that, what's the longest you've disappeared?\n\n01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:59.120\nI don't know, well I can't these days, maybe on the weekend, I'll just sit as long as my\n\n01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:08.040\nbody will let me, if it's not Valentine's Day and it's a weekend and I don't have something\n\n01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:17.680\nto write, I will get up and I'll grab the laptop and be like, her, minecraft, ha ha ha.\n\n01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:26.480\nAlright, let's figure something out.\n\n01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.480\nDo you have any music on there that's like, not rap, like, I branch out?\n\n01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:39.480\nYeah, let's try, let's go over and do this.\n\n01:18:39.480 --> 01:19:01.480\nWhen you move your body to the beat, when you see everybody in the street, you got the\n\n01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:11.360\naction, I got the water, we'll put them both in a cup with our daughter, family, family\n\n01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:19.520\non the street, with a bucket and a cup, doing everything, what's up, family, family on the\n\n01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:26.200\nstreet tonight, with a bucket and a cup, what's up, bucket, bucket, yo, yo, yo, my name is MC\n\n01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.000\nJohn, I'm here to mow the lawn.\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.240\nI'd like to use a rake, but that grass will not take, I've got to get up on the riding\n\n01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.240\nmower.\n\n01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:41.120\nSo faster, don't go slower, mow around the trees and yard, I've fucked your mama hard.\n\n01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:55.200\nI want to see you next Thursday night, I don't want to get into a fight, don't get in a fight\n\n01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.200\nbaby.\n\n01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:09.480\nCause you are my family and I love you, so you want, I won't steal your socks or your\n\n01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:22.600\nshoes, family, cause you got what I need, family.\n\n01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:35.920\nIt's good, that was a good one, that was a good song, I like the fascinating character\n\n01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:47.200\nof DJ, DJ John, I'm here to mow the lawn, DJ John was, DJ John was a refreshing departure\n\n01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:53.320\nfrom the, from the profane evolution of rap, he was back to like a traditional like peas\n\n01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:59.840\nand carrots kind of rap, but he, right at the end, he let you know, he's fucking your\n\n01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:06.280\nmom, which makes sense because he, listening to him, I don't think he knew that much about\n\n01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:11.920\nlawn care, he was, he wanted to use a rake.\n\n01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:18.920\nThat's a MacGuffin.\n\n01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:26.920\nWho, who, who wrote some of this music, do we have to give credit to these people?\n\n01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.920\nThat is by Kevin MacLeod.\n\n01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:28.920\nRemember Kevin, if you call my name.\n\n01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.920\nAre you Highlander Reference?\n\n01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:30.920\nYes.\n\n01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:31.920\nYes.\n\n01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.920\nKevin MacLeod.\n\n01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:39.520\nDon't forget Kevin, we're from an alien planet.\n\n01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520\nWhat?\n\n01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:47.480\nHighlander 2, fucked up, fucked up sequel.\n\n01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.840\nThey reveal at the beginning of Highlander 2 that all of the things that happened in\n\n01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:58.160\nHighlander 1 were in a different framework, they were aliens, they just, they just forgot\n\n01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:04.120\nthat they were aliens, and then they remember, and then the Sean Connery says, remember also\n\n01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:08.080\ndon't forget that you, if you call my name, I'll come back to life.\n\n01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.600\nSo he does, and the Sean Connery comes back to life, but Sean Connery spends the entire\n\n01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.600\nmovie buying clothes.\n\n01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:27.600\nAll right, what other songs do you get in there?\n\n01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:41.600\nIt's only 23 seconds, it has to be short.\n\n01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.600\nAll right, here we go, from the top, from the top.\n\n01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:50.600\nI got a beer, boots, and a pair of socks going to, wait, hold on, sorry, sorry, I can do\n\n01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.600\nit, I can do it, I can do it.\n\n01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.520\nI got corn syrup on my hat, I'm going out, how about that, going to grab some corn,\n\n01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:07.520\ngoing to grab some hay, fuck your mama, I'll live a long day, I've got a banjo on my knee.\n\n01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:15.520\nAll right, thank you, thank you, thank you, thanks, thanks.\n\n01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:25.520\nOh yeah, yeah, about time, it's about time, it's about that time.\n\n01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.520\nWait, what time is it?\n\n01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:38.520\nIt's about that time, I have a slow watch, I want to know what time it is.\n\n01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.520\nCould you tell me what time it is?\n\n01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:49.520\nI got an appointment coming up tomorrow.\n\n01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:57.520\nWe've been having a sweet old time, but I got to know what time it is.\n\n01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.520\nTimekeeper, timekeeper, it's like a Swiss clock tonight.\n\n01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:08.520\nWe've been hoeing low long day to the break of the dong dong.\n\n01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.520\nWhat'd you say?\n\n01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:13.520\nDon't fuck with me.\n\n01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.520\nI'm just trying to know what you're saying.\n\n01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:24.520\nSo I'm not even trying to play, I just got to know what time it is.\n\n01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:29.520\nSee, that's gibberish.\n\n01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:37.520\nI don't know why I work with you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.\n\n01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:42.520\nWhy are you all fighting?\n\n01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:48.520\nOh shit, it's my mom.\n\n01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:54.520\nWhy are you all down here fighting, sitting in my basement all night?\n\n01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.520\nWhat time is it?\n\n01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:59.520\nThat's what I'm asking.\n\n01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:05.520\nI set the grandfather clock on the wall, I'm not getting any sleep at all.\n\n01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.520\nYour father and I got work in the morning.\n\n01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.520\nThat's cheating.\n\n01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.520\nCan't you speak gibberish, man?\n\n01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:29.520\nAh shit, I'm going to bed.\n\n01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.520\nBaby, what was that?\n\n01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.520\nThose kids down in the basement.\n\n01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.520\nWhy they always going to be like that?\n\n01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.520\nWhy they're always waking up like that?\n\n01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.520\nDon't these motherfuckers get any sleep?\n\n01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.520\nI don't know baby, what time you keep?\n\n01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:51.520\nQuarter to three.\n\n01:25:51.520 --> 01:26:08.520\nThe dad knew what time it was, the whole time.\n\n01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.520\nThanks guys, thanks.\n\n01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:17.520\nThat was really nice, I was kind of hoping DJ John made an appearance about it.\n\n01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:25.520\nThis is like a whole Sesame Street of characters you've got going on.\n\n01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.520\nI think we should explore that town a little bit more.\n\n01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:36.520\nI'd like to know everybody that lives in that building, the whole block.\n\n01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:50.520\nAlright, well, what else you got?\n\n01:26:50.520 --> 01:27:01.520\nNone of them knew what time it was.\n\n01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.520\nAre they brothers or are they best friends?\n\n01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:10.520\nThey're in the basement and the mom was coming down and then she went back up to her husband.\n\n01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:18.520\nI think there was something going on between the mom and the friend.\n\n01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:35.520\nWow.\n\n01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.520\nVincent Press?\n\n01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:46.520\nIn the age of innocence, there is a prophecy that one will come.\n\n01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:56.520\nWho will change the innocence to guilt.\n\n01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:06.520\nThe keepers of this prophecy are called the Starwalkers.\n\n01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:27.520\nReclusive by nature, they keep to a hallowed hall atop the trees of Wisconsin.\n\n01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:36.520\nWe join them now at breakfast.\n\n01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:41.520\nDo you want more eggs?\n\n01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.520\nStarwalker.\n\n01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.520\nI have not satiated my taste for eggs.\n\n01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.520\nI would like another egg.\n\n01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.520\nI will make you one more egg.\n\n01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:01.520\nThe time keepers walk skywalkers, sir.\n\n01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.520\nWhat were they called?\n\n01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:09.520\nStarwalkers.\n\n01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:16.520\nSea eggs is the center of all power.\n\n01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.520\nHere is yours.\n\n01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.520\nI scrambled it.\n\n01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.520\nI tried to make it sunny side up.\n\n01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.520\nThen it became scrambled.\n\n01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:31.520\nI put my hand to it and draw from it its essence with my mind.\n\n01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:38.520\nSince the beginning of time, the sky guardians, what were they called?\n\n01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:44.520\nStarwalkers.\n\n01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:57.520\nThey derived their nutrition manually, preferring to save the mouth for verbal communication.\n\n01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:03.520\nWhat say you of the prophecy?\n\n01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.520\nThere will be three leaves in this tree.\n\n01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.520\nAll three will fall.\n\n01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:15.520\nOne will land.\n\n01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.520\nFather.\n\n01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.520\nYou are up early.\n\n01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:34.520\nThere is a man on the lawn.\n\n01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:39.520\nHe's got a rake.\n\n01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:45.520\nHe just seems to be fiddling around out there.\n\n01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:47.520\nBe calm, my young one.\n\n01:30:47.520 --> 01:31:03.520\nI will see what this is about.\n\n01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:07.520\nYou there.\n\n01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:13.520\nYou are tending the lawn?\n\n01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.520\nYes.\n\n01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:23.520\nMy name is John.\n\n01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.520\nJohn.\n\n01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:38.520\nI prefer a rake if that's what it take.\n\n01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:49.520\nBut I mow the grass like your mama ass.\n\n01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:53.520\nYour mama's ass.\n\n01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.520\nMy name is John.\n\n01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.520\nMomfucker.\n\n01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:12.520\nI'm here to say, I fucked so many moms today.\n\n01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:19.520\nI fucked them in the east.\n\n01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:23.520\nI fucked them in the south.\n\n01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.520\nThree hours later.\n\n01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:35.520\nIn the mouth.\n\n01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:40.520\nI have never heard of this practice.\n\n01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:43.520\nI am a star.\n\n01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:47.520\nWalker.\n\n01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.520\nI'm coming up.\n\n01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.520\nYou're not supposed to.\n\n01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:54.520\nI'm coming up.\n\n01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.520\nGet off the ladder.\n\n01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:16.520\nGive me the bucket of lava.\n\n01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:24.520\nHe's not slowing down.\n\n01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.520\nHe's a skeleton.\n\n01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:34.520\nHe's a flaming skeleton.\n\n01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:40.520\nMy name is John.\n\n01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:45.520\nRun, run to the panic room.\n\n01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.520\nDoes it work?\n\n01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.520\nDid they fix it?\n\n01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:53.520\nGet in the panic room.\n\n01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.520\nJesus.\n\n01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:58.520\nThis is a difficult sort.\n\n01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.520\nAnd you said, no panic room.\n\n01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:06.520\nYou said, let's go to Cancun.\n\n01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.520\nTurn that money into fun, you said.\n\n01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.520\nOne person in this tree top thinks about our safety.\n\n01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:18.520\nThe prophecy said three leaves would fall.\n\n01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:27.520\nWe three should jump and leave him here.\n\n01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.520\nOkay.\n\n01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.520\nI fear only one of us will make it.\n\n01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:38.520\nAnd so it is I take this time to say goodbye.\n\n01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:43.520\nGoing out the window of the panic room.\n\n01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:46.520\nThe ill advised window.\n\n01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.520\nThe panic room window.\n\n01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.520\nI wanted to see.\n\n01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.520\nYou guys don't even lock that window.\n\n01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.520\nIt defeats the whole point of having a panic room.\n\n01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.520\nFather, it's me.\n\n01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.520\nDon't be alarmed.\n\n01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.520\nThe panic room needs sunlight, you said.\n\n01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.520\nFine.\n\n01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.520\nGreat.\n\n01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.520\nAll right.\n\n01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:12.520\nSo the three of us jump.\n\n01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.520\nRight.\n\n01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.520\nIt is said in the Skywalker tradition.\n\n01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:20.520\nSky, sky, Skywalker.\n\n01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.520\nThat one need not fear death.\n\n01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.520\nFor death is only the beginning.\n\n01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:34.520\nBut that day, as my toes perched on the wooden sill of my panic room window.\n\n01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:40.520\nArms outstretched like a bold but fearful crane.\n\n01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.520\nI tasted what God must have felt the day he gave us life.\n\n01:35:45.520 --> 01:36:11.520\nThe fear that it was all for nothing.\n\n01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.520\nWell, my name is John.\n\n01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.520\nI was a skeleton all along.\n\n01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.520\nI wanted to take over the house.\n\n01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.520\nNow I got it all to myself.\n\n01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.520\nI got a rake over here and a shovel over there.\n\n01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.520\nI can do long care all day.\n\n01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.520\nI don't even have to rhyme anymore.\n\n01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.520\nI'm just big bad John and I got my own home.\n\n01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.520\nI'm going to sit down on the couch.\n\n01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.520\nGoing to make myself at home.\n\n01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.520\nI'm a burnt skeleton because they poured lava on me.\n\n01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.520\nThis is what I deserve.\n\n01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.520\nMy name is John.\n\n01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.520\nMy name is John.\n\n01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.520\nI'm walking all this long day.\n\n01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.520\nHop, hop, to the hip, to the hop, hop.\n\n01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.520\nHippity hop, hop, hip, hop.\n\n01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.520\nMy name is John.\n\n01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.520\nI do your lawn, but I don't take no shit today.\n\n01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.520\nHip hop to the hebbity hop.\n\n01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.520\nI said the hop, hop, bippity hop.\n\n01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.520\nHop, hop, hop.\n\n01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.520\nDid you ever see a White House with a president in it?\n\n01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.520\nFuck that, motherfucker.\n\n01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.520\nI'll fuck the government.\n\n01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.520\nFucking government.\n\n01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:09.520\nMy name is John.\n\n01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.520\nBig bad John all day long.\n\n01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.520\nTake care of your lawn, ding dong, ding dong.\n\n01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.520\nI take your daisies down\n\n01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.520\nto a regular town\n\n01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.520\nand I sell them at the bazaar.\n\n01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:21.520\nI drive back in my car.\n\n01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.520\nIt's powered by the sun.\n\n01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.520\nGreen energy.\n\n01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.520\nFuck the president.\n\n01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.520\nMy name is John.\n\n01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:39.520\nOh.\n\n01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:49.520\nOh.\n\n01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:59.520\nFather, are you okay?\n\n01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.520\nOh, no.\n\n01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.520\nMy back is broken.\n\n01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.520\nWould you perhaps like some eggs?\n\n01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.520\nOh.\n\n01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:09.520\nHow am I the only one that got hurt?\n\n01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.520\nI walked down.\n\n01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.520\nThere's a, what?\n\n01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.520\nThere's a stairs?\n\n01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.520\nJohn was just on the couch rapping.\n\n01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.520\nHe didn't even see me.\n\n01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.520\nHe was just getting really irritable\n\n01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.520\nabout the government.\n\n01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.520\nFather, I'll go to the medicine tree.\n\n01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.520\nDid any of you ever think\n\n01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.520\nthat we've done all we've done\n\n01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.520\nfor nothing?\n\n01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:43.520\nYes.\n\n01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.520\nBut\n\n01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.520\none must\n\n01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.520\nunderstand that it is all\n\n01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.520\na process of becoming\n\n01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.520\nand whether you are in the panic\n\n01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.520\nwindow, panicking\n\n01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.520\nwhether you are in the air\n\n01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.520\nflying and dying and landing\n\n01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.520\nand whether you're the clever\n\n01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.520\nson\n\n01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.520\ncascading down a flight of stairs\n\n01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.520\nmade more stable by lava\n\n01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.520\nthat has now ceased to be lava\n\n01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.520\nand is\n\n01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.520\nmerely\n\n01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.520\nigneous.\n\n01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.520\nFather, father, father.\n\n01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:21.520\nUncle Rico, sorry to interrupt.\n\n01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.520\nI'm getting a reading on the radar.\n\n01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.520\nIt appears to be some sort of spacecraft\n\n01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.520\ncoming inbound.\n\n01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.520\nIt takes the elder.\n\n01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.520\nShhh!\n\n01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.520\nHow the mighty have fallen!\n\n01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.520\nExpecting to see an elder?\n\n01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.520\nIt's me.\n\n01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.520\nTom Young.\n\n01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.520\nTude fat from living in your trees?\n\n01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.520\nLiving your dreams?\n\n01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.520\nDid a rat bring\n\n01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.520\nlawn man make you fall?\n\n01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.520\nI told you\n\n01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.520\nthere was war in this universe and you\n\n01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.520\nrefused to heed my call.\n\n01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.520\nNow you lay on the floor with the rest\n\n01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.520\nof the animals clutching at your broken\n\n01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.520\nback waiting
