00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
The Hollywood California Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
Thank you very much. Bad show tonight, bad show.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
It's not feeling it. Yesterday was Valentine's Day.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm not at liberty to say whether or not I use recreational drugs,

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
but if they're in a hypothetical universe where there was one that facilitated

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
intimate coupling, maybe some sort of like ecstatic sensations.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Something that would have been prescribed to couples before it was illegalized

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
back in the 80s, I think. I would have probably taken that yesterday

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
and I would be having a serotonin depletion right now

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
with just pleasant memories of seeing Wicked at the Pantages.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
You went? How was it?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
It was good.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Was it a big musical theater guide? You enjoyed it?

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
I like a good musical. I mean, I don't like a bad one. No one does.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
I don't know what that makes me. A regular old musical consumer.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I used to go, when I was a kid, we went to every play at the Pantages.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
That's a very fond childhood kind of memory for me.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
It's about a witch.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Is she the protagonist of the tale?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Even though she's a witch?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
We'll do a little reversal.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
Were you theoretically on this ecstatic sort of possible thing during the show?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
I don't know why. I mean, I'm especially not allowed to talk about

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
the possibility of my wife going near this stuff.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
But if she had, I would have said to her,

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
would you really want to do that during this?

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
I would have said yes, but we didn't.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
But if I had, then I would have been sitting there with my eyeballs kind of going,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Do you think that would possibly have enhanced your wicked viewing pleasure,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
or was it distracting? Hypothetically?

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
It's a synthetic drug. I think you kind of, if you take mushrooms or acid,

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
not that I ever have, but if you, those change your experience,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
like your perception of things, I think that, you know,

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
my experience with the ecstasy family of drugs,

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
it's a very small family.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
I think it's just that guy at Molly, his friend Molly, right?

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
It just kind of, you know, it kind of puts you in a certain mood,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
but everything that's happening around you, you know,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
you're not, you're emotionally receiving it differently,

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
but you're not like, you know, experiencing anything other than what's actually happening.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
So I guess I was kind of like, this musical puts me in a great mood,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
which may not be true, but I don't know.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Maybe it was bad. I don't know. It seemed good to me.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
She was green. She flew.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
I mean, don't let this guy, like, tell you whether or not I had a good time yesterday.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
It'll sound terrible. I'm, this is what happens.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
This is the price you pay for your disco drugs.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
All those highs you kids are on, they have lows.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, I'm rotten as a fucking chop today, man.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
I apparently drank 100,000 drinks in Anacord as Washington yesterday.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I was telling them backstage, I was on the plane,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
and I had to go into the lavatory just to get it together.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Like, I just sat in there like, it was really nice in there too.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I was like, I can't be around human beings right now.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
That's called delirium tremens, I believe is the word.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It's not good.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, good news is I guess I'm bored with the black people now.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I think we kind of...

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
You got that out of your system?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
We really double dipped last time too.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
I didn't mean for that to happen, but I wanted anybody that did come

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
just for the asking to be rewarded for it for sure.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I don't know if either of those two guys, Brian and Max,

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
if they actually, it sounded like they had those coincidences that they were here.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Because there were other people tweeting me going,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I'm going to come to the show because I'm black and you asked for it.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
And I thought if they do that, then that's very sacrificial of them.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
They should be given a reward of some kind.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
A spotlight, for instance.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
But having their race acknowledged and having them be dehumanized through it.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Anatolia, are you having a weird psychotic episode over here?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
What's going on?

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Can we get a camera on this guy?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
What is happening?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Anatolia, you kind of have to.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Normally we ask if you want to, but if you're going to sit in the front row

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
and do that, you have to show people what you're doing.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
At least stand up and face the audience and give them what I'm getting here.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
This is very horrifying.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Completely nightmare inducing.

05:32.000 --> 05:42.000
How are you?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Oh boy.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Oh no.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Careful.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh boy.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Oh no, I thought you were going to fall.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Do you want to talk for a little bit?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Okay.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Have a seat over there.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm enjoying the sweater of this space kitten.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I love that.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
It's got those earbud laces.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah, and I can do it like get listened to the music.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
And it goes like right to my nipples.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
So the cat is listening and sorry your nipples.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Have you heard of these bone shaking headphones?

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
They use your bone, your skull to conduct the music.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So there's no actual sound happening.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
It's just using your skull as a speaker.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
That makes sense.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
At least for me.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah, you look like you could use some disruption.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
I just hear music constantly, like every time.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Obviously we're not going to ask, what are you doing?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Why are you doing that?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
That's what you want us to do.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
And then you'll be like, I don't know.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
Here's your medal for whatever this movement is.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm not going to play the role of your father

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
shooting you looks over the top of my newspaper.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I'm going to support you.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
One of those dads, the dads that you end up calling by his first name when you move out.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah, that's good.

07:27.000 --> 07:37.000
So what, have you been directing anything lately?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I know you came out here to direct.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
I'm kind of trying to make my desert film right now, my desert short.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Desert Shield?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
No, it doesn't sound like that.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
My final short in my program.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Oh, you're short.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Are you talented enough to justify this level of eccentricity?

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure I am.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
One would hope that you can back that up.

08:05.000 --> 08:13.000
You can't just start wearing kitten costumes and stuff.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
I mean, well, you got to go, never mind.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
I mean, yeah, okay.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So what's your short about?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Can you tell us?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
It's called about love, but it's not about love.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Nice.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
What's it about?

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
It's just like shots of a factory.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And then a razor blade on a coffee table.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
As a tea kettle whistles.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
About love.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm a little bit lost.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
What's happening right now?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
That's all it took in the 70s.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
You were working for Spielberg after that.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
What?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
For real?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Is it 70s right now?

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Are you on anything?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Oh, I mean, oh, fuck.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It's a safe place to tell us.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
No.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I mean, yeah.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm never on anything.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
It just costs a lot of money to be on something, so I don't do it.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
So the thing keeping you from being a drug addict is the financial aspect?

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah, because I mean, that's like my main problem.

09:40.000 --> 09:48.000
Because as I see it, you always have risk of becoming heavily addicted to it.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
And then you need a lot of money for rehabs and stuff.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
So I don't start with it.

09:54.000 --> 10:04.000
Because when you have no money and start drugs, it's like your future is not bright.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It might be not bright.

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
So I just kind of want to get some money first and then start with drugs.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
It's good thinking.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
So in the meantime, you're just drinking?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I don't drink.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Do you have an inner ear infection?

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
There must be some explanation.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
You seem a little wobbly and eccentric.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I'm just an artist.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Oh, okay.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
All right, okay.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I won't keep pushing it then.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
You're just a wobbly, dizzy magazine page wearing sober Russian...

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
It's like my entire life is my art project.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
And it goes from, yeah, and it doesn't mean anything, at least for me.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
But it might mean something for people around.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
And they will see me in my art and that's how art exists.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Can we start a fun to get you really high for next week?

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
I wanted to see, because when we checked in with you, when we met you,

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
you said you came out here to be a director and we tried to have you direct us.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
And you just told us, talk louder or something?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
A lot of costume notes.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
I mean, because it's the most important thing, at least in film directing,

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
if it's going on camera, it should look real.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
If I remember correctly, it was a scene from a madman,

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
and you were Don Draper and you were dressed like you.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
And on an episode of a madman, Don Draper would be dressed like that.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
It won't be a madman.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
It's for real, it's the first note.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
The most important thing.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
If you're a crew of one, then you are also the wardrobe supervisor.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
You should be like, alright.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
So until we get you a 200 person crew, we'll never get a taste of your directing.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I wanted to see how far you've come as a director,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
and you've been going to film school all this time.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah, I'm pretty far.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah, I mean, if Jeff and I were to do another scene from Madman,

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
could you get beyond our wardrobe?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Okay, okay, I'll pretend like you're dressed fine, yeah.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Okay.

12:31.000 --> 12:42.000
Alright, in this scene, Don Draper is coming into Peggy's office.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
Oh, hello Don.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
What's going on with that Heinz report?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I was going to have it on your desk.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I just got distracted.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
My husband and I have been having problems at home.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Can I make a few things perfectly clear?

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
It's not going to be one of those sexist monologues you go into, is it?

13:02.000 --> 13:11.000
There's two things you're good for around here.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
The Heinz account.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
And the Heinz account.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I said it twice, because it's twice as important.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
This whole firm relies on the Heinz account.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
I don't watch Madman.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Thank you.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, I noticed that.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
Alright, so you have some notes?

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
By the way, this is now just starting to seem natural, this whole thing now.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Now we're strangely all okay with this.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah, I mean the main note is you should watch Madman.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Oh, alright.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Okay.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Alright, well, okay, I mean, so...

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Should we try...

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Can we do like a Russian film?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Can we do like some kind of like artistic...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Solaris.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Solaris?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Solaris, yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Tarkovsky's movie.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah, about space and shit.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Can we do a Tartovsky in space movie?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Well, can I predict his first note?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Will he be in space?

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
This seems like a lot of convenience.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I mean, I put this work in and then he's like,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
come back when you're in space.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
Then I did it.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I don't know, I'm getting offended.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah, I'm offended, but...

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
We exposed ourselves during that and you just, you know,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
you get to sit there in your little director's chair

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
with hiding behind a...

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
I love Lucy.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
What is this you got on your face?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I have no idea.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
All right, we'll give you one more chance.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
We'll do Tartovsky in space.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Tarkovsky, Tarkovsky in space, okay.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Captain.

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
There is a potato shortage in the potato locker.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Potato is not important right now.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Go to airlock.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Captain, how can you say that?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
The airlock is leaking.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
There is a leak in the airlock.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
With all due respect, Captain, it will not matter

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
if we have air or not, if we don't have potatoes.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
You need air more than potatoes.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
We'll just see.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
Yes, I'm just kidding.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
Tartovsky in space.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
All right, so...

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Wait, he looks excited about this one.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
He's getting into this one.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I didn't even get what just happened in this scene.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Someone died or...

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah, he had an oxygen mask.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I just haven't seen it, but yeah.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I just, I can't see stuff around me with this mask.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
So, yeah.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
The little eye holes are not cut out like in a certain aspect ratio

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
so you're always seeing the frame.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Come on, direct us.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Give us some fucking notes.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Some fucking notes on your improv.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh, the story?

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
How would you, if that was the starting point of our rehearsal

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
and we were going to shoot this thing,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
what would your direction be?

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
My direction would be, don't do stupid accent

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
because it doesn't make sense.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
If you're Russian, you either speak Russian

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
or if it's in a movie, you speak perfect English.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
You're speaking in a stupid Russian accent right now.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
I mean, it's kind of the...

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm not in the movie.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
The pot calling the Samovar black.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Where have you seen reality in movies?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Where have you seen something real in movies?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
I'm not in a movie, so I can't speak however I want.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
It's pretty, pretty defensive.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
No.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, check in with you again in the next semester

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
to see if you've learned anything.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
Let's have a hand for Wobbly,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Edgy,

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Dangerous, and Atoli.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
To be fair, my Russian accent was pretty crap.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
It was kind of a real Euro rail pass.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah, but, you know, lame.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Lame directing.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I'm supposed to tell us to get angry

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
and then we get angry.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
We would have gone, like, good job directing us.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
We got angry. That's all you had to do.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Giving them, like, force.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Now he's just flipping you off from the front row.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
All right, so that was the energy boost I needed to...

17:50.000 --> 17:58.000
That was, like, taking another capsule of Molly.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
When did they start calling it Molly?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Why did that happen?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
They just keep moving that goalpost.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
When I first encountered it, we called it X.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Like, Jamie Kennedy X.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
But then the kids were like, that's lame.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
It's E. I called it E for X to see.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
And then it's Molly.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Is Molly just more of a pure MDMA kind of thing?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
It's cut with amphetamine?

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I thought Molly's pure MDMA.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
It's the other way around.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
I think X to C always had a little speedy component to it.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
And then MDMA is more like, this is...

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
You can just wiggle your eyeballs and...

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Yeah, I went to the Hollywood Bowl

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
and saw Horst's Planets.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
And on a little bit of Molly, and it was a groovy.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
It was very good.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
I recommend that.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Oh, boy.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I mean, I say we're going to have bad shows a lot,

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
but I really meant it this time.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I feel like we can coast on Tartosky in space

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
for another half hour.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I don't think that was that good.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I think they're being nice.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
They want us to entertain them.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
They feel stupid for paying $10.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
They're going to tend to jump on anything they can.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Yeah, we don't even have Spencer tonight.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Spencer, do you hear that?

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Spencer, can you hear me?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, let's try an experiment.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Eventually, I want to get these monitors in here

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
so that we can do, for the live stream,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
we can do a feed,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
and then people can tweet at us.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
And then we can respond to them, kind of.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
But like...

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
For now, let's just do...

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
This show is like a fucking freight train of entertainment.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
This is some breathless shit.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Oh, my God.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I feel like a bum.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
All right, pick a hashtag.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Uh, hashtag, uh, Tartosky in space.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
That's too hard to spell.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
We'll just make it...

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Hashtag, potato locker.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Potato shortage.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Okay, hashtag...

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Well, okay, potato shortage.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
Okay, so if you're watching on the live feed,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I guess these guys can too,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
but there goes there's eight laughs we were getting.

20:32.000 --> 20:41.000
Just tweet something at hashtag, potato shortage.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
And then we can address their issues.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
I love it.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
The future is now.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Yeah, let's just wait for that.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
So you're saying that we would have a monitor,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
meaning that this would be happening live during the show?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Like, up here?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Well, yeah, something so that they can see.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Because the idea would be if you were watching the live stream,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
then it would be like a lower third.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
But then they have to see the same thing

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
that the people on the live stream are seeing.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
That's the difficulty.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I'd like to do more visual stuff,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
just to make people mad,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
that are listening for free.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
They're gonna wonder what the hell was on

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Anatoly's face the entire time.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Like, we'll start playing, like, fun, like,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
photos from a safari.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Is Erin here tonight,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
or is she recovering from hypothetical serotonin levels?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
She went with a group of, like, 50 girls

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
to see 50 Shades of Grey.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
They did a whole outing.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
I don't know if those were groans of pleasure,

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
or pain, as the source material, I guess,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
would want me to be confused, right?

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm assuming, as a blurred line.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I don't know, isn't it?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It's about S&M stuff.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Oh, fuck, I left my book on the plane.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
God damn it.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Not 50 Shades of Grey.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I was reading another book.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
What book were you reading?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
It's called Rubicon.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's about the last days of the Roman Empire.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
It was very good.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Anybody read it? Tom Holland, right?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Really well-written stuff,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
and then, of course, leave it on the plane.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
You got a copy of it?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
You audio-booked it?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah, I have to go find it.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
All right, hit me with a fucking rap beat.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Oh, shit.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Let's just, like, let's just, let's get this thing.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Let's go deep.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Big pile of booties out front.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Fuck your mouth.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
That's the only thing that rhymes with that is...

22:36.000 --> 22:44.000
All right, all right, that's enough, that's enough.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
That's how this is gonna go.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
I thought it would bring up the energy, but...

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
It's not that the rap bar was ever set that high by you,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
but that was poor.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
That was very poor.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I didn't get to the first rhyme.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
But I'm calling that a victory.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Not getting to the rhyme of that one.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Oh, I got one. All right, play it.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Do you like that beat? You want to feel something else?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Play the same one.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Sorry, I just sprayed back on you.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
Baby dance, baby dance, baby dance, baby dance.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Big pile of booties out front.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Candid camera hosted by Alan Funt.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Saw your mama just the other day.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Got her on my knees and I started to pray.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Because your mama's booty is like a god to me.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
It's all that I ever see, like a touchy roll.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
In those old ads, I fucked your mama.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Her name is Tad.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Fatty is by birth.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Then later shortened to the informal tad.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
I took your mama to the beach.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I fed her apples, I fed her a peach.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
She started to get heartburn because the citric acid.

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
That's what we learned is causing her esophagus to fuck her up.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Now she's in a sarcophagus.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
She's not dead.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
She's just getting out of her head.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
That'll meditation exercise.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Fuck your mama between her juicy thighs.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Put my head inside.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I got reverse born.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Now I'm white.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I'm white.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
W-I-D-E.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I meant to say it.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
It's a new way to say cool.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
White.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
You're white now.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Alright.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
That was good.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
See, I feel that energy now.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
It doesn't really matter.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
That gave them energy.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Then they give it to me and what do I do with it?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I can't say, man.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
That shit was wide.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
That shit was wide.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Hashtag potato shortage.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Alright.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Well, I mean...

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Let's bring out D'Morge.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
D'Morge Brown!

25:12.000 --> 25:23.000
Downtown D'Morge Brown.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Boy, this is when you have to see in the live stream

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
to really get to...

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
There's a lot of visual goodies going on here.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
That's pretty wide, man.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
What is wide for you is wide for other people.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Alright.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
So, the Chinese are at it again.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Fucking Chinese, man.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I don't have anything.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I'll check the feed.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Okay, let's see here.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
How are you, D'Morge?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
It's a very exciting shirt you have on there.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Thank you very much.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Well, it's Valentine's Day weekend.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I thought I would do something for myself.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
As I'm only with myself.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Single ladies.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Are you a single gentleman?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Yeah, I am.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
For how long?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Until someone solves that riddle, you know?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
When was the last time you were in a series?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Ah, geez. Like a couple of years ago, I think.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Yeah.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
What's your record for the longest relationship?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
I think like seven years.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Six years? Something like that.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Like college and then some.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
It's a wonderful person.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
She was a great person. She was a good kid.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
And then what?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And then I moved to Los Angeles.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I wanted to be an actor and she wanted to be a human being.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
And I think that's it.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I had to become fictional.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
These tweets are very critical.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Maybe this is a bad emotional road to walk down right now.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
This guy says,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I think you'd be surprised

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
how many people would watch a live stream of Dan

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
just staring at his phone.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Hashtag potato shortage?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I guess I'll hear this on Wednesday,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
says this guy.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Damn, Dan can't even rap.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
What horrible mush has he made his mind?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Oh!

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Damn.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Josh Cahill says,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I felt massive shame this week

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
when I accidentally bought one ply toilet paper.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
The first time I ever went grocery shopping

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
with Erin,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I don't think she had moved in yet,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
but it was sort of like,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
one day in a relationship

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
you both go grocery shopping together.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I remember early in our relationship,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Erin went through a very brief phase

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
of trying to impress me with how frugal

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
she was and how unimpressed she was

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
with my money.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
So if I would say,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
let's just take a cab there.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
She'd be like, no, it's safer to

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
take a cab.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I needed toilet paper

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
and she got this giant pack

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
and said, look,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
look at this big pack of toilet paper.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Look how cheap it is.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I'm like, okay, I'm very impressed.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
It was one ply

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
and I'm still wiping my ass with it.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
You haven't gotten through yet?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It's only just now, start down to one roll

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
and finally...

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
What is the problem with one ply?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I was asking a question.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I mean, it's like, toilet paper is...

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
No, toilet paper is one of those things

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
that you have to spend all the money on.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
It wasn't a dollar difference.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Go get the good shit.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Until they come up with better

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
technology than just paper

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
to wipe the shit out of your butt.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
The thicker, the better.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
The more between you

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
and what your body

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
is even saying,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
don't go near this.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
The wispy stuff.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Don't put this in your hand.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
This is coming out to the other side.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
What do you think it's interesting

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
that we are just worms?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
LAUGHTER

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
You know, a multicellular organism

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It becomes like a circle.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
It increases the surface area.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Basically, we evolved

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
from the first multicellular organisms

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
where these tubes

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
so shit would go

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
and digest through.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And we're still tubes.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
This is outside your body

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
inside your butt.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Like what you're doing

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
when you take a cookie

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
and you put it in your mouth,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
you're just rubbing the outside of your body

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
along it.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
LAUGHTER

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Some would say the worm

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
is on the inside.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
The worm is on the inside?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Yeah, and that we are on the outside

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
doing other things.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
We have built on our worm

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
a whole life.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
It's just getting way too wide for me, man.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
LAUGHTER

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Well, thank you, Josh Cahill,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
for not saying shitty things.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Are any of the cameras on?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I don't see any red lights.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
This guy is just sending

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
other rhymes for

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
front.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Oh, dear. That could be risky.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
They're mostly asking about potatoes.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I think that's a mistake we made.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Where's Camel? That's a good question.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Where's Camel?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Are we going to get some Camel?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Why are you about 50 shades?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
What feed is this?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I had them tweet at the hashtag

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
potato shortage.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Any relationship advice on how to stop

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
a communication breakdown from snowballing?

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Hmm.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
OK.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
How to keep a communication breakdown from snowballing?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
You have to

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
learn that your feelings

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
are your feelings

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
and your thoughts

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
and the mistake that we all make

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
is we say,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
look, you're making me very angry right now

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
or I feel like

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
when you come home late from work,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
these are constantly doing that.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
We're going like, I feel like

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
you're a piece of shit.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Which is really impossible.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
It's not honest.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Isn't that the good part that when somebody says

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I feel because normally

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
what people say is you're a piece of shit

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
and they don't mean I feel you're a piece of shit?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Exactly. So you have to

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
tend your own garden and express

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
what is actually happening inside of you.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Just think of it this way.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
What's something that nobody could argue with?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
If you said

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I'm just uncomfortable

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
right now.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I don't expect you to do anything.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Anybody who would say, well, you shouldn't be uncomfortable,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
they're an asshole.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
But if you say to somebody,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I'm uncomfortable so you should move your car,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
you should go do something else,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
that person is allowed to then say,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
well, if I move my car, I'm going to feel like this or that.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
But the important thing is to communicate

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
your feelings, especially with your lover.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
No one needs their car moved or anything like that.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
All that ever happens is

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
you both are afraid that the other one

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
will stop loving you.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
And then somebody says, I feel sad

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
because you did something and then the other person

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
is like, that's bullshit, I'm not the reason you're sad

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
and now I feel angry at you

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
and you're not really sharing feelings,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
your own feelings, you're just yelling shit

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
at each other.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Are you still doing the couples therapy thing?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah, can't you tell?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I'm a master now.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Except I took off my wedding ring

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
at work and it's sitting on my desk.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Wow.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Oh boy.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
It's okay.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
It'll still be there.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
But yeah, that could have been

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
like a desk made of quicksand.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
So lesson learned,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
don't take off your wedding ring.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
You're always working right now,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
you're pretty much a community all the time, right?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Does that take a toll on you and Aaron?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
If you don't have a lot of time to spend with each other.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
It's a very big challenge, yeah.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Yeah.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It'll bring the bad stuff out.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Is she here tonight? Is she coming?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
She's watching. Oh, I already asked.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
50 shades of gray.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Yeah, it's tough,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
but we're dealing with it.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
We're all right.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
When's the light at the end of the tunnel

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
already?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Sorry, what? I was reading my Twitter feed.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Are you almost done with community?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah, we're shooting

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
like the 9th episode.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Matt Berry flies in on Tuesday.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
We're going to do an episode.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Oh, shit, you know what?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Not a woman.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
That reminds me.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
A reminder, write script

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
for Matt Berry for Tuesday.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Hey.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
See, you're casting

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
without any script.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
We want you on a thing.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
We're in there international like that.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
You've got to book them well in advance

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
and schedule everything with them.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
So we knew we were going to do an episode with Matt Berry.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Now we know, as of yesterday,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I woke up, I know what we're going to do.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
But then yesterday I played

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
vanilla.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Valentine's.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Wow.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Valentine's Day.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Vanilla teen.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And today was vanilla Minecraft.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Tomorrow,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
which is a holiday,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I'll slave over a hot

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
keyboard for Matt Berry.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
A hit will be born.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I want to hear you

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
discuss Kanye West. I find him to be

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
super wide, but there seems to be

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
a perception created by

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I really hope that gains traction.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I want wide to become

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
a thing for the rest of our lives.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah, I don't know.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
SNL is doing their 40-year anniversary

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
tonight and I have

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
seen some tweets being critical

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
of Kanye.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I'm a little out of touch with Kanye.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
What's going on in Kanye News?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Is he a pariah?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
He seems like he's a very talented producer

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
and rapper, but he also seems like he's kind of a ding-dong.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
It's just, I think,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
somebody's given him a formula

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
that says every six days

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
he's got to do something publicly.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And the weirder it is, the better.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And so he just kind of plays that ball back and forth.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I mean, you know, it's all just, it all falls away.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
And then he throws, when people start to lose

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
patience with him, he just throws

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
a slab of incredible music out and tours

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
for two years and then comes back.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I think it's fine, man.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I like that gold digger song.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
You know what I just heard?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
I don't know shit about hip-hop.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
There'll be a He Loves Hip-Hop

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
and he played that song Monster for me

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
with Nicki Minaj and who else is on that, Jay-Z?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
It's fucking good.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
She's really good on that, too.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I was very excited about that.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
She is.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
That's the end of my rap knowledge.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
When I was in high school,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
we all had really big sound systems

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
in our car.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
We all had stolen speakers and amps

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
and all this shit.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Alpine rants.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Alpine and blowpunks and all that stuff.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
We would all play, it was all hip-hop

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
all the time and we were just a bunch

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
of white assholes.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
It was really cheesy.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Two live crew and shit, like terrible.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Candice Razo says,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I want to have sex with my boyfriend

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
while he watches Harmontown.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
It seems like an extraordinarily

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
bad idea.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Are we supposed to give her the thumbs up?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Go ahead.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
They should do that on the condition

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
that there's photos made available.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
This guy wants me to flip

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
off Anatoly.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
This guy wants me to take off my shirt.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
He wants sad shirtless Dan, please.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
That apparently is going to happen.

37:10.000 --> 37:16.000
Let's get ready to rumble.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Come on, Coco.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
That really is wide.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Can you actually start crying?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Can you produce an actual tear for us, Dan?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It's the new Coco.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Alright, I'm going to try to really cry.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I'm so fat.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Earth is dying.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
My dad's going to die.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I can't, there's nothing.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I mean, my dad's not sick or anything.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Otherwise, that would probably work.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Wait, what was the order? Fat?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Earth is dying. My dad's going to die.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Remember the improv show we did

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
where you ended up naked on stage

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
and you had a nosebleed so you were covered in blood?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
And holding your junk

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
and I sang you a lullaby

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
and you were just pouring

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
bright, incredibly red blood

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
and Jack Black was in the audience

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and we were so embarrassed and he comes back

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
out of the shirt and he goes,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
guys, that was a fucking fiasco.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I just realized we really undermined

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Candace, but

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
you know, if your boyfriend's probably not

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
going to be able to perform.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Candace's boyfriend just

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
looked from the neck down

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
where I'm a beautiful lady.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Don't listen to those haters hate

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
says at Embrace LeBase.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Your show is going

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
fucking great.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
This guy says

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
this show is great even without

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Serotonin.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
This guy says keep talking about

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
your butt.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
So remember when

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Candu.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Remember when Spencer

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
talked about his

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
caloric, pistolic,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
you remember that nest

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
cyst or whatever.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
The day he

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
started talking about that

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I got one

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
and I've had it the whole time.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I was like could that really be some kind of psychosomatic

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
like I got this thing that Spencer talked about

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
and I had it and then

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
finally it started to go away

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
and then the next day Spencer told me

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
his went away.

40:16.000 --> 40:22.000
I remember that story.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I got nothing.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
This show is really something.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
This one's probably

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
for Jeff.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I'm trying to learn to make better scones.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
What type of fruit or filling should I add?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Fuck you, Dan!

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Scones suck, right?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Scones aren't good.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
You don't want a fucking scone ever.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
You want a croissant or a fucking

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
something flaky, something light.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
You want a biscuit.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
It's like cakey gravel sort of.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
No, it's not good.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
If you're having scones you're doing it wrong,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I believe.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
My advice is don't make scones.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Aim higher is my advice.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
This guy says

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
woman pouring her hot coffee

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
into the trash.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I said you'll start a fire.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
She looked at the stream coming out

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
and screamed.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
That's just a crazy guy.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
You think?

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Maybe that's the one guy who's using

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
the hashtag potato shortage for something else.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
After the moon base

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
gets set up can Armenians

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
colonize other celestial bodies like Europa

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
or something?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Yes.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
On the next rixty minutes

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
might they catch an episode of community?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I don't know.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I saw that fly to

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Demorge. That's eight minutes ago.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
There was an enormous prehistoric animal

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
flew by your head.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
It was large.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Damon Gentry says

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Dan, do you ever get writer's block?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
What do you do if that happens?

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Aha!

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
All right.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
You're adorable.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
You're so cute.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Thank you.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
You're like the little Benny Hanukkah.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Benny Hanukkah?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
The Benny Hanukkah restaurant logo.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
The little Buddha guy.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Benny Hanukkah.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Benny Hanukkah.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
You get a different

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
one time for each of the eight days.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
The

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
writer's block.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I've said this a thousand times before

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
but it's

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
good advice.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Prove that you're a bad writer.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
There you go.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Okay.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
You're trying to prove that you're a good writer

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
that's what's blocking you.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
No matter how good you get

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
you're always going to think

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
that you should be better than you are

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and you will be by thinking that

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
but you're just not going to get you writing right now

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
and the only thing that's going to make you get better

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
is practicing and the only thing you're going to be able

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
to write right now is something worse

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
than what you think you should be writing.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
So you have to stop thinking about the thing

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
that you're eventually going to be able to do

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
and you have to start thinking about the thing

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
that you're terrified you will do

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
because that will go by very quickly.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
It's like cheating.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
It's like putting shit in your gas tank.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
It's like putting exhaust in your gas tank.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
It's like putting your car on it, technically.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Just write badly.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
And specifically

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
do that by saying

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
okay, I'm going to actually go there.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I'm going to actually show myself

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
what a piece of shit writer I really am

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
without thinking about any of it.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I'm impressed by the uniformity of your chest hair.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
It's just perfectly

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
it's very even.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Do you trim that or is that just natural?

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Yes.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I spent a great deal of time

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
on my chest hair and this is the result.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I spend

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
five hours a day

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
to achieve

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
the

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
god damn it, I forgot his name.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
You've got a very impressive little

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
back neck tuft

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
going on there too.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Who's the porn star

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
that ever

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
ever on Jeremy?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Would have been funny.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Let's all take our shirts off.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
What is your thoughts on Spider-Man

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Bad grammar.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Just kidding, I don't care.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I heard a rumor

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
about Spider-Man that Sony and Marvel

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
are now going to be, it's not a rumor, it's news, right?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Sony and Marvel

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
are going to be sharing Spider-Man now

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
in some weird way.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Sony gets to make Spider-Man movies

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and so does Marvel

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
and they don't make money off of each other's movies

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
but they're going to use the same Spider-Man.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Are they using the same Spider-Man?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Which means they're going to have to have

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
some kind of web slinger summit.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I don't know what to make of it.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Movies are for children now.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I don't care anymore.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Will Erin be playing the role

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
of Christian Grey

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
when she comes home tonight?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I don't know.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Who in here has read those books

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
or any of those books?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
applause, anybody?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
You?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
There's a lot of guilty looking faces out there.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Nobody really?

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
One and a half?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Are they really bad?

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
There's too much sex?

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
That's your complaint?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Who is that?

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
She wants less fucking.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Or more pizza.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I missed all of that.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
She was saying they're bad books

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
because people are fucking just too

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
wantedly.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
No one can walk five steps without

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
just rogering somebody next to them.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
That's what the movie is about?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Is everyone just doing it with each other?

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I don't know.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
The book.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Bring her up.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Will you come up on stage so we can

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
see you and hear you?

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
I want to talk about this.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
What's your name?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Let's put a face to the shame.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Give me a hug.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
No, I'm kidding.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Sorry.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
What's your name, madam?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
My name is Angel.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
You're looking very smart.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Obviously.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Hello.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
This is like reading rainbow.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
You're going to give us your book report on

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
50 Shades of Grey.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
You say you're a book and a half then.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Does that mean you are currently reading one of the books?

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
My friend and I both got to the same place.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
We were like, I can't believe I actually wanted

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
there to be a plot.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I didn't think there was enough sex.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Guess get her up here.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Bring it on up, sister.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Bring it on up.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Point, counter points.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
That's my friend.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Now we have a discussion on our hands.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Oh, and then we have a good question

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I got tweeted in.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
You explain.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
What is your name?

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
My name is Laura.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Angel and Laura.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Yes.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Guess how our lives go.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I know how tonight's going to go.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Let us know.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I agree that they could be in a restaurant

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and all of a sudden they have to have sex, but

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I don't know.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Don't even go to the bathroom.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Go in the parking lot.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
It's just they need to calm down.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
But it wasn't good sex.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
That's the point.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
It's about SNM, but it's like

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I don't give a shit anymore.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Older people like it and think it's risque,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
but we grew up with the internet,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
so it's not.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Interesting.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Some of those old people grew up on the internet,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
so we're actually just bored with all sex.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I feel like I'm just like

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
an asexual lump of clay.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
You really don't look like it.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Thanks, baby.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Baby.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Somebody asked a question that I think

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
we could all take a stab at here.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
This person's

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Twitter handle is

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
yesee underscore bev

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and they say, if you could tell one person

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
about 9-11 before it happened,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
who would you tell and why?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
What would change?

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
You got to pick one person.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It's pretty easy, right, though?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Don't you just...

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
You tell...

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
The pilot?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
The pilot knew.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
The pilot knows, yeah.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
You mean the actual pilot?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Your own personal life.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Don't you just tell like

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
the...

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I'd tell her, so I could just say

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I told you so

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
and make her mad.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
You tell some really old school

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
stop.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Some guy who's seen it all.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Somebody should...

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I mean

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I'm not saying that I'm the guy who would do this,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
but somebody should have told Bryant Gumbel

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
because

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
the video of him

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
as it's going down

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
is insane.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
It's the most confounding thing

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
in the world because they're telling him

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
what's going down and he's just seen it going.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
So let me understand.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
A building?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
And it's like you're there.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
He's in it as it's going on.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
It goes on for hours and hours and hours.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
He wouldn't get off the air

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
so that somebody could explain to him what was going on.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
And I can't imagine people were trying to explain

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
to him what was going on.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
It was all live feeds with people telling him

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
what was happening and he just kept

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
repeating the same question over

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and people were getting angry with him.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
The experts on the ground were getting angry.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Was he just in disbelief?

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
It was just him

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I don't know what he was doing,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
but it was just him and his own rhetoric

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
trying to parlay this into a real sports interview.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
If it was a hypothetical

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
then the backdrop

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
changes and now there's no building

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
and he's still kind of struggle with it.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
There's an ad now with he

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
and

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Katie Couric

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and it's based on his humor

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
dealing with the internet.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
But this is the same thing

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
with this real

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
non-

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
humorous event that's going on

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
in real time.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Fuck that guy.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I don't know a bad way.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Will there be a 9-12?

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Yes.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
You know what would be a good movie?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
It starts with that question

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
like Michael Cain

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
is Mr. Destiny or somebody

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
who comes and says

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
you can go on anybody you want

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
about 9-11

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
go.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
You go and it cuts to

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Robert Downey Jr.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
goes up the White House steps

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
and he's like

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Mr. President

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
and Mr. President says yeah

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
and he says the 9-11 is going to happen.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Let me explain exactly what 9-11 is going to be.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I got 10 minutes

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
and you don't want to hear it all

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
so you cut to like a cigarette

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
that shortens

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
and then he's like

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
and it's going to happen on 9-11

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
and the mnemonic device for that is

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
it's an emergency

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
and also it's September 11th

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
so 2001 so

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
okay.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
He doesn't tell him that he's traveled

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
in time though

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
so then he goes back to the present

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Robert Downey Jr. and he gets there

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
and it's like

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
everything's the same

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
9-11 happened just

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
the same way

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
you know why?

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Why?

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
They let it happen.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
He spends some time trying to make sure

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
oh did it not maybe it was a dream

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
and he's the only guy that can prove

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
that it actually was

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
an inside job because he told him

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
right but his evidence is

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
a strange story

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
about going back in time.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
But he has

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
the president makes the mistake

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
of saying

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
this was great 9-11 forewarning thank you

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
I want you to take my lucky

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
rabbit's foot

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
it's a presidential lucky rabbit's foot

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
the guy didn't think anything of it

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
and when he traveled

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
back to the present

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
he ran into his ex-girlfriend

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
who he hates but

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
but

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
who he loves and

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
he gives it to her

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
he goes like you know what here take this

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
she's like I'm gonna go study

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
overseas and he's like

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
take this and she's like why he's like

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
someone gave me

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
so then he goes home

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
and it's like oh 9-11 happened just like

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
regular and he's like what it must have been

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
an inside job because I said that rabbit's foot

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I got to get that rabbit's foot

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
but my ex-girlfriend has it and I hate her

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
and she's overseas

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I need another Michael Cain

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
scene at this point

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I told you the rules to this thing

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
can't go back

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
can't go back once

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
come on I need it

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
oh yeah stop wait

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
oh

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
oh

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
so yes

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
no yeah

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
yeah

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
is Robert Downey Jr playing himself

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
uh yeah

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
yes that's why he didn't

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
need to get a tour or anything like he just

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
walked up the White House steps

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
was that rdj down there

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
that's that was my president

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
speaking of it somebody requested your

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Obama if you want to

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I'll do the we'll do the scene

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
where I'm Robert Downey Jr

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Obama wasn't president during that one

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
yeah

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
that wouldn't work

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
well he finds Obama

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
in a cafe

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
who's going over his presidential

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
nomination forms

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
uh and uh yeah

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Mr. President

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I mean uh

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Barack

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
jump in the gun there a little bit aren't you

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
look

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
if I sit down my name is

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Robert Downey Jr

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
uh well it's a free country

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
uh and uh

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
quite frankly I'm not going to pretend that I don't know

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
who you are

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I'm going to sit

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
on the chair

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
by turning it around and straddling it

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
just to add some energy

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
here's the deal

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
9-11 is going to happen

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
the date

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
or is there some new ban

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
that I'm not familiar with

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
there's going to be some planes

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
and they're going to

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
3-11 is bad enough

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
it's

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
on 9-11

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
it all happens on 9-11

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
what I've got to do is get

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
to my people

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
and we've got to

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
come up with a policy for this

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
and there are proper channels

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
for making this happen

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
just as long as you stop 9-11

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
that's all I care about

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
I'll see you later

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
well you sure you don't want to

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
oh alright

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I mean I had a couple of these

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Danishes and certainly I can only get through

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
half of them

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
but there it goes

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
just stop 9-11

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
president

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I got 5 minutes left

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
in 1999

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
maybe I should go

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
you know what I don't know if you like steak

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
oh

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
but while you're here there's a 5 minute steak place

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
that's around the corner

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
alright well I'll probably get to make

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
watch them make it

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
but then I gotta go

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
doggie bag

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
is the steak better

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
in 1999 than it ever will be

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
it'd be 10 years old

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
be a seared Kobe beef

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
a mix of green peppers

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
and black peppers

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
when do people start fucking

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I somehow lost my

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
hashtag search

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
alright

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
based on Dan's Michael Cain impression

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
campaign to get him into

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
the trip 3

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
I don't know what that means

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I don't like pop cultural references

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
they both do very funny Michael Cain

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
impressions in that

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
it's very good

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
the end

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
please fix the red cup

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
in the ice bucket my OCD can't take it

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I mean OCD doesn't

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
mean you can't handle things

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
being at an angle

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
there's no proper way

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
for a cup to be

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
don't blame that on OCD

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
you crazy person

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
I was going to tweet

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
asking if there's spare vodka

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
but my phone ran out of battery

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
oh yeah

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
help yourself

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
no no help yourself

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I just don't want to dig in the ice with my hand

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I'm what?

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
your manners sir

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
no I

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I'm trying not to

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I don't want to touch your ice

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
with manners if you think about it

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
alright

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
are you two good friends

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
have you known each other for a long time?

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
where'd you guys grow up?

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Tucson?

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
oh yeah

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
yeah but we're like

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
the friends that hate each other too

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
why's that?

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
she's really funny

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
she's so funny

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I know

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
but I

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
really don't you have that though everybody has that friend

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
that they really love but they also kind of hate sometimes

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
like a frenemy?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
no

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
maybe if you go in a staycation

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
together

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
on

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
on vanilla day

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Levi wants to know how does Jerry McSeinfeld

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
feel about the potato shortage

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
ahem

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
how come it's got to be a potato shortage?

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
why can't it be a tall edge?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
alright

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
thank you

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
thank you

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
thank Jeff for Teen Wolf

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
okay

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
that's my best work

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
this guy says I have bone conduction speakers

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
you can try

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
fourth row

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
really?

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
wow we've got the skull speakers

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
bring him to Jeff

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
let Jeff try them

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
what kind of bone?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
what goes on here?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
it's a google glass

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
right?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and then put it on

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
wow

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
tap the side and go to a

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
video of Dan rapping or something

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
right now he just turned it off

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
now it's on

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
tap it again

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
okay glass, record video

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
this is wild

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.600
It's doing whatever you pull it to.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.120
OK, so it's recording a video.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.240
So if I talk real loud right now, and then it'll do 10 seconds,

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.600
and then it'll stop.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.960
And then if you replay the video, then it'll come out.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.320
A speaker here on the side.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.480
OK, that's 10 seconds.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:51.960
All right.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.000
Oh, I heard that.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.440
So now, tap it.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.960
Yeah, tap it to hit play, and it'll say play video.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.320
And then it'll play video.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:00.820
Play?

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.920
Yeah, hit play.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.880
And then the way you can tell bone conduction

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.520
is when it's playing, if you push this against your skull,

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.520
it'll get louder.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.400
Or if you close your ears like this,

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.240
then it gets louder because it's making your head vibrate.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.480
Nothing's happening.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:22.240
Here, here, here we go.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.120
I don't hear a shit.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.920
I see you moving.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.840
You also might have heard these aren't that popular,

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.040
and people make them.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.480
Theoretically, that's how it works.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.400
I mean, I felt like an enormous piece, but I

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.400
don't know what I'm saying.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.480
That's a primary purpose question.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.240
What is your name?

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:39.740
Daniel.

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.280
Come on, Daniel, thank you very much.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.160
That's our tech correspondent, Daniel,

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:49.800
with the now discontinued Google Glass, which,

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.880
so when you get the Google Glass, is there like a,

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.720
is the bone conducting speakers like an option,

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.040
like a sunroof on a car?

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.000
Or a mandatory.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.500
Oh, OK.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.800
It's kind of at the side here in the middle.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.480
And it really sounds like a radio.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.120
Normal speakers, and you, so like if you're at a concert

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.320
and you're listening to it, you can plug your ears,

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.600
and you can, like if you're having a phone conversation

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.200
with someone, and then you can hear it,

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.760
even though there's loud things around you,

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.320
because it's going through your head.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.760
Interesting.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.360
The brunette to your left, the redhead or the black guy,

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:34.360
F, murder, kill, go.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:45.960
I wandered into that like a, look, I'm not allowed.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.600
I took vows that preclude me from playing

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.120
fuck, murder, kill, ever again.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.560
I'll save it for you.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.800
Just fuck.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.000
Murder and kill are the same thing, so yeah.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.800
Well, Mary, Mary, it's Mary.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.080
Oh, Mary.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.040
Probably her.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.160
You can kill me, I don't care.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.200
I don't know where to live.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.560
All right, great.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.560
It's all about the shirt.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.000
I didn't mean to make this dark.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.960
Yeah, that didn't seem like a sincere threat or anything.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.400
All right, well, let's, why don't we thank these young ladies

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.400
and get them out of here.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.400
Thank you, Angela and Laura.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:29.920
Thanks, ladies, thanks for your 50 Shades of Grey report.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.360
And they added some energy, right?

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.360
Yeah.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.360
Right.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360
Yeah.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360
All right.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:44.440
Yeah, this show isn't free fall right now, man.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.240
We should do something every 9-11.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240
All right.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240
I'm always going to notice it.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.840
So what do we do every 9-11?

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.840
Uh, what?

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.840
Make a wish.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840
Make a wish?

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.840
Make a wish?

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:05.280
If you use that wish for anything other than there to be no more 9-11s, you're an asshole,

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.280
right?

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.800
I would like you to do it every 9-11.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.240
I want you to go into some sort of weird Michael Cain scene.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:22.360
You see Michael Cain on acting, right?

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.160
Who's the comic, the Michael Cain in the love scene?

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.160
I love you.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.760
Michael, let's do it again, but a little more romantic this time.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:31.760
All right.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.400
I bloody love you.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.960
Who is that comic?

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.920
We'll find out.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.360
Is Rob Schrab in the house?

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.200
I hear his dumb laugh.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.480
He has to get prepped to shoot the Matt Barry episode.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.480
Take off the pants.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.480
What do you have to lose?

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.480
I'll tell you.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.480
I'll tell you what I have to lose.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:58.800
Uh, the, uh, the, the, the secret of my skit mark is what I, uh, I, I am, I'm, I'm pretty

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.640
certain that, uh, that it'll be, yeah, gross if I take off my pants.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.640
What sort of underwear do you wear?

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640
You're like, you a tidy whitey guy?

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640
What do you got?

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.720
Uh, I think boxers, what do you wear?

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720
I can't remember.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.320
Like they're like box, they're like, they're like boxer briefs.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320
Boxer briefs.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:20.680
You can't remember the underwear you wear because I put them on like, you know, each pair is

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.680
like three weeks.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:33.360
So, you know, I can't, then I just throw them in the garbage and buy a new pack.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.280
They're so different.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.400
What does the Latin on the Harmontown seem to, I mean, uh, I think it means, uh, we,

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.680
uh, we, we, we found a city without tyranny.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.120
We write in Latin without understanding.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:56.200
Uh, you're welcome.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.080
Uh, Caesar back there.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.080
Uh, Jeff, Jeff Rapp, please.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.080
NBA rap.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.080
NBA rap.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.080
Yeah.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.080
You don't like the NBA?

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.560
Are you, are you racist, bro?

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560
I used to like the NBA.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560
I grew up as a Laker fan, man.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560
It was awesome.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560
Back in the days.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.560
Do an NBA rap.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:23.080
Uh, Lakers, Lakers going down the court, wearing aphoros and shorts that are short.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:28.160
Oh, I've got skills.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.240
This guy, Aaron Nelson says he needs to write a 9-11 song for us to play and sing along

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.240
to at 9-11.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.240
That would be a good thing.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.240
Okay.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.240
Every 9-11.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.240
But you know, don't make it.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.240
Well, I don't know.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.240
I'm not going to say don't make it, whatever.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.160
I mean, it'll, it'll, it'll be perceived as offensive if that's how you want to perceive

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160
it.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:52.600
But I think we should, it'll be a solemn moment, 9-11, obviously it refers to a national tragedy.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.960
And then we'll do something with that moment to this guy's music, maybe.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.560
We'll try that.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.920
And I guessed Dungeon Master.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920
Are you here?

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.920
This person that asked this?

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920
Yeah.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.920
How would you do that?

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.920
Improbable.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:12.560
Let me, look, we're going to put a pin in that.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:19.080
In the realm of ideas of that quality, this person says, bring Adam Goldberg up.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.560
I don't think there's any way he could be here, right?

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.960
He, he, he, he, he, he'll materialize.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:26.440
This would have been a, it's like, it's like Candyman.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.040
But, historically, he, he, he's made his presence known already if he's here, right?

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040
Yeah.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.000
Oh, give something away at 9-11, this person suggests.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
That's a good idea.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Okay.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Can't, nobody.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
We auction him off at 9-11.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.440
Play, on the other side of the spectrum, this person's saying, play Jenga at 9-11.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.440
That's, yeah.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.440
Yeah.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.440
Yeah.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.440
Bad person.

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.440
You're a bad person.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.440
You hear that?

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:59.440
That's what you do to people when you think?

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:11.440
Uh, I just tuned in what the hell is going on.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.440
What was, what was the last movie you saw?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440
Uh...

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.080
Didn't you say Monuments Men?

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.640
Well, I tried to watch it Nightcrawler.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.640
I kept falling asleep.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.840
I, I, I was really into it, but I just, very sleepy.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.760
I really want to finish watching Nightcrawler, but I keep, I, I keep falling asleep.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.760
Nightcrawler's awesome.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.760
You ever gonna write a movie?

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.760
We've talked about this before.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.760
Yeah.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:37.160
I gotta, I just gotta, I just gotta write a bad enough season of community, that they

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:44.000
stop making me do more, uh, and then I'm gonna write on those movies.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.640
I think you should write your 9-11 movie.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.000
Wait, what is it, Dan Harmon Potato Shortage is now showing up as a trending hashtag next

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.360
to Chevy Chase?

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.360
Not really.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360
Oh, just in Chicago.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.360
That makes sense.

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:59.360
It's an improvised podcast.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:06.600
Yeah, Chevy did the, uh, SNL thing tonight.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600
He made an appearance.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600
I saw that on Twitter.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:14.840
And so did Eddie Murphy, who long has not appeared near SNL.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.840
Wasn't he kind of banned from it or something like that?

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:22.000
I think it was more like, wasn't he more, was he banned or was he like the other way around?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Like he wouldn't go.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I don't know.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Who knows.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
All right.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Well, okay.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.120
That was Twitter interaction.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120
Kind of hot, huh?

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.600
I mean, it kind of works.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:43.480
Like imagine if, imagine if I didn't have to look at my phone, that applause was so sad.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:49.040
I think that if we had like a little monitor down there, and then we could see it, or you

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.040
could curate it.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.040
You're the comptroller.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.040
Right.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.040
Alright.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:10:01.280
It is hot up here, so I might as well just, I just feel, I mean, it's like somebody tweeted

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280
a picture.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:08.280
I know what I look like.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:16.520
Everyone I love that married this, she has to, she has to look at this tonight.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:26.280
After watching Fifty Shades of Grey, you better buy a lot of pizza.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.280
Alright.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.680
Have you ever done any bondage, sadal masticism stuff?

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.800
Do you guys ever do like kinky shit?

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.800
You guys mean Aaron?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.800
Yeah.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.720
Or previous gals, or?

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.320
When I was younger, because I thought you had to try everything, I tried all the, you

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:52.440
know, I tried a little bit of tying somebody, you know, down, I'm like, okay, now you're

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.440
tied down.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:11:02.240
I mean, it kind of felt like you were obligated to stay here before that, you know, like social

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:08.400
anxiety is more, more pressing to me than like my dad's neckties.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.920
Were you ever tied up?

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.400
Did you ever get tied down?

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.400
I think, well, I think we took turns this, I was like young enough that I was like, well,

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.400
let's do that.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:23.640
And then I also like, I went by, oh, let's get the food, let's do the food, so the dumbest.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.000
You see people in the movies with the food, with the whipped cream and the, it's just

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.800
like, oh, this is sticky and gross.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.960
And now it's more like hot dairy products, that's gross.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.680
Sex is pretty dumb.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:48.280
I mean, the people that enjoy it, like, they don't stop doing it, they like have to keep

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:54.920
doing it, which is a good sign that it's dumb, right?

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.960
Like it's not, it's not like they can do it for like, and then, oh, hey, Marissa, I didn't

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.560
know you were in town.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:09.760
It's the strangest show.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:19.200
That's Marissa, she does the, she hosts, has created the Having Changed Tumblr blog, which

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:25.000
has been up since the start of this podcast, really, right?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.280
Because I made some comment about how there's no Tumblr blogs about me, and then you made

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.280
one.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:38.640
So she's been in our corner ever since, she was at our wedding.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.120
So what other kind of food did you guys do?

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120
Do you whip the whipped cream?

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.120
What else?

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.960
I have whipped cream and chocolate sauce or some shit.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:49.200
I just remember whipped cream, I'm like, I think maybe honey, I can't remember.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:56.000
Only thing I remember is it being, just dumb, just being, it's like sex, you know, sex is

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:11.200
something that you do with someone you love because, you know, the alternative is masturbating,

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:19.200
which is an exclusive act, an exclusionary, it's a bad message to send.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:37.000
So you invite the other person in, let's do this together.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:56.520
And every once in a while, a new life is created by this act.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:09.480
That person germinates in the uterus, is extracted from it, placed on a stainless steel scale,

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:28.080
even a barcode, sent home after several vaccinations, which, oh, and then 18 years later goes to

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:34.200
work at Verizon.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:45.200
And so does she, oh, that's special someone, and then they go, and then Verizon keeps growing.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:56.080
It's a great species, it's really fun, I'm sure 50 shades of gray really put the magic

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.080
back in it.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.680
Did you ever, like, dress up or do any, like, costumes or something like that?

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.680
Dress up?

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:10.880
Well, I mean, yeah, I guess, well, not like a panda or anything, I don't know, I'm 42

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:16.040
years old, I've tried everything once.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:28.000
Somebody's bone conductor's turned off, yeah, I've tried everything once, yeah, yeah, once.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Gang bang?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Not scapula, no, no, no.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.080
I didn't, I haven't done pee and poop and, yeah, the pee and the poo and the blood thing

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.160
is not for me, I don't need any of that in my life.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.320
I mean, I haven't tried everything, everything, yeah, that's silly for me to say, I've tried

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.360
everything like a normal person, like, like, like, consider, like, like, like, this is

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:53.840
like three things, like, it's like 900 things I haven't tried, I haven't put a toe in my

01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.920
butt, that's the, it's like, and you could do all 10 toes and that's 10 things I haven't

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.920
done.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.920
You put a Schrab. up your butt?

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.920
Mm-hmm.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.920
Mm-hmm.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.920
Yeah, I did.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.360
Mass, the mask work?

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:18.640
How are we, how are we gonna, how are we gonna get through tonight?

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.680
How are we gonna do, how are we gonna do a show?

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.680
Are we warmed up yet?

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.200
I'm warm, I'm shaking, I'm stopped.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:35.560
Oh, that's my post supervisor, he's canceling the, canceling post tomorrow, he's probably

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:44.560
figured out I'm not gonna be editing, yeah, yeah, I'll have to be writing, thank you.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:17:02.400
Sorry, I'm on the stage, okay, there we go, post super, podcast gold, do you guys have

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:09.360
any Minecraft questions?

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360
What mod am I running?

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:16.320
I'm running a mod pack called Feed the Beast Infinity, it's available at FeedtheBeast.com,

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:25.560
it's called the Infinity Mod Pack, it's brand new, it's for 1.7 and it's very stable and

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:29.760
it has applied EnerGistix 2 in it, which I've been looking forward to for a while and just

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:34.400
gotten on my feet with that and I'm having a real good time.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.200
It's a very balanced mod pack, very balanced, previous mod packs have done strange things,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:43.720
experimental things like magical crops added, now you can grow everything, you don't even

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.120
have to do anything else, this is a good mod pack.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.560
How many hours do you spend playing that, what's the longest you've disappeared?

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:59.120
I don't know, well I can't these days, maybe on the weekend, I'll just sit as long as my

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:08.040
body will let me, if it's not Valentine's Day and it's a weekend and I don't have something

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:17.680
to write, I will get up and I'll grab the laptop and be like, her, minecraft, ha ha ha.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:26.480
Alright, let's figure something out.

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.480
Do you have any music on there that's like, not rap, like, I branch out?

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:39.480
Yeah, let's try, let's go over and do this.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:19:01.480
When you move your body to the beat, when you see everybody in the street, you got the

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:11.360
action, I got the water, we'll put them both in a cup with our daughter, family, family

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:19.520
on the street, with a bucket and a cup, doing everything, what's up, family, family on the

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:26.200
street tonight, with a bucket and a cup, what's up, bucket, bucket, yo, yo, yo, my name is MC

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.000
John, I'm here to mow the lawn.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.240
I'd like to use a rake, but that grass will not take, I've got to get up on the riding

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.240
mower.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:41.120
So faster, don't go slower, mow around the trees and yard, I've fucked your mama hard.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:55.200
I want to see you next Thursday night, I don't want to get into a fight, don't get in a fight

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.200
baby.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:09.480
Cause you are my family and I love you, so you want, I won't steal your socks or your

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:22.600
shoes, family, cause you got what I need, family.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:35.920
It's good, that was a good one, that was a good song, I like the fascinating character

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:47.200
of DJ, DJ John, I'm here to mow the lawn, DJ John was, DJ John was a refreshing departure

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:53.320
from the, from the profane evolution of rap, he was back to like a traditional like peas

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:59.840
and carrots kind of rap, but he, right at the end, he let you know, he's fucking your

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:06.280
mom, which makes sense because he, listening to him, I don't think he knew that much about

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:11.920
lawn care, he was, he wanted to use a rake.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:18.920
That's a MacGuffin.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:26.920
Who, who, who wrote some of this music, do we have to give credit to these people?

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.920
That is by Kevin MacLeod.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:28.920
Remember Kevin, if you call my name.

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.920
Are you Highlander Reference?

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:30.920
Yes.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:31.920
Yes.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.920
Kevin MacLeod.

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:39.520
Don't forget Kevin, we're from an alien planet.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520
What?

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:47.480
Highlander 2, fucked up, fucked up sequel.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.840
They reveal at the beginning of Highlander 2 that all of the things that happened in

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:58.160
Highlander 1 were in a different framework, they were aliens, they just, they just forgot

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:04.120
that they were aliens, and then they remember, and then the Sean Connery says, remember also

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:08.080
don't forget that you, if you call my name, I'll come back to life.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.600
So he does, and the Sean Connery comes back to life, but Sean Connery spends the entire

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.600
movie buying clothes.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:27.600
All right, what other songs do you get in there?

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:41.600
It's only 23 seconds, it has to be short.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.600
All right, here we go, from the top, from the top.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:50.600
I got a beer, boots, and a pair of socks going to, wait, hold on, sorry, sorry, I can do

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.600
it, I can do it, I can do it.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.520
I got corn syrup on my hat, I'm going out, how about that, going to grab some corn,

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:07.520
going to grab some hay, fuck your mama, I'll live a long day, I've got a banjo on my knee.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:15.520
All right, thank you, thank you, thank you, thanks, thanks.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:25.520
Oh yeah, yeah, about time, it's about time, it's about that time.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.520
Wait, what time is it?

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:38.520
It's about that time, I have a slow watch, I want to know what time it is.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.520
Could you tell me what time it is?

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:49.520
I got an appointment coming up tomorrow.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:57.520
We've been having a sweet old time, but I got to know what time it is.

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.520
Timekeeper, timekeeper, it's like a Swiss clock tonight.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:08.520
We've been hoeing low long day to the break of the dong dong.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.520
What'd you say?

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:13.520
Don't fuck with me.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.520
I'm just trying to know what you're saying.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:24.520
So I'm not even trying to play, I just got to know what time it is.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:29.520
See, that's gibberish.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:37.520
I don't know why I work with you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:42.520
Why are you all fighting?

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:48.520
Oh shit, it's my mom.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:54.520
Why are you all down here fighting, sitting in my basement all night?

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.520
What time is it?

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:59.520
That's what I'm asking.

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:05.520
I set the grandfather clock on the wall, I'm not getting any sleep at all.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.520
Your father and I got work in the morning.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.520
That's cheating.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.520
Can't you speak gibberish, man?

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:29.520
Ah shit, I'm going to bed.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.520
Baby, what was that?

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.520
Those kids down in the basement.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.520
Why they always going to be like that?

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.520
Why they're always waking up like that?

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.520
Don't these motherfuckers get any sleep?

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.520
I don't know baby, what time you keep?

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:51.520
Quarter to three.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:26:08.520
The dad knew what time it was, the whole time.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.520
Thanks guys, thanks.

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:17.520
That was really nice, I was kind of hoping DJ John made an appearance about it.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:25.520
This is like a whole Sesame Street of characters you've got going on.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.520
I think we should explore that town a little bit more.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:36.520
I'd like to know everybody that lives in that building, the whole block.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:50.520
Alright, well, what else you got?

01:26:50.520 --> 01:27:01.520
None of them knew what time it was.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.520
Are they brothers or are they best friends?

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:10.520
They're in the basement and the mom was coming down and then she went back up to her husband.

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:18.520
I think there was something going on between the mom and the friend.

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:35.520
Wow.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.520
Vincent Press?

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:46.520
In the age of innocence, there is a prophecy that one will come.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:56.520
Who will change the innocence to guilt.

01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:06.520
The keepers of this prophecy are called the Starwalkers.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:27.520
Reclusive by nature, they keep to a hallowed hall atop the trees of Wisconsin.

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:36.520
We join them now at breakfast.

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:41.520
Do you want more eggs?

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.520
Starwalker.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.520
I have not satiated my taste for eggs.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.520
I would like another egg.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.520
I will make you one more egg.

01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:01.520
The time keepers walk skywalkers, sir.

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.520
What were they called?

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:09.520
Starwalkers.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:16.520
Sea eggs is the center of all power.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.520
Here is yours.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.520
I scrambled it.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.520
I tried to make it sunny side up.

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.520
Then it became scrambled.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:31.520
I put my hand to it and draw from it its essence with my mind.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:38.520
Since the beginning of time, the sky guardians, what were they called?

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:44.520
Starwalkers.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:57.520
They derived their nutrition manually, preferring to save the mouth for verbal communication.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:03.520
What say you of the prophecy?

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.520
There will be three leaves in this tree.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.520
All three will fall.

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:15.520
One will land.

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.520
Father.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.520
You are up early.

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:34.520
There is a man on the lawn.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:39.520
He's got a rake.

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:45.520
He just seems to be fiddling around out there.

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:47.520
Be calm, my young one.

01:30:47.520 --> 01:31:03.520
I will see what this is about.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:07.520
You there.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:13.520
You are tending the lawn?

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.520
Yes.

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:23.520
My name is John.

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.520
John.

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:38.520
I prefer a rake if that's what it take.

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:49.520
But I mow the grass like your mama ass.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:53.520
Your mama's ass.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.520
My name is John.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.520
Momfucker.

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:12.520
I'm here to say, I fucked so many moms today.

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:19.520
I fucked them in the east.

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:23.520
I fucked them in the south.

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.520
Three hours later.

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:35.520
In the mouth.

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:40.520
I have never heard of this practice.

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:43.520
I am a star.

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:47.520
Walker.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.520
I'm coming up.

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.520
You're not supposed to.

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:54.520
I'm coming up.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.520
Get off the ladder.

01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:16.520
Give me the bucket of lava.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:24.520
He's not slowing down.

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.520
He's a skeleton.

01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:34.520
He's a flaming skeleton.

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:40.520
My name is John.

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:45.520
Run, run to the panic room.

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.520
Does it work?

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.520
Did they fix it?

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:53.520
Get in the panic room.

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.520
Jesus.

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:58.520
This is a difficult sort.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.520
And you said, no panic room.

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:06.520
You said, let's go to Cancun.

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.520
Turn that money into fun, you said.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.520
One person in this tree top thinks about our safety.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:18.520
The prophecy said three leaves would fall.

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:27.520
We three should jump and leave him here.

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.520
Okay.

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.520
I fear only one of us will make it.

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:38.520
And so it is I take this time to say goodbye.

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:43.520
Going out the window of the panic room.

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:46.520
The ill advised window.

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.520
The panic room window.

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.520
I wanted to see.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.520
You guys don't even lock that window.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.520
It defeats the whole point of having a panic room.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.520
Father, it's me.

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.520
Don't be alarmed.

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.520
The panic room needs sunlight, you said.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.520
Fine.

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.520
Great.

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.520
All right.

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:12.520
So the three of us jump.

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.520
Right.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.520
It is said in the Skywalker tradition.

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:20.520
Sky, sky, Skywalker.

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.520
That one need not fear death.

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.520
For death is only the beginning.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:34.520
But that day, as my toes perched on the wooden sill of my panic room window.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:40.520
Arms outstretched like a bold but fearful crane.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.520
I tasted what God must have felt the day he gave us life.

01:35:45.520 --> 01:36:11.520
The fear that it was all for nothing.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.520
Well, my name is John.

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.520
I was a skeleton all along.

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.520
I wanted to take over the house.

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.520
Now I got it all to myself.

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.520
I got a rake over here and a shovel over there.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.520
I can do long care all day.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.520
I don't even have to rhyme anymore.

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.520
I'm just big bad John and I got my own home.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.520
I'm going to sit down on the couch.

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.520
Going to make myself at home.

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.520
I'm a burnt skeleton because they poured lava on me.

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.520
This is what I deserve.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.520
My name is John.

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.520
My name is John.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.520
I'm walking all this long day.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.520
Hop, hop, to the hip, to the hop, hop.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.520
Hippity hop, hop, hip, hop.

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.520
My name is John.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.520
I do your lawn, but I don't take no shit today.

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.520
Hip hop to the hebbity hop.

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.520
I said the hop, hop, bippity hop.

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.520
Hop, hop, hop.

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.520
Did you ever see a White House with a president in it?

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.520
Fuck that, motherfucker.

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.520
I'll fuck the government.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.520
Fucking government.

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:09.520
My name is John.

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.520
Big bad John all day long.

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.520
Take care of your lawn, ding dong, ding dong.

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.520
I take your daisies down

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.520
to a regular town

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.520
and I sell them at the bazaar.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:21.520
I drive back in my car.

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.520
It's powered by the sun.

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.520
Green energy.

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.520
Fuck the president.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.520
My name is John.

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:39.520
Oh.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:49.520
Oh.

01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:59.520
Father, are you okay?

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.520
Oh, no.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.520
My back is broken.

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.520
Would you perhaps like some eggs?

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.520
Oh.

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:09.520
How am I the only one that got hurt?

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.520
I walked down.

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.520
There's a, what?

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.520
There's a stairs?

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.520
John was just on the couch rapping.

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.520
He didn't even see me.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.520
He was just getting really irritable

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.520
about the government.

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.520
Father, I'll go to the medicine tree.

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.520
Did any of you ever think

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.520
that we've done all we've done

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.520
for nothing?

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:43.520
Yes.

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.520
But

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.520
one must

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.520
understand that it is all

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.520
a process of becoming

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.520
and whether you are in the panic

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.520
window, panicking

01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.520
whether you are in the air

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.520
flying and dying and landing

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.520
and whether you're the clever

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.520
son

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.520
cascading down a flight of stairs

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.520
made more stable by lava

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.520
that has now ceased to be lava

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.520
and is

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.520
merely

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.520
igneous.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.520
Father, father, father.

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:21.520
Uncle Rico, sorry to interrupt.

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.520
I'm getting a reading on the radar.

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.520
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.520
coming inbound.

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.520
It takes the elder.

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.520
Shhh!

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.520
How the mighty have fallen!

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.520
Expecting to see an elder?

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.520
It's me.

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.520
Tom Young.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.520
Tude fat from living in your trees?

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.520
Living your dreams?

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.520
Did a rat bring

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.520
lawn man make you fall?

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.520
I told you

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.520
there was war in this universe and you

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.520
refused to heed my call.

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.520
Now you lay on the floor with the rest

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.520
of the animals clutching at your broken

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.520
back waiting for medicine

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.520
trees.

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.520
The medicine has gone to the front.

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.520
Gird your lines

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.520
and join the war, a parish here!

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:27.520
Shhh!

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.520
Fuck! God damn it!

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.520
Shhh!

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:33.520
Shhh!

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.520
That was...

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.520
maybe just a cameo, I guess.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.520
Is he coming back, father?

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.520
Whoa!

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.520
Well, what have we here?

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:51.520
The elders

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:53.520
struck down like animals from the

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:55.520
pride atop the treetops.

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.520
Ha ha ha ha!

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.520
Wasn't so long ago you refused us food

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.520
and weapons for our war.

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:03.520
Ha ha ha!

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.520
Jesus Christ,

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.520
everyone hated us.

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.520
Worm people.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.520
Worm people detect

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.520
elders.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:23.520
How's...

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.520
you've been stricken down

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.520
to worm level.

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:29.520
You should have helped us

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.520
with our war.

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.520
Oh, sorry.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.520
Worm people theme.

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.520
Underground

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.520
Underground

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:43.520
where the waters found

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.520
moisture

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.520
Neutrients

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.520
Neutrients.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.520
Where did they went?

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.520
Have to find those nutrients

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.520
before the rain drives us up.

01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:57.520
You're looking for notes on my keys.

01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.520
My mucous membrane

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.520
protects my outer shell.

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:03.520
I wriggle around.

01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:05.520
I do very well.

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.520
I am a worm.

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.520
And my worm culture

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:11.520
will prevail.

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.520
Ha ha ha ha!

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.520
Ha ha ha ha!

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.520
To talk.

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.520
I'm a worm rapper.

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.520
I'm a rapper.

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.520
Wrapping worm.

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.520
Watch me squirm.

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.520
Stop.

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:29.520
What did I tell you?

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.520
Stop.

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:33.520
Bad rapper.

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:35.520
Go practice.

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.520
Sun comes up.

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:39.520
Moon goes down.

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.520
Worms around.

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.520
We are everywhere.

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:45.520
Our worm culture will prevail.

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:47.520
Move through the dirt.

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.520
Rumors I heard.

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:51.520
Worm armies.

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.520
Must mount for our defense.

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.520
Worm swords.

01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.520
Worm shields.

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.520
Worm horses. Never yield.

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:03.520
These worm colors never run.

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:09.520
Mucous in the sun.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:15.520
I will never fail my wormy queen.

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:19.520
Until she kisses with this machine.

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.520
My name is little worm Tony.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.520
I will...

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:25.520
No, get out!

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.520
Worm people.

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.520
Worm people.

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:35.520
Worm people.

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:37.520
Dwelling in the dirt that we make up.

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:41.520
Did you know that 90% of the dirt worms live in

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.520
is made up of dead worms?

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.520
Yes, I did.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:49.520
This may sound gross to you.

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:51.520
Above the soil line.

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.520
But down here.

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.520
That shit do me fine.

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:59.520
Worm people out.

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:03.520
Jesus.

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:05.520
Fuck.

01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:11.520
This is a terrible, terrible opera.

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:15.520
Are these characters going to come back or...

01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:21.520
Father, I feel like the Starwalkers used to be a proud culture,

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:23.520
but it seems like everybody kind of hates our guts.

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.520
We've let a lot of people down.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.520
Wisdom brings its labor.

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.520
There is a small place in the world for ponderous people

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.520
who look at eggs.

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:39.520
Muse about the future.

01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.520
Father, I'm getting another reading.

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:47.520
I think it's that asshole Tom Young's coming back.

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:53.520
He's got two Russians with him.

01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:01.520
It's me, Tom Young.

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:03.520
And here's my Russian friend.

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:07.520
Hello.

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:11.520
Is this what you wanted?

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.520
I'm not trying...

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:15.520
I don't want to be difficult, but...

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.520
I don't...

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.520
What was the idea?

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:21.520
It was a callback to the potato guys.

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:27.520
Throw a road flare in the gas tank.

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.520
Shit. Run.

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:33.520
My back. I'm dying.

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.520
I died.

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:37.520
Oh, Jesus.

01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.520
It's Jesus of the Elders.

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:41.520
Get out.

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:43.520
Tree hell.

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:45.520
Whoa, the gasoline.

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:47.520
It's filled with gas. Run.

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:49.520
Shit. Run.

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.520
Jump off the edge of the earth.

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.520
We're becoming a singularity.

01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.520
We're in another zone.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.520
Oh, shit. It's the devil.

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.520
Ow.

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:07.520
Oh, he's shitting on us.

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.520
I'm drowning in his shit.

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:13.520
Ow!

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.520
Whole universe exploded.

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.520
My name is John.

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.520
That's to happen from the president.

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.520
Fuck the president.

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.520
My name is John.

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.520
I mow your lawn.

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.520
I'd like to do a whip

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.520
with all your lawn.

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.520
I'd like to do it with a rake.

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.520
But that's all I can take.

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.520
My name is John. I'm on your lawn.

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.520
Hip hop to the hippity hop.

01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.520
Yo, did you ever see

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.520
a vampire quite like me?

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.520
Oh, shit. It's a Dracula.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.520
Hippity hop.

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.520
Oh, shit. Vampire back.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.520
I'm running away from that.

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.520
I'm a vampire going to bite your neck.

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.520
Oh, shit. Fuck you. My name is Beck.

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.520
Bing bong.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:17.520
Bing bong.

01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.520
What? Your name is Beck?

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.520
Father, look. It fits in price.

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.520
Oh, yes.

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.520
Spiders crawling

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:27.520
on every part

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.520
of your genitals

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.520
with little

01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:33.520
pink socks on each of their eight feet

01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:35.520
so that it feels good

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:37.520
like little

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.520
berry tongues.

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:43.520
That's not scary.

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:47.520
My name is John.

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.520
It's Halloween.

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:51.520
I'm going to the party scene.

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:53.520
Trick or treat. Trick or death.

01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.520
I fucked your mom like that.

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.520
My name is John.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:59.520
I take care of all your lawns.

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.520
I mow every grass in every city.

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:03.520
I mow your mama's kitty.

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:05.520
She enjoyed it.

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:21.520
My

01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:23.520
name is

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.520
John.

01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:27.520
But I got a secret.

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:31.520
I'm a lion.

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.520
Running through the forest.

01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.520
Gotta get past this.

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:43.520
Find my quarry.

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.520
In the quarry.

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.520
I killed a rabbit.

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.520
Take it back to the ladies.

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.520
Whoa.

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.520
Stop it.

01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:59.520
Say what?

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.520
Family! Family!

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:03.520
You have got to have

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:05.520
a family.

01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:07.520
Don't you get bit by a bat?

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:09.520
I turned it to a lion like that.

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:11.520
That was a cautionary tale.

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:13.520
John fell.

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.520
You shouldn't be him like him.

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:17.520
Thanks for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.520
DeMorge Brown.

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:23.520
John is here!

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:27.520
I Alexand Nacht turbo!

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.520
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:31.520
Paul is here!

01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:33.520
This is a man I've never met before.

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:35.520
It was the warehouse idea.

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.520
größ banner name.

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:41.520
In my mind.

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:43.520
Their family.

01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:45.520
This was the cool idea.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:49.520
My name is Hippity John, I got a Jim, John, Jimity, John, a jip hop.

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.520
I like to use a rake, a shovel, if that's what it takes.

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.520
But I prefer to use a lawn mower.

01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.520
I fucked your mom's show and not a girl.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:59.520
Well, I'm a big John and I'm on your lawn.

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.520
I got to blow, blow, blow, don't own a log.

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:03.520
I got a hip, hop, hippity hop.

01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:05.520
Another hip, hop, hip, hip, hop.

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:07.520
I need hip, hop, hop, hip, hip, hop.

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:09.520
I need hip, hop, hop, hop, hop.

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.520

I got a hip, hop, never stop.

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.520
My name is John.

01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:14.520
Good night, everybody.

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:16.520
Hip, hop, run it all day long.

01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:18.520
All day long, sing my song.

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.520
I got a hip, hop, hipity, hop.

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.520
I got a hip, hip, hop, got a hipity, hop.

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.520
My name is backer John.

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.520
I'm on your fucking lawn.

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.520
I got a hip, hop, bowing the lawn.

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:30.520
Everybody gonna sing my song.

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.520
Hip, hop, hipity, hop.

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.520
Everybody eat some dipping dots.

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.520
Happy birthday, Zach.

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:37.520
Happy birthday.

01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.520
Hip, hop, go to hip, hip, hop.

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:40.520
Oh.

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:43.520
Did you get any of that?

01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:45.520
It's a good show.
