WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
From Hollywood, California, NerdMelt Studios, Harmontown is now in session.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
I am your guest comptroller, Spencer Crittenden.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Thank you, thank you. You're too kind, that's very kind.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
But please give it up to the person you're really here to see.

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
The mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Guest Comptroller, Spencer Crittenden everybody.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Yeah man.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
It's a bare bones show tonight.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah, I was, it's fucking hot man.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
I was gonna, you know, the thing about controlling that people don't know is you gotta wear a suit to do it.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
We have a lot of guests and they don't get that memo or whatever, but you gotta wear a suit

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
and I would have worn one but I would have been sweating a motherfucker.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
No, you don't have to.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
No, you gotta wear, let me, let me make this real clear.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
You gotta wear a suit to be the Comptroller.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
Like I wrote five minutes of material about the suit I was planning to wear, you know.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Did you actually put it on and then go, I'm taking this off?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
No, I mean I was running around finding an air conditioner all day

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
and then I had to clean up my area to put an air conditioner into place

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
and then by then I was sweating so hard I was like, I can't even put on a suit man.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
But I still have all this great material, you know, like,

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
oh yeah, 201st episode Harmon, thanks for dressing up, you know.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Like, it would have made sense if I was wearing a suit, that's the thing.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
A lot of his stuff was in this pre-suit.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, I wrote down, by the way, for those of you who are new here,

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm not being aloof when I'm looking, I'm not texting, I'm looking, these are my notes.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
It's 201, so I kind of, we were talking about the concept of the prestige

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
of the video game, which I've only learned through incremental clickers.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
My favorite game currently is Cookie Collector 2.

02:25.000 --> 02:34.000
You can laugh all you want, but the truth is all of you are just collecting cookies in real life.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
And now Cookie Collector...

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Don't mock me.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
The second one really improves on a lot of shortfalls in the first one, right?

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Make all the obvious Cookie Collector 2 addict jokes you want.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
There's a million of them that are immediately present.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I mean, every dot is within one inch of every other dot.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
You know what's creative?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
You know what's ironic?

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Brave, heroic, saying, I play Cookie Collector 2 and spitting on you.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Sorry, sorry.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Say, frothing at the mouth about, did it again.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Just for the people at home, for the listeners at home,

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
prestigeing is when you roll over your levels to start over in a better way.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
You're kind of reborn, you're reborning yourself.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Is that a word?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Reborning?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
You're prestigeing, you're starting over.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
That's what we're doing.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
It's not that 200 will definitely be the...

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Because the Jason Bourne movie is coming out, you know, the next one.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Isn't this one just called, like, Jason Bourne for real?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Reborn Legacy.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah, but they had to go through all the Bourne dichotomy, the Bourne eulogy,

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
the Bourne octology.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
But now it's like Matt Damon's back, so it's like, the Bourne.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Because one of them was just like Jeremy Renner, it was like, the Bourne brother.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Bourne, Bournman.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Bournman apprenticeship.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I'd like to be a Bourne, please.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh, Stewie.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
No, I'm gonna be the best Bourne ever.

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
But you can't even know how many exits are in a room.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
You can't even, like, placidly, like, lock eyes with a beautiful international diplomat

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
and explain to her that you're so powerful, you don't know why you could kick so much ass.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
You can't do that, but I can try.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
You know, Bournman.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm a little high.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
It's not, I promise you, you're getting your money's worth.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
But so the...

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
But we're prestigeing.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
I mean, this is a real unprecedented moment in podcasting history.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Like, there's plenty of podcasts that have had 200 episodes, but this isn't gonna be 201.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
This is gonna be Harmontown Prestige Episode 1.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Right.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
You see?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
We're prestigeing.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
We're prestigeing.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Typically in an incremental clicker, like Cookie Collector 2,

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
prestigeing means that you get to start over as if you're playing the game for the first time.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
However, you have bonuses from muffins, cupcakes.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Right.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
And then the podcast world, you get to start over and delete all of your bad iTunes reviews.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
It's all just fives.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
In Resident Evil 1 on PlayStation 1,

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
prestigeing was you finished all of Resident Evil and you get to play it again with a rocket launcher.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
I think that was like the original kind of prestige culture.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah, back when it was just New Game Plus.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
If we were prestigeing not to be mistaken with the age-old,

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
if I could improve myself, I was, be greedy, be selfish, beat the game.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Not accountable to what you think is a good person or a bad person.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
If you were gonna prestige as Spencer,

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
I guess maybe relative to the podcast, so it's relatable.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Right.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
So, the Spencer that is the character on Harmontown,

06:11.000 --> 06:19.000
if that character was gonna prestige out of selfishness, what would prestigeing involve?

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, I think my position would, I'd be promoted to like Comptroller from here on out.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
So like going forward, I'd just be the co-host, yeah.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Do you think, would Jeff move over there or would he just like, would he just vanish?

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
He'd prestige to like club promoter or something.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
Now I think Jeff is like standing in the back, like we're at Jeff's place instead of downtown.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
And Jeff, Jeff down theater. And Jeff is just like happy as a can of peaches,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
giving a thumbs up from the back.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
He's like bud Friedman.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
He tells people like not to use flash photography and stuff.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah, God, Jeff loves doing that.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Okay, so, here's the thing.

07:05.000 --> 07:12.000
So there's a new movie out that I haven't seen yet called Now You See Me Too.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
It's a sequel to a movie called Now You See Me.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Correct.

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, okay, let's go there first then, which is, by the way, your title,

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
the whole point of it is that it's the first part of a two-part thing.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
I guarantee you nobody that wrote that movie, let alone that title,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
thought they were ever gonna be doing a sequel.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Can you imagine the guy coming and going, knock, knock.

07:43.000 --> 07:52.000
So apparently there's no sarcasm checkbox on Apple TV and your movies I hit.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
So now they want a second one and there's like nine people

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
because how could that movie be written by fewer people?

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Have you seen that fucking movie?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I'm not angry, I'm excited.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I just watched it with Cody.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I was so excited that she hadn't seen it.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
I was walking in Canada.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Think about it.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
And I walked by the movie theater and on the marquee I saw the words,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Now You See Me Too.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
That was the number two.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
I swear to God I'm not being David Spade about this.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
My actual fucking first instinct was,

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh, that explains so much about that movie.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
It's Canadian.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
And they show it here still every day.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
And the next showing is at two.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
I swear to Christ above that was what I thought

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
because I expected a sequel to that movie was that impossible.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Both in terms of demand and supply.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't care who wants a sequel.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
If I made that movie and people wanted a sequel,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
I would have some explaining to do.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
The first thing I would explain is I didn't know what I was doing.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
And I would say, look, can we start over?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I have all kinds of ideas.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
They told me magicians were cool.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I just got here.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm talented.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
You saw what I did.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Just let me write a different movie.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I don't want to.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
I would call it now you don't.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
It would be called now you don't.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
In an honest world.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
This movie was built on dishonesty about dishonesty.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Not only is magicians never cool.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Magicians where they are cool.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
In the context in which you can trick people into thinking they're cool.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
And it's always a trick to think that they're cool.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
You'll go down there.

10:06.000 --> 10:17.000
And it's still, I forgot what I was, it's a, watch now you see me, one.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Which I rewatched last night.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
And I think, I honestly think, knock it off.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
This movie, holy fuck man.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
How many people have seen now you see me one?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Respectable.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
Well, now that you know it doesn't matter what your vote does.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Now that you know Trump's elected and the now you see me franchise into your,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
he says like you watching now you see me one won't isn't accountable.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Watch it.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
I made the mistake of being one of the dollars that apparently funded the sequel.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I didn't mean to do that.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Like they need a checkbox that says I'm kidding.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
I don't know, it's like your money's green.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
We're going to make a sequel.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
We'll go ahead but know that it's a kidding movie.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Or we were kidding when we watched the first one.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
We were kidding.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Like if you could give someone a page view or you don't give someone a page view,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
but you're checking out like a clickbait thing, that'd be great.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
You know, the best of both worlds.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Just say your intention.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
The internet's a sewer because nobody's their selves.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
If you could go into the internet and there was a lobby and you're like,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
my name's Carl Johnson.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
And then you go, I'm going to go talk about pedophilia now mask.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
And then you go through a tube and then like everyone's like,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Oh, there's a kid fucker 29.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
But it's and you're like, that's me.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I'm saying the internet structure.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
They should do that.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
You should always have to come back into the lobby and look at yourself in a virtual mirror

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
before you leave the internet.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I'm pitching AOL.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
There should be a portal and you should like have a living room and say,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
you've got mail and look at yourself.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
You jerked off to people that look like your sister-in-law.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Who invited you?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Your mail.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
What?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Just because you can talk about mail doesn't mean you're sentient.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
You've got a lot to learn.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
What?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
As long as you can say you've got before it, you can say anything.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
You've got a point.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
No.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
God damn it.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
No.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
You've got knife.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
It's stabbing me.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
That'd be great.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
So have you seen the trailer for this new now you've done it?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
No, no.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Now you've done it.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
That would be a great.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
What if they did a sequel and the sequel was they were like,

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
okay, what is it?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Now you to me.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Now you see me too.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Now you don't.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
What is it going to be?

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
But it was just like, they were like, now you pee.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
That was it.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
It was like Cloverfield Lane.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
They were just like, it's not a sequel.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Now you pee.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It's from the now you series.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
You don't think we know how to make movies?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Fucking step off.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Let the people in.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
They're trying to get into a good movie, motherfucker.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You fucking jaded piece of shit.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Fucking now you is in session.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Now you surf against a shark monster.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Hey, did you see the most recent now you movie?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Oh, now you.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah, I didn't know.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
I fucking love now you see me one.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah, I love now you diamond heist.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Did you see now you reunion?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
A wish upon a star.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I was sweet.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah, no, it was sweet.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
I loved now you didn't.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Well, there's a lawsuit pending.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Those people actually don't represent the now you franchise.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
No, but I mean that.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And they're playing the race card and it's not cool.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
The trailers problematic though, because like, yeah, you know,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
it's a wizard movie about all these wizards and sorcerers,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
you know, and they're like, you know, you got Mark Zuckerberg

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
and he like conjures a storm of cards and then you have like,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
I don't know, Morgan Freeman and he like picks a card

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
and puts it through a guy's skull and stuff.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
And then you got a guy who disappears and reappears

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
inside of a bank fall and then you got Lizzie Kaplan

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
who takes her bra off without taking off her top.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
That's the first one too.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I have a Fisher plays it.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
They go, I go like Cody, you're going to be,

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
you're going to be introduced to the five types of magician now

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
from the Chris Angel type played by Jesse Iserberg

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
to the spoon bending pick pocket car chasing type

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
played by one of the Franko's.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Then Woody Harrelson is a, he's a mentalist and that is up

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
with Isla Fisher.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
She's introduced to go like, and here comes the lady magician

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
and the writers were like, fuck, like David Copperfield.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Like he's a guy.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
She's a lady magician, but she's awesome.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Lady magician.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
I just, I often times a lady is a magician's assistant.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
Tom, giant Tom, are you sitting in the corner

15:08.000 --> 15:14.000
like talking in a slightly urban petwa?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
That's right.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Just watching you all try to figure out this story seems

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
to me magicians come with femininity.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
It's just compartmentalized in the form of their subjectifiable

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
objectifiable assistant.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Tom, he's right.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Isla Fisher should play a new kind of magician.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
She used to be Zuckerberg's assistant.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
Now she takes over clothes before dropping

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
into a tank of water.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
She's like a super assistant.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
All right.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Anyway, that's not my beef with that.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I'm not, I'm not white knighting.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
It's an insane movie.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I think you should watch this movie.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Now you watch it.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
Now you fucking, like, if you're mind blown.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
I shouldn't have, I spent too much time talking about it.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Look, there's a lot of stuff to talk about.

16:12.000 --> 16:19.000
I want to tell you about me handling myself pretty well

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
against a terrible person in a bar.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Oh, yeah.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Oh, yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
So that's a good time to bring out my friend, Dino Stamatopoulos.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Let's bring out Dino.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Oh, shit.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Hi.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
And now that Dino's here, remind me to talk about my new condom idea.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It's going to blow minds.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Why?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Why me?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Because, you know.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Because I'm a pervert.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
You're my angel investor.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
What's your condom idea, Spencer?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Okay, so think about condoms.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Now, forget everything you ever knew about condoms.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
No, okay.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
Okay, remember a couple of things about condoms.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
That's my first problem.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
I never remember condoms.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Right.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Well, this one you'll never forget.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
So, I mean, essentially a condom is a sock, you know?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Who makes your sock?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
You stuff it, you stuff it on.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
See, my first thought was, how big is your dick?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
You thought he had weird socks.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
I thought he had an enormous hinged dick.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Dicks are very important to you.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Feet are important to me, you know?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
But so, okay, right.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
It's like a sock.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
The only thing that's keeping it on is like friction and like elasticity.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Elasticity, yeah.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
So, but then to do that, it has to be shoved all the way down the leg to your shaft.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
Okay, so imagine if you will a shortened condom that's more like a head cap, right?

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
And then at the end is a rubber band that goes behind your balls.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
So most of your shaft still has that exposure.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
It's not covered.

18:11.000 --> 18:19.000
But the tension of this rubber band pulling your balls towards the front, that keeps it on.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
I love it.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
I do that anyway.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
It's fucking nothing like a nice tight set of balls.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
That's why I wanted you out here.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Boing.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah, man.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It's like a cock ring and a condom.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
I'm trying to imagine, I think my answer, my answer, I'm sure it's different for you,

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
is that depending on the excitement level of the woman and my age,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
I have a hard enough time getting this little fucker anywhere.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, but it would be Taylor made your balls.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
There's things on it.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Anything that's on it is going to fall off eventually.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
No, but it would wrap around.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Did you ever have a cock ring on?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah, exactly.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
No one's ever had a cock ring on.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I'm not saying that proudly.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I don't mean that.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I mean, I'm self-shaming.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I do not have that honor, sir.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
You should because apparently you and your girlfriend love your balls.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Well, we just found that out.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah, and this would help.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
I mean, your balls would be like fucking Dolly Parton balls with the cock ring on.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm very old.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I'm 51.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
It's like a ball court.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
I don't want to put anything on my dick that changes the size of my balls.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Oh, because it makes your dick look smaller?

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
No, because the only way that happens in cartoons is when there's buildup.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Well, the buildup is great.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
You talk about like Tom and Jerry and he puts his foot on his hose.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
What episode is that?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Oh.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
A hose.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
I don't want to do anything like that to my private part.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
This is the right neighborhood.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
You could go like five feet in any direction and find some good cock rings.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
I wasn't implying that I couldn't find good cock rings.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm saying I think you would love them.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
No, I don't think I would.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I think you would.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
You'd love them.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
But what do they do?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
They keep you hard?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Yeah, they keep you hard.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Why would you want...

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
They're fine.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
You don't want to stay hard?

20:10.000 --> 20:18.000
Well, isn't it kind of like...

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Well, isn't it?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
It's like my therapist says that...

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
You shouldn't stay hard.

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
My therapist says sex is a destination, not an event.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Fuck your therapist.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
It's an event.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
What's the best thing ever?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
What does that distinction mean?

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
It means that you're joining with someone and going somewhere together.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Well, then isn't it a journey?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
And not a destination?

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
The same thing happened when I said...

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
It's not the destination, it's the journey.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
That's what these people are saying.

20:59.000 --> 21:06.000
But you can't apply that to sex and say it's not the sex destination, it's the sex journey.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
They've already heard that.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
It's more powerful to say sex isn't a thing that starts to happen and then at some point stops happening.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
It's not like a thing that you need to accomplish, because that starts to set into a syndrome.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
So what's good about it then?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
What's good about what?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Sex.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Sex isn't... because it feels good.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Oh, so it's all about blowing your load on someone.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
But don't make that the goal.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Or you may never.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Well, then what is the goal?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
To have fun and give feel to it.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
It often involves blowing your load on people.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
All right, I like that.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
I'm not making my therapist's point.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
All it is is to say just take the pressure off.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Because a lot of...

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
That's this idea that there's possible to have sexual dysfunction, sexual pressure, things that are happening.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
You're like, oh, it's...

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Right, I know.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It's the pressure that keeps me going, though.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Yeah, you can have a relationship with it.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
You can be like, I bet she doesn't think I'm going to get hard on it.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
I'm going to show her that my screenplay is going to be great.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
You can have like a whipped cream if it works.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I've never written a screenplay.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
All right, so...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
All right, now you see me too.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, I brought you out here because...

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Right.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Our bar night, our bar day.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Oh, yeah.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
This segment is called,

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
Carmen Does It Mostly Right?

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
It's a bad title.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Do you have music for it?

22:36.000 --> 22:48.000
Most of my stories are about what a failure I am.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
It wouldn't be...

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
It wouldn't be controlling if I wasn't just messing stuff up over here.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
See?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Okay.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Anyways, but this is, you know...

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
When Jeff Davis tells a story, it's like, we've celebrated,

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
he goes like, I went and got a brownie yesterday at a brownie store.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Did you hear about this price?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
I got 12 blowjabs.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Everyone loved me.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I went and I looked at the brownies.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
There's like nine kinds of brownie and I said,

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
do you have a...

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Do you have a Chocolat Extreme?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
So I'm fucking the Chocolat Extreme.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
And I mean, fucking the Chocolat Extreme.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Yeah, and this story ends with somebody invariably,

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
as we've pointed out.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Grabbing his arm.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
Someone in the service industry or a rock band

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
grabbing Jeff on the arm and saying,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Thank you.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
So look for that.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Thank you for wanting that.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Thank you for ordering that.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Who ordered for La Mama?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Thank you.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Where were we?

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Justin, we didn't even start the bar.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Oh, okay.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
So anyways, my stories usually end with me shitting my pants

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
and being a bad person.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I think this story is...

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
I'm kind of a badass and an amazing person.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Don't give it away, but yeah, maybe.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
We'll see.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
We'll all be the judge.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
All right.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
So I just wanted to witness here.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
We went into a bar and there was nobody in it,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
but one guy.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
And the bartender.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
And the bartender.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
So we walked in and it was dark and quiet

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
and there was nice music playing on either the jukebox

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
or what have you.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
But in any case, there was baseball on the TV

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
and there was one guy sitting there.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Just so, and then...

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And the baseball was, you know, the volume was on.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
It was blaring.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I sat in the stools with Dino.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
The middle thing.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
He was empty. Okay, great.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Not thinking about anything.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
That guy gets up and he leaves.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
There's some money on the bar.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
There's a drink on the bar.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I'm not sure if he's left or not.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
I say to the bartender,

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
hey, do you know if that guy is invested in the audio

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
of the baseball broadcast?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Does he...

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
What?

25:14.000 --> 25:21.000
Does he need to hear the baseball?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Because I would love to...

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
You want me to mute the baseball?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Yeah, I don't want to be an asshole.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Well, no, I want you to mute the baseball

25:29.000 --> 25:35.000
unless that guy loves the baseball sounds.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
I think he left.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
I'm going to repeat that.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
I think he left because it's kind of an important thing.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
At this point, I'm thinking Dan's over-explaining it,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
but this guy is still not getting it.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I don't mean to throw you under the bus,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
but I'm just saying you're making fun of me a little bit.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
You're going like, you're over fucking doing.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Yeah, yada, yada.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Just ask him to turn it down.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And I'm like, okay, I'm going to compartmentalize that shame

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
because it keeps me from violence.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
And you'll understand sooner or later.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And then this guy is like...

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I just wanted this guy to understand

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
that definitely do not mistake this

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
for me being entitled to fucking control

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
over the sensory environment of this bar.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah, you're going beyond the call of duty.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
And I think he left.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
And I was like, then my blue sky would be no baseball audio.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
He's not embellishing this, by the way.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
And just this.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
And he's like, can do whatever.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
It's a baseball, goes on mute, music comes up,

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
and we experienced for four minutes and 17 seconds.

26:45.000 --> 26:52.000
The version of life I still feel entitled to somehow.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah, when there's no one else in the bar,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
we should just listen to the music and we don't have to hear.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Just be in...

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
I'm talking about work with Dino.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
And so at some point during that,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
all of a sudden, then I was like,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
what, did the jukebox end?

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
All of a sudden, you're kind of conscious of the fact that

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
the baseball audio is back up.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Yeah, you noticed this. I didn't.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
And I get peeved at a certain point.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
The guy never came back, the other guy, he was gone.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
So it's me, Dino, and the bartender.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
The bartender is seated three feet from the TV

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
at the end of the bar, and he's watching it.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Now he's watching it with audio, which has changed since that

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
weird labyrinthine conversation,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
the headline of which I'd like to define as

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
this motherfucker, Dan Harmon,

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
gives massive shits about the people around him

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
to the point where he doesn't want to make a fucking move

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
until he's got the all clear.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
So this guy's like, what is going on?

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Why is he watching? He knew.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
So the thing in my head is, I go,

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
jeez, this guy, he leaves at this point.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
He was really ashamed of loving baseball, audio.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
But he's gone, he's gone, he's gone in the back room at this point.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Because he goes in the back room for a second.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
As Dan starts talking about this guy.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
And I'm like, this is fascinating to me, because this guy,

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
he says, I'm asking, I remember that laborious conversation we had?

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Yeah, yeah, I said, don't you think there was like a million

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
chances for him to say, well, I'll tell you what,

28:33.000 --> 28:39.000
I work here and I know you think the laws of economy should apply.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
That's all convenient for you.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
But the truth is, this is my corner of the world,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
and I love baseball.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
And that there's the most important game that's ever been played,

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
specifically because the players make strange sounds.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
Or the sports caster, Howard Costell has come out of the grave

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
and he's like doing this one, I need to hear the fucking sounds.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
I say any of that and then I would go, well, that's good information.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
I'm glad we now know we can go to a different bar.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
So I was sitting there, I was going like, well, see that guy,

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
come on, come on.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I mean, like, well, we have that whole conversation.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
And he's like, and then he comes back out.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
I'm hearing him bitch about this, but I haven't noticed that the baseball's up.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
So I'm like.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
So he just thinks I'm nuts.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Yeah, why are you bringing this up again?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I was tuning it out.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Yeah, and then I'm perceiving it.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I'm like, why is it, okay, all right.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
So, and then the guy's like sitting there and I was like,

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Zidino keeps talking and I'm like, and now I'm just like,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
I can't hear anything but the fucking TV.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
And so I do this weird thing like a six-year-old would do.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I'm still lost.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
And Zidino doesn't know why I'm doing this.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
But I'm like staring at my Amstel bottle and I just lock eyes with the Amstel bottle

29:58.000 --> 30:06.000
and I just start to do my impression of the sounds coming from the TV.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Really, really loudly.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
Well, not, I mean, really loudly meaning I was matching the,

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
I wanted to simulate, well, if that should be in the bar,

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
then if that was in a chair over here, then that's,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
this is what that would sound like.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
And so I was just like, strikes!

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Johnson, the other guy, we're doing four things.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Oh, that's going to be fun.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Oh, it's a great night for sports.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
A major league, solid dichotomy.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
So, well, stand, Johnson, whoa, three yards,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
come to the team, hook all the camp, open your heart.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
And then there's like an Arby's commercial.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Like, Arby's, Arby's, Arby's, Arby's, Arby's.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Well, so a commercial comes out and it's like, by the way,

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
sports don't mean joy, sports means every four minutes,

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
you've got seven minutes of corporate fucking propaganda.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
Don't tell me you can hang out in a bar and keep to your fucking,

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
like ideological guns and you're bathing yourself in Jerry Springer

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
and Carl's Jr. commercials.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
Fuck you, you're not punk rock, kill yourself.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
But it's a fucking commercial.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
It's like, like, sports, commercials are worse than sports.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Like, why do you even watch them?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
So I just start going like Carl's Jr., oh, it's going to be,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
it's going to be a hot tab, your town, so catch up.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
So at this point, it dawns on me what's going on.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
I'm like, oh.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
It's an empty bar.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
It's me and a guy staring at a television whose job is

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
to bring us drinks and who I have made a pact with

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
that the baseball audio would be silenced.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
So he's now blaring it and I'm doing the opposite

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
and Dino's going like, what's going on?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
What's happening?

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
And so I finally got to go like, oh, it's either a mustard

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
ketchup or a horseradish or something.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
What the fuck am I listening to?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I'm in a bar.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
And I said that and like fucking it wasn't,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
I want you to understand, like if you were editing this

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
in iMovie, you would not, there wouldn't be any space

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
between those lines of dialogue.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
It's like when you're really, really mad at somebody

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
and you're really ready to go, I want to make it clear,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
that's how dramatic that was.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
So it's like, I said, what the fuck am I?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
I said, I'm in a fucking bar.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
What the fuck am I listening to?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Which was my height of shame because I was like throwing

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
this little tantrum doing this thing.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
And so I was kind of like, that was me pulling a rip cord.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
I wasn't going to do it anymore.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I don't know who knows what I would have done,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
but I was being a baby and I was feeling like a baby.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
And like at the height of me doing that though,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
the crazy thing, I said, I go,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
what the fuck am I listening to?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
What the fuck am I listening to?

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Silence, look over at this six foot five beefy arm

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
to fucking bespectacled, but in a way that makes you think,

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
maybe he just needs murder vision.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
Like, not a guy who, if he was a bouncer,

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
I would not question, I'd be intimidated by everybody,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
but he definitely could have killed me.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
And he was like, what am I listening to?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Look at him and he goes like,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
fucking talk about this bullshit,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
you fucking talk about your Netflix deal

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
and fucking industry hack.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Oh.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
This guy, this guy had an axe to grind.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Wow.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
How can you have that much backstory

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
to be watching broadcast cable?

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
That guy needs to be a Blu-ray collector.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Like, he's fucking rich as a character.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
And I was like, industry hack?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
And he goes, yeah, you come in here talking about your deals,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
you got this deal and that deal.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
And I was like, oh.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
We're just laughing.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
And I'm not proud of that, but I just started like laughing.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
Because the guy was like, I felt bullied and so on now.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
It's easy to like, I'm now on the bully,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
but it's like, I didn't feel that way.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Like an underdog.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
So I was like, oh, man.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Wow.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
And silence, empty bar.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
And then I said,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Am I going to repeat it or you?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Maybe if you do it.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I got to think of what it was exactly.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Is there a bat in here?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Hey, you hit it.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Sorry, is there a Buddhist around?

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
I said, man, the time and energy it takes

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
to make you honest.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
And all he did was look down.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
He didn't say another word.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
And we got up and we fucking put down our sarcastic tips.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
And I drank and I did.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
I did.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I think I feel like Jeff Davis would do,

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
which is I sat there and I planted my feet

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
and I drank to the bottom of the glass.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
And then I went, put the glass in the bar.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
I walked out.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
I felt like Jeff was on my shoulder going like,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
that was beautiful.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Sit there.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Don't say anything.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Don't say it.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
You didn't say anything more.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
You said the perfect amount.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
It was perfect.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Anyways, bullies.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Am I right, people?

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
I'm kind of on that guy's side.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
I'm on the bartender's side, you know?

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
You are on the bartender's side?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Have you ever heard fucking LA people talk about

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
their fucking bullshit?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
It's the worst experience imaginable.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Yeah, but here's the thing.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Here's the thing.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
We asked them to turn the music up.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
We asked them to just turn the sound down.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
We said, we want to hear the music.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Also, by the way, if you have the word

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
hack in your vocabulary and you're a bartender,

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
you better be the best fucking bartender in the world.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
And that includes not judging the fucking

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
racist, sexist, rapist fucking.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Yeah, the occasional industrial hack

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
that comes through your bar.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
The reason why the bar is sacred is because

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
you're supposed to be, not impartial,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
but you're supposed to keep your fucking lip zipped.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
You're supposed to be an objective, strange,

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
crooked lighthouse to the broken.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
I don't demand that of anybody,

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
but don't demand I don't mention Netflix on my fucking...

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I'm working on the weekend.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Industry hack.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Yeah.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Fine.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I'll be the first person to call myself that

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
if you're cool to me.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Fucking guy loves baseball so much.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Did we change your mind?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
No, no.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
I mean...

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
But what are you saying, Spencer?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Are you saying that you, what?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
I'm saying you should reexamine your life.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
But are you saying that if you were that bartender

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
that you would have turned on the baseball audio?

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
No, I'm just saying, if I were that guy

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
and I turned up the baseball audio

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
and then I heard someone making fun of me,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
I'd be kind of upset.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
I wasn't making fun of him.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
I was...

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Look, we...

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Oh, hey, okay.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Yeah, exactly.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
No, I wanted the guy to go,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
hey, fuck you, it's kind of weird

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
that when he finally popped

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
the wine on top of the bottle

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
had nothing to do with me being

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
loud, obnoxious, nerdy,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
like, totally out of line.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Weirdly, it had to do with my Netflix deal.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Oh, yeah.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Because, again, the kinds of douchebags

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
that talk about that stuff are insufferable.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
He probably has to put up with shit like that

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
from actual douchebags all the time.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Oh, my God, the smallest violin

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
for the LA bartender.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
So sick of serving drinks

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
to people in the entertainment industry.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
My heart fucking bleeds.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Give me a drink.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I need it to work.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I have 70 jobs.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
That guy, that guy would be in Ireland

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
just screaming like,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
quit talking about coal mining.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Fucking facts.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
You fucking hack.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
You fucking pickaxe.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Deal with it.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
You're in LA.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
This is what we talk about.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I'm going to be dead at 61

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
if I'm lucky.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Paying that guy's salary

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
with my Sunday.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I was working.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
I don't even want to talk about the industry.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
I'm working.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I usually like Spencer.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Hey, man.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Well, Spencer.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I gotta say, this rant against blue-collar people

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
has really turned me around on your side.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
It's not a rant against blue-collar people.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
How dare you be upset with a douchebag.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
My rant is about allowing the term blue-collar

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
to be applied to people.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That guy didn't lift shit

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
during his fucking tiring.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
He turned that baseball up

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
in a passive-aggressive way.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I think you guys both just glanced off each other

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
at the wrong way,

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
and then you both got mad.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
No, I had been done.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
But wait, he's like Jesus Christ.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
I admit that,

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
but I still think I'm the hero of that story.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
But it doesn't matter,

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
because my next topic is,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
and here comes a segment called

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Things You'll Never Hear Talked About

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
on Any Other Podcast.

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
Colin Donald Trump Edition.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Hey, there's a fascist openly running

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
for president,

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
and the world is ending,

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
and it's affecting us in different ways.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Remember in high school,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
you studied literature,

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
and you learned that the invention

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
of the atomic bomb

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
or World War I

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
totally affected 30 years of literature,

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
which means it is possible

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
for the national psyche

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
to be affected by huge catastrophic events.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
And it's seeping into us,

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
but I found the silver lining of it.

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
I'm coming through for better or for worse.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
The Donald Trump phenomenon

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
is now, it's bringing me through,

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
it's releasing me from my need for approval.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
It's separating,

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
that's different from saying.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
It's doing that for a lot of people.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Mostly white supremacists,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
but a lot of people.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
I was worried,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
well, absolutely correct.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
But hopefully for me,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
that's a better thing

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
than if a skinhead feels that way.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
But that is exactly what's happening.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
People are uncorked,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
but it's like how much of you is performance

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
and how much of you is intent and behavior.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Those two things being unbraided,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
because it's like, hey,

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
there was a time when it was like,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I was obsessed with the fact that like,

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
oh, what's this politically correct phenomenon going on?

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Do you mean if you never say something racist,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
that means you're a flawless person?

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Because this president has never said anything racist

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
and he's a terrible, terrible person.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
He's doing terrible things

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
that cost human lives.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
That was my whole game.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
And then you go into the new generation

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
where it becomes,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
but now the weird thing is,

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
this guy is like, I mean,

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
he's as famous as you can ever get ever.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
He's as close to whatever fucking definition we have

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
of winning the American game is.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
Like we've, as far as we've defined it,

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
and he just keeps,

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
and so it's like, there's a point where I hit this bottom,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
thank God we didn't have a podcast last week

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
because I think I was kind of feeling this way then,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
was like, how am I supposed to,

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
why am I even fucking trying to be a good person?

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
What is, I almost tweeted it,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
like this is the danger that this guy represents,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
that there's gonna be like,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
because on the lower class level,

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
that takes the form of fucking clockwork orange gangs

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
running through the street going like,

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
mexy, I tabby tab, you're racey race.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
It's baby talky, so it's weird weird,

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
but honestly, you're black and I'm stomping on you,

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
and that up the upper class is that there would be

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
a similar thing, it would take the form,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
and then somewhere in the middle was me going like,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
oh fuck, I don't have a conscience anymore,

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
but that led to, oh shit, but okay,

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
no, what that means is you have to stop basing it on outcome,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
you have to stop basing it on opinion,

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
on whether or not it is going to make people like you

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
or hate you, because that doesn't matter

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
and that's a good thing to learn

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
because that actually means that you could like,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I think a lot of us want to say things

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
that we're worried about, no, I'm not.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
I'm so hot, I'm so hot.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
I thought if I dug through the tunnel,

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
I would eventually hit a hand.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Does anybody want any ice?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Yes.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Woo!

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Oh wow.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Oh!

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
It's a big one!

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
Oh god!

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Oh boy.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
You guys are in the splash zone.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Yay!

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
That was a success and it just got alcohol over the floor.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
That's what a success is.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
What were you trying to rant at?

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I couldn't listen, I'm so hot.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
The only thing I could think you were getting at

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
is political correctness can cause problems

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
because if people that are only a little racist

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
are like, if I'm going to be treated like I'm a Nazi

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
every time I say something kind of off-color,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
then what's the point of even trying?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Why don't I just go whole hog the other way?

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Whereas if we kind of approach with sensitivity

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
and be all like, hey man, I get what you're saying,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I'm not trying to attack you, but the end result

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
of what you're saying can lead down this path

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
and that's why it might be good to, you know...

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Right, like if the enemy is ignorant for instance,

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
you know, like then to the way to defeat ignorance

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
is not to like hit it on the head with a brick,

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
necessarily.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Yeah, because I don't know, I read this crazy article

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
about a guy...

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
This is getting me horny.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Are you rubbing ice on your junk?

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
How is that?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
That doesn't even sound unpleasant enough

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
to get you horny.

43:44.000 --> 43:50.000
It just sounds a bit uncomfortable.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Look, I just had nothing to say.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
I mean, I think you really...

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
You used what you had.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
That's all I got.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
You got what forced me into this.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
That kind of led me into...

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Okay, so I'm forcing a dot connect here,

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
but it's not...

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
It does exist anyway,

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
which is another topical, horrible, weird,

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
random thing which represents just random chaos

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
was that actor today that...

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Oh, yeah.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
...died in that crazy way,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
and everybody just wanted to know

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
what the hell is going on,

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
and it was kind of like a great metaphorical...

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It was like when people get sick

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
and we associate that with death and stuff,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
there's not enough lightning strikes

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
and crazy things to really cast death

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
in its direct...

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
The way that people dealt with it and watching it,

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
I had to go to the TMZ article about this death

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
and then just the...

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
The comment section,

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
just Star Trek pawn after Star Trek pawn after Star Trek pawn,

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
and kind of mean as if...

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
You can tell that the joke is like...

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
I'm not here to generate humor.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
I'm here as a punchline to this crazy setup

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
that exists called fucked up society

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
that's so fucking...

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
And I respect that. That's always going to be needed

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
if society is truly fucked up.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
But everybody wants to be that guy,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
but it's just going through that thing,

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
and I was like, holy shit, man.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
There's literally almost nobody saying,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
what a bummer.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Of course, you wouldn't log in to say that,

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
and then you go like,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
okay, so the internet is...

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
It's like this carnival.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
There's none of those people...

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
Everyone just... You go into this toilet

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
and you put on these weird bird masks

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
and then you do this fucked up shit.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
And it's like the Purge series,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
which I think everybody...

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
It's not because those movies are good that they keep making them.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
I think everyone's like,

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
tell me more about that absolute thinly veiled metaphor

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
for my life.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Like where I...

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
And I...

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
That plus Trump equals...

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Not nihilism.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
It equals renewed realization

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
that being cool absolutely

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
can only be by your own definitions.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
The other ones don't work at all for anyone.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
And you better make every day

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
of achieving that goal

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
worth as much as the final one

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
because a bus might fall out of the sky

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
and land on the building you're in.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Yeah, it's crazy.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I mean, first of all, that whole...

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
The way that guy died,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
you know, as if there's not enough ways

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
that I'm afraid of dying.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
You know?

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
I mean, like, you know, you're driving home,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
you're like, oh yeah, you can get hit,

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
and you feel like when you park your car,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
you're done.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Made it safe.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Now this guy...

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
This guy got hit by a parked car.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Take a name here.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Yeah, what happened?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Well, he thought it was parked.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
No, it sounded like...

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
He thought he put it in park,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
but he put it in neutral, right?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
What it sounds like,

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
but there's been so little information,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
but it's the only logical...

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Occam's razor says that he has a steep driveway

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
and he got out of his car to check his mail.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Yeah, he thought it was parked.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I don't want to die checking my mail.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I didn't.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
I mean, I didn't want to talk about this.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
It's really hot, I don't know.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
Stephen King's Cell.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
There's a movie you can get on your Apple TV.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
Stephen King's Cell.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
C-E-L-L.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
Don't mistake it for the Jennifer Lopez Cell.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
This is Stephen King's Cell.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
You can remember it because it has

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Stephen King's before it.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
Which means so much.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
It's a stamp of quality like none other.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
How do you...

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
How do you ever...

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Is he ever...

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
What happens before someone says,

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Stephen King's clam of mammas?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
No way.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Why are people still...

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
It doesn't mean any...

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
It means bad, Stephen King's.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
He did it. It means he did it.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
But what does it even mean?

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
It means oaky-spooky is what it means.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
It doesn't mean good, it doesn't mean bad,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
it just means oaky-spooky.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Another pin on the sash.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Tom Clancy's something means

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
that there's going to be geopolitical strife

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
and technological porn.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
I assume Roger Avery.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
This is Roger Avery. I think I'm an actor.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I saw Stephen King

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
took a picture of George R. R. Martin.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I was like, I hope he teaches him

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
how to write stuff quickly.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
You know?

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Just kidding.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
He could trade some notes.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
You got jokes.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Oh yeah, I got jokes.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Anyways, Stephen King's cell,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
if you get a chance to watch it,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
is the most exciting

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
first 15 minutes I think

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
of a movie this cheap

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
that you'll ever see.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
John Kuzak's got an airport

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
and then Stephen King's

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
America's dad.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
He's making a point about...

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Or not making a point, but just saying

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
there's a lot of cell phones.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
What if...

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
What if...

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
It's like, everywhere you go, there's a cell phone.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
And turning that into horror.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
So it's John Kuzak's going through an airport

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
and everyone who's on a cell phone

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
at a specific moment,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
they all go...

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
And then they all start stabbing each other

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
and beating each other up.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Jesus, it's like my dad wrote that.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
It's a pretty cheap movie.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
You find yourself...

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Sam Jackson and John Kuzak,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
they must have been

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
the most expensive thing about the movie.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Because it was very cheaply done,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
but for a cheaply done movie

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
that starts at an airport

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
with everyone starting to stab each other,

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Cody and I were kind of freaked out.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
But anyways,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I'm not here to shill for Stephen King's cell.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I just want to tell you

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
that eventually, without any ceremony at all,

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
at some point, because it becomes

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
about avoiding these people

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
who got too close to a cell signal,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
they start calling them

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
phoneers. I just wanted to tell you that.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Phoneers.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
And then they expect you to stay on the edge of your seat.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Ah, fuck, those phoneers.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
So many phoneers over there.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
They were so happy with that term

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
when they came over.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Just do a rewrite on that page.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Pay Tarantino a million dollars

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
to come in.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Phoneers?

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Did we have a vote about that?

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I don't know, motherfucker.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
That's Sam Jackson.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
They look like phoneers to me.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Speaking of Sam Jackson,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
in that role,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
there was another weird or

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
it's great,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
that's not weird, but it was weirdly not weird.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Sam Jackson's character

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
appears in the very beginning

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
to offhandedly mention,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
totally indirectly,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
something that

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
kind of clearly indicates that he's gay,

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
and it never comes up again.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Oh.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Which strikes your mind as weird,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
because it's John Kuzak and Sam Jackson

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
walking through a subway tunnel,

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
and the Jackson's character goes like,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
yeah, well, my man done left me,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
so now I'm alone.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
And that's the last thing you ever hear about it, ever.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
There's no like,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
he's holding him up from a pit full of phoneers,

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
and goes like, use your love of

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
men

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
to grab my hand.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
There's nothing, and there's no like,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
sorry, I misjudged you, nothing.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
It was noteworthy to me

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
because it shouldn't be noteworthy,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
and I'm 43.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
But it seems like he's doing this thing

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
where he's just making choices,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
and just sticking with him.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
What are you talking about?

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
How he had a weird lisp or something in a movie?

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Sam Jackson.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Oh, God, will that...

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Maybe this is what he does,

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
like he's interested.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Well, he just makes character choices,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
and then those sometimes manifest in moments

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
we see in the final tell.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Well, just like character choices,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
it almost seems to me like Sam Yule Jackson

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
is some kind of intergalactic

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
lottery winner.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
I'm not saying that in the sense of like,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
oh, he's a bad actor or whatever.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I just mean like, where he is

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
when he is there,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
it just seems like he won a contest,

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
like he's just getting the VIP tour of a life.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I was like,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I'm gonna be in Star Wars.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
I'm a Jedi.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Hey, Iron Man,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
you're gonna be an Avenger.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
This prison food

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
tastes great.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Whoa, I got an Oscar.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
He might have nine Oscars,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
he might have zero out of no idea,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
but he's like drifting through,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
he's like Sirens of Titan,

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
he's like a Vonnegut character.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
He's just having fun.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
He's like, you wanna hear about sharks?

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Here's ice, and a shark eats them.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
But he's out of the whole shitty movie.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
There's snakes on the plane.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
I don't have to tell you what he's done.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
You guys aren't agreeing with me?

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
No, I agree.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Like more than any other actor?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
If you were an alien species

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
and you wanted to ride a human actor

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
through Earth,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
would you choose Richard Dreyfus?

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
It's like,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
that's like going to the pyramids

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
and taking a picture.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Oh, he was in Jaws.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Samuel Jackson, you freaking,

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
whoa, shit, man.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I agree, I'm just trying not to faint up here.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Oh.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Well, I don't know why I'm seeking your guys approval.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
There's an orange fascist running for president.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Openly fascist,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
absolutely openly fascist

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
bragged

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
about revoking the Washington Post's credentials,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
because he doesn't like

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
their lies.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
There was a Washington Post

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
article right before that happened that was like,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
this is a transcript

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
of us talking to Donald Trump.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Obviously in response to like,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
what do we have to do

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
to stop being told we're lying

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
or misrepresenting? You sound this

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
dumb. You came to our office

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
to talk to us about how dumb we are.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
We, we, here's the whole

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
transcript.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
What do you want from us?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Ahem.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Donald Trump, bad guy.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
It's a bad day

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
to be an alligator.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
You know?

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Yeah, man. It's no good.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
It's a bad day. Right after

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
they found that like giant fucking alligator

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
on that golf course too, right?

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Like what's going to happen to him now?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
That's a bummer.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
He'll be fine. I don't know, man, I'm worried.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
About the alligator?

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Yeah, things like a dinosaur,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
like a national, no,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
that's a national treasure.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I've been a little offended

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
by the alligator coverage.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
I feel like

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
could we ever at any point

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
say

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
we get it.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Corporate America is unaccountable.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Uh...

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
It's okay.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
But can we just call it a fucking

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
tragedy that the alligator

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
fucking grabbed? It hasn't even

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
it hasn't even been acknowledged.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
That it's a tragedy? Yeah.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I feel like that may have been acknowledged.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
It's controversial. Well, like

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
you get ten points for being technically

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
right, but I'm expressing an emotional

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
subjective thing.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
I just keep the coverage of it.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I'm sorry that I've encountered it.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
By the way, jeez, moment of silence

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
for a fucking victim

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
of society, period.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
No matter how

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
it's just like a fucking...

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I retweeted the thing, it was like CNN

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
like the story

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
from the fucking alligator side of it

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
and how sometimes kids

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
just look delicious.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I don't fucking care

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
if this is the most careless family in the world.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I was like, it's ridiculous.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
You're selling people's safety.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Who cares? You're not going to lose your fucking

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
giant corporation. It's not at risk.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
It's not going to happen. Just say

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
we're sorry one of our alligators

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
ate you.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
We're sorry. It seems like one of our alligators

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
ate you.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Tomorrow's going to be double

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
pump dumps.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Bring a dump pump

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
and you'll get two pump-pump-doubles.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Sorry about the alligator.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Look, you mean

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
happiest place on earth is going to be some

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
unhappiness running like rivulets

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
down the gutters outside

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
and into the giant generator

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
that runs on mostly air of blood

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
but some of yours.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Some of yours every once

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
in a while.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I wonder how Flint, Michigan

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
is doing.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
That

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
really fell off once Trump started

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
gaining steam. People stopped caring about

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
that. This is no good.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
What was the latest in Flint?

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
It just poisoned all the water. It was great.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Was Flint

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
where the natural gas was coming up?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Where was that?

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
It sucked down all the factories

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
from the auto industry.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Hello, real Annie.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
It was the documentary

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
where there was Roger and me.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
That's the information I've been going on

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
but I wasn't going to be like, I know all about Flint

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
from Roger and me because I'm 43.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
I faced the water supply from the Detroit water

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
to the Flint River

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
and since there was a lot of corrosion

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
the pipes were like pipes

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
and the water from the Flint River

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
was so polluted that the lead got out

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
and poisoned all the children.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Flint, which is like 90%

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Also non-children.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Also non-children.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Now the children have been lead poisoning

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
for like two years or something

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
and they're like overtarded.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
What about all the alligators?

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I heard that loud and clear

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
and you were very good at it.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I think probably everybody here did but I worry about the podcast

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
like hearing them.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Look up Flint, Michigan.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
If you didn't hear what happened.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
They poisoned the water.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
They did something to the pipes

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
and because the pipes were not maintained

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
it leached lead into the pipes.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Poison the water.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Why would they poison the water?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Because it saved money.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
That seems crazy.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
It's going to cost a hundred bucks

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
to haul all this poison out of here.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Don't poison that.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
We might need to address that later.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Of all the things you could poison, why the water?

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Poison the grass I could understand.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Poison the alligator.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I'm America's aunt.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Why would they do it next time?

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
My new character, let's have America's aunt talk to Tom.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Remember Tom from early?

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Wait, what?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
He was a giant.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Wait, wait.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Tom was in the

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
the picture room for

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
For now you see me.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Oh, now you see me. Yes, yes, yes.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Sorry, I'm sorry.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Tom, I would think.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Magicians have sexy ladies

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
around them sometimes.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I know Tom.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Maybe Isla Fisher's character

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
is an escape artist.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Tom, we've been over this.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Hold it.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Before the escape.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
She takes off her clothes.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Tom, you're a genius.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Classic character?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
This is the musical score

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
for now you see me one.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I haven't seen two.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
For an hour.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And I'm saying this.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I'm telling you this.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I'm saying watch it.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I'm telling you to watch it.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I'm not telling you don't watch it.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
You gotta see this movie.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Use the magicians.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
You said that the woman was just

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
sexual or whatever, but

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
there was a decrease

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
in the

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
level of magic

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
from the beginning.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
First it was, what's his name?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Jesse Eisenberg.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
He was amazing.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
It got steadily worse and worse.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
By amazing you mean he said pick a card

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
and then the card was on a skyscraper.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I have the storyboards memorized.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I guess that wasn't that great.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And then I don't want to get a beef with the

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Frankos. I've been adamant about this.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
But one of the Frankos is in it

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
and he's on a boat.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
This is one of the classic archetypes of magician.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
If you're going to get a super group of magicians together.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
He goes like I'm going to bend a spoon

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
and then someone's like you didn't bend the spoon

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
and then he's like I guess I didn't.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
You got your wallet.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
So a pick pocket is one of the magician

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
types.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It turns out to be a car

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
racer

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
and a mimic.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
That's not a spoiler.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Now you see me won.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
It features one of the Frankos.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
He does sleight of hand

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
foo to make Rufalo

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
like restrained.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And then Rufalo goes like

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
what are you doing?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And he goes what are you doing?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And he goes like what's your end game?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
What's your end game?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
He takes the walkie-talkie and Rufalo's like

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
no and he's like go to Isle 7

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
but it's like it's

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Rufalo's voice coming out of Franko's mouth

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
because he's a predator now

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
because he's a magician.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It's one of the four types of magician.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
The other one is a assistant

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
that is naked.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
The sequel is not called now you don't.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It can't

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
by law it cannot be.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
It can technically be a different movie.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Is it then you saw me?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
That's the

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
prequel.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
That's when they reboot it.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
That's when you'll see me.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
We'll be seeing each other

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
soon.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
But for tonight, Paris.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Balls?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Yeah!

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
You guys are a little

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
we're picking up on your

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
It's hot here, it's hot.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I offered her a hair tie

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
because of the heat.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Why did you have a hair tie?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
How long are these shows?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Do you?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Do you?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Okay, fair enough.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I mean I didn't invite you up to talk about it

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
but you'd be way hotter up here.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I mean it's so much hotter.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I want to be bald.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Does anybody have a bald cap?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I'd like to put that.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
No, you take the hair tie.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Here's a segment for which I

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:47.000
would invite audience interaction.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Rude.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
He's a hurtful.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Don't say rude.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Rude is going to trigger me.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I'll say rude.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I'll say hurtful.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I'm sorry.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
You're rude.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
It's very hot, we're all irritated.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
How long are these shows?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You can leave.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
You guys are triggering my shame.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Sorry.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
My therapist says I have a very, very

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
low shame threshold.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
If you track all of my negative behavior

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
it's all due to the fact that

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I'm very easily

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
shamed and startled.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
She told Cody

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Dan's going to be easily startled

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and I'm like what?

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And then sure enough

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I was like oh god damn it I am.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I don't want to trigger you but you're a bad guy.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
No, well that's not.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
What's this segment you were talking about?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
It's moving along.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Well this language of wins it over.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I'm sorry.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
That's my bid because I got nothing else.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Who wants to leave?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It's still game of thrones to watch.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Obviously it goes without saying if you want to leave you can leave.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Thank you, that's alright.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I don't mean to say that in a passive aggressive way.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I will make the show better.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
If you don't have to tell me

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
if it's going wrong

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I think it's going to go great by the end.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And if you pay attention

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
the next segment might involve you.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Is it an hour or one?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We've got another hour.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
You're doing it still.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Well I thought I didn't think you'd hear me.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
It's 9-11 by the way.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Time to talk about politics.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I like Hillary Clinton

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
because

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I thought that's what you get hide.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
No.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
9-11 man, 4-20.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Oh 4-20.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
What's this segment?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The segment is

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I want to be careful about how I ask for these volunteers.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
LA is pretty cool.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
We usually get pretty balanced.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
You don't have to be balanced.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
You can be imbalanced too.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I think we've proven that.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I'm just saying

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
obviously you're not going to run up because you want to be on stage.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I really want you for a specific role.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I want you to be passionate

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
about

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
an either side of the issue

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
pineapple on pizza.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
This guy's hand shot up first.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
That guy really cares.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Let's diversify a little though.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You come up.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
We've got a white male.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Cisgender.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
How many people are you bringing?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I see a lady in the middle

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
back maybe.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
At least.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Why am I mixing it up though?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I still think we should.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
There's a young lady here

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
raising both hands.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
You come on up.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
No, we fucked up.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
We've got to go one at a time.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Hold on.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
You have to stand there in the deck.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
The deck is what I call

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
the awkward deck.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Have a seat.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
How about you sit up here?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
It'll be great.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Right here in the good place.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Not the bad person

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
place.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
What's your name?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Hunter.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Four against.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I don't suppose by some coincidence

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
you're against.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
God damn it.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Stay there.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
What's your name?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Emily.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Emily.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Ormaly.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Couldormally.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Abnormally.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Thank you Emily.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
You guys are both four.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I can act against though.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I really want passion here.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
You already,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
now people know

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
that you're a sociopath.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I can totally see the reason

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
against though.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Another sociopath.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
They found one and it wasn't me.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Can I help you move?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
He named my disease.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I'm never allowed to applaud that.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
That's why the witch burnings

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
were so popular.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
They got one.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
They got one of us.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
So we need a,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I think,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
we need somebody who's

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
so against.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Black woman against over here.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
It didn't sound like a black woman.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
That's an advocate

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
or four.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
You said black woman against.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But I got to be sure.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
We can't force you to come up.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You've got a strong advocate

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
if you'd love to come up.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Dino, go with the table.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
The table.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I think the title of this episode should be

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
black woman against over here.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I'm going to submit that

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
for a standard construction

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
sign type of thing that you could

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
hang around the city.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Who knows when that could come in handy?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
What's your name?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Juliana.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
You're so against,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
well I'm against too.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I don't know what to do now though.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
My only thought was

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
because it was such a weird thing

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
because I was hearing some people talk about

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
how amazing pineapple and pizza was.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Yeah, some people.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
What the fuck, man?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Do you mean

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
racially?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
No, we were in the green room. I'm right here.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I thought it was like some people.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
What do you mean some people?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
What do you mean some people?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Okay, so you're four.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So now we've got three four pineapples.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
This is a mess.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I don't know what I was going to do

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
but two people come up.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
We can still do that.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
What do you mean two people?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Just let them do a minute each

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and just see how it goes.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
We can still do it.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
We've got two four pineapples.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I've got plans to smooth this all out

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
as we proceed.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
What would the next thing I do?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Let's start with a pro probably, right?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Right, so a minute each?

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Yeah, we go a minute of pro,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
a minute of con, a minute of pro

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
and then we can get another con.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Okay, so I forgot your name again, sorry.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
My name is Emily.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I'm going to give you a minute.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
So when people are like,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Pixar is really good at making movies,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
are they like, hey, what's so great

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
about Pixar movies is that they're just funny

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
and they're never sad and they're never touching.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Do people say that about Pixar movies?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
No, no, they don't.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
It would be really great if I had

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
like a second example to go after Pixar movies.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I don't, that's all I have.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
What's great about pineapples on Pizza

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
is that they're sweet and tangy

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and they're also savory and salty.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
That's clearly a superior combination

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
when you wake up in the morning

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and you're like, oh, breakfast.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
I'm so psyched about breakfast

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
because I have never in my life craved a sweet thing

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
and breakfast is a meal predicated

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
solely on savory things.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
No, you don't say that because breakfast is amazing

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
and breakfast includes both sweet

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
and savory things.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Thank you.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
That was 48.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
That was all I needed.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That was good.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I love that. That was great.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
So now, what do you think?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Do you like the counterpoint?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
We should probably, the next thing we should hear

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
should be anti-pineapples.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
So it's between, I'm sorry.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Juliana, right?

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I'll do one too, but you want to go first or second?

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I mean, it's...

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
You should go.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I'm sorry, I need to be a better leader.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I'm sorry.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
You do it.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
You can take a minute or less.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Here we go.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
It's just an abomination.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
It's just as bad

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
as having hot beer

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
and deep-fried watermelon.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Does it make sense to me?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Fruit on pizza

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
is like,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
why would anyone want to eat pineapple for?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I mean, I'm sorry.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
It's just an abomination.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
That's just how I just describe it.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I know it's not a huge

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
explanation or argument,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
but I just feel like an abomination

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
just describes everything about it.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
All right.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Tie it into America.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Yes.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I feel in a crazy way

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
we are tying it into America.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Do you want any more time?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
It doesn't matter.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
You get applause for one sentence.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I just feel that pineapple

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
is just one of the fruits

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
that it just doesn't make sense to me.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Like, watermelon,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I mean, it's not just because I'm black,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
but I just like watermelon.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Time's up and that was getting complicated.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Secretary of Defense,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I'm sorry.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Okay,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
so why don't I ever ask

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
names if I'm never going to remember them?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Hunter.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Hunter.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
You're going to go pro pineapple?

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Alright, start, go.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I want to tie it into the theme of the show,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
the Precision Magic.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
The film

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
is like a magic trick

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.260
then I'm gonna go with ham pizza.

01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.000
You start with it, so you're not looking at it,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.520
you get the saltiness.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.920
And you're like, oh, this is really good.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.520
I hope it's not all one note, and you keep having it,

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.760
and you're like, oh, it's a little bit of dairy,

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.520
a little bit of a nice bland flavor,

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.400
and then it mixes it up, like a one-two punch with pineapple.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.800
And you're like, oh, it's a different texture,

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.600
and it's sweet, and it leaves me with this whole point

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.440
all along, and this is what I expected.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.680
Same with the reverse point, you're like,

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.040
oh, it's all this sweet pizza, I'm not really used to it,

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.520
and then you get the salt after, and you're like,

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.080
oh my god, it's so many flavors packed into one,

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.280
and you're like, I can't even believe it.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280
Oh my god.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280
It's very true.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280
Right.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:23.840
And so, Dan, you're con, right?

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.840
I'm con.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.840
I'm con.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.840
So why don't you round us out?

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.840
Well, okay, I'm gonna do it.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.840
Cool, cool.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.840
I'm gonna do.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.400
Wait, do you know that The Prestige is a movie,

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.000
and it also has magic in it?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Yeah.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Okay.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
So we can do like a magic?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.640
A bunch of us apparently were like, why, why are you bringing

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.640
that up?

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.200
Because you can't talk about everything.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:46.760
I clearly times it a premium on my show.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.360
Two points of a triangle.

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.920
It was like, where's the apex?

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920
What do you mean, where's the impact?

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.960
No, it was like, it was like two points of a triangle, and

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.960
like, where's the apex?

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.960
Right now.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:56.960
We're at the apex.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.520
We all thought, we all thought you had like a big, good like

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.000
Chris Nolan point coming.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.520
But you're looking up from a certain perspective, like if you

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.920
knew from my perspective, you'd be like, oh yeah, like every

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.560
single thing I talk about is like one third of something I

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.800
was trying to get to.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.760
So I never, I mean, I probably would have talked about, I

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.560
wanted to talk about like, oh, Spencer, what would we, I don't

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.480
know where the fuck we got off track, but it was like, the

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.000
idea was like, we're on track, we're on track.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.040
Anyway, sorry, sorry, but no, I'm trying, I'm coming back around

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.040
a year.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.040
Yeah, you're right.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.040
It is weird.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040
I would have, I would have come around to that topic.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.040
I would have.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.040
No, you wouldn't know.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.040
I didn't mean to shame you.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.040
All right.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.440
But I am now about to shame you.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.440
Okay, here we go.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.680
Let's keep this to a minute.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.080
All right, so here's the thing.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.080
It's pizza.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.080
Okay.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:49.520
Now, my partner sounded a little xenophobic, so like, it's

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:50.760
like, oh, I hate it.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.160
It's like, let's talk about what a pizza is.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.600
Is it sweet?

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.960
Is it in the dessert section of the menu?

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.760
Or are you ordering a greasy, salty, cheesy, bready thing?

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.680
Too many people look at pizza as if it's an opportunity to express

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.680
themselves.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.640
And not enough people just order something other than pizza.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.400
Be that person at the party that says, you know what?

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.960
I can't like pizza.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.680
I'd like a chicken barbecue pineapple salad.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.880
Oh, Anthony's at the party.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.120
Anthony, eat pizza.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.840
Stop disrupting the party.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.760
You've infected the culture.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.480
You've infected my soul.

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.880
That was exactly one minute.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:53.360
All right, so I have an unfair weight, literally and figuratively.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360
We can't take a vote.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.240
We're going to walk away going, what does it matter?

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.440
Why can we not take a vote?

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.920
Okay, okay.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.920
Physical challenge.

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.240
I think, wait, before we make it binary and like, let's make it

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.240
constructive, because here's one thing that I'd like to point out.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:16.440
How many of you here hearing these two are having second thoughts

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.120
about pineapple's merit on a pizza?

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.120
No.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.120
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120
Okay.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.400
Too many handsome people have raised their hands.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:30.000
I found myself going, like, why am I blocking all this passion?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.400
You guys did a good job, I think, of making it a positive thing.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.720
But then again, it's about advocating for a fucking ridiculous prop on

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.360
top of a pizza.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.720
It's not like you could take a negative position and go, like, it's

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.920
pizza and Steve, not pizza and...

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.080
There's nothing you can do that doesn't sound positive.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080
I will say that.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.680
Like, you get to sound like fucking woke by going, like, why not try new shit?

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.120
That's why I was going, like, because it's pizza, motherfuck.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.240
All right.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.960
So, I mean, it doesn't need to be a result.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:02.960
I mean, we got to...

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.960
We'll make it official.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.960
I know.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:05.960
All right.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.960
The question is...

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:07.960
That's outlawed.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.960
The question is, should it exist?

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.960
Applaud if you accept pineapple on pizza.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.960
They're vocal.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:12.960
They're vocal.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.640
That sounds like trying too hard.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:26.120
Applaud if you refuse to let pizza be violated.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.000
This is why America's going to die.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.880
Do we beat Truman all over again?

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.160
All Donald Trump does.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.160
It's like, easy.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:39.560
Like, applaud if you just want huge, huge, very, very strong pizza.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.560
But I...

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.560
Yeah, when you...

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.560
Yeah, I don't...

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.560
Yeah.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.560
It's easy.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.560
It's stickier.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560
Negative things are stickier.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.560
It's easier.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.560
When I was in debate in high school, I was on the negative.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.560
Did you do debate?

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.560
Yeah, I did debate.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.560
I don't mean to...

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.560
It's a racist stereotype.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.560
Sorry.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:59.040
I don't mean to assume, black girls, debate, captain.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.800
Can I say one thing about this real quick?

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.240
Can I say one thing, or is that...

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.240
I hope...

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.240
Yeah, but I mean...

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.240
I feel like...

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.960
But what if what you say is, Hitler was right?

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:08.960
No.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:14.360
And then I'm like, you said, yes, you can speak, but I want to judge what you said.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.360
No, yeah, absolutely.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.360
So you know recently you were talking about...

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.360
What the fuck?

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.360
No, I'm sorry.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360
I'm sorry.

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.360
I'm so drunk in high school.

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.360
Sorry.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.360
Go ahead.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.080
I mean, there's a lot of theory theories and how it's easier to work from the back end

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.480
of it, where you work from what's there, and then you say, oh, I can work against what's

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.480
been said.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.800
It's kind of the same with negative points.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.960
It's easier to find negative points than something.

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.960
Well, that's the tough thing.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.960
Yeah.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.960
When we do debate in high school, there was the affirmative...

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960
Affirmative?

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960
Affirmative, yeah.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.960
Affirmative, negative.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.280
You had to come up with a plan if you were affirmative, prison overcrowding, oh, the negative

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:50.600
you would just show up and be like, we had a recipe box full of negative evidence cards.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.480
It didn't even matter what the topic was, you just pull out Alan Greenspan says we're

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.600
headed for a recession.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.280
You're armed with that when you don't want anything done.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:09.560
Well, first of all, Alan Greenspan says we're headed for a recession, except when we are.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:14.520
It was just like prison overcrowding, you're proposing we build a biodome, well, Alan Greenspan

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.120
says we won't have the money, I bid you good day.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.200
Yeah, it's easier to be negative.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.200
It's easier to keep your pizza pure.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:26.840
I feel like if you have that variety in your life of more open-minded to accept, it's like

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.400
soup sort of, like people hate putting all the shit in soup, but it's like...

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.200
Who hates putting all the shit in soup?

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:35.040
Oh, come on, there are people, there are people.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:42.160
I mean, yes, so, well, there's a core human problem, we're a rich empire, we have this

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:48.760
like at least successfully illusory freedom, if not actual, that's it, we have it pretty

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:55.720
good, like, so we have these opinions, and then you go, oh, am I defending the underdog

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:02.760
if I say, hey, come on, it was like that yesterday, give it a break, don't complicate it.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.760
I make that guy sound like a teamster, so he sounds wrong, unless I was at a union meeting

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.880
and then they'd be like, yeah, that sounds like God's no, they'd be like, fuck you, you

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.320
think that's what we sound like?

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:21.560
But if you also said like, hey, mine's gotta be open, you know, you gotta close mine, tough

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:27.360
titty, welcome to America, love it or leave it, you know, like, I think that's like, people

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:31.520
don't know where to punch and where to deflect, they don't know when they're the underdog

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:36.240
and when they're the alpha, you always feel like the underdog, I always, you know, I

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.840
don't have a point here, it's just like when you're saying like, why don't you put pineapple

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:47.440
on pizza, like, why wouldn't you, yeah, absolutely, and then everyone's worried, I think the fear

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.480
is that if you put pineapple on pizza and like everyone keeps saying they like it with

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.160
nobody saying this is bullshit, that all of a sudden one day pineapple will be part of

01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:00.480
pizza whether you like it or not, I think that is the genuine fear, which is also kind

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:06.160
of ridiculous, I think that that is like, what the problem is, that's the engine of

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:12.680
humanity that people go like, well, what's next, book burning? I'm not giving up, mind

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:20.880
comp finally, you can't burn it, it's the slippery pineapple slope, yeah, all right, so anyways,

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:25.120
since we have you up there, why is everyone, I mean, it's the answer is because you're

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.320
good people, why are you talking, it's hot, all right, it's hot, but it's really hot,

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:36.940
are they just saying it's hot? No, they're just brawl and winches. Is it like dog's

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:39.480
panting? That's what I'm saying. I'm gonna show them, I'm gonna show them. I'm gonna

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.240
show them, I'm going to show them, I'm showing them, I'm showing them, I'm showing

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.740
them, I'm showing them, I'm showing them, I'm showing them, I'm showing them. I'm letting

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:48.680
off, sorry, I'm letting off to hot temperature, well, we got a lot of smart people up here,

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:54.340
right, yeah, so let's, let's let's solve some problems. What Would You Rather Fight a

01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:58.180
or 40 duck-sized horses or a horse-sized duck.

01:22:58.180 --> 01:22:59.020
All right.

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:03.460
I would definitely fight, what's the big one?

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.900
The horse-sized duck.

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.780
So that's a duck, the size of a horse.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:10.700
Yeah, that's no fucking problem.

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:14.220
Like you don't, you don't, look, do you want to fight,

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:15.060
well just hold on.

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.260
Do you want to fight the T-Rex

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:18.140
or do you want to fight the Velociraptors

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.220
if you've seen any Jurassic movie?

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.180
Exactly.

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:24.020
You know that the Velociraptors win.

01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.260
You don't, you don't want,

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.740
you don't want a pack of something small and vicious

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:30.340
that can coordinate its attacks.

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.540
Yeah, but horses aren't vicious.

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:32.940
You want a single opponent.

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.980
Even if it's a large duck, it's still a fucking duck.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.260
Have you ever had a,

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:40.940
have you ever had a duck shit in your mouth?

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.020
I have.

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:43.740
Like right in my goddamn mouth.

01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:46.260
Why did that happen?

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:48.660
A horse-sized duck shit.

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:49.820
That won't fit in your mouth.

01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:51.540
Yeah, I don't know, I'm not getting anywhere near that

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:52.740
with an open mouth.

01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:55.460
What's the, what are the two?

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:56.660
A horse-sized duck.

01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.460
Now Dan, that's a duck.

01:23:58.460 --> 01:23:59.300
A horse-sized duck.

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.740
That's the size of a horse.

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:01.580
What's the other one?

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:05.060
40 duck-sized horses.

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:05.900
40?

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:06.940
Oh, Jesus.

01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:09.300
Are they, are they the big ducks or the little ducks?

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.140
They're duck-sized.

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:10.980
They're not like,

01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:12.900
oh, they're not the horse-sized ducks.

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:13.740
No, no.

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:17.540
Now even four, I'd fight 40 horse-sized horses.

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:23.380
They're timid herbivores that run when you say, yeah.

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:26.500
A duck will kick your fucking ass like a,

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:31.420
it's angry waterfowl that has a huge territorial instinct.

01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.900
Horses don't lay eggs.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.220
They're not going to fuck you up.

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.060
They're going to run.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.900
I agree.

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:39.460
If they're the size of ducks,

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:41.820
I'm going to laugh while they're running.

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:44.300
Yeah!

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.540
They're going to wave at them.

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:48.660
Unless they're the horse-sized ducks.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.140
That's true.

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:54.860
Yeah, so what if it was, what if you had to fight a horse-sized duck

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.420
or 40 horse-sized ducks?

01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.820
Which would you take?

01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:02.980
Well, OK, I would take the smaller, the small horses,

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:04.060
and I'll tell you why.

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:08.300
Because I already have a great technique

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.780
for handling mobs of enemies.

01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:13.860
And I think it applies just as well to duck-sized horses

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.460
as it does to coyotes, you know?

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:18.060
That's all I'm saying.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.020
This is my podcast idea.

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:20.940
Yeah.

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:23.020
Oh, no, I'm not going to show you.

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:24.100
Is it your running punch?

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.900
Well, if you go to the sixlerfightsanimals.com,

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:31.020
you can order my instructional videos,

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.500
where I teach you all the techniques,

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.980
how to dodge coyotes with a backpack,

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.660
how to take on horses with carrots,

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.860
how to take on sharks with an eyeball,

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.140
all the classic techniques.

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:46.140
Sharks hate an eyeball.

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.220
No, they don't.

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:48.580
That's the thing.

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.220
They trust it, and then you get them.

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.900
Exactly, and then you get right in there.

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:56.420
Are they the spear-sized eyeballs?

01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.980
Sorry.

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.580
Juliana.

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:02.580
Get close.

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:04.340
Juliana.

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.900
Juliana.

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.860
Juliana.

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.940
Who was your friend that said, we got a black woman

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.060
over here against pineapple?

01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.820
That's my boyfriend.

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:17.900
First date, second date.

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:21.420
Our first date was actually with Harmontown,

01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:23.820
but we've been together for six months.

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:26.420
You seem young enough that I can ask how old you are,

01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:28.180
if you don't mind telling us.

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:29.980
Oh, I'm 26.

01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:33.780
Little baby, big baby pumpkin.

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:36.740
And he's 49.

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:41.620
And I don't judge him, I don't support him either.

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.860
I'm just saying, it's a jungle hot day.

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.420
He's actually younger than me.

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:45.100
What's that?

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.140
He's actually younger than me.

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:47.820
Oh, nice.

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:48.900
Why did I do that?

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:52.260
Why do I do that?

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:55.740
What is that instinct?

01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:56.700
I'm going to get better.

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.620
I don't know what that is.

01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:01.820
What is that?

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.860
That was like some kind of weird, that's OK.

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:08.540
I'm going to investigate that.

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:09.980
So you guys met at Harmontown?

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.140
Is that what you're saying?

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:13.180
No, we met at Long Beach, but our first date

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.980
was here in Harmontown.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:15.980
So yes.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.740
And this is what he asked me to be his girlfriend

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:21.060
on Harmontown.

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.580
What do you mean on Harmontown?

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:23.380
Well, we were here.

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.980
You're having a coffee.

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:25.980
What?

01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:27.660
Oh, wait, who's that guy?

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:28.940
Is that your boyfriend or is that just?

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:31.580
Yeah, that's my boyfriend, the Asian one in the bag.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.500
I can't see him, but I'm just there.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:36.660
So while we were doing the show, is that what he said?

01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:41.740
Yeah, he asked me, and then I thought about it.

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:43.900
Never a good sign.

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:47.100
And then my rap was so good.

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.100
If I had done one false move, if I

01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:52.020
had had the wrong opinion about a Game of Thrones episode,

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.340
you would have gone one way or the other.

01:27:54.340 --> 01:28:02.420
And instead, you chose to make him the luckiest Long Beach

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:08.020
Harbin Town fan in the Three Black Radius

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.500
for the next three to five months.

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.060
Yeah.

01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:14.260
Statistics, say.

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.420
How is your life at LA?

01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:23.100
Can we ask you personal questions?

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.100
Yeah, sure, you can actually ask me personal questions.

01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:26.060
What do you do for rent paying?

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:31.940
Well, I used to work for the government.

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:32.660
What the fuck?

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:37.940
I don't even know if I could talk about it on here,

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.060
but I feel like it's fine.

01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.300
I used to work for them.

01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:44.020
But now I work at a medical office in Santa Monica,

01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:47.740
which is OK, but.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.820
A medical office, so people come in and they go,

01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:52.020
I might be sick at some point.

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:54.620
Yeah, they call in, and then we're like, we might be sick.

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:56.020
And I'm like, well, we don't have.

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.140
Maybe we should go to the emergency room.

01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.460
We don't have the means to help you, but.

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.860
Maybe you should go to the emergency room,

01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.820
and they're like, no, I don't want to.

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.100
I'm like, I don't know what I can do.

01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:10.660
So it's just a place that you tell them to go elsewhere?

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.020
I want to open up one of those.

01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:14.020
No.

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:15.420
Yeah, no.

01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:18.100
It's not like that, but if we mostly

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:20.500
deal with primary care, so if it's

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.980
like a huge of medical emergency,

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:25.460
it's like you definitely should go to an ER.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.900
Some people come in and they go, my hand is gone.

01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:33.620
And you're like, well, I've got a stapler and a phone.

01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.980
Hi, I don't have any problems.

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:37.340
Well, you've come to the right place.

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:47.340
Does it represent any kind of like,

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:50.580
how close is this to your, what's your fantasy

01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:53.100
about your career path, your vocation, your role?

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.460
I don't even want to pin you down.

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.180
Maybe you want to be the vapor of light,

01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.340
but what would you hope would happen

01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:05.500
from your very limited time on this earth?

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.700
Well, I would like to be a doctor in the future.

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.260
All right, medical office seems like, yeah,

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.620
it's like the mail room of probably, I'm assuming,

01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.740
I don't know, my cartoonish understanding

01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:15.980
of the medical industry.

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:19.700
Here you go, doctor, there's three sick people for you today.

01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:22.500
Boy, I stayed up all night sorting them.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.140
I arranged them from sick to sickish.

01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.940
Hope you have a great Father's Day.

01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:31.420
A young man, what are these?

01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:35.260
I'm not a young man, I'm a young black woman.

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.380
I just happen to talk like this, because Dean Hyman can only

01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:43.260
understand young Jewish men in a mail room.

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.220
He was raised on 60s musicals.

01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:52.860
There's some blackboard medical problem that she solves.

01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:59.460
I didn't hear that, but what's your name again?

01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:00.060
Ralph Hunter.

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.220
Hunter, yeah.

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:05.620
All right, Ralph was not a good guess.

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.100
All right, what do you do?

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:08.740
Hard to follow, what do you do?

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:10.780
Computer, software engineer.

01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:13.940
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.420
That's awesome.

01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:19.260
Computer, software, engineer, sounded suspicious.

01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:21.820
I don't believe that you have a job, or.

01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:22.580
No, yeah, I worry.

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:25.220
You have to prove you're not a murderer.

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.940
What do you want me to say?

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:27.740
GPL.

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:32.700
No, I'll give him my own test to see if he's a murderer.

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:37.620
Let's say she's getting a bucket.

01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.660
What does she put in it?

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.780
In what order?

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:42.900
OK.

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:46.940
Let's say she has lotion.

01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:48.020
Oh, now you, really?

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:49.420
OK.

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:50.780
That's what tipped it in.

01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:54.580
OK, all right, I feel like a fucking idiot.

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.660
All right.

01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:58.340
He's a basket, right?

01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.340
A basket, a bucket.

01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:00.060
He's a basket.

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.740
All right, I'm on your side.

01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:04.260
I'm a piece of shit.

01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:05.140
OK, thank you.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.740
Well, that's better news than you think.

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.500
I didn't want to think that there

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:12.060
was some kind of weird gauze between a reference

01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:12.980
and it going in the hoop.

01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:15.420
I'm glad I had it fundamentally wrong.

01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.180
Thank you, all right.

01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:19.540
So it says you're going to need a bigger bus.

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:27.140
All right, your name was Alon, Horpo?

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:27.860
Hunter, yeah.

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.340
OK.

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.340
Horpo.

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:33.300
It wasn't even a good guess.

01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:37.980
I had to pass over Hunter to fake guess Horpo.

01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:40.900
It's just bullying.

01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:42.500
Because it's Hunter's a cool name.

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.100
Thanks, man.

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.260
I want to take it away from you.

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.340
It's a cool name.

01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:52.300
It sounds literally like a hunter.

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.860
Yeah, sticking that, too.

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.300
It's like if your name was Fireman.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:33:04.100
Like, it's cheating.

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:04.820
It's what it is.

01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:05.860
It's cheating.

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.780
Your parents cheated.

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:10.300
It's Senator James Harmon.

01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:17.740
OK, well, what are you doing and what do you want to do?

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.500
Yeah, so right now I write computer software

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:22.140
for a company out in Santa Monica.

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:22.740
Lie.

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:25.740
Yeah.

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:28.180
Yeah, what I would want to do would be, I don't know.

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:29.180
Shoot animals for some reason.

01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:30.860
Shoot animals, yeah.

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:33.660
Or keep women in a huge hole in my basement.

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:35.340
Either one.

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.940
It's probably like teaching or like physics, professor,

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:38.540
something like that.

01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:39.620
It might be fun.

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.140
Both teachers.

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:44.540
Yeah, you would want to like, but specifically,

01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:45.740
you'd want to teach science.

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:47.460
What if someone said you could be

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:49.980
a teacher, but you have to teach bubblegum?

01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:50.740
I'd probably be OK.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.660
I'd probably get to teach the shit out of bubblegum.

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.460
Really?

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.380
But really, that your passion for education

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:58.140
is so high that you're like, yeah, it's OK if it's not physics.

01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:01.300
Yeah, so it's something that came across at work.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.980
What if you had to teach racism?

01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.380
And not awareness of it.

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:08.420
You had to teach how to be racist.

01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.220
What if that form came through?

01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.260
God damn it.

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.860
What are they going to give me the job I want?

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:15.500
I love physics.

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.860
It's like some vacuum tube pill comes through

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.540
and just opens up racism.

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:21.620
No, I'm sorry.

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.980
I've gone off on my funny little flights of fancy.

01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:27.260
Say what you were going to say before I forgot

01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:28.940
what was going on.

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.060
No, no, that's about it.

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.940
Yeah, I do computer software now.

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:35.060
I'd probably want to teach, but not getting my hopes up.

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:35.540
All right.

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.380
And yeah.

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:37.940
Glorietta, what are you doing?

01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:38.660
Emily.

01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:39.140
Emily?

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.900
I just jumped in.

01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:44.380
I don't.

01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:45.380
I'm just bad.

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:47.380
I'm just a bad, I don't.

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.340
Names and faces can't do it.

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:49.820
Juilliard?

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:56.620
I loved you in that school.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.260
Thank you.

01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.100
Hunter.

01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.540
Hunter, all right.

01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.100
I was about to say doctor.

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.660
That's how fast it happens.

01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:09.300
OK, Gwen.

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:10.060
Emily.

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:11.060
Diane.

01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:14.460
Triscuit.

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:20.540
Trap, trap, trap, trap, Travis Johnson, the third.

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:21.980
Daphne.

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:23.140
Jennifer.

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.540
Haar, Christian.

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:26.220
My name is Emily Carmichael.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.980
Emily.

01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:28.540
Thank you.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:30.220
I love your dress, by the way.

01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:31.300
I've been in the red.

01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:32.860
I mean, not your dress is awesome.

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:33.860
Awesome.

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:34.860
Oh.

01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:36.140
You guys.

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:37.180
Stop it.

01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:37.980
Beef.

01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:38.500
Stop that.

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.980
Beef.

01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:40.780
Oh, god.

01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:43.660
This is what having towers like.

01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:45.300
It's a nightmare.

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.500
Oh, it is.

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.540
It's telling somebody you like their dress,

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.740
and then somebody else is upset.

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:55.660
No, I'm not the ally you want.

01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:58.180
You both look really good.

01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:00.140
I saw what happened there, and I was immediately,

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.180
I was like, that's me.

01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:01.940
That's a how.

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:15.540
All right, so Korra, what are you doing?

01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:18.020
What do you want to do, in any order, at any length,

01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:22.660
in any accent from Norwegian to Spanish?

01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:25.980
Just kidding, on the last part, just a little drunk.

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:26.980
What are you doing?

01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:28.140
What do you want to do?

01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:30.620
I direct future films, and I want

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:32.220
to direct future films.

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.220
What?

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.220
What?

01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:35.580
Privilege.

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:37.900
Privilege.

01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.580
You have everything.

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:42.740
Why don't you go yell at bartenders?

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.860
Dream follower.

01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:46.940
Industry hack.

01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:49.980
Kills a realizer of dreams.

01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.900
I have a totally unrelated thing,

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.460
which is that there is a person in this audience who I'm not

01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:56.940
going to look at, because I don't want to make them feel

01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:57.820
called out.

01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:59.860
But there is somebody in this audience

01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:02.540
who's just watching this show with just like a bottle of

01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:04.380
Jameson at their foot.

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.820
And can that person help me?

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:09.500
Does that person have a cup?

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:10.940
Does that person want to share?

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.700
Again, not looking.

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.580
Again, if you wanted to just sit that one out,

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.500
you could have done that.

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:20.900
You didn't have to like name yourself.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:24.580
That was just a freebie, you know?

01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.300
Everybody, this is Annie, whose name I'm not going to forget.

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:28.940
She's her mansplain.

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.220
Annie.

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.820
Do you need help with that, Annie?

01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.500
Are you the one that I'm disabled?

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:35.500
Oh, different.

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:36.500
Different.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:39.500
Different able.

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:40.140
Where is it?

01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:42.380
I don't see any kind of like.

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:45.460
Annie, would you like to come up to this stage

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:49.900
and tell us about yourself?

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:51.540
She's sub-hosting.

01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:53.580
I love it.

01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.460
But I like it.

01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:55.660
Yes, keep sub-hosting.

01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:56.260
You're doing good.

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:57.500
Thank you so much.

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.940
Annie, come.

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.940
Annie, it would be nice to ask you a couple of questions

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.140
we haven't seen in a while.

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.380
Do you need help?

01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.180
Oh, OK, there you go.

01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:09.700
What happens when you ask?

01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:12.900
Yeah, yeah, here, you sit down, I'll get to you.

01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:15.820
Let's give a hand to Dr. Horpo.

01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:23.700
Dr. Horpo.

01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:26.620
Just for you to keep in scar, the pro-pineapple people,

01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:29.940
much more inclusive and open-minded.

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:34.100
We're clearly just like, fuck everyone.

01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:36.540
I don't mean to lump you in with me, but it's all I got.

01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.500
All I'm saying is double pepperoni, bacon, and pineapple.

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:40.500
Amazing.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.980
I bet that sounds good.

01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:44.020
Wait, Canadian bacon or bacon bacon?

01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:44.620
No, bacon bacon.

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.140
OK, I'm on board.

01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:47.980
I'm very glad I asked you onto the stage.

01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:50.140
Smokiness of bacon, and then the pepperoni

01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.580
and the spiciness in the pineapple.

01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:53.740
Oh my god.

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.460
I am a little high in jerk myself.

01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:56.300
OK, OK.

01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:59.180
I feel like more for my brain.

01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:01.180
I always picture you as a kind of a clean cut.

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:02.300
Did I cause this in you?

01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:03.580
Are you just a high drunk person now,

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:04.900
because you listen to the podcast?

01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:05.980
Oh, definitely not.

01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:07.900
OK, OK, thank you.

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.020
Yeah, you did not corrupt me in any way, shape or form.

01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.340
But I did take you from a walker to a cane, right?

01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:16.100
Like, I cured your spinal stenosis.

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:18.380
Yes, that was entirely you're doing, Dan.

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:23.300
You just killed me up out of the mud.

01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.220
I was like, oh my god.

01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:29.620
I am no longer disabled, because Dan has shown me the way.

01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:31.300
Yes, thank you.

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.140
Wait, are you disabled?

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.140
Yes, yes I am.

01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.340
OK, how does that work?

01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:39.020
My spine is collapsing.

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:42.820
Yeah, I know it was hard, because the last time

01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.940
you tried to talk to me was at South by Southwest

01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.220
when we couldn't hear anything.

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.020
Yeah, it was a nightmare.

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.860
Yeah, that was a nightmare episode.

01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:52.420
But yeah, for new viewers or whoever,

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:58.380
Real Annie is like, well, I don't know how to qualify it.

01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:02.420
But like, huge community fan, particularly of Annie's character,

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:04.820
had a blog, how to dress like Annie.

01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:09.220
Annie dresses like this, dot org dot edu slash Annie.

01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:10.420
I saw that.

01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:11.860
Annie's clothes.

01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:14.060
Saw that.

01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.460
It didn't go far.

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:19.340
And I think at South by, you had like, it was like a walker,

01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:19.780
right?

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:20.380
Yeah, I was doing like a page.

01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:22.500
Because you have spinal stenosis.

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.660
Yeah, I have degenerative spinal stenosis

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.140
and degenerative disc disease.

01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:29.820
And now I also have arthritis in my upper spine,

01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:33.620
as well as collapsing discs in my thoraxes.

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:35.380
Well, you needed humbling.

01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:36.460
Yeah.

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.660
It was god, the spinal stenosis was going to your head.

01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.340
I found myself thinking, boy, she

01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.620
needs to be taken down a peg.

01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:42.740
I hope she gets arthritis.

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:44.020
It's true.

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:46.260
The arthritis really did it for me.

01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:47.020
It just really hit me.

01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:48.660
You finally thought, maybe, you know what,

01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:49.660
I should clean up my act.

01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:51.540
Yeah.

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.660
Well, how did you go from a walker to a cane?

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:58.340
Because I said to myself, well, self,

01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:02.300
I don't like this walker.

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:04.140
And it was actually starting.

01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.540
So my arthritis was spreading up into my neck.

01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:10.860
And it was starting to spread into my shoulders.

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:15.020
And so, and I asked my doctor, why is that?

01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:18.500
And he said, one of the reasons that is

01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:21.020
is because when you walk on a walker,

01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.620
you kind of have to push down on it a little bit.

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:27.500
And so when you're walking forward,

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.260
you sort of give it this pressure.

01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.980
You're hunching forward, kind of.

01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:33.740
You were using your walker as a crutch.

01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:36.740
Right.

01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.300
And they called you out on it.

01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:39.820
It's exactly.

01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:44.140
It's like you need it to help you walk or something.

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:48.660
So I said, fuck that.

01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:52.860
And which is not unlike what I said to Dan,

01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:54.460
if any of you remember that episode.

01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:57.020
It's the same exact way she said it.

01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:58.820
Exactly.

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:02.860
And so I just said, OK, I'm going to start using my cane more.

01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:06.100
And so what the doctor said was, and this is probably

01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:08.020
the best thing I've ever heard in my life,

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:10.260
was if you're going to use your cane more,

01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:13.540
you're going to have to take more pain pills.

01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:17.300
And I'm like, wait a minute, why was I not doing this sooner?

01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:18.700
What's the downside?

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:20.060
Yeah.

01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:22.460
Can my cane be one of those Christmas

01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.340
canes filled with the pain pills?

01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:24.820
Right.

01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:32.780
I'm like, if I get rid of it, do I get more?

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:34.300
Is it a reward system?

01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:35.860
Right.

01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:38.820
It's like those billboards for AIDS where it says,

01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:42.580
would you rather wear one of these or take all these pills?

01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:43.580
Pills.

01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:44.580
Yeah.

01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:45.260
Are you crazy?

01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.980
I'm like, was this a hard question?

01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:50.980
I was actually, I've been taking one drug,

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:53.980
and he says, oh, my doctor said, well,

01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:58.180
my physical medicine doctor said, oh, you could also

01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:01.140
be taking this pill, which makes you lose weight

01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.180
automatically.

01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:05.900
And I said, why didn't you give me that in the first place?

01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:08.220
Why didn't she give me that in the first place?

01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:12.100
Right, I was like, what made you take a year to give me this?

01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:14.620
I mean, it just was unbelievable.

01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:17.860
This one attacks your pain, but the side effects

01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:22.940
are heightened IQ, super jumping,

01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:26.900
and pineapples on pizza.

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:30.140
Ability to, you'll have a portable hole.

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:31.220
It's our look it up.

01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:35.380
It's a D&D thing, a bag of holding.

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:38.300
Don't put them in each other.

01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:39.180
Oh, unbelievable.

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:43.500
No, unless you want to level a castle.

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.220
What do you think about that from time to time?

01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:49.420
Julie, you've been awfully quiet.

01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:56.060
I'll give you one minute to be for or against Annie's health.

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:56.660
Are you doing it?

01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:57.660
I'm kidding.

01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.660
I'm kidding.

01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:02.420
Be against it.

01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:04.300
It's so easy to be negative.

01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:07.140
Does that mean current health or eventual health?

01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:08.140
I don't know.

01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.380
My joke, obviously, was that I'm a terrible host,

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:13.460
and I don't know what I'm doing.

01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:19.460
What do you guys think about all this war?

01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:23.460
We got 10 minutes.

01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:26.100
It's fine.

01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:27.340
OK, guns.

01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:37.020
Hey, why don't we talk about your girlfriend's titties?

01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:40.500
That sounds like an urban diss, but what he means

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:46.020
is that my girlfriend, she said it was OK to tell about it.

01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.460
She said this happens every day.

01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:48.900
And everybody, she found a little lump,

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:51.420
and it was like, so we spent that weird lump scare.

01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:54.660
And she went in and got a mammogram.

01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:57.380
I had seen videos of it, and she was texting me like, man,

01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:00.940
they smashed your boob like a tortilla.

01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:03.620
How many women?

01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:04.660
I don't know.

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:08.380
I guess, well, I still don't even know what the rules are

01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:09.860
about that.

01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:11.620
Who's got a mammogram?

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:13.100
Applaud if you've got a mammogram.

01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.860
Oh my god, that's so weird.

01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:16.540
Well, I'm not hearing a lot of applause,

01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:19.100
but that might mean, I don't know if that means like.

01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:21.100
Usually they only give them to older women

01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.980
unless you're particularly susceptible to cancer

01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:25.980
and or bizarre illness.

01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:28.060
I understand that, Masha, did you, have you had one?

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:28.580
Yeah.

01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:30.700
Why have you had one?

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:35.740
Oh, I had a tumor in my ovaries, which got removed.

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:39.260
And so they were like, hey, let's check these out, yeah.

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:43.780
So, and they mash your booby on a, I saw a video of it.

01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:46.260
Yeah, they like put this two metal plates,

01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:47.740
and then they just like, they really

01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:49.420
are like trying to make a tortilla.

01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:53.540
And like, the bigger your boobies are, the more it hurts.

01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.980
Like, it was funny because like, you know,

01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:57.700
people would think, oh, the smaller they are,

01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:00.980
the worse it would be, opposite is true.

01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:01.780
It's very wrong.

01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:03.020
Yeah, I would have thought that too.

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:03.860
How do you know?

01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:08.340
Have you tried having smaller breasts when you got one?

01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:13.420
I did it for a little while in the 90s, and I was like,

01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:14.940
that is not for me.

01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:16.020
I mean, it was the 90s.

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:17.020
We all were.

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:20.580
Yeah, every girl's had little tits at some point.

01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:24.900
Yeah, I don't recommend it, honestly, you know.

01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:25.400
I do.

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.020
Big breasts, that's, you know, is the best.

01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:28.500
I hate mine.

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:32.620
Are you familiar with the itty bitty, titty committee?

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.700
I am.

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:37.660
They're an offshoot of the Bilderberg group.

01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:40.380
And it's said that they run the Eye of Horus, which

01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:43.340
is a plot of, now you see me, one.

01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:49.060
And at the end of that movie, they go into a glowing carousel.

01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:50.860
I don't care.

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:53.620
God is spoiled by this movie.

01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:57.900
And I'm telling you, the good guys evaporate

01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.940
into a magical mist, and now they're

01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:00.900
going to do a second one.

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.860
Are they going to be like, whoa,

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:08.420
we're trans-dimensional magician robbers.

01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:11.820
Oh, help, help, my cart broke down.

01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:14.740
Anyways, I can't wait.

01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.100
I can't wait.

01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:18.620
Now you don't, is what it should be called.

01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:19.740
But you can't call it that.

01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:23.500
I think that when the first one came out, everyone was like,

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:24.820
now you see me.

01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:25.740
No, I didn't.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:29.580
So then they couldn't go that way if they wanted to,

01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:31.260
because that joke was already there undoing.

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.540
Well, flying in the face of the theory

01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:37.580
that shame would stop them from doing anything

01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:40.260
is every frame of the movie you're describing.

01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:45.940
So the mammogram came out OK.

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:49.700
Well, I think it's cool you say, yeah, it hurts.

01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:52.500
But now I feel like I'm a guy who

01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:54.100
has a podcast that had a girl.

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:57.500
I was like, everybody, can you also

01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:00.100
say it didn't hurt that much?

01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:00.700
No.

01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:03.100
I'm like, what's your agenda for that?

01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:05.940
I don't want to be the guy that helped

01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:08.180
the platform of mammogram fear.

01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:10.700
Well, I mean, it's not like it's one of those things

01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:15.260
where it doesn't matter whether or not it hurts.

01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:17.660
You want to get the mammograms.

01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:24.220
So do you know what is the current party line of it?

01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:26.220
Is it that you're supposed to self-check?

01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:28.380
And then the mammogram is if you find a lump?

01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:29.260
Is that the idea?

01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:31.220
Yeah, so you do this thing.

01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:33.100
You're supposed to do it in the shower,

01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:36.740
and then you go in circles around your breasts

01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:37.980
while you're in the shower.

01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.620
It's very sensual.

01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:40.100
I mean.

01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:43.020
And then you're supposed to, they actually,

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:44.940
when you're in high school, or at least

01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:47.340
when I was in high school, they gave us this fake, tiny

01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:52.940
breast, and then it had two lumps.

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.580
One lump you could feel, and the other lump

01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:56.340
you could not feel.

01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:57.900
Oh, like the princess of the pea.

01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:58.380
Right.

01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:06.660
The female hero's journeys are about sensitivity.

01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:10.340
This woman could bitch about anything.

01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:12.940
She's the King Arthur of her gender.

01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:13.660
That's fair.

01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:18.420
Yeah, I'm obviously being ironic and saying

01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:20.180
I'm on your side.

01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:23.220
You should have had better hero's journeys than that.

01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:25.940
So the purpose of the lump you could not feel

01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:28.940
was that it meant that's why you need to get married.

01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:30.820
Oh, they were like, it was like a shitty,

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.700
like, Kobayashi Maru, like, like fucking, like,

01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:35.700
what sound of what?

01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.260
Why didn't you pick the finger?

01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:39.860
I was going to pick my own finger.

01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:43.580
Oh, well, oh, of good, you should be a wizard.

01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:45.020
Yes, Willow is the movie.

01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:47.020
Yes.

01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:48.620
Well played.

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:50.940
OK, all right, breast, check your breasts.

01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:53.340
The mammogram came out all right.

01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:56.380
But here's the thing about balls.

01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:57.100
I love balls.

01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.500
You don't get to draw a circle around your balls

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.140
in a steamy shower.

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:02.140
That sounded hot.

01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:04.460
Like, that's not what you do when you check your balls.

01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:08.060
Like, the guys in this audience are holding their balls on.

01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:09.700
Well, they're more sensitive, right?

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.900
Well, it's like, well, there's art

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.780
on the college stall.

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:16.500
That's the first time you went, in my day,

01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:20.140
when you encountered ball-checking, like, mythology.

01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:23.500
No one teaches it until you're in college, in my day.

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.900
And there's a diagram when you get to college.

01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:29.780
And it's just like these thumb and forefinger.

01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:33.420
And it's just like, to do that to a ball.

01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:35.500
And they're suggesting that you do that in the shower.

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.500
It looks like fucking pogs.

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.580
Like, it looks like tiddly winks is being played.

01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:40.620
Like, it just looks like a fun.

01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:42.660
And like, I'm not doing it.

01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:44.860
Like, we'll not mush my ball like that.

01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:47.260
That doesn't sound pleasant.

01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:48.060
No.

01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:50.500
I mean, now I feel like you're patronizing me.

01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:51.340
No, no.

01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:52.780
I love balls.

01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.940
Oh, thank God, thank God.

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.500
No, no, no, like, I really am.

01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:56.780
She seems sincere, yeah.

01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:57.740
She seems sincere.

01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:00.860
The pain of that ball go through.

01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:03.420
So that does not sound pleasant.

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:05.660
Yeah, but now I feel bad, though.

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:06.340
Yeah, no.

01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:07.500
I'm not complaining of it.

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.060
My spine's just collapsing.

01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.060
Why do you think?

01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:11.060
Why do you think I love balls?

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:17.620
So you were disappointed that your girlfriend didn't have

01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:19.060
cancer?

01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:21.780
No, no.

01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:25.220
He's compacting a very, very long, complicated story

01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:27.540
that was like, I love Cody so much.

01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:30.340
It was like, I was trying to explain this to my therapist.

01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:33.300
And I said to her, I'd never say this out loud.

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:34.020
Oh, really?

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:35.620
Because it's complicated.

01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:38.300
I was trying to express a thing.

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:39.620
Why would you bring this up?

01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:41.060
Because you said we were going to talk about it.

01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:42.260
Well, no, I never said that.

01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:44.700
I didn't say I'd like to talk about this aspect of it.

01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:46.180
But it was like, it's hard to explain.

01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:49.380
It was like, I found out I love my girlfriend so much

01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.540
that I was like, kind of like, part of my brain

01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:54.380
was like, stoked about proving it?

01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:58.340
Like, I don't know.

01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:00.540
And she was a little disappointed, too, right?

01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:01.500
Yeah, I don't know.

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.340
But it's like, it's not a thing to talk about.

01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:04.980
Like, I'd say it's a private thing.

01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:05.740
It's like, I don't know.

01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:06.780
It's like, complicated.

01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:08.220
But I mean, I'm OK.

01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:08.860
I mean, like you said.

01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:13.540
I'm sorry, I broke your no rules rules.

01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:16.380
If it was 8.15, I'd be like, OK, yeah,

01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:17.980
let's make the episode about this.

01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:19.260
I want to make this understandable.

01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:22.300
It might not be something to talk about.

01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:23.980
But is it something to rap about?

01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:29.460
Best cop-troller ever!

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:39.740
Oh, I got this cover.

01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:41.740
I got a song and everything.

01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:42.240
Yo.

01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:47.740
Yo.

01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:48.740
Give it to her.

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:51.140
I got Janilla area.

01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:52.980
I got Helena area.

01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:56.260
I got Gwen, Mary, Maria, Maria.

01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:58.860
I got Spencer and all of your models.

01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:00.260
I got Dan.

01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:01.100
Excuse me for a second.

01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:02.100
What the fuck?

01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:04.100
I got Dan.

01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:06.100
I got Dan.

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:07.100
I got Dan.

01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:08.100
Yeah.

01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:10.100
Dan, he's going to rap you.

01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:11.100
OK, well, I was.

01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:13.700
I got Dan.

01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:14.700
All right.

01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:17.700
All right, that's cool.

01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:21.100
Our rap intern, Janessa.

01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:21.600
All right.

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.100
Don't get discouraged.

01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:24.100
Yo.

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:25.100
Yo, thank you.

01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.100
Take it from the one.

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:30.100
One, one, two, one, one, two.

01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:33.100
I got a one and it's going in my shoe.

01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:36.100
I got a sock and you know what to do.

01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:40.100
I put it on my toe and I get some glue.

01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:44.100
I attach the shoe to my sock.

01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:48.100
I go out and I find a sizable rock.

01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:51.100
And I put my foot on it.

01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:54.100
I sit there for six hours and write a sonnet.

01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:58.100
And I say, yo, your face is like a comet.

01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:00.100
I fucked your mama so hard.

01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:01.100
I made her vomit.

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:03.100
I wanted to fucking hit me.

01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:05.100
You Wallace gromit.

01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.100
I'm going to do it.

01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:10.100
If you Jerry and Tom it, I'm going to fuck you so hard.

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:12.100
I'm going to glom it on too.

01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:14.100
Why am I trying to do that thing where you repeat

01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:16.100
the rhyme a million times?

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.100
Those people rate those things for hours.

01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:19.100
It's over ambitious.

01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:20.100
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:22.100
They're pushing you to flowers.

01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:24.100
That's a funeral.

01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:25.100
Laying it on her grave.

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:26.100
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:28.100
Her life was mine to save.

01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:30.100
Gave it CPR.

01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:31.100
Gave it ABC.

01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:33.100
Gave it 222.

01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.100
And this is a TLC.

01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:36.100
What?

01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:37.100
Who's?

01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:38.100
Just some suggestions.

01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:40.100
There's a ghost in there.

01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:42.100
Yo, don't get discouraged.

01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:45.100
Yo, Harmontown is the place where rap was born.

01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:48.100
I fucked your mama so hard or she got shorn.

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:52.100
I put razors inside her barn.

01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:54.100
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:56.100
She told a motherfucking yarn.

01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:58.100
All right.

01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:01.100
That's it for the show.

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:07.100
Some of you should really think about yourselves tonight.

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:11.100
Let's have a hand for Henrietta.

01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:12.100
Goblin.

01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:13.100
Goblin.

01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:14.100
Goblin.

01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:15.100
Goblin.

01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:16.100
Annie.

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.100
Helen.

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:18.100
Gloriana.

01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:19.100
And Juliana.

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.100
Nicely done, Spencer.

01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:23.100
Our Comptroller, Spencer Crittenden.

01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:24.100
Thank you.

01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:26.100
Thank you.

01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:31.100
Helpful imp Dino Stamatopoulos.

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:33.100
Zach, the audio maniac.

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:36.100
And Dustin, the feral audio producer in the back.

01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:38.100
Thanks to Kris Boruff.

01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:40.100
Sarah Hill.

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:45.100
And Yi Sun, the feral audio guy.

01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:46.100
And all the best.

01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:48.100
All right.

01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:50.100
Drive fast, take chances.

01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:56.100
Did you get any of that?

01:55:56.100 --> 01:56:17.100
It's a good show.
