{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, NerdMelt Studios, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:19.000\nThank you, thank you.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:25.000\nI am your guest comptroller, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:30.000\nThank you, thank you. You're too kind, that's very kind.\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:34.000\nBut please give it up to the person you're really here to see.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:44.000\nThe mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:49.000\nThank you, thank you.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:55.000\nGuest Comptroller, Spencer Crittenden everybody.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:56.000\nYeah man.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:58.000\nIt's a bare bones show tonight.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.000\nYeah, I was, it's fucking hot man.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:06.000\nI was gonna, you know, the thing about controlling that people don't know is you gotta wear a suit to do it.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:11.000\nWe have a lot of guests and they don't get that memo or whatever, but you gotta wear a suit\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:14.000\nand I would have worn one but I would have been sweating a motherfucker.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nNo, you don't have to.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\nNo, you gotta wear, let me, let me make this real clear.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nYou gotta wear a suit to be the Comptroller.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:28.000\nLike I wrote five minutes of material about the suit I was planning to wear, you know.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nDid you actually put it on and then go, I'm taking this off?\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:34.000\nNo, I mean I was running around finding an air conditioner all day\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:37.000\nand then I had to clean up my area to put an air conditioner into place\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:41.000\nand then by then I was sweating so hard I was like, I can't even put on a suit man.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:45.000\nBut I still have all this great material, you know, like,\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:52.000\noh yeah, 201st episode Harmon, thanks for dressing up, you know.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:57.000\nLike, it would have made sense if I was wearing a suit, that's the thing.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nA lot of his stuff was in this pre-suit.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nYeah.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:06.000\nWell, I wrote down, by the way, for those of you who are new here,\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:11.000\nI'm not being aloof when I'm looking, I'm not texting, I'm looking, these are my notes.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:17.000\nIt's 201, so I kind of, we were talking about the concept of the prestige\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:21.000\nof the video game, which I've only learned through incremental clickers.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:25.000\nMy favorite game currently is Cookie Collector 2.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:34.000\nYou can laugh all you want, but the truth is all of you are just collecting cookies in real life.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:35.000\nAnd now Cookie Collector...\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:36.000\nDon't mock me.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nThe second one really improves on a lot of shortfalls in the first one, right?\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:45.000\nMake all the obvious Cookie Collector 2 addict jokes you want.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nThere's a million of them that are immediately present.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:51.000\nI mean, every dot is within one inch of every other dot.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nYou know what's creative?\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nYou know what's ironic?\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:01.000\nBrave, heroic, saying, I play Cookie Collector 2 and spitting on you.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nSorry, sorry.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:08.000\nSay, frothing at the mouth about, did it again.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:13.000\nJust for the people at home, for the listeners at home,\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:18.000\nprestigeing is when you roll over your levels to start over in a better way.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nYou're kind of reborn, you're reborning yourself.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:22.000\nIs that a word?\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:23.000\nReborning?\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nYou're prestigeing, you're starting over.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:26.000\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:29.000\nIt's not that 200 will definitely be the...\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:33.000\nBecause the Jason Bourne movie is coming out, you know, the next one.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:38.000\nIsn't this one just called, like, Jason Bourne for real?\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:39.000\nReborn Legacy.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:46.000\nYeah, but they had to go through all the Bourne dichotomy, the Bourne eulogy,\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:51.000\nthe Bourne octology.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\nBut now it's like Matt Damon's back, so it's like, the Bourne.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nBecause one of them was just like Jeremy Renner, it was like, the Bourne brother.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nYeah.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nBourne, Bournman.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nBournman apprenticeship.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nI'd like to be a Bourne, please.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.000\nOh, Stewie.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:14.000\nNo, I'm gonna be the best Bourne ever.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:22.000\nBut you can't even know how many exits are in a room.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:27.000\nYou can't even, like, placidly, like, lock eyes with a beautiful international diplomat\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:31.000\nand explain to her that you're so powerful, you don't know why you could kick so much ass.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nYou can't do that, but I can try.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nYou know, Bournman.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nI'm a little high.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:45.000\nIt's not, I promise you, you're getting your money's worth.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nBut so the...\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nBut we're prestigeing.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:53.000\nI mean, this is a real unprecedented moment in podcasting history.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:58.000\nLike, there's plenty of podcasts that have had 200 episodes, but this isn't gonna be 201.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:02.000\nThis is gonna be Harmontown Prestige Episode 1.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\nRight.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:04.000\nYou see?\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:05.000\nWe're prestigeing.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:06.000\nWe're prestigeing.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:11.000\nTypically in an incremental clicker, like Cookie Collector 2,\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:15.000\nprestigeing means that you get to start over as if you're playing the game for the first time.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:18.000\nHowever, you have bonuses from muffins, cupcakes.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nRight.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.000\nAnd then the podcast world, you get to start over and delete all of your bad iTunes reviews.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nIt's all just fives.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nIn Resident Evil 1 on PlayStation 1,\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:34.000\nprestigeing was you finished all of Resident Evil and you get to play it again with a rocket launcher.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:39.000\nI think that was like the original kind of prestige culture.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nYeah, back when it was just New Game Plus.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:47.000\nIf we were prestigeing not to be mistaken with the age-old,\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:53.000\nif I could improve myself, I was, be greedy, be selfish, beat the game.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:58.000\nNot accountable to what you think is a good person or a bad person.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nIf you were gonna prestige as Spencer,\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:05.000\nI guess maybe relative to the podcast, so it's relatable.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nRight.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:11.000\nSo, the Spencer that is the character on Harmontown,\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:19.000\nif that character was gonna prestige out of selfishness, what would prestigeing involve?\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:25.000\nWell, I think my position would, I'd be promoted to like Comptroller from here on out.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nSo like going forward, I'd just be the co-host, yeah.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:34.000\nDo you think, would Jeff move over there or would he just like, would he just vanish?\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:38.000\nHe'd prestige to like club promoter or something.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:45.000\nNow I think Jeff is like standing in the back, like we're at Jeff's place instead of downtown.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:50.000\nAnd Jeff, Jeff down theater. And Jeff is just like happy as a can of peaches,\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\ngiving a thumbs up from the back.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nHe's like bud Friedman.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nHe tells people like not to use flash photography and stuff.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nYeah, God, Jeff loves doing that.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:05.000\nOkay, so, here's the thing.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:12.000\nSo there's a new movie out that I haven't seen yet called Now You See Me Too.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:17.000\nIt's a sequel to a movie called Now You See Me.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nCorrect.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:27.000\nWell, okay, let's go there first then, which is, by the way, your title,\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:32.000\nthe whole point of it is that it's the first part of a two-part thing.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nI guarantee you nobody that wrote that movie, let alone that title,\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:39.000\nthought they were ever gonna be doing a sequel.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:43.000\nCan you imagine the guy coming and going, knock, knock.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:52.000\nSo apparently there's no sarcasm checkbox on Apple TV and your movies I hit.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:56.000\nSo now they want a second one and there's like nine people\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:00.000\nbecause how could that movie be written by fewer people?\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:04.000\nHave you seen that fucking movie?\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:07.000\nI'm not angry, I'm excited.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nI just watched it with Cody.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nI was so excited that she hadn't seen it.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nI was walking in Canada.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nThink about it.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:21.000\nAnd I walked by the movie theater and on the marquee I saw the words,\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nNow You See Me Too.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nThat was the number two.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nI swear to God I'm not being David Spade about this.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:33.000\nMy actual fucking first instinct was,\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nOh, that explains so much about that movie.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nIt's Canadian.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nAnd they show it here still every day.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:46.000\nAnd the next showing is at two.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:51.000\nI swear to Christ above that was what I thought\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:58.000\nbecause I expected a sequel to that movie was that impossible.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:02.000\nBoth in terms of demand and supply.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nI don't care who wants a sequel.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nIf I made that movie and people wanted a sequel,\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nI would have some explaining to do.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:16.000\nThe first thing I would explain is I didn't know what I was doing.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nAnd I would say, look, can we start over?\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nI have all kinds of ideas.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nThey told me magicians were cool.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nI just got here.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nI'm talented.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nYou saw what I did.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nJust let me write a different movie.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nI don't want to.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:37.000\nI would call it now you don't.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:43.000\nIt would be called now you don't.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nIn an honest world.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:50.000\nThis movie was built on dishonesty about dishonesty.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nNot only is magicians never cool.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nMagicians where they are cool.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:59.000\nIn the context in which you can trick people into thinking they're cool.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nAnd it's always a trick to think that they're cool.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:06.000\nYou'll go down there.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:17.000\nAnd it's still, I forgot what I was, it's a, watch now you see me, one.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nWhich I rewatched last night.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:23.000\nAnd I think, I honestly think, knock it off.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:29.000\nThis movie, holy fuck man.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.000\nHow many people have seen now you see me one?\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nRespectable.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:40.000\nWell, now that you know it doesn't matter what your vote does.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:44.000\nNow that you know Trump's elected and the now you see me franchise into your,\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nhe says like you watching now you see me one won't isn't accountable.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nWatch it.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:52.000\nI made the mistake of being one of the dollars that apparently funded the sequel.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nI didn't mean to do that.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nLike they need a checkbox that says I'm kidding.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nI don't know, it's like your money's green.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nWe're going to make a sequel.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nWe'll go ahead but know that it's a kidding movie.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:07.000\nOr we were kidding when we watched the first one.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:08.000\nWe were kidding.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:09.000\nYeah.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nLike if you could give someone a page view or you don't give someone a page view,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nbut you're checking out like a clickbait thing, that'd be great.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nYou know, the best of both worlds.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nYeah.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nJust say your intention.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nThe internet's a sewer because nobody's their selves.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nIf you could go into the internet and there was a lobby and you're like,\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nmy name's Carl Johnson.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:32.000\nAnd then you go, I'm going to go talk about pedophilia now mask.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nAnd then you go through a tube and then like everyone's like,\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:39.000\nOh, there's a kid fucker 29.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nBut it's and you're like, that's me.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nI'm saying the internet structure.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nYeah.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nThey should do that.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:50.000\nYou should always have to come back into the lobby and look at yourself in a virtual mirror\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nbefore you leave the internet.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nI'm pitching AOL.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:58.000\nThere should be a portal and you should like have a living room and say,\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nyou've got mail and look at yourself.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nYou jerked off to people that look like your sister-in-law.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nWho invited you?\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nYour mail.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nWhat?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nJust because you can talk about mail doesn't mean you're sentient.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nYou've got a lot to learn.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nWhat?\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nAs long as you can say you've got before it, you can say anything.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nYou've got a point.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nNo.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nGod damn it.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nNo.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nYou've got knife.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:28.000\nIt's stabbing me.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:31.000\nThat'd be great.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:34.000\nSo have you seen the trailer for this new now you've done it?\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nNo, no.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nNow you've done it.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nThat would be a great.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:41.000\nWhat if they did a sequel and the sequel was they were like,\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nokay, what is it?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nNow you to me.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nNow you see me too.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nNow you don't.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nWhat is it going to be?\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:51.000\nBut it was just like, they were like, now you pee.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nThat was it.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nIt was like Cloverfield Lane.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nThey were just like, it's not a sequel.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nNow you pee.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nIt's from the now you series.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nYou don't think we know how to make movies?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nFucking step off.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nLet the people in.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nThey're trying to get into a good movie, motherfucker.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nYou fucking jaded piece of shit.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nFucking now you is in session.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:15.000\nNow you surf against a shark monster.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:19.000\nHey, did you see the most recent now you movie?\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nOh, now

13:30.000\nDid you see now you reunion?\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nA wish upon a star.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nI was sweet.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nYeah, no, it was sweet.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nI loved now you didn't.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nYeah.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nWell, there's a lawsuit pending.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nThose people actually don't represent the now you franchise.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nNo, but I mean that.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nAnd they're playing the race card and it's not cool.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nThe trailers problematic though, because like, yeah, you know,\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:53.000\nit's a wizard movie about all these wizards and sorcerers,\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nyou know, and they're like, you know, you got Mark Zuckerberg\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nand he like conjures a storm of cards and then you have like,\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:02.000\nI don't know, Morgan Freeman and he like picks a card\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nand puts it through a guy's skull and stuff.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nAnd then you got a guy who disappears and reappears\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:10.000\ninside of a bank fall and then you got Lizzie Kaplan\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nwho takes her bra off without taking off her top.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nThat's the first one too.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nI have a Fisher plays it.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nThey go, I go like Cody, you're going to be,\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nyou're going to be introduced to the five types of magician now\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:25.000\nfrom the Chris Angel type played by Jesse Iserberg\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:31.000\nto the spoon bending pick pocket car chasing type\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:35.000\nplayed by one of the Franko's.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nThen Woody Harrelson is a, he's a mentalist and that is up\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nwith Isla Fisher.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:43.000\nShe's introduced to go like, and here comes the lady magician\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:47.000\nand the writers were like, fuck, like David Copperfield.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nLike he's a guy.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:53.000\nShe's a lady magician, but she's awesome.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nLady magician.\n\n14:55.000 --> 15:02.000\nI just, I often times a lady is a magician's assistant.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:08.000\nTom, giant Tom, are you sitting in the corner\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:14.000\nlike talking in a slightly urban petwa?\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nThat's right.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:19.000\nJust watching you all try to figure out this story seems\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nto me magicians come with femininity.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:25.000\nIt's just compartmentalized in the form of their subjectifiable\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:29.000\nobjectifiable assistant.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:32.000\nTom, he's right.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:36.000\nIsla Fisher should play a new kind of magician.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nShe used to be Zuckerberg's assistant.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:44.000\nNow she takes over clothes before dropping\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\ninto a tank of water.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nShe's like a super assistant.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nAll right.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nAnyway, that's not my beef with that.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nI'm not, I'm not white knighting.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.000\nIt's an insane movie.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nI think you should watch this movie.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nNow you watch it.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:03.000\nNow you fucking, like, if you're mind blown.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:07.000\nI shouldn't have, I spent too much time talking about it.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:12.000\nLook, there's a lot of stuff to talk about.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:19.000\nI want to tell you about me handling myself pretty well\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nagainst a terrible person in a bar.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:26.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:30.000\nSo that's a good time to bring out my friend, Dino Stamatopoulos.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nLet's bring out Dino.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:35.000\nOh, shit.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nHi.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.000\nYeah.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nAnd now that Dino's here, remind me to talk about my new condom idea.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nIt's going to blow minds.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nWhy?\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nWhy me?\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nBecause, you know.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\nBecause I'm a pervert.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:55.000\nYou're my angel investor.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:58.000\nWhat's your condom idea, Spencer?\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nOkay, so think about condoms.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:04.000\nNow, forget everything you ever knew about condoms.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nNo, okay.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:10.000\nOkay, remember a couple of things about condoms.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nThat's my first problem.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nI never remember condoms.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nRight.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nWell, this one you'll never forget.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:21.000\nSo, I mean, essentially a condom is a sock, you know?\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nWho makes your sock?\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:26.000\nYou stuff it, you stuff it on.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:31.000\nSee, my first thought was, how big is your dick?\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nYou thought he had weird socks.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nI thought he had an enormous hinged dick.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nDicks are very important to you.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nFeet are important to me, you know?\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nBut so, okay, right.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nIt's like a sock.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:49.000\nThe only thing that's keeping it on is like friction and like elasticity.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nElasticity, yeah.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:55.000\nSo, but then to do that, it has to be shoved all the way down the leg to your shaft.\n\n17:55.000 --> 18:01.000\nOkay, so imagine if you will a shortened condom that's more like a head cap, right?\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:06.000\nAnd then at the end is a rubber band that goes behind your balls.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nSo most of your shaft still has that exposure.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nIt's not covered.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:19.000\nBut the tension of this rubber band pulling your balls towards the front, that keeps it on.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:20.000\nI love it.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:25.000\nI do that anyway.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nIt's fucking nothing like a nice tight set of balls.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nThat's why I wanted you out here.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nBoing.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nYeah, man.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nIt's like a cock ring and a condom.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:40.000\nI'm trying to imagine, I think my answer, my answer, I'm sure it's different for you,\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:45.000\nis that depending on the excitement level of the woman and my age,\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nI have a hard enough time getting this little fucker anywhere.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nYeah, but it would be Taylor made your balls.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nThere's things on it.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:55.000\nAnything that's on it is going to fall off eventually.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nNo, but it would wrap around.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nDid you ever have a cock ring on?\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nNo one's ever had a cock ring on.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nI'm not saying that proudly.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nI don't mean that.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nI mean, I'm self-shaming.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nI do not have that honor, sir.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:11.000\nYou should because apparently you and your girlfriend love your balls.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nWell, we just found that out.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nYeah, and this would help.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:22.000\nI mean, your balls would be like fucking Dolly Parton balls with the cock ring on.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nI'm very old.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nI'm 51.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nIt's like a ball court.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nI don't want to put anything on my dick that changes the size of my balls.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nOh, because it makes your dick look smaller?\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:34.000\nNo, because the only way that happens in cartoons is when there's buildup.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nWell, the buildup is great.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:39.000\nYou talk about like Tom and Jerry and he puts his foot on his hose.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nWhat episode is that?\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nOh.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nA hose.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.000\nI don't want to do anything like that to my private part.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\nThis is the right neighborhood.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:50.000\nYou could go like five feet in any direction and find some good cock rings.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:55.000\nI wasn't implying that I couldn't find good cock rings.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:58.000\nI'm saying I think you would love them.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nNo, I don't think I would.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nI think you would.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nYou'd love them.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nBut what do they do?\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nThey keep you hard?\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nYeah, they keep you hard.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.000\nWhy would you want...\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nThey're fine.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nYou don't want to stay hard?\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:18.000\nWell, isn't it kind of like...\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:19.000\nWell, isn't it?\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nIt's like my therapist says that...\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nYou shouldn't stay hard.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:30.000\nMy therapist says sex is a destination, not an event.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nFuck your therapist.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nIt's an event.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nWhat's the best thing ever?\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nWhat does that distinction mean?\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:42.000\nIt means that you're joining with someone and going somewhere together.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nWell, then isn't it a journey?\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nAnd not a destination?\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:51.000\nThe same thing happened when I said...\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:55.000\nIt's not the destination, it's the journey.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:59.000\nThat's what these people are saying.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:06.000\nBut you can't apply that to sex and say it's not the sex destination, it's the sex journey.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nThey've already heard that.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:14.000\nIt's more powerful to say sex isn't a thing that starts to happen and then at some point stops happening.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:19.000\nIt's not like a thing that you need to accomplish, because that starts to set into a syndrome.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nSo what's good about it then?\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nWhat's good about what?\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nSex.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nSex isn't... because it feels good.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:27.000\nOh, so it's all about blowing your load on someone.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:30.000\nBut don't make that the goal.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nOr you may never.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:33.000\nWell, then what is the goal?\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nTo have fun and give feel to it.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nIt often involves blowing your load on people.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nAll right, I like that.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:43.000\nI'm not making my therapist's point.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:46.000\nAll it is is to say just take the pressure off.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:49.000\nBecause a lot of...\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:55.000\nThat's this idea that there's possible to have sexual dysfunction, sexual pressure, things that are happening.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:58.000\nYou're like, oh, it's...\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nRight, I know.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nIt's the pressure that keeps me going, though.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:04.000\nYeah, you can have a relationship with it.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:07.000\nYou can be like, I bet she doesn't think I'm going to get hard on it.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:12.000\nI'm going to show her that my screenplay is going to be great.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:15.000\nYou can have like a whipped cream if it works.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nI've never written a screenplay.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nAll right, so...\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nAll right, now you see me too.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nOh, I brought you out here because...\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nRight.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nOur bar night, our bar day.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nThis segment is called,\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:34.000\nCarmen Does It Mostly Right?\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nIt's a bad title.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nDo you have music for it?\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:48.000\nMost of my stories are about what a failure I am.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nIt wouldn't be...\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:55.000\nIt wouldn't be controlling if I wasn't just messing stuff up over here.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nSee?\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nOkay.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nAnyways, but this is, you know...\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:05.000\nWhen Jeff Davis tells a story, it's like, we've celebrated,\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:10.000\nhe goes like, I went and got a brownie yesterday at a brownie store.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nDid you hear about this price?\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nI got 12 blowjabs.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nEveryone loved me.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nI went and I looked at the brownies.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:18.000\nThere's like nine kinds of brownie and I said,\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\ndo you have a...\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nDo you have a Chocolat Extreme?\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nSo I'm fucking the Chocolat Extreme.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:26.000\nAnd I mean, fucking the Chocolat Extreme.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:29.000\nYeah, and this story ends with somebody invariably,\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nas we've pointed out.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.000\nGrabbing his arm.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:36.000\nSomeone in the service industry or a rock band\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:39.000\ngrabbing Jeff on the arm and saying,\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:41.000\nThank you.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nSo look for that.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nThank you for wanting that.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nThank you for ordering that.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:49.000\nWho ordered for La Mama?\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:52.000\nThank you.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nWhere were we?\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:57.000\nJustin, we didn't even start the bar.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nOh, okay.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:02.000\nSo anyways, my stories usually end with me shitting my pants\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nand being a bad person.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nI think this story is...\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:09.000\nI'm kind of a badass and an amazing person.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nDon't give it away, but yeah, maybe.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nWe'll see.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nWe'll all be the judge.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nAll right.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nSo I just wanted to witness here.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:21.000\nWe went into a bar and there was nobody in it,\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nbut one guy.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nAnd the bartender.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nAnd the bartender.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nYeah.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:30.000\nSo we walked in and it was dark and quiet\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nand there was nice music playing on either the jukebox\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nor what have you.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:38.000\nBut in any case, there was baseball on the TV\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:41.000\nand there was one guy sitting there.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nJust so, and then...\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nAnd the baseball was, you know, the volume was on.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nIt was blaring.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nI sat in the stools with Dino.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:49.000\nThe middle thing.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nHe was empty. Okay, great.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nNot thinking about anything.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:55.000\nThat guy gets up and he leaves.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nThere's some money on the bar.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:57.000\nThere's a drink on the bar.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nI'm not sure if he's left or not.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:03.000\nI say to the bartender,\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:07.000\nhey, do you know if that guy is invested in the audio\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:10.000\nof the baseball broadcast?\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nDoes he...\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nWhat?\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:21.000\nDoes he need to hear the baseball?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nBecause I would love to...\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nYou want me to mute the baseball?\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nYeah, I don't want to be an asshole.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nWell, no, I want you to mute the baseball\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:35.000\nunless that guy loves the baseball sounds.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:38.000\nI think he left.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nI'm going to repeat that.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nI think he left because it's kind of an important thing.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:45.000\nAt this point, I'm thinking Dan's over-explaining it,\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:48.000\nbut this guy is still not getting it.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nI don't mean to throw you under the bus,\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nbut I'm just saying you're making fun of me a little bit.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nYou're going like, you're over fucking doing.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nYeah, yada, yada.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:57.000\nJust ask him to turn it down.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nAnd I'm like, okay, I'm going to compartmentalize that shame\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nbecause it keeps me from violence.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:06.000\nAnd you'll understand sooner or later.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nAnd then this guy is like...\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nI just wanted this guy to understand\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:13.000\nthat definitely do not mistake this\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:16.000\nfor me being entitled to fucking control\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:20.000\nover the sensory environment of this bar.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:23.000\nYeah, you're going beyond the call of duty.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:26.000\nAnd I think he left.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:31.000\nAnd I was like, then my blue sky would be no baseball audio.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nHe's not embellishing this, by the way.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nAnd just this.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:38.000\nAnd he's like, can do whatever.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:41.000\nIt's a baseball, goes on mute, music comes up,\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:45.000\nand we experienced for four minutes and 17 seconds.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:52.000\nThe version of life I still feel entitled to somehow.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nYeah, when there's no one else in the bar,\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nwe should just listen to the music and we don't have to hear.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nJust be in...\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:01.000\nI'm talking about work with Dino.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:04.000\nAnd so at some point during that,\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nall of a sudden, then I was like,\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nwhat, did the jukebox end?\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:11.000\nAll of a sudden, you're kind of conscious of the fact that\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:16.000\nthe baseball audio is back up.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nYeah, you noticed this. I didn't.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:21.000\nAnd I get peeved at a certain point.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:24.000\nThe guy never came back, the other guy, he was gone.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nSo it's me, Dino, and the bartender.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:31.000\nThe bartender is seated three feet from the TV\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nat the end of the bar, and he's watching it.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:36.000\nNow he's watching it with audio, which has changed since that\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nweird labyrinthine conversation,\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:42.000\nthe headline of which I'd like to define as\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.000\nthis motherfucker, Dan Harmon,\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:49.000\ngives massive shits about the people around him\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:53.000\nto the point where he doesn't want to make a fucking move\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nuntil he's got the all clear.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:58.000\nSo this guy's like, what is going on?\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.000\nWhy is he watching? He knew.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:05.000\nSo the thing in my head is, I go,\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\njeez, this guy, he leaves at this point.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:11.000\nHe was really ashamed of loving baseball, audio.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:14.000\nBut he's gone, he's gone, he's gone in the back room at this point.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nBecause he goes in the back room for a second.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nAs Dan starts talking about this guy.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:21.000\nAnd I'm like, this is fascinating to me, because this guy,\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:26.000\nhe says, I'm asking, I remember that laborious conversation we had?\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:29.000\nYeah, yeah, I said, don't you think there was like a million\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:33.000\nchances for him to say, well, I'll tell you what,\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:39.000\nI work here and I know you think the laws of economy should apply.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:43.000\nThat's all convenient for you.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:46.000\nBut the truth is, this is my corner of the world,\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nand I love baseball.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:51.000\nAnd that there's the most important game that's ever been played,\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:56.000\nspecifically because the players make strange sounds.\n\n28:56.000 --> 29:00.000\nOr the sports caster, Howard Costell has come out of the grave\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:04.000\nand he's like doing this one, I need to hear the fucking sounds.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:08.000\nI say any of that and then I would go, well, that's good information.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:12.000\nI'm glad we now know we can go to a different bar.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:15.000\nSo I was sitting there, I was going like, well, see that guy,\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:16.000\ncome on, come on.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nI mean, like, well, we have that whole conversation.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nAnd he's like, and then he comes back out.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:25.000\nI'm hearing him bitch about this, but I haven't noticed that the baseball's up.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:26.000\nSo I'm like.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:27.000\nSo he just thinks I'm nuts.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nYeah, why are you bringing this up again?\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nI was tuning it out.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nYeah, and then I'm perceiving it.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nI'm like, why is it, okay, all right.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nSo, and then the guy's like sitting there and I was like,\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:40.000\nZidino keeps talking and I'm like, and now I'm just like,\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:43.000\nI can't hear anything but the fucking TV.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:48.000\nAnd so I do this weird thing like a six-year-old would do.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nI'm still lost.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nAnd Zidino doesn't know why I'm doing this.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:58.000\nBut I'm like staring at my Amstel bottle and I just lock eyes with the Amstel bottle\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:06.000\nand I just start to do my impression of the sounds coming from the TV.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nReally, really loudly.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:12.000\nWell, not, I mean, really loudly meaning I was matching the,\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:17.000\nI wanted to simulate, well, if that should be in the bar,\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:22.000\nthen if that was in a chair over here, then that's,\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nthis is what that would sound like.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:27.000\nAnd so I was just like, strikes!\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nJohnson, the other guy, we're doing four things.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nOh, that's going to be fun.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nOh, it's a great night for sports.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nA major league, solid dichotomy.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:38.000\nSo, well, stand, Johnson, whoa, three yards,\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\ncome to the team, hook all the camp, open your heart.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:45.000\nAnd then there's like an Arby's commercial.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nLike, Arby's, Arby's, Arby's, Arby's, Arby's.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nWell, so a commercial comes out and it's like, by the way,\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:54.000\nsports don't mean joy, sports means every four minutes,\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:57.000\nyou've got seven minutes of corporate fucking propaganda.\n\n30:57.000 --> 31:00.000\nDon't tell me you can hang out in a bar and keep to your fucking,\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:04.000\nlike ideological guns and you're bathing yourself in Jerry Springer\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nand Carl's Jr. commercials.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:10.000\nFuck you, you're not punk rock, kill yourself.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nBut it's a fucking commercial.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:15.000\nIt's like, like, sports, commercials are worse than sports.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nLike, why do you even watch them?\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nSo I just start going like Carl's Jr., oh, it's going to be,\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:22.000\nit's going to be a hot tab, your town, so catch up.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nSo at this point, it dawns on me what's going on.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nI'm like, oh.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nIt's an empty bar.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:30.000\nIt's me and a guy staring at a television whose job is\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:34.000\nto bring us drinks and who I have made a pact with\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:37.000\nthat the baseball audio would be silenced.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:40.000\nSo he's now blaring it and I'm doing the opposite\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nand Dino's going like, what's going on?\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nWhat's happening?\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:46.000\nAnd so I finally got to go like, oh, it's either a mustard\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nketchup or a horseradish or something.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nJesus Christ, Jesus Christ.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:51.000\nWhat the fuck am I listening to?\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.000\nI'm in a bar.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:57.000\nAnd I said that and like fucking it wasn't,\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:00.000\nI want you to understand, like if you were editing this\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:05.000\nin iMovie, you would not, there wouldn't be any space\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nbetween those lines of dialogue.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:10.000\nIt's like when you're really, really mad at somebody\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:15.000\nand you're really ready to go, I want to make it clear,\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nthat's how dramatic that was.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nSo it's like, I said, what the fuck am I?\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nI said, I'm in a fucking bar.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nWhat the fuck am I listening to?\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nWhich was my height of shame because I was like throwing\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nthis little tantrum doing this thing.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nAnd so I was kind of like, that was me pulling a rip cord.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nI wasn't going to do it anymore.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nI don't know who knows what I would have done,\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nbut I was being a baby and I was feeling like a baby.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:37.000\nAnd like at the height of me doing that though,\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nthe crazy thing, I said, I go,\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nwhat the fuck am I listening to?\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nWhat the fuck am I listening to?\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:47.000\nSilence, look over at this six foot five beefy arm\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:50.000\nto fucking bespectacled, but in a way that makes you think,\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:53.000\nmaybe he just needs murder vision.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:58.000\nLike, not a guy who, if he was a bouncer,\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:02.000\nI would not question, I'd be intimidated by everybody,\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:05.000\nbut he definitely could have killed me.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:08.000\nAnd he was like, what am I listening to?\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nLook at him and he goes like,\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nfucking talk about this bullshit,\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nyou fucking talk about your Netflix deal\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nand fucking industry hack.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:19.000\nOh.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:24.000\nThis guy, this guy had an axe to grind.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:27.000\nWow.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:30.000\nHow can you have that much backstory\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:33.000\nto be watching broadcast cable?\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:36.000\nThat guy needs to be a Blu-ray collector.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nLike, he's fucking rich as a character.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:41.000\nAnd I was like, industry hack?\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nAnd he goes, yeah, you come in here talking about your deals,\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nyou got this deal and that deal.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nAnd I was like, oh.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nWe're just laughing.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:51.000\nAnd I'm not proud of that, but I just started like laughing.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:55.000\nBecause the guy was like, I felt bullied and so on now.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nIt's easy to like, I'm now on the bully,\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nbut it's like, I didn't feel that way.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nLike an underdog.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nSo I was like, oh, man.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nWow.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:07.000\nAnd silence, empty bar.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:11.000\nAnd then I said,\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nAm I going to repeat it or you?\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:14.000\nMaybe if you do it.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nI got to think of what it was exactly.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nIs there a bat in here?\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nHey, you hit it.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nSorry, is there a Buddhist around?\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:25.000\nI said, man, the time and energy it takes\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nto make you honest.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:31.000\nAnd all he did was look down.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nHe didn't say another word.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:37.000\nAnd we got up and we fucking put down our sarcastic tips.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:40.000\nAnd I drank and I did.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:41.000\nI did.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nI think I feel like Jeff Davis would do,\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:46.000\nwhich is I sat there and I planted my feet\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nand I drank to the bottom of the glass.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:51.000\nAnd then I went, put the glass in the bar.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nI walked out.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:55.000\nI felt like Jeff was on my shoulder going like,\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nthat was beautiful.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nSit there.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nDon't say anything.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nDon't say it.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nYou didn't say anything more.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nYou said the perfect amount.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:03.000\nIt was perfect.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nAnyways, bullies.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nAm I right, people?\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:10.000\nI'm kind of on that guy's side.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:13.000\nI'm on the bartender's side, you know?\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nYou are on the bartender's side?\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nHave you ever heard fucking LA people talk about\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:18.000\ntheir fucking bullshit?\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nIt's the worst experience imaginable.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nYeah, but here's the thing.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:22.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nWe asked them to turn the music up.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nWe asked them to just turn the sound down.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nWe said, we want to hear the music.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nYeah.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nAlso, by the way, if you have the word\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nhack in your vocabulary and you're a bartender,\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:35.000\nyou better be the best fucking bartender in the world.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nAnd that includes not judging the fucking\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:40.000\nracist, sexist, rapist fucking.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nYeah, the occasional industrial hack\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nthat comes through your bar.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:47.000\nThe reason why the bar is sacred is because\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nyou're supposed to be, not impartial,\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:52.000\nbut you're supposed to keep your fucking lip zipped.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\nYou're supposed to be an objective, strange,\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:58.000\ncrooked lighthouse to the broken.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:01.000\nI don't demand that of anybody,\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nbut don't demand I don't mention Netflix on my fucking...\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nI'm working on the weekend.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nIndustry hack.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:10.000\nYeah.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\nFine.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nI'll be the first person to call myself that\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:16.000\nif you're cool to me.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:19.000\nFucking guy loves baseball so much.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nDid we change your mind?\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nNo, no.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:24.000\nI mean...\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:25.000\nBut what are you saying, Spencer?\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nAre you saying that you, what?\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nI'm saying you should reexamine your life.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nBut are you saying that if you were that bartender\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:34.000\nthat you would have turned on the baseball audio?\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:37.000\nNo, I'm just saying, if I were that guy\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nand I turned up the baseball audio\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nand then I heard someone making fun of me,\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nI'd be kind of upset.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nI wasn't making fun of him.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:44.000\nI was...\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nLook, we...\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:48.000\nOh, hey, okay.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nNo, I wanted the guy to go,\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nhey, fuck you, it's kind of weird\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nthat when he finally popped\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nthe wine on top of the bottle\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nhad nothing to do with me being\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nloud, obnoxious, nerdy,\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nlike, totally out of line.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nWeirdly, it had to do with my Netflix deal.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:06.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nBecause, again, the kinds of douchebags\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nthat talk about that stuff are insufferable.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nHe probably has to put up with shit like that\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nfrom actual douchebags all the time.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nOh, my God, the smallest violin\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:19.000\nfor the LA bartender.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nSo sick of serving drinks\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:25.000\nto people in the entertainment industry.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:29.000\nMy heart fucking bleeds.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nGive me a drink.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nI need it to work.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nI have 70 jobs.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nThat guy, that guy would be in Ireland\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:39.000\njust screaming like,\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nquit talking about coal mining.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:42.000\nFucking facts.\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:43.000\nYou fucking hack.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:46.000\nYou fucking pickaxe.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:47.000\nDeal with it.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:48.000\nYou're in LA.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:49.000\nThis is what we talk about.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nI'm going to be dead at 61\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nif I'm lucky.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nPaying that guy's salary\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nwith my Sunday.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nI was working.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:01.000\nI don't even want to talk about the industry.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:02.000\nI'm working.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nI usually like Spencer.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nHey, man.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:06.000\nWell, Spencer.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nI gotta say, this rant against blue-collar people\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:11.000\nhas really turned me around on your side.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:14.000\nIt's not a rant against blue-collar people.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:17.000\nHow dare you be upset with a douchebag.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:21.000\nMy rant is about allowing the term blue-collar\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.000\nto be applied to people.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nThat guy didn't lift shit\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nduring his fucking tiring.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:29.000\nHe turned that baseball up\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nin a passive-aggressive way.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nI think you guys both just glanced off each other\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:34.000\nat the wrong way,\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:35.000\nand then you both got mad.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:36.000\nYeah.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.000\nNo, I had been done.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:42.000\nBut wait, he's like Jesus Christ.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:43.000\nI admit that,\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:47.000\nbut I still think I'm the hero of that story.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:48.000\nBut it doesn't matter,\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:49.000\nbecause my next topic is,\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nand here comes a segment called\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nThings You'll Never Hear Talked About\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:56.000\non Any Other Podcast.\n\n38:56.000 --> 39:01.000\nColin Donald Trump Edition.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nHey, there's a fascist openly running\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.000\nfor president,\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:05.000\nand the world is ending,\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:08.000\nand it's affecting us in different ways.\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:09.000\nRemember in high school,\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nyou studied literature,\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:12.000\nand you learned that the invention\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:13.000\nof the atomic bomb\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:14.000\nor World War I\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\ntotally affected 30 years of literature,\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:17.000\nwhich means it is possible\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:18.000\nfor the national psyche\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:21.000\nto be affected by huge catastrophic events.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:22.000\nAnd it's seeping into us,\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:25.000\nbut I found the silver lining of it.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:30.000\nI'm coming through for better or for worse.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nThe Donald Trump phenomenon\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:35.000\nis now, it's bringing me through,\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:39.000\nit's releasing me from my need for approval.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:40.000\nIt's separating,\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:41.000\nthat's different from saying.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nIt's doing that for a lot of people.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:44.000\nMostly white supremacists,\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nbut a lot of people.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:47.000\nI was worried,\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:50.000\nwell, absolutely correct.\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:51.000\nBut hopefully for me,\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:52.000\nthat's a better thing\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nthan if a skinhead feels that way.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nBut that is exactly what's happening.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nPeople are uncorked,\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nbut it's like how much of you is performance\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:04.000\nand how much of you is intent and behavior.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nThose two things being unbraided,\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nbecause it's like, hey,\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:12.000\nthere was a time when it was like,\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nI was obsessed with the fact that like,\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:17.000\noh, what's this politically correct phenomenon going on?\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:20.000\nDo you mean if you never say something racist,\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nthat means you're a flawless person?\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:25.000\nBecause this president has never said anything racist\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nand he's a terrible, terrible person.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:28.000\nHe's doing terrible things\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:29.000\nthat cost human lives.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nThat was my whole game.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nAnd then you go into the new generation\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:34.000\nwhere it becomes,\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nbut now the weird thing is,\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:39.000\nthis guy is like, I mean,\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:43.000\nhe's as famous as you can ever get ever.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:48.000\nHe's as close to whatever fucking definition we have\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.000\nof winning the American game is.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:55.000\nLike we've, as far as we've defined it,\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:58.000\nand he just keeps,\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:01.000\nand so it's like, there's a point where I hit this bottom,\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nthank God we didn't have a podcast last week\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nbecause I think I was kind of feeling this way then,\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nwas like, how am I supposed to,\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:11.000\nwhy am I even fucking trying to be a good person?\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:14.000\nWhat is, I almost tweeted it,\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nlike this is the danger that this guy represents,\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nthat there's gonna be like,\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nbecause on the lower class level,\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:24.000\nthat takes the form of fucking clockwork orange gangs\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nrunning through the street going like,\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:29.000\nmexy, I tabby tab, you're racey race.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:34.000\nIt's baby talky, so it's weird weird,\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:37.000\nbut honestly, you're black and I'm stomping on you,\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:41.000\nand that up the upper class is that there would be\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\na similar thing, it would take the form,\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nand then somewhere in the middle was me going like,\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\noh fuck, I don't have a conscience anymore,\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:52.000\nbut that led to, oh shit, but okay,\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:57.000\nno, what that means is you have to stop basing it on outcome,\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:01.000\nyou have to stop basing it on opinion,\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:06.000\non whether or not it is going to make people like you\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:11.000\nor hate you, because that doesn't matter\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:12.000\nand that's a good thing to learn\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:16.000\nbecause that actually means that you could like,\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nI think a lot of us want to say things\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:21.000\nthat we're worried about, no, I'm not.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nI'm so hot, I'm so hot.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:24.000\nI thought if I dug through the tunnel,\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:25.000\nI would eventually hit a hand.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nDoes anybody want any ice?\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.000\nYes.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:29.000\nWoo!\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nOh wow.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:32.000\nOh!\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nIt's a big one!\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:37.000\nOh

alcohol over the floor.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:51.000\nThat's what a success is.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nWhat were you trying to rant at?\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nI couldn't listen, I'm so hot.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nThe only thing I could think you were getting at\n\n42:57.000 --> 43:00.000\nis political correctness can cause problems\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:03.000\nbecause if people that are only a little racist\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:06.000\nare like, if I'm going to be treated like I'm a Nazi\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nevery time I say something kind of off-color,\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nthen what's the point of even trying?\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nWhy don't I just go whole hog the other way?\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nWhereas if we kind of approach with sensitivity\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nand be all like, hey man, I get what you're saying,\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nI'm not trying to attack you, but the end result\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nof what you're saying can lead down this path\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nand that's why it might be good to, you know...\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:25.000\nRight, like if the enemy is ignorant for instance,\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.000\nyou know, like then to the way to defeat ignorance\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:31.000\nis not to like hit it on the head with a brick,\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:32.000\nnecessarily.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nYeah, because I don't know, I read this crazy article\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:35.000\nabout a guy...\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nThis is getting me horny.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nAre you rubbing ice on your junk?\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:40.000\nHow is that?\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nThat doesn't even sound unpleasant enough\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nto get you horny.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:50.000\nIt just sounds a bit uncomfortable.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nLook, I just had nothing to say.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nI mean, I think you really...\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nYou used what you had.\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:57.000\nThat's all I got.\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:58.000\nYou got what forced me into this.\n\n43:58.000 --> 43:59.000\nThat kind of led me into...\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nOkay, so I'm forcing a dot connect here,\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:02.000\nbut it's not...\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nIt does exist anyway,\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:07.000\nwhich is another topical, horrible, weird,\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:10.000\nrandom thing which represents just random chaos\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:13.000\nwas that actor today that...\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:14.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\n...died in that crazy way,\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nand everybody just wanted to know\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:19.000\nwhat the hell is going on,\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:23.000\nand it was kind of like a great metaphorical...\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nIt was like when people get sick\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:28.000\nand we associate that with death and stuff,\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nthere's not enough lightning strikes\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:33.000\nand crazy things to really cast death\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nin its direct...\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nThe way that people dealt with it and watching it,\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:42.000\nI had to go to the TMZ article about this death\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nand then just the...\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nThe comment section,\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:50.000\njust Star Trek pawn after Star Trek pawn after Star Trek pawn,\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:55.000\nand kind of mean as if...\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:59.000\nYou can tell that the joke is like...\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:02.000\nI'm not here to generate humor.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:05.000\nI'm here

I just wanted to tell you that.\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nPhoneers.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nAnd then they expect you to stay on the edge of your seat.\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:47.000\nAh, fuck, those phoneers.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nSo many phoneers over there.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nThey were so happy with that term\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nwhen they came over.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nJust do a rewrite on that page.\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nPay Tarantino a million dollars\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nto come in.\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nPhoneers?\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nDid we have a vote about that?\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nI don't know, motherfucker.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nThat's Sam Jackson.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nThey look like phoneers to me.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nSpeaking of Sam Jackson,\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nin that role,\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nthere was another weird or\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nit's great,\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nthat's not weird, but it was weirdly not weird.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nSam Jackson's character\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:23.000\nappears in the very beginning\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nto offhandedly mention,\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\ntotally indirectly,\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nsomething that\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:31.000\nkind of clearly indicates that he's gay,\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nand it never comes up again.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.000\nOh.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nWhich strikes your mind as weird,\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nbecause it's John Kuzak and Sam Jackson\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nwalking through a subway tunnel,\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nand the Jackson's character goes like,\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nyeah, well, my man done left me,\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nso now I'm alone.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nAnd that's the last thing you ever hear about it, ever.\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nThere's no like,\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nhe's holding him up from a pit full of phoneers,\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nand goes like, use your love of\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nmen\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nto grab my hand.\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:01.000\nThere's nothing, and there's no like,\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:03.000\nsorry, I misjudged you, nothing.\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:05.000\nIt was noteworthy to me\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nbecause it shouldn't be noteworthy,\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.000\nand I'm 43.\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nBut it seems like he's doing this thing\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nwhere he's just making choices,\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nand just sticking with him.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nHow he had a weird lisp or something in a movie?\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nSam Jackson.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nOh, God, will that...\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nMaybe this is what he does,\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nlike he's interested.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nWell, he just makes character choices,\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nand then those sometimes manifest in moments\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nwe see in the final tell.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nWell, just like character choices,\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nit almost seems to me like Sam Yule Jackson\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nis some kind of intergalactic\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nlottery winner.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nI'm not saying that in the sense of like,\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\noh, he's a bad actor or whatever.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nI just mean like, where he is\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nwhen he is there,\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nit just seems like he won a contest,\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nlike he's just getting the VIP tour of a life.\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nI was like,\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nI'm gonna be in Star Wars.\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nI'm a Jedi.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nHey, Iron Man,\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nyou're gonna be an Avenger.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nThis prison food\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\ntastes great.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nWhoa, I got an Oscar.\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nHe might have nine Oscars,\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nhe might have zero out of no idea,\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nbut he's like drifting through,\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nhe's like Sirens of Titan,\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:19.000\nhe's like a Vonnegut character.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nHe's just having fun.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nHe's like, you wanna hear about sharks?\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nHere's ice, and a shark eats them.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nBut he's out of the whole shitty movie.\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nThere's snakes on the plane.\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nI don't have to tell you what he's done.\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nYou guys aren't agreeing with me?\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nNo, I agree.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nLike more than any other actor?\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nIf you were an alien species\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nand you wanted to ride a human actor\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nthrough Earth,\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nwould you choose Richard Dreyfus?\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nIt's

it.\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nAll right.\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nTie it into America.\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nYes.\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nI feel in a crazy way\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nwe are tying it into America.\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nDo you want any more time?\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nYou get applause for one sentence.\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nI just feel that pineapple\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nis just one of the fruits\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nthat it just doesn't make sense to me.\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nLike, watermelon,\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nI mean, it's not just because I'm black,\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nbut I just like watermelon.\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nTime's up and that was getting complicated.\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nSecretary of Defense,\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nOkay,\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nso why don't I ever ask\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nnames if I'm never going to remember them?\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nHunter.\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nHunter.\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nYou're going to go pro pineapple?\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nAlright, start, go.\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nI want to tie it into the theme of the show,\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nthe Precision Magic.\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nThe film\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nis like a magic trick\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.260\nthen I'm gonna go with ham pizza.\n\n01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.000\nYou start with it, so you're not looking at it,\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.520\nyou get the saltiness.\n\n01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.920\nAnd you're like, oh, this is really good.\n\n01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.520\nI hope it's not all one note, and you keep having it,\n\n01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.760\nand you're like, oh, it's a little bit of dairy,\n\n01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.520\na little bit of a nice bland flavor,\n\n01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.400\nand then it mixes it up, like a one-two punch with pineapple.\n\n01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.800\nAnd you're like, oh, it's a different texture,\n\n01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.600\nand it's sweet, and it leaves me with this whole point\n\n01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.440\nall along, and this is what I expected.\n\n01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.680\nSame with the reverse point, you're like,\n\n01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.040\noh, it's all this sweet pizza, I'm not really used to it,\n\n01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.520\nand then you get the salt after, and you're like,\n\n01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.080\noh my god, it's so many flavors packed into one,\n\n01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.280\nand you're like, I can't even believe it.\n\n01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280\nOh my god.\n\n01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280\nIt's very true.\n\n01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280\nRight.\n\n01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:23.840\nAnd so, Dan, you're con, right?\n\n01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.840\nI'm con.\n\n01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.840\nI'm con.\n\n01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.840\nSo why don't you round us out?\n\n01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.840\nWell, okay, I'm gonna do it.\n\n01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.840\nCool, cool.\n\n01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.840\nI'm gonna do.\n\n01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.400\nWait, do you know that The Prestige is a movie,\n\n01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.000\nand it also has magic in it?\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nYeah.\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nOkay.\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nSo we can do like a magic?\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.640\nA bunch of us apparently were like, why, why are you bringing\n\n01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.640\nthat up?\n\n01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.200\nBecause you can't talk about everything.\n\n01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:46.760\nI clearly times it a premium on my show.\n\n01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.360\nTwo points of a triangle.\n\n01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.920\nIt was like, where's the apex?\n\n01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920\nWhat do you mean, where's the impact?\n\n01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.960\nNo, it was like, it was like two points of a triangle, and\n\n01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.960\nlike, where's the apex?\n\n01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.960\nRight now.\n\n01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:56.960\nWe're at the apex.\n\n01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.520\nWe all thought, we all thought you had like a big, good like\n\n01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.000\nChris Nolan point coming.\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.520\nBut you're looking up from a certain perspective, like if you\n\n01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.920\nknew from my perspective, you'd be like, oh yeah, like every\n\n01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.560\nsingle thing I talk about is like one third of something I\n\n01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.800\nwas trying to get to.\n\n01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.760\nSo I never, I mean, I probably would have talked about, I\n\n01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.560\nwanted to talk about like, oh, Spencer, what would we, I don't\n\n01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.480\nknow where the fuck we got off track, but it was like, the\n\n01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.000\nidea was like, we're on track, we're on track.\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.040\nAnyway, sorry, sorry, but no, I'm trying, I'm coming back around\n\n01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.040\na year.\n\n01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.040\nYeah, you're right.\n\n01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.040\nIt is weird.\n\n01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040\nI would have, I would have come around to that topic.\n\n01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.040\nI would have.\n\n01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.040\nNo, you wouldn't know.\n\n01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.040\nI didn't mean to shame you.\n\n01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.040\nAll right.\n\n01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.440\nBut I am now about to shame you.\n\n01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.440\nOkay, here we go.\n\n01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.680\nLet's keep this to a minute.\n\n01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.080\nAll right, so here's the thing.\n\n01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.080\nIt's pizza.\n\n01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.080\nOkay.\n\n01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:49.520\nNow, my partner sounded a little xenophobic, so like, it's\n\n01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:50.760\nlike, oh, I hate it.\n\n01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.160\nIt's like, let's talk about what a pizza is.\n\n01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.600\nIs it sweet?\n\n01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.960\nIs it in the dessert section of the menu?\n\n01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.760\nOr are you ordering a greasy, salty, cheesy, bready thing?\n\n01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.680\nToo many people look at pizza as if it's an opportunity to express\n\n01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.680\nthemselves.\n\n01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.640\nAnd not enough people just order something other than pizza.\n\n01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.400\nBe that person at the party that says, you know what?\n\n01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.960\nI can't like pizza.\n\n01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.680\nI'd like a chicken barbecue pineapple salad.\n\n01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.880\nOh, Anthony's at the party.\n\n01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.120\nAnthony, eat pizza.\n\n01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.840\nStop disrupting the party.\n\n01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.760\nYou've infected the culture.\n\n01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.480\nYou've infected my soul.\n\n01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.880\nThat was exactly one minute.\n\n01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:53.360\nAll right, so I have an unfair weight, literally and figuratively.\n\n01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360\nWe can't take a vote.\n\n01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.240\nWe're going to walk away going, what does it matter?\n\n01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.440\nWhy can we not take a vote?\n\n01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.920\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.920\nPhysical challenge.\n\n01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.240\nI think, wait, before we make it binary and like, let's make it\n\n01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.240\nconstructive, because here's one thing that I'd like to point out.\n\n01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:16.440\nHow many of you here hearing these two are having second thoughts\n\n01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.120\nabout pineapple's merit on a pizza?\n\n01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.120\nNo.\n\n01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.120\nOh, Jesus.\n\n01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120\nOkay.\n\n01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.400\nToo many handsome people have raised their hands.\n\n01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:30.000\nI found myself going, like, why am I blocking all this passion?\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.400\nYou guys did a good job, I think, of making it a positive thing.\n\n01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.720\nBut then again, it's about advocating for a fucking ridiculous prop on\n\n01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.360\ntop of a pizza.\n\n01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.720\nIt's not like you could take a negative position and go, like, it's\n\n01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.920\npizza and Steve, not pizza and...\n\n01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.080\nThere's nothing you can do that doesn't sound positive.\n\n01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080\nI will say that.\n\n01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.680\nLike, you get to sound like fucking woke by going, like, why not try new shit?\n\n01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.120\nThat's why I was going, like, because it's pizza, motherfuck.\n\n01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.240\nAll right.\n\n01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.960\nSo, I mean, it doesn't need to be a result.\n\n01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:02.960\nI mean, we got to...\n\n01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.960\nWe'll make it official.\n\n01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.960\nI know.\n\n01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:05.960\nAll right.\n\n01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.960\nThe question is...\n\n01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:07.960\nThat's outlawed.\n\n01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.960\nThe question is, should it exist?\n\n01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.960\nApplaud if you accept pineapple on pizza.\n\n01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.960\nThey're vocal.\n\n01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:12.960\nThey're vocal.\n\n01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.640\nThat sounds like trying too hard.\n\n01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:26.120\nApplaud if you refuse to let pizza be violated.\n\n01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.000\nThis is why America's going to die.\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.880\nDo we beat Truman all over again?\n\n01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.160\nAll Donald Trump does.\n\n01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.160\nIt's like, easy.\n\n01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:39.560\nLike, applaud if you just want huge, huge, very, very strong pizza.\n\n01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.560\nBut I...\n\n01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.560\nYeah, when you...\n\n01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.560\nYeah, I don't...\n\n01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.560\nYeah.\n\n01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.560\nIt's easy.\n\n01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.560\nIt's stickier.\n\n01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560\nNegative things are stickier.\n\n01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.560\nIt's easier.\n\n01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.560\nWhen I was in debate in high school, I was on the negative.\n\n01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.560\nDid you do debate?\n\n01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.560\nYeah, I did debate.\n\n01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.560\nI don't mean to...\n\n01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.560\nIt's a racist stereotype.\n\n01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.560\nSorry.\n\n01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:59.040\nI don't mean to assume, black girls, debate, captain.\n\n01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.800\nCan I say one thing about this real quick?\n\n01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.240\nCan I say one thing, or is that...\n\n01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.240\nI hope...\n\n01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.240\nYeah, but I mean...\n\n01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.240\nI feel like...\n\n01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.960\nBut what if what you say is, Hitler was right?\n\n01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:08.960\nNo.\n\n01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:14.360\nAnd then I'm like, you said, yes, you can speak, but I want to judge what you said.\n\n01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.360\nNo, yeah, absolutely.\n\n01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.360\nSo you know recently you were talking about...\n\n01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.360\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.360\nNo, I'm sorry.\n\n01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.360\nI'm so drunk in high school.\n\n01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.360\nSorry.\n\n01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.360\nGo ahead.\n\n01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.080\nI mean, there's a lot of theory theories and how it's easier to work from the back end\n\n01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.480\nof it, where you work from what's there, and then you say, oh, I can work against what's\n\n01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.480\nbeen said.\n\n01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.800\nIt's kind of the same with negative points.\n\n01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.960\nIt's easier to find negative points than something.\n\n01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.960\nWell, that's the tough thing.\n\n01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.960\nYeah.\n\n01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.960\nWhen we do debate in high school, there was the affirmative...\n\n01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960\nAffirmative?\n\n01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960\nAffirmative, yeah.\n\n01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.960\nAffirmative, negative.\n\n01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.280\nYou had to come up with a plan if you were affirmative, prison overcrowding, oh, the negative\n\n01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:50.600\nyou would just show up and be like, we had a recipe box full of negative evidence cards.\n\n01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.480\nIt didn't even matter what the topic was, you just pull out Alan Greenspan says we're\n\n01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.600\nheaded for a recession.\n\n01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.280\nYou're armed with that when you don't want anything done.\n\n01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:09.560\nWell, first of all, Alan Greenspan says we're headed for a recession, except when we are.\n\n01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:14.520\nIt was just like prison overcrowding, you're proposing we build a biodome, well, Alan Greenspan\n\n01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.120\nsays we won't have the money, I bid you good day.\n\n01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.200\nYeah, it's easier to be negative.\n\n01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.200\nIt's easier to keep your pizza pure.\n\n01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:26.840\nI feel like if you have that variety in your life of more open-minded to accept, it's like\n\n01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.400\nsoup sort of, like people hate putting all the shit in soup, but it's like...\n\n01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.200\nWho hates putting all the shit in soup?\n\n01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:35.040\nOh, come on, there are people, there are people.\n\n01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:42.160\nI mean, yes, so, well, there's a core human problem, we're a rich empire, we have this\n\n01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:48.760\nlike at least successfully illusory freedom, if not actual, that's it, we have it pretty\n\n01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:55.720\ngood, like, so we have these opinions, and then you go, oh, am I defending the underdog\n\n01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:02.760\nif I say, hey, come on, it was like that yesterday, give it a break, don't complicate it.\n\n01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.760\nI make that guy sound like a teamster, so he sounds wrong, unless I was at a union meeting\n\n01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.880\nand then they'd be like, yeah, that sounds like God's no, they'd be like, fuck you, you\n\n01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.320\nthink that's what we sound like?\n\n01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:21.560\nBut if you also said like, hey, mine's gotta be open, you know, you gotta close mine, tough\n\n01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:27.360\ntitty, welcome to America, love it or leave it, you know, like, I think that's like, people\n\n01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:31.520\ndon't know where to punch and where to deflect, they don't know when they're the underdog\n\n01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:36.240\nand when they're the alpha, you always feel like the underdog, I always, you know, I\n\n01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.840\ndon't have a point here, it's just like when you're saying like, why don't you put pineapple\n\n01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:47.440\non pizza, like, why wouldn't you, yeah, absolutely, and then everyone's worried, I think the fear\n\n01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.480\nis that if you put pineapple on pizza and like everyone keeps saying they like it with\n\n01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.160\nnobody saying this is bullshit, that all of a sudden one day pineapple will be part of\n\n01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:00.480\npizza whether you like it or not, I think that is the genuine fear, which is also kind\n\n01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:06.160\nof ridiculous, I think that that is like, what the problem is, that's the engine of\n\n01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:12.680\nhumanity that people go like, well, what's next, book burning? I'm not giving up, mind\n\n01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:20.880\ncomp finally, you can't burn it, it's the slippery pineapple slope, yeah, all right, so anyways,\n\n01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:25.120\nsince we have you up there, why is everyone, I mean, it's the answer is because you're\n\n01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.320\ngood people, why are you talking, it's hot, all right, it's hot, but it's really hot,\n\n01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:36.940\nare they just saying it's hot? No, they're just brawl and winches. Is it like dog's\n\n01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:39.480\npanting? That's what I'm saying. I'm gonna show them, I'm gonna show them.

but horses aren't vicious.\n\n01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:32.940\nYou want a single opponent.\n\n01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.980\nEven if it's a large duck, it's still a fucking duck.\n\n01:23:37.980 -->

01:24:34.220\nThey're not going to fuck you up.\n\n01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.060\nThey're going to run.\n\n01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.900\nI agree.\n\n01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:39.460\nIf they're the size of ducks,\n\n01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:41.820\nI'm going to laugh while they're running.\n\n01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:44.300\nYeah!\n\n01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.540\nThey're going to wave at them.\n\n01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:48.660\nUnless they're the horse-sized ducks.\n\n01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.140\nThat's true.\n\n01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:54.860\nYeah, so what if it was, what if you had

way or the other.\n\n01:27:54.340 --> 01:28:02.420\nAnd instead, you chose to make him the luckiest Long Beach\n\n01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:08.020\nHarbin Town fan in the Three Black Radius\n\n01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.500\nfor the next three to five months.\n\n01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.060\nYeah.\n\n01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:14.260\nStatistics, say.\n\n01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.420\nHow is your life at LA?\n\n01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:23.100\nCan we ask you personal questions?\n\n01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.100\nYeah, sure, you can actually ask me personal questions.\n\n01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:26.060\nWhat do you do for rent paying?\n\n01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:31.940\nWell, I used to work for the government.\n\n01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:32.660\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:37.940\nI don't even know if I could talk about it on here,\n\n01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.060\nbut I feel like it's fine.\n\n01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.300\nI used to work for them.\n\n01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:44.020\nBut now I work at a medical office in Santa Monica,\n\n01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:47.740\nwhich is OK, but.\n\n01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.820\nA medical office, so people come in and they go,\n\n01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:52.020\nI might be sick at some point.\n\n01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:54.620\nYeah, they call in, and then we're like, we might be sick.\n\n01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:56.020\nAnd I'm like, well, we don't have.\n\n01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.140\nMaybe we should go to the emergency room.\n\n01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.460\nWe don't have the means to help you, but.\n\n01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.860\nMaybe you should go to the emergency room,\n\n01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.820\nand they're like, no, I don't want to.\n\n01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.100\nI'm like, I don't know what I can do.\n\n01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:10.660\nSo it's just a place that you tell them to go elsewhere?\n\n01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.020\nI want to open up one of those.\n\n01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:14.020\nNo.\n\n01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:15.420\nYeah, no.\n\n01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:18.100\nIt's not like that, but if we mostly\n\n01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:20.500\ndeal with primary care, so if it's\n\n01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.980\nlike a huge of medical emergency,\n\n01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:25.460\nit's like you definitely should go to an ER.\n\n01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.900\nSome people come in and they go, my hand is gone.\n\n01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:33.620\nAnd you're like, well, I've got a stapler and a phone.\n\n01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.980\nHi, I don't have any problems.\n\n01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:37.340\nWell, you've come to the right place.\n\n01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:47.340\nDoes it represent any kind of like,\n\n01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:50.580\nhow close is this to your, what's your fantasy\n\n01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:53.100\nabout your career path, your vocation, your role?\n\n01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.460\nI don't even want to pin you down.\n\n01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.180\nMaybe you want to be the vapor of light,\n\n01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.340\nbut what would you hope would happen\n\n01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:05.500\nfrom your very limited time on this earth?\n\n01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.700\nWell, I would like to be a doctor in the future.\n\n01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.260\nAll right, medical office seems like, yeah,\n\n01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.620\nit's like the mail room of probably, I'm assuming,\n\n01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.740\nI don't know, my cartoonish understanding\n\n01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:15.980\nof the medical industry.\n\n01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:19.700\nHere you go, doctor, there's three sick people for you today.\n\n01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:22.500\nBoy, I stayed up all night sorting them.\n\n01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.140\nI arranged them from sick to sickish.\n\n01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.940\nHope you have a great Father's Day.\n\n01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:31.420\nA young man, what are these?\n\n01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:35.260\nI'm not a young man, I'm a young black woman.\n\n01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.380\nI just happen to talk like this, because Dean Hyman can only\n\n01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:43.260\nunderstand young Jewish men in a mail room.\n\n01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.220\nHe was raised on 60s musicals.\n\n01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:52.860\nThere's some blackboard medical problem that she solves.\n\n01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:59.460\nI didn't hear that, but what's your name again?\n\n01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:00.060\nRalph Hunter.\n\n01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.220\nHunter, yeah.\n\n01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:05.620\nAll right, Ralph was not a good guess.\n\n01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.100\nAll right, what do you do?\n\n01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:08.740\nHard to follow, what do you do?\n\n01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:10.780\nComputer, software engineer.\n\n01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:13.940\nOh, sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.420\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:19.260\nComputer, software, engineer, sounded suspicious.\n\n01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:21.820\nI don't believe that you have a job, or.\n\n01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:22.580\nNo, yeah, I worry.\n\n01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:25.220\nYou have to prove you're not a murderer.\n\n01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.940\nWhat do you want me to say?\n\n01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:27.740\nGPL.\n\n01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:32.700\nNo, I'll give him my own test to see if he's a murderer.\n\n01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:37.620\nLet's say she's getting a bucket.\n\n01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.660\nWhat does she put in it?\n\n01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.780\nIn what order?\n\n01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:42.900\nOK.\n\n01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:46.940\nLet's say she has lotion.\n\n01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:48.020\nOh, now you, really?\n\n01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:49.420\nOK.\n\n01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:50.780\nThat's what tipped it in.\n\n01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:54.580\nOK, all right, I feel like a fucking idiot.\n\n01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.660\nAll right.\n\n01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:58.340\nHe's a basket, right?\n\n01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.340\nA basket, a bucket.\n\n01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:00.060\nHe's a basket.\n\n01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.740\nAll right, I'm on your side.\n\n01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:04.260\nI'm a piece of shit.\n\n01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:05.140\nOK, thank you.\n\n01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.740\nWell, that's better news than you think.\n\n01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.500\nI didn't want to think that there\n\n01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:12.060\nwas some kind of weird gauze between a reference\n\n01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:12.980\nand it going in the hoop.\n\n01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:15.420\nI'm glad I had it fundamentally wrong.\n\n01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.180\nThank you, all right.\n\n01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:19.540\nSo it says you're going to need a bigger bus.\n\n01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:27.140\nAll right, your name was Alon, Horpo?\n\n01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:27.860\nHunter, yeah.\n\n01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.340\nOK.\n\n01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.340\nHorpo.\n\n01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:33.300\nIt wasn't even a good guess.\n\n01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:37.980\nI had to pass over Hunter to fake guess Horpo.\n\n01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:40.900\nIt's just bullying.\n\n01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:42.500\nBecause it's Hunter's a cool name.\n\n01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.100\nThanks, man.\n\n01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.260\nI want to take it away from you.\n\n01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.340\nIt's a cool name.\n\n01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:52.300\nIt sounds literally like a hunter.\n\n01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.860\nYeah, sticking that, too.\n\n01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.300\nIt's like if your name was Fireman.\n\n01:32:55.300 --> 01:33:04.100\nLike, it's cheating.\n\n01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:04.820\nIt's what it is.\n\n01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:05.860\nIt's cheating.\n\n01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.780\nYour parents cheated.\n\n01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:10.300\nIt's Senator James Harmon.\n\n01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:17.740\nOK, well, what are you doing and what do you want to do?\n\n01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.500\nYeah, so right now I write computer software\n\n01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:22.140\nfor a company out in Santa Monica.\n\n01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:22.740\nLie.\n\n01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:25.740\nYeah.\n\n01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:28.180\nYeah, what I would want to do would be, I don't know.\n\n01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:29.180\nShoot animals for some reason.\n\n01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:30.860\nShoot animals, yeah.\n\n01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:33.660\nOr keep women in a huge hole in my basement.\n\n01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:35.340\nEither one.\n\n01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.940\nIt's probably like teaching or like physics, professor,\n\n01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:38.540\nsomething like that.\n\n01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:39.620\nIt might be fun.\n\n01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.140\nBoth teachers.\n\n01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:44.540\nYeah, you would want to like, but specifically,\n\n01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:45.740\nyou'd want to teach science.\n\n01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:47.460\nWhat if someone said you could be\n\n01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:49.980\na teacher, but you have to teach bubblegum?\n\n01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:50.740\nI'd probably be OK.\n\n01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.660\nI'd probably get to teach the shit out of bubblegum.\n\n01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.460\nReally?\n\n01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.380\nBut really, that your passion for education\n\n01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:58.140\nis so high that you're like, yeah, it's OK if it's not physics.\n\n01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:01.300\nYeah, so it's something that came across at work.\n\n01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.980\nWhat if you had to teach racism?\n\n01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.380\nAnd not awareness of it.\n\n01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:08.420\nYou had to teach how to be racist.\n\n01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.220\nWhat if that form came through?\n\n01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.260\nGod damn it.\n\n01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.860\nWhat are they going to give me the job I want?\n\n01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:15.500\nI love physics.\n\n01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.860\nIt's like some vacuum tube pill comes through\n\n01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.540\nand just opens up racism.\n\n01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:21.620\nNo, I'm sorry.\n\n01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.980\nI've gone off on my funny little flights of fancy.\n\n01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:27.260\nSay what you were going to say before I forgot\n\n01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:28.940\nwhat was going on.\n\n01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.060\nNo, no, that's about it.\n\n01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.940\nYeah, I do computer software now.\n\n01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:35.060\nI'd probably want to teach, but not getting my hopes up.\n\n01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:35.540\nAll right.\n\n01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.380\nAnd yeah.\n\n01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:37.940\nGlorietta, what are you doing?\n\n01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:38.660\nEmily.\n\n01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:39.140\nEmily?\n\n01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.900\nI just jumped in.\n\n01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:44.380\nI don't.\n\n01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:45.380\nI'm just bad.\n\n01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:47.380\nI'm just a bad, I don't.\n\n01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.340\nNames and faces can't do it.\n\n01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:49.820\nJuilliard?\n\n01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:56.620\nI loved you in that school.\n\n01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.260\nThank you.\n\n01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.100\nHunter.\n\n01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.540\nHunter, all right.\n\n01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.100\nI was about to say doctor.\n\n01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.660\nThat's how fast it happens.\n\n01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:09.300\nOK, Gwen.\n\n01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:10.060\nEmily.\n\n01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:11.060\nDiane.\n\n01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:14.460\nTriscuit.\n\n01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:20.540\nTrap, trap, trap, trap, Travis Johnson, the third.\n\n01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:21.980\nDaphne.\n\n01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:23.140\nJennifer.\n\n01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.540\nHaar, Christian.\n\n01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:26.220\nMy name is Emily Carmichael.\n\n01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.980\nEmily.\n\n01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:28.540\nThank you.\n\n01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:30.220\nI love your dress, by the way.\n\n01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:31.300\nI've been in the red.\n\n01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:32.860\nI mean, not your dress is awesome.\n\n01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:33.860\nAwesome.\n\n01:35:33.860 -->

nightmare.\n\n01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.500\nOh, it is.\n\n01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.540\nIt's telling somebody you like their dress,\n\n01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.740\nand then somebody else is upset.\n\n01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:55.660\nNo, I'm not the ally you want.\n\n01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:58.180\nYou both look really good.\n\n01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:00.140\nI saw what happened there, and I was immediately,\n\n01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.180\nI was like, that's me.\n\n01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:01.940\nThat's a how.\n\n01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:15.540\nAll right, so Korra, what are you doing?\n\n01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:18.020\nWhat do you want to do, in any order, at any length,\n\n01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:22.660\nin any accent from Norwegian to Spanish?\n\n01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:25.980\nJust kidding, on the last part, just a little drunk.\n\n01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:26.980\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:28.140\nWhat do you want to do?\n\n01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:30.620\nI direct future films, and I want\n\n01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:32.220\nto direct future films.\n\n01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.220\nWhat?\n\n01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.220\nWhat?\n\n01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:35.580\nPrivilege.\n\n01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:37.900\nPrivilege.\n\n01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.580\nYou have everything.\n\n01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:42.740\nWhy don't you go yell at bartenders?\n\n01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.860\nDream follower.\n\n01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:46.940\nIndustry hack.\n\n01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:49.980\nKills a realizer of dreams.\n\n01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.900\nI have a totally unrelated thing,\n\n01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.460\nwhich is that there is a person in this audience who I'm not\n\n01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:56.940\ngoing to look at, because I don't want to make them feel\n\n01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:57.820\ncalled out.\n\n01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:59.860\nBut there is somebody in this audience\n\n01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:02.540\nwho's just watching this show with just like a bottle of\n\n01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:04.380\nJameson at their foot.\n\n01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.820\nAnd can that person help me?\n\n01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:09.500\nDoes that person have a cup?\n\n01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:10.940\nDoes that person want to share?\n\n01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.700\nAgain, not looking.\n\n01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.580\nAgain, if you wanted to just sit that one out,\n\n01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.500\nyou could have done that.\n\n01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:20.900\nYou didn't have to like name yourself.\n\n01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:24.580\nThat was just a freebie, you know?\n\n01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.300\nEverybody, this is Annie, whose name I'm not going to forget.\n\n01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:28.940\nShe's her mansplain.\n\n01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.220\nAnnie.\n\n01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.820\nDo you need help with that, Annie?\n\n01:37:32.820 -->

while.\n\n01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.380\nDo you need help?\n\n01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.180\nOh, OK, there you go.\n\n01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:09.700\nWhat happens when you ask?\n\n01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:12.900\nYeah, yeah, here, you sit down, I'll get to you.\n\n01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:15.820\nLet's give a hand to Dr. Horpo.\n\n01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:23.700\nDr. Horpo.\n\n01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:26.620\nJust for you to keep in scar, the pro-pineapple people,\n\n01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:29.940\nmuch more inclusive and open-minded.\n\n01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:34.100\nWe're clearly just like, fuck everyone.\n\n01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:36.540\nI don't mean to lump you in with me, but it's all I got.\n\n01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.500\nAll I'm saying is double pepperoni, bacon, and pineapple.\n\n01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:40.500\nAmazing.\n\n01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.980\nI bet that sounds good.\n\n01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:44.020\nWait, Canadian bacon or bacon bacon?\n\n01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:44.620\nNo, bacon bacon.\n\n01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.140\nOK, I'm on board.\n\n01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:47.980\nI'm very glad I asked you onto the stage.\n\n01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:50.140\nSmokiness of bacon, and then the pepperoni\n\n01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.580\nand the spiciness in the pineapple.\n\n01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:53.740\nOh my god.\n\n01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.460\nI am a little high in jerk myself.\n\n01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:56.300\nOK, OK.\n\n01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:59.180\nI feel like more for my brain.\n\n01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:01.180\nI always picture you as a kind of a clean cut.\n\n01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:02.300\nDid I cause this in you?\n\n01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:03.580\nAre you just a high drunk person now,\n\n01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:04.900\nbecause you listen to the podcast?\n\n01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:05.980\nOh, definitely not.\n\n01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:07.900\nOK, OK, thank you.\n\n01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.020\nYeah, you did not corrupt me in any way, shape or form.\n\n01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.340\nBut I did take you from a walker to a cane, right?\n\n01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:16.100\nLike, I cured your spinal stenosis.\n\n01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:18.380\nYes, that was entirely you're doing, Dan.\n\n01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:23.300\nYou just killed me up out of the mud.\n\n01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.220\nI was like, oh my god.\n\n01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:29.620\nI am no longer disabled, because Dan has shown me the way.\n\n01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:31.300\nYes, thank you.\n\n01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.140\nWait, are you disabled?\n\n01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.140\nYes, yes I am.\n\n01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.340\nOK, how does that work?\n\n01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:39.020\nMy spine is collapsing.\n\n01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:42.820\nYeah, I know it was hard, because the last time\n\n01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.940\nyou tried to talk to me was at South by Southwest\n\n01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.220\nwhen we couldn't hear anything.\n\n01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.020\nYeah, it was a nightmare.\n\n01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.860\nYeah, that was a nightmare episode.\n\n01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:52.420\nBut yeah, for new viewers or whoever,\n\n01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:58.380\nReal Annie is like, well, I don't know how to qualify it.\n\n01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:02.420\nBut like, huge community fan, particularly of Annie's character,\n\n01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:04.820\nhad a blog, how to dress like Annie.\n\n01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:09.220\nAnnie dresses like this, dot org dot edu slash Annie.\n\n01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:10.420\nI saw that.\n\n01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:11.860\nAnnie's clothes.\n\n01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:14.060\nSaw that.\n\n01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.460\nIt didn't go far.\n\n01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:19.340\nAnd I think at South by, you had like, it was like a walker,\n\n01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:19.780\nright?\n\n01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:20.380\nYeah, I was doing like a page.\n\n01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:22.500\nBecause you have spinal stenosis.\n\n01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.660\nYeah, I have degenerative spinal stenosis\n\n01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.140\nand degenerative disc disease.\n\n01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:29.820\nAnd now I also have arthritis in my upper spine,\n\n01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:33.620\nas well as collapsing discs in my thoraxes.\n\n01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:35.380\nWell, you needed humbling.\n\n01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:36.460\nYeah.\n\n01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.660\nIt was god, the spinal stenosis was going to your head.\n\n01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.340\nI found myself thinking, boy, she\n\n01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.620\nneeds to be taken down a peg.\n\n01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:42.740\nI hope she gets arthritis.\n\n01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:44.020\nIt's true.\n\n01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:46.260\nThe arthritis really did it for me.\n\n01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:47.020\nIt just really hit me.\n\n01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:48.660\nYou finally thought, maybe, you know what,\n\n01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:49.660\nI should clean up my act.\n\n01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:51.540\nYeah.\n\n01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.660\nWell, how did you go from a walker to a cane?\n\n01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:58.340\nBecause I said to myself, well, self,\n\n01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:02.300\nI don't like this walker.\n\n01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:04.140\nAnd it was actually starting.\n\n01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.540\nSo my arthritis was spreading up into my neck.\n\n01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:10.860\nAnd it was starting to spread into my shoulders.\n\n01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:15.020\nAnd so, and I asked my doctor, why is that?\n\n01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:18.500\nAnd he said, one of the reasons that is\n\n01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:21.020\nis because when you walk on a walker,\n\n01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.620\nyou kind of have to push down on it a little bit.\n\n01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:27.500\nAnd so when you're walking forward,\n\n01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.260\nyou sort of give it this pressure.\n\n01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.980\nYou're hunching forward, kind of.\n\n01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:33.740\nYou were using your walker as a crutch.\n\n01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:36.740\nRight.\n\n01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.300\nAnd they called you out on it.\n\n01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:39.820\nIt's exactly.\n\n01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:44.140\nIt's like you need it to help you walk or something.\n\n01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:48.660\nSo I said, fuck that.\n\n01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:52.860\nAnd which is not unlike what I said to Dan,\n\n01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:54.460\nif any of you remember that episode.\n\n01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:57.020\nIt's the same exact way she said it.\n\n01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:58.820\nExactly.\n\n01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:02.860\nAnd so I just said, OK, I'm going to start using my cane more.\n\n01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:06.100\nAnd so what the doctor said was, and this is probably\n\n01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:08.020\nthe best thing I've ever heard in my life,\n\n01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:10.260\nwas if you're going to use your cane more,\n\n01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:13.540\nyou're going to have to take more pain pills.\n\n01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:17.300\nAnd I'm like, wait a minute, why was I not doing this sooner?\n\n01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:18.700\nWhat's the downside?\n\n01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:20.060\nYeah.\n\n01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:22.460\nCan my cane be one of those Christmas\n\n01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.340\ncanes filled with the pain pills?\n\n01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:24.820\nRight.\n\n01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:32.780\nI'm like, if I get rid of it, do I get more?\n\n01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:34.300\nIs it a reward system?\n\n01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:35.860\nRight.\n\n01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:38.820\nIt's like those billboards for AIDS where it says,\n\n01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:42.580\nwould you rather wear one of these or take all these pills?\n\n01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:43.580\nPills.\n\n01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:44.580\nYeah.\n\n01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:45.260\nAre you crazy?\n\n01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.980\nI'm like, was this a hard question?\n\n01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:50.980\nI was actually, I've been taking one drug,\n\n01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:53.980\nand he says, oh, my doctor said, well,\n\n01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:58.180\nmy physical medicine doctor said, oh, you could also\n\n01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:01.140\nbe taking this pill, which makes you lose weight\n\n01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.180\nautomatically.\n\n01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:05.900\nAnd I said, why didn't you give me that in the first place?\n\n01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:08.220\nWhy didn't she give me that in the first place?\n\n01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:12.100\nRight, I was like, what made you take a year to give me this?\n\n01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:14.620\nI mean, it just was unbelievable.\n\n01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:17.860\nThis one attacks your pain, but the side effects\n\n01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:22.940\nare heightened IQ, super jumping,\n\n01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:26.900\nand pineapples on pizza.\n\n01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:30.140\nAbility to, you'll have a portable hole.\n\n01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:31.220\nIt's our look it up.\n\n01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:35.380\nIt's a D&D thing, a bag of holding.\n\n01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:38.300\nDon't put them in each other.\n\n01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:39.180\nOh, unbelievable.\n\n01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:43.500\nNo, unless you want to level a castle.\n\n01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.220\nWhat do you think about that from time to time?\n\n01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:49.420\nJulie, you've been awfully quiet.\n\n01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:56.060\nI'll give you one minute to be for or against Annie's health.\n\n01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:56.660\nAre you doing it?\n\n01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:57.660\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.660\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:02.420\nBe against it.\n\n01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:04.300\nIt's so easy to be negative.\n\n01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:07.140\nDoes that mean current health or eventual health?\n\n01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:08.140\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.380\nMy joke, obviously, was that I'm a terrible host,\n\n01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:13.460\nand I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:19.460\nWhat do you guys think about all this war?\n\n01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:23.460\nWe got 10 minutes.\n\n01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:26.100\nIt's fine.\n\n01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:27.340\nOK, guns.\n\n01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:37.020\nHey, why don't we talk about your girlfriend's titties?\n\n01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:40.500\nThat sounds like an urban diss, but what he means\n\n01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:46.020\nis that my girlfriend, she said it was OK to tell about it.\n\n01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.460\nShe said this happens every day.\n\n01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:48.900\nAnd everybody, she found a little lump,\n\n01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:51.420\nand it was like, so we spent that weird lump scare.\n\n01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:54.660\nAnd she went in and got a mammogram.\n\n01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:57.380\nI had seen videos of it, and she was texting me like, man,\n\n01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:00.940\nthey smashed your boob like a tortilla.\n\n01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:03.620\nHow many women?\n\n01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:04.660\nI don't know.\n\n01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:08.380\nI guess, well, I still don't even know what the rules are\n\n01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:09.860\nabout that.\n\n01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:11.620\nWho's got a mammogram?\n\n01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:13.100\nApplaud if you've got a mammogram.\n\n01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.860\nOh my god, that's so weird.\n\n01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:16.540\nWell, I'm not hearing a lot of applause,\n\n01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:19.100\nbut that might mean, I don't know if that means like.\n\n01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:21.100\nUsually they only give them to older women\n\n01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.980\nunless you're particularly susceptible to cancer\n\n01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:25.980\nand or bizarre illness.\n\n01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:28.060\nI understand that, Masha, did you, have you had one?\n\n01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:28.580\nYeah.\n\n01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:30.700\nWhy have you had one?\n\n01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:35.740\nOh, I had a tumor in my ovaries, which got removed.\n\n01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:39.260\nAnd so they were like, hey, let's check these out, yeah.\n\n01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:43.780\nSo, and they mash your booby on a, I saw a video of it.\n\n01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:46.260\nYeah, they like put this two metal plates,\n\n01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:47.740\nand then they just like, they really\n\n01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:49.420\nare like trying to make a tortilla.\n\n01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:53.540\nAnd like, the bigger your boobies are, the more it hurts.\n\n01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.980\nLike, it was funny because like, you know,\n\n01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:57.700\npeople would think, oh, the smaller they are,\n\n01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:00.980\nthe worse it would be, opposite is true.\n\n01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:01.780\nIt's very wrong.\n\n01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:03.020\nYeah, I would have thought that too.\n\n01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:03.860\nHow do you know?\n\n01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:08.340\nHave you tried having smaller breasts when you got one?\n\n01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:13.420\nI did it for a little while in the 90s, and I was like,\n\n01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:14.940\nthat is not for me.\n\n01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:16.020\nI mean, it was the 90s.\n\n01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:17.020\nWe all were.\n\n01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:20.580\nYeah, every girl's had little tits at some point.\n\n01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:24.900\nYeah, I don't recommend it, honestly, you know.\n\n01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:25.400\nI do.\n\n01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.020\nBig breasts, that's, you know, is the best.\n\n01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:28.500\nI hate mine.\n\n01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:32.620\nAre you familiar with the itty bitty, titty committee?\n\n01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.700\nI am.\n\n01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:37.660\nThey're an offshoot of the Bilderberg group.\n\n01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:40.380\nAnd it's said that they run the Eye of Horus, which\n\n01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:43.340\nis a plot of, now you see me, one.\n\n01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:49.060\nAnd at the end of that movie, they go into a glowing carousel.\n\n01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:50.860\nI don't care.\n\n01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:53.620\nGod is spoiled by this movie.\n\n01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:57.900\nAnd I'm telling you, the good guys evaporate\n\n01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.940\ninto a magical mist, and now they're\n\n01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:00.900\ngoing to do a second one.\n\n01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.860\nAre they going to be like, whoa,\n\n01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:08.420\nwe're trans-dimensional magician robbers.\n\n01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:11.820\nOh, help, help, my cart broke down.\n\n01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:14.740\nAnyways, I can't wait.\n\n01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.100\nI can't wait.\n\n01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:18.620\nNow you don't, is what it should be called.\n\n01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:19.740\nBut you can't call it that.\n\n01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:23.500\nI think that when the first one came out, everyone was like,\n\n01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:24.820\nnow you see me.\n\n01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:25.740\nNo, I didn't.\n\n01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:29.580\nSo then they couldn't go that way if they wanted to,\n\n01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:31.260\nbecause that joke was already there undoing.\n\n01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.540\nWell, flying in the face of the theory\n\n01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:37.580\nthat shame would stop them from doing anything\n\n01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:40.260\nis every frame of the movie you're describing.\n\n01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:45.940\nSo the mammogram came out OK.\n\n01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:49.700\nWell, I think it's cool you say, yeah, it hurts.\n\n01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:52.500\nBut now I feel like I'm a guy who\n\n01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:54.100\nhas a podcast that had a girl.\n\n01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:57.500\nI was like, everybody, can you also\n\n01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:00.100\nsay it didn't hurt that much?\n\n01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:00.700\nNo.\n\n01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:03.100\nI'm like, what's your agenda for that?\n\n01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:05.940\nI don't want to be the guy that helped\n\n01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:08.180\nthe platform of mammogram fear.\n\n01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:10.700\nWell, I mean, it's not like it's one of those things\n\n01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:15.260\nwhere it doesn't matter whether or not it hurts.\n\n01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:17.660\nYou want to get the mammograms.\n\n01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:24.220\nSo do you know what is the current party line of it?\n\n01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:26.220\nIs it that you're supposed to self-check?\n\n01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:28.380\nAnd then the mammogram is if you find a lump?\n\n01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:29.260\nIs that the idea?\n\n01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:31.220\nYeah, so you do this thing.\n\n01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:33.100\nYou're supposed to do it in the shower,\n\n01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:36.740\nand then you go in circles around your breasts\n\n01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:37.980\nwhile you're in the shower.\n\n01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.620\nIt's very sensual.\n\n01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:40.100\nI mean.\n\n01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:43.020\nAnd then you're supposed to, they actually,\n\n01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:44.940\nwhen you're in high school, or at least\n\n01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:47.340\nwhen I was in high school, they gave us this fake, tiny\n\n01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:52.940\nbreast, and then it had two lumps.\n\n01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.580\nOne lump you could feel, and the other lump\n\n01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:56.340\nyou could not feel.\n\n01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:57.900\nOh, like the princess of the pea.\n\n01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:58.380\nRight.\n\n01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:06.660\nThe female hero's journeys are about sensitivity.\n\n01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:10.340\nThis woman could bitch about anything.\n\n01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:12.940\nShe's the King Arthur of her gender.\n\n01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:13.660\nThat's fair.\n\n01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:18.420\nYeah, I'm obviously being ironic and saying\n\n01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:20.180\nI'm on your side.\n\n01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:23.220\nYou should have had better hero's journeys than that.\n\n01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:25.940\nSo the purpose of the lump you could not feel\n\n01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:28.940\nwas that it meant that's why you need to get married.\n\n01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:30.820\nOh, they were like, it was like a shitty,\n\n01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.700\nlike, Kobayashi Maru, like, like fucking, like,\n\n01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:35.700\nwhat sound of what?\n\n01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.260\nWhy didn't you pick the finger?\n\n01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:39.860\nI was going to pick my own finger.\n\n01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:43.580\nOh, well, oh, of good, you should be a wizard.\n\n01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:45.020\nYes, Willow is the movie.\n\n01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:47.020\nYes.\n\n01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:48.620\nWell played.\n\n01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:50.940\nOK, all right, breast, check your breasts.\n\n01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:53.340\nThe mammogram came out all right.\n\n01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:56.380\nBut here's the thing about balls.\n\n01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:57.100\nI love balls.\n\n01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.500\nYou don't get to draw a circle around your balls\n\n01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.140\nin a steamy shower.\n\n01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:02.140\nThat sounded hot.\n\n01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:04.460\nLike, that's not what you do when you check your balls.\n\n01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:08.060\nLike, the guys in this audience are holding their balls on.\n\n01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:09.700\nWell, they're more sensitive, right?\n\n01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.900\nWell, it's like, well, there's art\n\n01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.780\non the college stall.\n\n01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:16.500\nThat's the first time you went, in my day,\n\n01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:20.140\nwhen you encountered ball-checking, like, mythology.\n\n01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:23.500\nNo one teaches it until you're in college, in my day.\n\n01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.900\nAnd there's a diagram when you get to college.\n\n01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:29.780\nAnd it's just like these thumb and forefinger.\n\n01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:33.420\nAnd it's just like, to do that to a ball.\n\n01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:35.500\nAnd they're suggesting that you do that in the shower.\n\n01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.500\nIt looks like fucking pogs.\n\n01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.580\nLike, it looks like tiddly winks is being played.\n\n01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:40.620\nLike, it just looks like a fun.\n\n01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:42.660\nAnd like, I'm not doing it.\n\n01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:44.860\nLike, we'll not mush my ball like that.\n\n01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:47.260\nThat doesn't sound pleasant.\n\n01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:48.060\nNo.\n\n01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:50.500\nI mean, now I feel like you're patronizing me.\n\n01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:51.340\nNo, no.\n\n01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:52.780\nI love balls.\n\n01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.940\nOh, thank God, thank God.\n\n01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.500\nNo, no, no, like, I really am.\n\n01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:56.780\nShe seems sincere, yeah.\n\n01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:57.740\nShe seems sincere.\n\n01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:00.860\nThe pain of that ball go through.\n\n01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:03.420\nSo that does not sound pleasant.\n\n01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:05.660\nYeah, but now I feel bad, though.\n\n01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:06.340\nYeah, no.\n\n01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:07.500\nI'm not complaining of it.\n\n01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.060\nMy spine's just collapsing.\n\n01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.060\nWhy do you think?\n\n01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:11.060\nWhy do you think I love balls?\n\n01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:17.620\nSo you were disappointed that your girlfriend didn't have\n\n01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:19.060\ncancer?\n\n01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:21.780\nNo, no.\n\n01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:25.220\nHe's compacting a very, very long, complicated story\n\n01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:27.540\nthat was like, I love Cody so much.\n\n01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:30.340\nIt was like, I was trying to explain this to my therapist.\n\n01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:33.300\nAnd I said to her, I'd never say this out loud.\n\n01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:34.020\nOh, really?\n\n01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:35.620\nBecause it's complicated.\n\n01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:38.300\nI was trying to express a thing.\n\n01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:39.620\nWhy would you bring this up?\n\n01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:41.060\nBecause you said we were going to talk about it.\n\n01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:42.260\nWell, no, I never said that.\n\n01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:44.700\nI didn't say I'd like to talk about this aspect of it.\n\n01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:46.180\nBut it was like, it's hard to explain.\n\n01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:49.380\nIt was like, I found out I love my girlfriend so much\n\n01:51:49.380 -->
