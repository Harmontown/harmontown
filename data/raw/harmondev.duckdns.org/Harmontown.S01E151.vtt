00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, in the Meltdown showroom, Harmontown is now in session.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
I am your Comptroller, Jeff Davis. Please welcome your judging master, Spencer Crittenden, to the stage.

00:21.000 --> 00:33.000
And now please welcome the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Thank you, Jeff Davis everybody.

00:42.000 --> 00:55.000
I was almost going to pull my phone out and put my drink down for a physical ritual that has long oppressed me, but I'm free now.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Dan is presenting the audience his new Apple Watch, what do they call it, Apple Watch?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Yep, I only need to free a hand to swipe.

01:06.000 --> 01:18.000
Ever, ever note, ever note, boop. Here we go, let's talk about Jurassic World.

01:21.000 --> 01:30.000
Or if you prefer, let's talk about the Apple Watch. Oh, grandpa. No one calls him I anymore.

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
Black people aren't I people. They sure aren't Dan. They're just Apple people.

01:40.000 --> 01:52.000
Remember when, we've talked about this 8,000 times, my grandparents think that your grandparents probably too think that black people are supposed to be called colored people, that that is polite.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
You all roll your eyes at that. I roll my eyes at that. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, however.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
Bit of a pickle. Stationary already ordered.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
It's just one of those funny things that happens to a species.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Did you hear about that lady from Tacoma?

02:13.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, I almost didn't. Everybody, yes. The leader of the Spokane Washington chapter of the NAACP was outed by her parents as being a tan white lady.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
After, I don't know how many years. Do we know how many years she successfully, 10?

02:32.000 --> 02:48.000
There's always weird, weird conversations that are happening, which are totally awesome and healthy, especially in the midst of, for instance, you know, the transgender movement, which has everything to do with what you are born as does not define you.

02:48.000 --> 03:01.000
Absolutely not. And then there's an equally, like, totally valid, like, clearly obvious observation that, like, if you were born as a blunt blue-eyed lady, you do not have the right to go to a tanning booth,

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
frizz your hair, and then become the say that you're getting hate mail because you're so black.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
This is all good, in my opinion. This is all fantastic.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
I mean, I'm sure other people have the right to be offended or care way more than I do. As far as I'm concerned, seems like fun.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh, man.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Why not?

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
Everything's fun to us, yeah. That's called privilege. I think that's what they mean when they say check your privilege.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
As long as we don't, like, get involved, we're fine. That's the new political correctness. We just get to say, fuck it.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Like, that's us being the most open-minded we can be. What are you doing?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Jane is here. Earthshine Jane.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
All right.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
What's your last name, George? You want your last name out there?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Just Jane. Earthshine Jane is your Twitter handle, correct?

03:53.000 --> 04:02.000
Aside from the fact that Jane has been the purveyor and distributor for us of fine absence and awesome booze, did you make this glass bottle, too?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I did not. I have a friend who's a master glass blower now.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I designed it, but he made it.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
This is really good. This is fantastic.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
And so I have a bottle of...

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
I mean, sadly, I have the dregs of a bottle of...

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
The rest of it's in the decanter.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Oh, it's in here. You've broken it in half. I love it. Jane, can I do a commercial for Jane's absence?

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
I took this absence of malice to a party, and I actually had about that much.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I had about, like, maybe a little bit more than that.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Brought it to a party where I was dressed as David Bowie, because it was a glam party.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
And you had a David Bowie party.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
I just had one laying around. And I took this to the party, and everybody there wanted to know how to get more of it.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
This stuff is really groovy, and it gets you high.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Why don't we find out how... Jane, do you want to come up and talk or... No.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
It's cool. No.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
There was hesitation there.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Oh, okay. All right. No. Okay. Cool.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Fine. Good. Oh, great.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
We'll talk later on.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
That's great. That's the first time I might get in trouble.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
I'll be getting a whole stick of, like, don't come up if you don't want to come up, actually, finally, like...

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Because I'm always saying it as the prayer.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
By the way, if you don't want to be exploited...

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Well, also, there might be some sort of agencies that might care about that.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
No, there's all kinds of shit. Well, it was just ironically why...

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Which is why there's a story to tell and why I want to talk to you eventually.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
But, like I said, like, tweet me when the adventure is over.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Also, while we're thanking people for gifts, this was sent to me...

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Apparently, it's been here for a month or two.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Tweet me when the adventure is over.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
That's the title of my book.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
That's my wake me for the weekend.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I got this little gift backstage, Dan.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
It's from a person by the hilarious name of Susan Shipper.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
And I was shipped to me first-class U.S. postal.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
And I opened it up and it's a Scottish ski-and-do, which is what you put in your sock if you weren't killed.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Did you mention it was through a rat?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I did not mention that.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
As it came out of the envelope?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
It's a different message.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
It's a weapon. It's a knife that you keep in your sock if you weren't killed.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
But then I was like, why would somebody give me that?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And I looked at it. There's a little emerald on the side here.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
It's an emerald dagger.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I love it.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Is that from a Scottish fan? Is the address in Scotland?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Susan Shipper doesn't sound terribly Scottish, but I love it.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
What is the address? Is there a return address?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Don't say it out loud.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
Well, the wholesale cutlery store in Arlington, Texas.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
All right. This watch is short.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
One of the shortcomings has to do with the settings I programmed into it.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
It vibrates my wrist every time someone tweets at me.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Every time somebody you know tweets you?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Or anytime anybody tweets you?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
You know, you set it up however you want.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I made a mistake.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
I also immediately got all these games on my watch,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
so at any given moment it'll buzz and I'll go like,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
oh, that could be, someone needs a kidney.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
No, Spymaster needs to know if he should face down these dogs.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yes or no.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Do it.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
There's like these games for the watch that are so dumb

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
that they're basically just like some guy, like a fictional guy,

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
buzzes your watch every six hours to let you know he needs more training.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Can you Minecraft?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
No, you can't Minecraft. Everyone stop making fun of me.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Which brings me to a new thing.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
I don't even mean that because I don't take it personally

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
because that's one of the four agreements.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
By Don Miguel Ruiz, which my wife Erin McGathy turned me on to.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
The four agreements, Jeff.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
The audiobook takes less time to listen to than this podcast,

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
which I have not done yet, but I got into the first agreement.

07:46.000 --> 07:54.000
But the four agreements are, god damn this fucking watch.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Spymaster, are you getting a watch?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh, now there's another fucking tweet.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Now people, of course, are tweeting me.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
You guys are great.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
It's like the Simpsons where they're all shocking each other.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I get it. You're amazing.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
That's hilarious.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I'm not going to judge you for it.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
I'm just going to say it doesn't take talent to do what you're doing.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
It's just digital equivalent of throwing a tomato.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
It doesn't take any talent.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
You're creating a culture of fear, which is what I've learned from this book.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
Anyway, so the first agreement is don't train raptors.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
No, I'm getting my notes mixed up.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
The first of the four agreements is,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
and this is the four agreements by Miguel Ruiz.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
The audio book is $10, which is what you paid to get in here.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
It is two hours long, so if you listen...

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
What are the agreements?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
The agreements are.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
First, can I explain what he means by agreement?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Yes, please do.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
He starts with the cosmology.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Everything that we're experiencing right now is a dream.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
That's not new.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
There's a famous song about rowing boats.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I'm not kidding, I was thinking about that on the way here.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
I'm like, God damn, they hide the secret in a fucking plain sight.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's on the back of a cereal box.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Life is but a fucking dream, motherfucker!

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Then we watched The Matrix and we're like, holy shit!

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah, row, row your boat!

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I wanted to say the n-word so bad.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Row, row your boat!

09:36.000 --> 09:45.000
We are all dreaming right now.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
If life were but a dream, why not say the n-word after that?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Because I don't want to pollute that dream for other people,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
because we're in a shared dream also.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Is that one of the agreements?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Don't drop an n-bomb and someone else's dream.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
No, the first agreement is be impeccable with your word,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
and so we'll get to that.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
There's some work on that one.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I'll probably die getting that one right.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
But the idea, the cosmology is, we are all made of light.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
The light between stars.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
Easy to laugh at, young man.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
He's not laughing at that concept.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
He's laughing at you fishing your way through this.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
You don't know him.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Trevor?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
He's laughing at the wrong shit.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I've met him.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
He's three minutes from his next DUI.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
But his dad's a senator, and I'm not bringing him up.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
We're all light.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
What is that?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
What's the implication of that?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Why is that important?

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
It's a model of light.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
What do you mean why is that important?

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Well, is that a necessary principle for the rest of the agreements?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I think so.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Okay, sorry.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
But you could probably do away with it after, I think,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
because it never really comes back to it.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
By the way, don't forget we're all light.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
That's what I'm asking.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I'm just taking you through the guy's whole cosmology.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Thank you.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Do you guys like the format where we bring Spencer up before me?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I thought that was a good choice.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Thank you, thank you.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Why are we saving him for dessert?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I couldn't be more nervous.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Oh, yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I'm sure it really puts a lot more responsibility.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
We have no idea.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
If Spencer is dessert,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Spencer's like the dessert cart laying off the side of the table

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
while you're eating dinner.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
You're eyeing that cake the whole time.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
You get to look at that delicious cake over there.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Spencer, you're like a sexy cannoli sitting over there.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
That sounds good.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
There are some people who are here for the first time

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
and they're wondering, why am I watching this?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I'll tell you, it's for my book reviews.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
What are the goddamn agreements?

12:07.000 --> 12:15.000
The cosmology is we're made of light.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Life is a dream.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
We're all dreaming right now.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
You dream when you go to sleep,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
and yeah, your dog also dreams and he's like,

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
you know, we're dreaming when we're awake too

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
because this is all an illusion.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Obviously, the difference between this dream

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
and the one you have when you're asleep

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
is simply the fact that this one's consistent,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
which makes you think it's more real

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
because it will be here tomorrow,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
but it also means it was here before you were born.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
It's as artificial a reality

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
as the ones that you have when you go to sleep at night.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Life is a dream.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
We all share it, and that doesn't mean bad.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
It doesn't mean less real than important.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Just to put yourself in that space

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
where you think of reality,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
everything that we're living right now as a dream

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
kind of immediately sort of relaxes you

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
and all the great myths that we've ever heard

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
drive into that all of those sacred texts

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
insinuate that, including the Matrix.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
End Inception.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
You love it.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
You love it.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
You do. This guy loves Inception.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Wait, oh my god, the writer of Inceptions here.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I glanced at you and I was like,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
oh shit, I bet you wrote Inception.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Would you stand up and prove...

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Doesn't he look like you wrote Inception?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
He wrote Inception.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Possibly. Or is it a dream?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
I think he also wrote for whom the bell tolls.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I don't know if that was...

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
There's a joke about the power you emanate.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It's all a dream.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
We are indoctrinated in the dream by way of agreements.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
So for the moment you're born, you're making agreements.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Your attention's getting hooked by your parents

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
for good reason. They're telling you,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
this is how you live in this dream.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
This is what the alphabet is. You call that a door.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
You call that a door mat. You call that an elephant.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
You call that an apple.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
You have to...

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
The idea is that human beings are capable

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
of experiencing a thousand things at once.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And of living

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
as if we are living in a dream

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
of constant contradiction

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
and never being certain about anything.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Our brains are designed for that chaos.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
But we won. We took over the Earth

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
and we have created a dream

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
of very, very focused, very artificial things.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And the only

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
problem with it is that reality

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
is obscured

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
by the smoke that we create between all of us.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
We're never actually...

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
He says,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
granted, I listened to this for a half hour

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and I turned it off.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
We're made of light.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
All matter

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
is mirrors.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
It's reflecting the light.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
So every time you're looking at anything with your eyes,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
you're actually seeing something

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
that is simply reflective of something else.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
You're not actually

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
experiencing anything by looking at something.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
So

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
we are all reflecting each other

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
and the truth

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
is right in front of us

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
but we have all been indoctrinated into a dream

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
through these agreements

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
that we make with society

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
that teach you to sort of basically

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
operate on fear.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You're a good boy if you do this, you're a bad boy if you do that.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
You're a really bad boy

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
if you think that you're a girl.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Ooh.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
There's

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
all these rules.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
You guys know I was being ironic when I said that.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
It's fucking generation.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
These

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
This is the flawed

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
society I'm representing.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
God damn it, I hate these fucking kids.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
They trick you into

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
explaining everything.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
They're just light.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
You're light.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
You're light.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
It's all a dream.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
We're going to wake up when we die.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It has nothing to do with afterlife or anything.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
It's just to say that

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
if you're in afterlife,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
the hell that we describe

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
in Christian mythology,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
isn't it now

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
is what the author says.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
This world of fear

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
and hate and where anybody can do anything

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
where your neighbor might break in your door

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
and eat you or he might

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
reward you if you're a good enough boy

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
or a bad enough boy.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It's all driven by fear

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
and prejudice and judgment

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
and just constant pursuit

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
of pleasing other people

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
and hooking other people's attention

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
and having your attention be hooked by them

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
when really what we are designed to do

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
is just float and do all this stuff.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
The idea of the four agreements

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
is to wipe away all the agreements

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
that you have made to get this far

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
and wipe them all away and replace them

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
with these four primary agreements.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Number one.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Always.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
If you are

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
number one,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
the first three

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
are traffic oriented.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Number one,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
if you're parking uphill, always turn your wheels

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
to face the curb.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Dan, does one of these

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
agreements have something to do with little shit?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Whether or not to sweat it?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
The first rule is, yeah, don't sweat the little shit.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
The second agreement is

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
it's all little shit.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
The first agreement is...

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
let's talk about the four agreements.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Yay.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I hope that's not in there.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
All right.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Let me just scroll through my watch,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
which I'm very happy I bought.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Be impeccable with your word.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
All right, I'm working on that.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I like that one.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Fuck you.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Dan, that's not very impeccable.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Lodge, do you want me to read the copy?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
It's short.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
These glasses, by the way,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
only work for far away.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Why not get my...

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
My life is a dream.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It's insane. It's an insane dream

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
where I'm now wearing props to make people like me.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
It's right, I have 20-20 vision,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
and I can...

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I'm wearing these because people like me more in them.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Now we don't.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
We can't do it.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Now that we know it's all lies.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Tch.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Be impeccable with your word.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Rule number one.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Say only what you mean.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Avoid using the word to speak against yourself

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
or to gossip about others.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Jeff.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Use the power of your word

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
in the direction of truth and love,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Adam Goldberg.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
You're doing the opposite of being impeccable

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
every time you inject...

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Rule number two.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Don't call out people who are telling you

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
you're not allowed to.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
You know, there's five agreements.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
One A.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
You can't, you're not allowed.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
If someone knows the four agreements before you do,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
they get to tell you what they are.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
So rule number one, don't talk shit.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah, don't talk shit.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
That's tough. That's hard.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Rule number two.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Don't take anything personally.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I think this is the big thing that I have in my life.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I think this is like...

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
All of my conflict is based on

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
either I am taking something personally

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
that people didn't mean to be taken personally,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
or I am saying something that someone else is taking personally

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
that I did not mean for them to take personally.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Nothing others do

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
is because of you.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
What others say and do is a projection

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
of their own reality, their own dream.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
When you are immune to the opinions

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
and actions of others, you won't be the victim

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
of needless suffering.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
You know, easier said than done.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
But I mean, it's really...

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I've heard that don't take it personally.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I find myself, I'm like, shit, god damn it.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I keep catching myself, yeah.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
If I could rephrase that, don't sweat the little shit.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
That's not... God, you're a fucking idiot.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Rule number one.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
That's a reflection of me. That's a reflection of me.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Rule number one, you broke rule number two

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
and number one in the same fucking...

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
You don't know that? I'm a dream.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I'm a dream, you piece of shit.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Rule number one. I'm a dream.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
You're taking it personally.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Everything you're saying is smoke. La, la, la, la, la.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
We're doing great. This book is saving our lives.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Rule number three.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Don't make assumptions. Find the courage.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Don't make assumptions.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Pause.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Find the courage to ask questions.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I really like this one because I think this one actually

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
like, you know, it braids nicely.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
This book is very old.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
My wife found this book in high school

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
in her, like, identity seeking phase.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
But it's still...

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
This rule, I think,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
really is important

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
as we enter this sort of

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
culture of awareness

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
and progression and calling

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
each other out for things

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
that we're doing wrong and stuff.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Because as I've said

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
a couple of times on this podcast, boy,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
could we try to understand

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
ignorance a little more than we are.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
So rule number...

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Agreement number three is don't make assumptions.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Find the courage

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
to ask questions

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
and to express what you really want.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Communicate with others

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
as clearly as you can

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
to avoid misunderstandings, sadness,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
and drama.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
With just this one agreement,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
you can completely transform your life.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I don't know why he says that.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Because it's shitting on the other agreements.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Dan, they're making an assumption there.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah, right.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
But I'm asking you a question.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Get your agreements shit together.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Anyways.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
On that note, the fourth agreement...

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Here's what's funny about this.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm going to try to encapsulate this.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Don't fill up on bread.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Agreement number four.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Don't fill up on bread.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
You're always going to

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
want to fill up on bread.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
It's delicious. It's particularly hot

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
in military and restaurants,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
but so is the food that's coming.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
They're going to charge you for your meal anyway.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Don't fill up on bread.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
That was a weird one to throw there.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
But we were...

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
The reason this whole thing came up

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
is because we were in Austin with

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Derek Waters, the creator of

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Drunk History, and Aaron and I

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
were sitting at a table drinking in this bar.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And then the four agreements came up

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
because Aaron had encountered them

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
this book in her life.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I think it's the important one

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
that performers are constantly dealing with.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You make a show and somebody says,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
this episode wasn't as good as this episode.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And what a writer hears is

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
you're a failure and fuck you.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And then you write an e-mail

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
and say, do your time magazine, fuck off.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I never did it.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
But it's like you're taking it personally.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Anyways, so we were trying...

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
What are the other three agreements?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
We were like, be impeccable with your word.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
That's crazy.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Don't make assumptions. That's really good.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
And then...

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I've got a text real quick there.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
But then the fourth one...

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
It's funny because it's three performers,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
creative people, sitting at a table.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
And we all looked at the fourth one

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
when we found out what it was

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
because we couldn't remember it.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And then when we saw what it was,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
it's always do your best.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
And all the people at the table went,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
fuck that.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
And then we all were like,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
why did we feel that way?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
It's because I think people who act,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
direct, stunt coordinate, make chairs.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I don't know.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I think there's a...

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I don't know where you draw the line

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
because I don't want to make assumptions.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And I want to be impeccable with my word.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And whatever the first one was.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
But I do think actually somebody

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
out there needs to hear always do your best.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
But I think a lot of the people

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
probably in this room

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
and people in the city of Los Angeles,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
the fuck do you think I'm doing?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Dumb piece of shit.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
More like three agreements, all right?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
But then we thought about,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
you know what, I think a lot of people out there

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
actually, someone that worked at Enron,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
maybe if they had read that, always do your best.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And they're like, yeah, I'm doing my best.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Yeah, but really, your best?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, but that just doesn't include

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
your work or your creativity.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
That includes your...

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Well, let's see what he meant.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The way you behave to other people.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Always do your best.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Your best is going to...

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah, okay.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I got it, guys.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I got your tweets.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I get it. Season four was great now.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
It's all hilarious.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It's all coming to my watch.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
You've all got my watch.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
You all live on my wrist.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Now we lost, Jeff.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Always do your best.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Your best is going to change from moment to moment.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
It will be different when you are healthy

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
as opposed to sick.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
That's it?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Okay, see, dumb agreement.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Just do your best, whatever.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I always do. I try.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
It always sucks.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
But that's judgment on me.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
You're not supposed to hate yourself, too.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
There's somewhere in there.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I've talked enough.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Let's start meeting some friends,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
and I really want to bring up

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
the stranger that came

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
into season six of Community and nailed it.

25:30.000 --> 25:58.000
Miss Paget Booster.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
No, I read that.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
The only two things I remember

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
hello, boss.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
The only two things I remember

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
were don't gossip.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Impossible.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
But don't take anything personally.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
That's the big one.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Because if someone

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
is angry with you

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
for whatever you did,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
it's more about them than you.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Most people are insecure.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I am. You are.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
We all are.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So, whenever anyone says,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
who's not insecure?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Who just went, uh...

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
You lying sack of crap.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Who said you?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
No, not you.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
He's never insecure. His dad's like an ambassador.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
There's a...

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Fuck you, Auntie. Don't take it personal.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Fuck you.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
But it's true, though.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Don't take anything personally, because whatever...

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Anytime anyone's talking,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
they're...

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
About them?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
We don't have to worry about anything.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Everyone's worried about their own screw-ups.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
We've heard it over and over

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
and over again. In fact, Spencer actually says

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
that at the end of the dumb movie we were in.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
It's not a dumb movie. You learned it in retail.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Wait, what?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I had to say dumb movie.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
You learned it in retail?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Well, you do, or you get bitter.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
He's so low to the ground.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Oh, yeah.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Well, you guys have a whole stage.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I'm not complaining. I love it here.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
It's the best table.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
But, yeah, I know you're

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
literally elevated off the floor that I am on.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
It's true.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
He enjoys too much power, as it is.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Best... If I could

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
dig a hole.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
No!

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I would put him in it. I would have his head on the floor.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
No.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's a powerful person.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Oh, that's really sweet.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I'm going to remember that.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
It makes me feel safe.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Spencer, do you feel powerful?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
No.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I feel like I have agency.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I can lift a rock

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
and go to the beach

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
and stuff.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I just want to point out

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
here's some other people that said that.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
God and Hitler.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
They draw your own conclusions.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And don't take it personally.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
But, I mean, those are...

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
God doesn't feel powerful.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Why would he make a universe if he felt powerful?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Hitler didn't feel powerful.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
He would have stayed in art school.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Don't let

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
humility fool you.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
It's the proboscis...

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Do you think God and Hitler had humility?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
They had

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
self-loathing.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
God was not content

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
to be nothing.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
He became everything.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Who does that?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Wait.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Who behaves that way?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
A very, very confident person.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Did God grow up

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
with a single mother

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
in the projects

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and he decided to be everything?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Wait, what?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
No, I'm curious, maybe.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I was not raised with religion.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Well, I know...

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Well, I was raised Lutheran

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
but I'm making up my own

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
perception of God.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
What is Lutheran?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
You're saying...

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Lutheran is...

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
No, I'm not...

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I'm not trying to be...

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
That's what the Pope said.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I was raised Lutheran too.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Lutheran, they refer to it as Catholic light.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It looks like Catholic.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
You've got stained glass windows and there's dudes wearing robes.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
You know how Catholicism is

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
sit, stand, kneel, stand, kneel, stand,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
sit, kneel, genuflect, stand, kneel,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
pray, leave?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Lutheran is sit, leave.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Leave.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
It's the original Protestantism.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Oh.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
It's Martin Luther.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Martin Luther was the first guy to say,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
look, religion should be accessible

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
to the people.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
So just sit and leave?

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Well, I mean, I...

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You do a little call and response and stuff like that.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
He said, for instance,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Bibles should not have to be in Latin.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Oh, well, that's fair.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
It's a dead language.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
There's people who would argue with you,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
but yeah, I wouldn't be one of them

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
because Latin is not Aramaic.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It's the language God was talking.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
No one knows Aramaic either.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Bibles should be...

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Don't come knocking.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Which I believe was

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Deuteronomy 211.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
You're saying then that if you believe

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
in a creationist mythology

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
that God created the universe from nothing

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
and created everything, you think that's an act

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
of self-loathing and low self-esteem on his part?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
You did say

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Hitler and God had low self-esteem.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
If you don't,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
they have something in common, which is a...

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Oh, Hitler and God

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
have something in common.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
If you can't...

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Dan Harmon says...

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
God is Hitler.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Well, but think about it.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Jesus got crucified for saying

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
the simple fact of people would go,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
oh, are you God?

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And he would go, well, technically, yeah.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And they'd be like, that's enough, string them up.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
He's like, no, we all are.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
It's fine.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
We're all outside the box.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
It's not going to

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
get you laid in a Halloween party

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
to come into a costume

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
that's like Hitler, but with a halo.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
And you're like, what's your point?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Because Hitler was God.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
No, that's not a good message to send.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
He made a lot of mistakes as a human being.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I'm saying that...

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Wait, Hitler or God?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Wait, God or Hitler?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
You're the one that's...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
No, I'm asking you.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
You're equating God with Hitler.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I'm telling you the one thing they had in common.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Maybe they both like fried eggs,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
but the one thing that I know that they had in common

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
is that they weren't happy

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
with their beginning state.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
God wasn't happy.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
The creationism...

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
My God, the God that I believe in.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
The birth of all existence, all this light that we are

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
and the mirrors that we all...

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
That's the Four Agreements thing.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
The whole thing, we are light.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
That's garbage.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Just get to the second agreement.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
The second agreement.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
No, wait, that's not the first agreement,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
isn't that we're all light?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You don't have to agree with that.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
The Four Agreements are all...

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
The first one's stupid, we're all light.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
No, no, that wasn't the first one.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
That wasn't the first one.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Fuck you, no, don't gossip.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
That's the first one.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
How can you be light and a dream?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
How can light dream?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
No one is light and a dream.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
We're all dirt and we're human

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and we're sexual and we're assholes.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
That's matter, that's matter.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Matter's a reflection.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Sorry, I hate to interrupt.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
No, that's good. You're being...

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I'm sorry, you were talking about God and Hitler.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Being the same.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Here he is!

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
You're being impeccable with your word and saying like...

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I've always been sexy dirt, I mean, you know, man.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
What?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
What? Sorry.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Get a different room.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Stop it.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Get a podcast.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
You're being impeccable with your word when you say,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
yeah, we're all animals, we're all...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I think so?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah, so that's good.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
This guy never said, I just want to make it clear

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
because I feel like I'm doing a bad commercial for him.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
He didn't say the first agreement was buying

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
into all this light and...

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I thought you said there was the first...

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
No, no, no, I was explaining his cosmology.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
His cosmology is that we're all a dream.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Cosmology, I don't know what that word means.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
What did you say?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Cosmology is the map of the universe?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Just a map of the universe, a model of the universe philosophically.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I didn't know that.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I appreciate you not judging me for not knowing that word.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I don't judge anything anymore. I have four agreements.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
That might be one of them.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I don't make assumptions.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Can we have a little judgment jar that you have to put a dollar in

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
every time you judge somebody throughout the rest of the show?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
That would be good.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I want to keep this bullet train moving

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
because we have so many people here tonight.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Judgment cup.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Every time you judge somebody

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
throughout the rest of this podcast

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
dollar in the judgment cup.

34:22.000 --> 34:50.000
A different Curtis Armstrong is here.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Curtis, welcome.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
She's my street buddy.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Oh, okay.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I ran into her on the street.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
She was the one who told me that you were worried

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
that I didn't like you anymore.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Don't take it personally.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
No.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
When you were in Communicado

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
and you were having fun with your daughter,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I...

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I know.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
You just got a little uncertain.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
You started thinking too much

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
which is really selfish and ego maniacal of me.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
To translate the things happening in this dream

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
to mean something about me.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
No, but I think all it was, Dan,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
was you expressing a very warm, friendly idea

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
that you want Curtis to like you.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And you had the courage to say that out loud.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
I took it that way.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I really did take it that way.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
And then Leah, correct?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Leah stopped me in the street

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
and she said, you have to talk to Dan.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I was outside a ramen place

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
and she said, you have to talk to Dan

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
because he's very upset.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And she said that she stood up

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
during the show

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
and told you, Dan, no.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
He's with his daughter.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
And I said, well, I guess he doesn't check his tweets.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Right.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Anyway, that's all behind us now

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
because you're clear on everything.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Yeah. Have you guys ever worked together?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Yeah.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
We worked for three years

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
on a series, an animated series

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
called Dan Versus.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
And some people have.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Dave Foley.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And it was three of us in a room.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
And I never

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
have laughed so much.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
It was really fun.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
We just laughed all the time.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
And then

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
the show was great

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and it ran and ran

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
and then the network was cancelled.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Well, it was this weird thing where

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
you could never get comfortable.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
It was exactly what happened.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And I don't even know yet

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
because it was on The Hub

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
which was

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
purchased by Hasbro.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Thank you.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Which then was purchased by

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Nickelodeon.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
The Germans.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
And now we're back to Hitler again.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
They kept saying

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
your contract is over.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Oh, no, wait.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
You're now owned by the Germans.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
That's exactly what it was.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And Curtis and I had so much fun.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
We were like, okay, whatever.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Germans, we're fine.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
So we were signing on to a show

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
that didn't exist anymore.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
In first position.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Yeah, it was crazy.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
We still don't know. I have not heard

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
any I don't even know if we have a show.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You could get a call tomorrow.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Dave Versus.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
For them though, I would do it.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
It was great.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
For you, I would do your show

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
for a second.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Me too.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Oh, yeah.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I would do your show.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
He's nuts, but he's good.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Keep going, keep going.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Talk to your friend, Curtis, colleague, actor.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Pretend I'm not here.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And I won't take it personally.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
And tell him everything

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
that you would say.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
If you ran into Curtis at an airport

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and you go, oh, I guess you just did a season

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
of Dan Harmon's show. What was that like?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
You've been working with Dan Harmon, right?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I heard that.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I am beat red.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Yeah, you are.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Hold on.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Curtis?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
You know what, I've heard some weird things

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
about Dan Harmon.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I know, I know.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
It's like 451 to Burbank is now boarding.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
It's like 451.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Fasten just sitting in zone one

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
or now welcome to the board.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Here's the thing, man. I'm not going to lie to you.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
The hours are long.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
He's a little crazy.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Sometimes the scripts are late.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
But here's the problem.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
They're so goddamn good

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
that you will end up agreeing

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
to have basically

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Stockholm syndrome.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
You will be like, fuck.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
This guy is so fucking good.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I don't know. The whole cast is great.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
No, I know. I know what you're thinking.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Look how happy Dan is.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Somebody asked me about being on the show.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Wait, I didn't hear what he said.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Sorry.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
What were you talking about this last time?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I don't know. He's jerking off and he's drinking.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I don't know.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
But this is conditional love.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Now boarding zone two.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
People see it in zone two.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I think I create the deplorable situation

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
so that you have to say that.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I think there's some unconscious drive behind me

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
because I don't think

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
your time that I wasted

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
or the wardrobe supervisor's time

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
that I wasted made the show any better.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
I think all the things that make the show good

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
can be done very quickly.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I think I purposely

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
or not purposely

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
because I don't think I'm that fucked up

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
that I do it consciously.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
But I do believe that unconsciously

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I'm trying to put myself in a situation

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
where mommy and daddy can say,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
God, you're a little piece of shit.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
You know, Roe v. Wade

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
so close to your conception.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
So close?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Just a photo finish.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
You got it.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
You don't think they told me?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
What?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Why else would I know?

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
1973.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Look it up.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Photo finish.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Oh my God.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I don't blame them.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And then they're like,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
what if I do this?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
And they're like, well, then, okay.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Now you're talented.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I need to drive it to that.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Yeah, no, go ahead.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Curtis, go.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
If everyone could do it quickly

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
then they would.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
And you did it

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
the way you needed to do it

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and that's how it works out.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
You do it at the speed that you do.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
And I would say to him

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
in an airport or at Gelsons

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Curtis, which is where we usually see each other.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Which is where we run into each other.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I would say he's nuts

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
but it's great.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
It's worth it.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
You're not a network TV.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Oh yeah.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I've heard that so many times about other people.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Why?

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
It never works out that way.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
People tell me the guy's really

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
insane

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
but it's worth it.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Have I ever said to you

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
this guy's crazy but it's worth it?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Never.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Because I would only say it about him.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I'm just a waiter.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Oh boy.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Could you ask your friend

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
for examples of people

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
who haven't been worth it?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Just because I'm a waiter

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
and I work at an airport

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
and this is all I have.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Bye.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Dan, most people aren't worth it.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Oh sorry Steve.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You know what I mean.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I do know exactly what you mean.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I've always imagined that that's what working with him was like.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
He's crazy but it's so worth it.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
He's nuts but it's worth it.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Excuse me, pardon me to interrupt your conversation.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I work for the TSA. Have you been approached by

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
somebody pretending to be a waiter

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
at the airport?

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Stop that waiter!

42:14.000 --> 42:20.000
Shhh!

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Argh!

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Argh!

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Argh!

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Argh!

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
The humans are suspicious.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
He's now on his eye watch

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Zone 3 is now boarding!

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Flight 2501 to Burbank, zone 3.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Oh he's flying.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Argh!

42:40.000 --> 42:54.240
Mr. President, Mr. President, we've made contact with the alien waders. Curtis, be the President.

42:54.240 --> 42:58.440
Mr. President, as your Chief of Staff, I feel it's time to get you into the bunker. The

42:58.440 --> 43:02.120
alien waders have invaded the Philadelphia airport.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.440
Who's this guy from the White House?

43:04.440 --> 43:06.240
Yeah, I don't have any idea.

43:06.240 --> 43:08.440
I'm your Chief of Staff, sir.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.560
Oooh, it's right. I'm sorry.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.120
Or am I?

43:12.120 --> 43:12.960
Paget.

43:12.960 --> 43:15.440
Err!

43:15.440 --> 43:20.640
Err...

43:20.640 --> 43:29.520
They're both lying right now. They both are alien faces for the podcast listeners at home.

43:29.520 --> 43:38.160
Paget, you're the head of an elite firm that helps people with their public

43:38.160 --> 43:41.640
scandals before they happen but you're having an affair with President Curtis

43:41.640 --> 43:49.520
which is the biggest scandal of all and yet your job is to handle scandals go go

43:49.520 --> 43:56.280
and you both just took a shit wait but I can't and you can both smell it but you

43:56.280 --> 44:00.560
think it's you but you don't know but you both think it's you because there's

44:00.560 --> 44:04.680
it's the year in the Oval Office there's two bathrooms and you both just took a

44:04.680 --> 44:10.640
huge shit and you both think I don't know if that informs is this the moment

44:10.640 --> 44:13.800
after that he found it found out his chief of staff is one of the alien

44:13.800 --> 44:17.520
waiters yeah he had that meeting now it's time for this meeting we're usually

44:17.520 --> 44:22.360
you guys like it's like your personal meeting I feel like the bit is you

44:22.360 --> 44:30.640
over explaining the improv I would not disagree with that which is why I stopped

44:30.640 --> 44:37.720
doing it that's every note I got after every improv show I ever did we just

44:37.720 --> 44:42.760
start a really good improv last night in a room full of eight people who as a

44:42.760 --> 44:49.400
Aaron come out here so you can tell us who that was Erin McGathy

44:49.400 --> 45:05.000
and white she's a great actress a beautiful red head and a sex box thank

45:05.000 --> 45:09.080
you Patrick I was just like obsessively fixing my hair backstage now I think I

45:09.080 --> 45:13.240
have a cocker-spaniel thing I love it no it looks beautiful thanks guys USS

45:13.240 --> 45:18.200
rock n roll is our the group that we saw yeah what are the words names of those

45:18.200 --> 45:27.200
kids Annie and Annie O'Connell Levin O'Connell and yeah Annie O'Connell Levin

45:27.200 --> 45:31.240
O'Connell I love Rick really good long-form improv I got so different from

45:31.240 --> 45:35.720
like like short-form improv is like it's a parlor trick it's like we we learn

45:35.720 --> 45:40.000
skills that we can use I'm saying we because anybody can I'm not saying I'm

45:40.000 --> 45:42.720
good at it I'm just mean like in short-form improv which I was trained in

45:42.720 --> 45:46.720
it's like they go okay here's all these disciplines and here's how you use them

45:46.720 --> 45:50.440
to make a quarter come out of someone's ear and you could like like Jeff is you

45:50.440 --> 45:55.040
know does it like on like national television is that still a thing national

45:55.040 --> 45:59.600
television yeah it's still national but when you're short-form improv is like

45:59.600 --> 46:03.280
it's like vaudeville like it's like be funny immediately so you don't like like

46:03.280 --> 46:06.080
our friend Derek Marys made a good analogy for short-form improv versus

46:06.080 --> 46:09.200
long-form short-form is like if you're on a dirt bike there's a ramp every

46:09.200 --> 46:12.320
couple seconds so you don't ever get that much runway and you don't ever get

46:12.320 --> 46:16.360
that much air long-form is a lot of runway and you build up a lot of speed so

46:16.360 --> 46:19.800
when a joke hits you get to fly for a long time like so the payoff is way

46:19.800 --> 46:24.920
bigger if you can like make a joke land in a long-form situation short-form like

46:24.920 --> 46:28.280
who's line is like joke joke joke joke joke joke you can also be like I mean

46:28.280 --> 46:31.600
another way another way to illustrate the difference is you could show up and

46:31.600 --> 46:36.000
and walk into a room and go oh there's only four other people here and for a

46:36.000 --> 46:39.160
short-form improv show that pretty much that doesn't mean it's gonna be a bad

46:39.160 --> 46:42.960
show it could be the most memorable show of your life but but depending on what

46:42.960 --> 46:47.440
they how they react backstage but it generally means this short-form improv

46:47.440 --> 46:50.440
engine is not gonna get the gas it needs but if you come in and there's four

46:50.440 --> 46:52.880
other people in the room there's a little black box and you're watching like

46:52.880 --> 46:58.480
good disciplines like long-form improv people you I mean they may do a better

46:58.480 --> 47:01.520
show for four people than they could have ever done for 40 people it's like you

47:01.520 --> 47:05.040
walk out it's like church I mean like if you walk into a church and it's empty

47:05.040 --> 47:11.160
you're I don't know it's like so there's more God for you or Hitler whatever you

47:11.160 --> 47:16.120
want to use as your placeholder well I think we we saw it just really quick we

47:16.120 --> 47:19.760
saw it we saw improv at the now theater in Los Angeles if you're interested in

47:19.760 --> 47:28.160

the fact that they met doing improv workshops I've told this a thousand

55:01.880 --> 55:08.240
times it's just my favorite thing they just flashback to Tina Fey they're

55:08.240 --> 55:11.080

55:11.080 --> 55:15.560
a little black box and they go okay the suggestions are a sling blade and Oprah

55:23.800 --> 55:32.800
those french-fried potatoes Jenna goes no you don't Oprah and then it just goes

55:32.800 --> 55:40.120
back all of the all of the sitcom like whip-pan flashbacks that we've had to

oh you know like the eyes getting all remember you dated a lot I still have

57:57.440 --> 58:02.480
two of your wigs by the way at my house which I wear quite frequently I got the

58:02.480 --> 58:09.400
red wig or the short red wig oh my god my landlord son wanted that wig and I

58:09.400 --> 58:13.920
couldn't find it I have the weirdest boner

58:15.760 --> 58:23.020
not my joke it's Donald Glover's wait okay all right so I'm sorry wait

58:23.020 --> 58:26.680
Patrick just said her landlord son went at that where what are you well back at

58:26.680 --> 58:33.720
not now I mean I own a home now she sophisticated now but there was a day

58:33.720 --> 58:39.880
when now my I lost a couple of wigs to Jeff Davis back in the day and that's

58:39.880 --> 58:48.560
fine listen every woman loses a couple of ways to Jeff that's fine

58:48.560 --> 58:53.640
pageant you weren't the first and you want me the last I know do you have

58:53.640 --> 59:12.800
pageant do you have a do you have an STD I'm changing no no I feel the same way

59:12.800 --> 59:19.320
it's a fucking miracle amazing because you got around to I'm a condom I'm

59:19.320 --> 59:26.360
safe yes we both use condoms we together and with other people but actually

59:26.360 --> 59:31.200
truth be told I used to put your wigs on my dick and fuck you with a wig that I

59:31.200 --> 59:40.240
don't remember all of Harmontown has led up to this point this is the most

59:40.240 --> 59:44.920
important moment well I was gonna ask you just because I didn't want to be

59:44.920 --> 59:50.040
remiss and having you on stage like we've farted around and had fun but you're

59:50.040 --> 59:55.560
a performer that has been funny for a very long time and probably is admired

59:55.560 --> 59:59.320
by a lot of people when they watch you on screen and stuff it was just so I'm

59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.560
not remiss as an interviewer I don't want to do my job wrong like is there a

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:08.200
philosophy that you follow because your ability to as I wrote be the person that

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:13.040
dropped in and nailed it you know you wrote that I wrote that as a Valentine

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:21.960
I wrote everything you said motherfucker no I know but the fact that you wrote

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.920
for me to say in the last episode as someone who came in late and nailed it

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:34.320
and I was so scared to say it because I didn't know at that point if I had like

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:44.640
to me I didn't know but no I just did to you what Aaron does to me all the time I'm so sorry what you just do it no I like I you you

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:52.480
never mind can we put a pin in that no I was put a pin in that oh my god this

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.080
has become something else no no like like well is there anything like when

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:03.960
you're when you before you step in front of eight fucking giant cameras 5,000

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.680
lights 200 people dangling from rafters you know like is there like different

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.240
actors say different things about how are they able to do comedy or drama or

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.200
anything in that in that totally artificial environment because all we see

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.160
on the screen is it like it's because of the courtesy of these craftsmen who make

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.680
things look like a living room and look like a courtroom in Mississippi in 1950

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.160
like all we see is reality and then these amazing actors and we don't realize

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.480
that it's like Jesus Christ the environment is so unnatural and you get

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.640
like particularly comedic actors are able to exude all of this like weird

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.320
human energy is there anything that you do do you kneel in front of a mirror in

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.040
your trailer do you remind yourself that you have a mantra are you crazy you this

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:54.440
is I'm gonna say this is Dan being a really generous thoughtful man

01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:00.880
podcaster interviewer he doesn't have to ask this no I want the only thing I

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.720
care about because I don't in working no you shouldn't wait I don't have that

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.160
question is like oh what do you have to promote you're an actor like a lot of

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.200
them out there want to do what you do yeah but they don't they they want to

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:18.960
like be home with their families and and like maybe take a totally misunderstood

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.880
our audience wait no I'm saying no no you're being very giving and loving and

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.920
supportive and thoughtful and saying oh what do you have to do for this character

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.560
I don't I just show up but I say the lines and I do the best I can and you

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:39.600
write great lines and that's why I was there when you're in front of the no

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.040
when you're in front of the camera what what you know okay when I was younger I

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:51.640
thought how does my hair look am I hiding the size of my nose do I have all

01:02:51.640 --> 01:03:00.120
my wigs or is that guy I was dating did he take them you gave you gave them to me

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:04.720
I asked you for them and you gave them to me of course I gave them to you you were

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:12.760
a great boyfriend okay pageant pretend you're in an airport with Curtis

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:22.360

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:31.840
president and presidential aid improv at Gelton's in Silver Lake sometime over

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.680

ritual do you have a technique do you have a mantra do you have a do you have

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:55.040
a threshold you have to cross before you step in front of cameras I don't I was

01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.080
thinking about this recently did I tell you about finding my my booger

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:07.680
biography you did yes you said that was what I used to I actually found in a

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:14.760
notebook the because I was trained as an actor and that what you do as an actor

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.760
is in order to understand your character you write a biography of it and no one

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.840
will ever know what you've written but you'll know and that's why you do that

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:31.560
and I found my biography that I wrote in 1983 for Booger revenge of the nerd for

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.920
revenge of the revenge of the nerd that was what I used to do I don't do it

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:43.360
anymore because no one ever gives me roles where I where they actually start

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.360
in a place and end in a place those don't really happen that well my friend

01:04:47.360 --> 01:05:06.600

01:10:53.420 --> 01:11:08.980
important. I need a doorbell. My son is important. Is this Don's doorbells? Is your

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:16.900
doorbell a real doorbell? I thought it was, I assumed, I'm sorry. Yes, it's a real doorbell.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:21.620
You just walked into my house. Oh, I thought it was Don's doorbells and that I assumed that the

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:29.100
doorbell on the outside was just a, I'm sorry. Don's doorbells was run by my son downstairs. Sorry,

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:45.220
what? You just close the door and then try to talk to me. Your son is important. Your son is

01:11:45.220 --> 01:12:11.420
important. Thank you. Don's doorbells is downstairs. Thank you. You get the idea. Mike Myers must

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:33.460
have been so young. Jeff, are we still in the improv? Should I run Don's doorbells? Yes,

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:42.460
yeah. Don, it's me. Don's doorbells here. I'm slightly Scottish, slightly Irish. What's

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:57.420
happening? I love doorbells and you are? I am my son's father. My son is important. Don is

01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:13.420
important. Do you need me to call 911? Yes, and one. We got it, we got it. That's a fucking

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:28.740
extra one. I almost blew it. But then I added the extra one. Did Curtis' character really go

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.940
from point A to point B? Did we really see that develop? Or is that just another one of those

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:40.140
one note? This is what I mean. I thought I was going somewhere I didn't really go. You know what

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:46.740
I did wrong, I endowed Curtis with a low status character. Curtis, I am. No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.660
No, no, no, no. I love the love of God. Can I overrule this, Dan? I say if we're going to do

01:13:51.660 --> 01:14:00.660
any more Curtis character development, we save it for Shadow Run, everybody. Shadow Run. Okay,

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:07.700
so we got Nightblade. We got, we should bring Demorge up here. DeMorge Brown on the stage,

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:22.340
please, DeMorge Brown. A cavalcade of stars tonight at Armageddon. Oh yeah. Demorge, why don't

01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:33.500
you sit here. Sit here and take this mic. But I could stand. I will say Spencer is still sitting

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:38.860
lower than the sea level. That's true. I was thinking, you know, they also have taller chairs.

01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:46.300
It's a real confluence of factors here. We're having too much fun. Thank you. Thank you. You

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.620
want a taller chair. I'm fine. We probably have to get Padgett up to speed and what the hell we're

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.620
doing here, right? Padgett, are you familiar with? Should I get out? No, no, you're staying with us

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:58.220
for certain. We'd like you to help us play a game. It's like a role-playing game. Oh, it's

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:04.500
called Dungeons and Dragons. It is. It's called Shadow Run. Oh, this? I don't know. It's like,

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:11.540
think of it kind of like the Matrix, the future. We're kind of like mercenaries, like Badasses

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:16.460
for hire. And what role will Padgett be playing? Well, see, that's the deal. I mean, we've got a

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:22.300
whole group of people here. Oh, do you have a chair coming in? Yeah, I don't have a character

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:27.660
sheet for Hacker. That's the problem. Because he's a plot device. No, I'll do it. No, no,

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:32.940
I think she should do, she should do Dr. Friend. No, no, you're Dr. Friend. All right, I'll do

01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:37.260
Dr. Friend. Well, wait, let's hear him out. Let's hear him out. Well, I was just thinking that maybe

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:46.020
Dr. Friend, maybe what has happened is Dr. Friend has gone into sort of a time warp time thing and

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:55.500
has has changed and is now is now being played temporarily by Padgett. I don't know what's

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:59.500
happening. We don't actually have too many people, do we? We do have too many people. We have too

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:05.500
many people. I'm telling you, Jim Nightbill. Trust me. Who would I lie? Why would I lie to you? Oh

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:13.500
my God, I love you are I am willing to stand by the softest arm and cheer everyone on. Spencer,

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:21.940
is it possible to have without anybody else being a Hawkeye? Maybe. What's a Hawkeye? Hawkeye is a

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:28.060
character that you don't want to be a Hawkeye. Spencer. Could she be some sort of NPC and come

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:32.860
and join? Can I be an NPC? Well, yeah, I mean, there's all sorts of things that we could do

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:38.180
successfully. I mean, I'm telling you now, it's just I don't have a character sheet for an extra

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:45.860
character. So if you don't need a sheet, I'll walk away. We all have those days where we feel

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:56.620
different than we do the day before. I call those, I guess that's every day. But maybe would it be

01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:06.220
okay if Padgett was like my memories or Jeff just made an interesting pitch that it would take

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:14.380
Spencer's yes to go with this. That what we do is take our shirts off. No, I'm not. We give everybody

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:21.020
two eggs. We do a very special episode where we do a flashback and find out about Dr. Friend's

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:27.740
origins. But it would have to be like, I mean, Spencer would be off the grid, off the map. Oh,

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:36.820
yeah, it would be a real improv show. Which I mean, you guys are the masters of that thing. I

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:42.220
think if I, you know, Spencer, your job would be maybe to just define whatever needs to be defined

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:47.100
in the spatial. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and change scenes. I'm just, yeah, you guys got to do some

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:55.980
lifting though. And I just leave and go to the bathroom. No, no, my mom, Padgett, Padgett, we

01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:00.420
need you for this. You're an actor and we need you. No, you need someone to leave. I will be that

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:05.700
person. No, no, what is happening? We're going on a magic carpet ride right now and you're on board

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:16.300
for this. We've done that before. I'm just asking for this to be happening. Spencer, I'm sorry you

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:22.060
had to see this. You're fine. Don't worry about it. Please tell me that's how Jeff initiates sex.

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:36.500
You want to go on a magic carpet ride? Dan, why don't you code DM and you at least you said Dan,

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:41.900
go over it with Spencer and you guys together come up with the you do the intro for wherever we are

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:50.060
and this is going to be bad. Oh, he did it. Jesus. Let me tell you that chairs the wrong height.

01:18:50.060 --> 01:19:01.820
Nobody gets a chair, a folding IKEA chair over an audience like Dan Harmon. He's crazy, but he's

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:05.940
great. Well, Padgett, this is your wheelhouse because you're also on an amazing show called

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:19.060
Thrilling Adventure Hour. Were you? We're not using character sheets. We're freestelling us. This is

01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:25.220
the origin story of Padgett Curtis's character as Dr. Friend. He is a, would you want to describe

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:31.900
your character to her briefly? To the extent that I understand it. Thank you. Dr. Friend and I

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:40.020
don't really. Dr. Friend is a part of the gang. He is a medical man, but he's a medical man who is

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:46.420
disturbed and he has a past. Okay. But no one really knows what that is. Okay. And among the

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:57.300
things that he's done in the course of this is he has powers that he can use on people like, no,

01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.940
no, wait a minute. I'll tell you. Oh my God. If there's files, I want a file. He does things like

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:09.100
he can do healing powers. Healing. So in the course of one of our adventures, if we get hurt,

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:16.380
if somebody gets hurt and is dying, you have a healing power. Yeah. Right. And that everybody

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:21.460
has powers of some kind. Okay. Yeah, it's kind of like a magical world, Padgett, but it's also the

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:26.420
future. So it's tech, it's technological, but there's also spells and magic. So it's like the

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:33.420
future and a lot of criminal activity. And also, and also it's Seattle. I have no file. So I have

01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:39.260
no power tonight is just focused on the mysterious past. Now this is this is backstory. So none of

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:43.300
us are going to be playing. No one is going to be. You're an even playing field with the rest of

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:48.980
us. Only only Curtis knows what is. Sorry, I'm very competitive. And I want powers and a file.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:54.540
I'm sorry. You're allowed to be whoever all your roles will become apparent. It's a special one

01:20:54.540 --> 01:21:01.020
off episode. We're exploring the origins of a character. So Spencer, what year is it when

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:09.380
we're normally playing shadow run? 2074. Okay. And how old how old do we think Dr. Friend is? Oh,

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:28.380
he's a good 27. What's 27 and four minus 27. Yep. What somebody say 3646 2046. Our story begins

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:41.820
in 2046 AD at Baltimore General Hospital. Ivy overruns the decrepit building, which has not

01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:52.180
been the same since the fall of the hospital. And the healthcare program. Still patients are

01:21:52.180 --> 01:22:02.060
served here. But they're never happy to be served. They only have to be. We move through the front

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:10.260
doors of the hospital and down the decrepit halls and start to pick up the whales of a woman giving

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:25.820
birth. We enter the delivery room. Certainly not the most sterile one we've ever seen. That's

01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:35.860
right. Keep going. Keep going. Breathe. Push. Push. I'm afraid, Mark. Why? I've never done this

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:43.580
before you asshole. Why am I afraid? It's all right. We're in the hospital. People are looking

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:51.220
after us. Nothing can go wrong. Come on. Look, do you have you heard from my sister? No, no,

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:58.220
I've tried to reach her, but there's no answer on her on her chip phone. She's she's always so

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:04.140
wild. Always trying to find a good time. Always giving wigs to men. She's having casual sexual

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:11.580
relationships with. Just if you hear from Anastasia, just tell her to get here now. She's

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:21.140
I'll try her again. It's all I can do. Dr. Gerber. Dr. Gerber. Anastasia in room one. Anastasia's

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:39.500
here. Keep pushing. Dr. Gerber. Dr. Gerber. There was a Curtis. This is this is this is when you were born. This is 27 years old. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. This is totally

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:46.620
misunderstood. 27 years earlier. I'm in there. 27 years. I don't have to worry. Did I blow it? Okay. No, no, no. You were

01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:55.500
right. I was wrong. What? I thought I was still Dr. Friend. And in fact, I'm still someone who knows the

01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:03.420
pregnant woman giving birth. No, no, I'm the baby. I'm in there. What? I'm in there. He's in here. I need a man to play

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:11.300
your dad. So now Dr. Gerber. Dr. Gerber. I am. Oh my God. Get my office. I want you in my office right now. Dr.

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:17.260
Gerber. What's wrong? What have I done? Dr. Gerber. What have you done? What haven't you done? Don't you realize that you're

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:25.140
the brother of the person who is the father of the child you're delivering right now? Oh, that's good. It's Anastasia. I'm a

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:36.540
drug intern. Anastasia. I don't get it. I thought you knocked me up. I got a baby that's gonna be the brother of that

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:43.540
baby. I don't care whose baby it is. All I know is it's gonna look a lot like that doctor right there. No, no, listen to

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:51.260
me. Anastasia. Dr. Gerber. Anastasia. What happened to us was a long time ago. That's in the history. No, I was like

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:56.940
nine months ago. Okay. Calling Dr. Craig Kikowski. We need help in long form

01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:05.980
improv. Calling Dr. Craig Kikowski. Our long form improv is in critical condition. Critical condition. Dr.

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:23.380
Kikowski. Paging Dr. Kikowski. Dr. Kikowski. Yes, I was playing golf. What can I do? Well, we've got a patient

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:35.580
here in crisis. And I thought I knew what I was doing. Patient in crisis. You guys, you guys, I'm an orderly. You'll

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:44.860
never see me again. I'm interrupting this very focused scene about the origin of a character to let you know that at

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:56.220
this point in future sci fi history, some big shit is happening forest gump style on the tele viewer. Look. They all

01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:07.220
look to the TV to see a news report about something. Dr. Kikowski. Well, it seems that Vitas is back again. It's

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:14.340
waving the nation faster than ever before. We got babies turned left ways, babies turned down ways and adults

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:21.140
turned back ways. It's an ugly world. You got to not touch anybody. Don't even bother washing your hands. Cut off

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:31.020
your hands. Wash the stumps. We're talking Vitas. It's back, baby. I'm out of here. Have you guys made sure that

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:41.700
your baby is please don't be offended by this, but human. God, please. Look, someone, someone take this metal card

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:48.460
with a number sketch in it. Officer Gerber, your brother's number is listed there. If you could get in touch. You know

01:26:48.460 --> 01:27:02.900
what? I'll have a look at that number. If I could. Obama? Look, no one, no one, no one trusts you since the

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:16.180
pickle scandal of 2014. Well, I believe pickle scandal was a little later. Yes, it was. That's fine. We've got a

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:29.340
quality. Here we go. Strangely enough, we've got emergency breach birth. Oh, good God, it's hideous. Come out. We

01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:39.580
don't know what it is. It's an orderly that was just hanging out beneath it. God damn it. I'm a long form improv

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:51.580
doctor and not an OBGYN. I also don't know if you can save this six years later at the friend household. It's a

01:27:51.580 --> 01:28:04.700
shame. What's a shame, mom? That long form improv. It's a shame. They tried. I've heard you talk about that

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:12.140
sometimes, but you never really explain. Because I don't want to talk about all of it, son. Well, even a little bit.

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:25.180
Baby, I think he's old enough. He is old enough to hear the story of how Obama came to the hospital. And you slit

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:37.820
the throat of a ghost orderly. He is old enough. That has been distilled. Grandson. Into a sentence. Grandson, it's your

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:44.380
grandfather. Would you come out on the porch with me a moment? I just want to have a talk with you. Well, sure. Sure,

01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:54.620
Graham. By the way, in the background, cars are flying. That's never going to goddamn happen. Grandson, I won't be around a whole much

01:28:54.620 --> 01:29:03.660
longer. Oh, these damned flying cars. When I was a boy, there was no, we had pickles until that horrible scandal came along.

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:11.900
And I want to tell you this before I pass along, son. Okay. I want you to follow in my footsteps and be a doctor. However, you

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:19.420
do understand that you're not like other people, boy. What do you mean? Have you ever noticed anything weird happen to you at

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:34.580
night when you're laying in bed all alone? Yeah, five months earlier. Come on. Come on. Rudy. Your boy. Your boy. There's

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:41.940
nothing there. There's nothing. Oh, no, there. No, there is. There's injured injured injured. Honey, it's time to go to bed.

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:50.660
Oh, no. But it's look at Rudy. There's something wrong. He got his leg caught in a trap. Rudy's an old dog. No, he's young young young.

01:29:50.660 --> 01:30:04.300
I can heal him. You. You have the power to heal. You have the power to heal. He'll heal heal. Honey, go to

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:11.980
bed. Everything's fine. Rudy's fine. No, I healed him. Grandson back to the present. So Grandson, remember that time you

01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:19.300
healed the dog with your mind? Yes. I do remember it. But I thought it was all a dream. It wasn't a dream. And we're not all

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:34.460
light. That's horseshit. We're real people. We're here right now. I want to make one agreement with you, son. Okay. Grandson, that

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:41.900
is. You were you were contaminated at birth by V talks and you're you're going to suffer some very special skills and some

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:53.140
very special special detriments inside Papi's chest. His heart beats heavier and heavier. Oh, I'm dying. Don't heal me,

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:59.420
boy. Don't heal me. Let it let let it happen naturally. Boom, boom. Let it I don't know. Do I see that look in your eyes,

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:22.260
Grandson? I see that look. Oh, cut to a doctor explains V talks completely lethal. It'll kill you in 100% of

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:30.300
situations. And less maybe some crazy shit is in your genes like you have troll stuff. I'm a doctor.

01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:52.580
Cambridge bells fade up on the scene of friends grandpa dying and we dissolve to the now not perfectly manicured lawns of an Ivy League medical

01:31:52.580 --> 01:32:08.980
kegs and date rapes of old. No, it's it's good. Well, there's a couple ways the future will be better. There's there's more

01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:16.220
education. There's put into this like sex ed is no longer about just what diseases you can get me actually tell kids

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:27.460
before they get horny about consent. Okay, so we zoom in on a medical proscenium and into a medical the medical class.

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:48.140
Son, I'm here to show you the medical college you should go to. And so what do you think? Hey, friend, it's real weird.

01:32:48.140 --> 01:33:00.340
We have to watch these meetings, right? I know. Geez. I just want my son to pick the best college Princeton. All right,

01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:09.620
okay, thank you, Mrs. Friend. And I think that will put an end to parents day here at medical school. If that's what you say,

01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:20.220
always. But I never approved of it. It feels weird. Now, as we were saying, how does nanotechnology affect the human condition?

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:31.980
And what is human? After all, Mr. Friend, perhaps you'd be more willing to answer that or does your troll nature confuse the

01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:41.660
issue? The camera whispers about friend whispers about friend. Not good enough. Weird. We is a weird guy. The camera

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:49.740
pushes through those students and lands on a troll like Dr. Friend. Now 21 years old from inside from inside his mind a voice

01:33:49.740 --> 01:34:03.660
speaks. Trust your instincts, Doc. Do you like French fries, Doc? Trust your instincts, Doc.

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:17.940
My troll DNA has nothing to do with my work as a doctor. Oh, really? We have ourselves a protege. Wait, what do you

01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:31.540
call it? A protege. I spent the year teaching in France. I'm your protege. Get out of here, Dave. All right.

01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:41.940
So, ladies and gentlemen, please, I think this could be a teachable moment here at hologram, John F. Kennedy Ivy League Medical

01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:55.460
School for the surgical and nanotechnological art. Please do indulge us, the world's first troll surgeon. What do you feel

01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:01.720
about Hellman's law regarding the inefficacy of nanotechnological devices in the bloodstream?

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:13.560
Inefficacy? Good word. Dana, also out. This is not English. I'm sorry. I do worry we were having tea in the

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.880
hole. Also, you, Mrs. Stevenson. I don't care how much I'm blind on my ret. Doctor, doctor, I would love to.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:25.800
Professor, Professor, do you mean to tell me that you're going to let a troll person get up and tell me about

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:35.880
nanotechnology? Yes, you all have to start listening. It's a new world. Trolls are every bit as worthy and

01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:44.840
acceptable as doctors as any of the rest of you. And I'm going to prove it. We will. As, as friend

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:52.680
speaks, sweat drips from his armpits in a way that is inhuman and it creates puddles beneath him.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:58.040
Well, perhaps before you advise us on our physiology, you should manage your own. Look at the puddles.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:07.160
But he's not wrong. Look at the puddles. You'll have to work much harder or the world will have to get

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:13.560
much worse before you're successful. Just, just as his competition is happening. I'll work harder.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:27.960
And you'll regret this as long as you live. The professors, the professors face begins to melt

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:41.640
like butter in a microwave dripping to the ground. Beautiful. Blood goes into a signature that says

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:50.360
Dr. Friend. Cut to 2000 something, but it's a courtroom. It's a futuristic courtroom. Dr. Friend

01:36:50.360 --> 01:37:05.960
is in shackles facing a hologram of a judge. Dr. Friend. Dr. Friend. Is it in fact your contention

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:20.360
that you have the power of the mind at your will as a healing device? I'm reminded, of course,

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:27.800
of the story of a child who had a mere human cold, which has been eradicated for some decades.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:35.000
But his parents thought that they could through Christian science and the word of God heal this

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:42.200
young man and did not give him syrup of Ipacaca, Sudafed, or whatever crude inventions they had

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:51.400
at that time. Is it possible that you, as a non-human doctor, claim to understand the human

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:57.320
workings that were first profligated by Von Lee and hooking his microscope?

01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:07.720
Your Honor, is there a question for my clients? The question is. Prosecutor Sanders, we've asked

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:17.000
this many times before. If you could please rephrase your monologues into a single sentence.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.480
Objection, Your Honor. And I don't think she knew what she was going to say after she said

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:35.080
Prosecutor Sanders. Orderly asshole. Well now, Ms. Emily. Hold on. Your objection was about me

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:40.200
not knowing what I was going to say in an improvised sketch? Don't take it personally.

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:50.040
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just a loyal as the Latinos would say abogato in a three-dimensional

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:56.200
situation, but we have added a fourth dimension and a fifth dimension, and I'm reminded of Sophocles

01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:02.920
who once said, good lord, how is a person to defend themselves when they don't own enemy?

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:08.760
As this courtroom drama is unfolding, a weird green vapor starts filling up the courtroom

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:18.360
from underneath the cracks in the doors. Spencer? Yes. Yes, Jeff. Tell him about the

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:28.760
gases coming into the room. Oh, it's, there's gas. As a court stenographer, I'm sorry to weigh in

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:37.400
on the record, but something's wrong with the gas coming from the flower. The gas, the gas itself

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:45.000
flows from amorphous diaphanous to solid and stinking form. I'm just, I'm talking as fast as I

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.920
can. I'm just a jury member, but I tell you what, this gas makes me want to say everything I never

01:39:50.920 --> 01:40:01.560
did. I wish I would have taken a bath and a barrel of flour. I wish I would have hit a man with my

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:05.240
car. One by one, people from the back of the courtroom start dropping dead and suffocating

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:11.640
from this green vapor emanating through the room. While it's happening, because it's such

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:18.520
dramatic juxtaposition, Dr. Friend, as if he's not the one making it happen, gives his final argument

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:31.640
about himself. I am a troll, but I'm more than just a troll. I'm a troll who cares deeply about

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:42.760
all species. Objection, your honor, people are interrupting his monologue right now.

01:40:42.760 --> 01:41:02.760
It's in my head. I was adopted. I just realized I'm adopted. And you're all,

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:10.760
all of you going to regret this day because I'm going to right now clear the green fog from this

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:21.320
room just before you die. And then you're going to see the sort of troll I am. As your lawyer,

01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:27.800
I would have been appreciating being brought in on this strategy. As the green fog clears,

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:35.800
there is nothing left but a sea or galley, as they call it, gallery. What do they call it in

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:50.600
the courtroom? A sea of corpses, corpses. I'm a lowly court stenographer, but I know from going

01:41:50.600 --> 01:42:03.720
to college it's a galley of dead people. You're alive! It's a bit surprising that a troll would

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:14.440
surprise me with science. Wait, as a tall man or a black man? Well, you know, I'm part of a lot

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:21.080
of old qualities, but really the thing is, it's a science. As Dr. Friend slips out the courtroom

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:25.880
doors, we crane shot on the conversation between those two characters who are immune to green gas.

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:35.240
Cut to a Rolling Stones cue blares as we cut to the inside of a cyber tavern.

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:42.600
Just to clarify, Dr. Friend did not save those people. No, everyone died. Okay. Sorry, go ahead.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:52.760
I'll never stop. Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm the overused Rolling Stones cue.

01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:00.440
I'm the song that's used every time you want. Yeah, it's like $45,000 every time you use it.

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:10.760
The camera pushes down the bar. As visa holograms inform us of the state of the new world,

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:19.400
the dragon president has been assassinated. BTL ships are infected with VVRL viral nanos.

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:29.480
Women are equal. That's the sci-fi future. Everything's insane. Women are equal. Everyone has agency.

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:45.720
As your new president, Herman Cain, you know, folks once asked me what would I do

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:49.640
if I did not win this election and I said I would make mayonnaise.

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:57.160
In fact, I did win the presidency and I'm still going to make mayonnaise.

01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:04.120
I am reminded of the movie motion picture officer and a gentleman in which Richard

01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:11.640
Gears' character's name was Mayo, but his nickname was Mayonnaise. We arrive at a lone Dr. Friend,

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:23.160
now fully troll, now fully alone. He nurses his indescript drink through troll lips

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:28.040
and mutters to himself dramatically.

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:45.800
I wonder if I'll ever get over the guilt that I feel for not having cured all of those people in

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:57.720
the courtroom. Why can't you save me? Your indescript wounds haunt you.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:04.840
You know what? The thing is Obamacare doc, Obamacare, and French fries. Do you like them?

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:14.760
You haven't fixed anything. You talk about saving people. The camera swivels to reveal

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:21.240
a trench-co-cloaked troll of a different age nursing his own drink.

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:30.840
He knocks back the glass with the air of an old school drunk before turning his yellow gaze

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:40.280
on his racial compatriot. Fuck people. Fuck them all. What do you mean?

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:46.600
What, how many favors have they done you? Did they cure you?

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:52.920
They give a fuck whether you live or die? Doctor? No, they didn't.

01:45:53.960 --> 01:46:01.880
My name is Detective Emil Trollinger. Of Emil Trollinger, Trollinger.

01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:10.040
It's a German name, but I was originally Jewish. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Think about how that feels.

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:17.080
Feels, feels. We cut to the moment when he became German and not Jewish. Or not.

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:22.920
Why is Ellis Island still open? So embarrassing, embarrassing, embarrassing.

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:31.880
Why do I have to... Well, we were working on some sort of trap. Cut back. What are you saying to me?

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:38.920
I'm saying to you that this world we used to think was a world is the world we thought came after

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:47.560
this world. This is hell, my friend, and it's divided into two groups of people. People who give a fuck

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:53.960
of people who live to see tomorrow. Give a fuck, see tomorrow. My name is Detective Trollinger.

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:59.240
Trollinger, Trollinger, Trollinger. I used to be a cop until I became a fucking troll.

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:07.880
A fucking troll, a fucking troll. Now I organize Shadow Runs for Shadow Runners.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.600
And if you call or visit text this number, you could get involved in that world.

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.640
Complicated, complicated, complicated. Visit text is bullshit. I don't care. Why wouldn't you just...

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:24.680
Those voices you're hearing are called what the troll community calls the inner critic.

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:30.280
Don't deny me, don't deny me. I'm totally... You know, the thing that... What I like the most

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:36.200
is ice cream, doc. I'd like to go to Martha's. One of the troll voices is just Obama talking about.

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:39.320
Just do my best. That's our curse.

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:46.600
Hey, Trollinger, Trollinger, you're gonna order something? I'm trying to run a cybertavern here.

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:54.440
Hey, what are you looking at? Where's the horseshoe? I'll take double what I had on the side of the hair.

01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:01.560
Trollinger, I have worked very hard to achieve something in my life,

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.360
and I've been knocked down every time I stood up.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:12.200
Oh, well, you must be the only one. Sound of my eyes rolling so far back, they roll back around

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.720
and came up from the bottom in our forever owed one rotation.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:25.320
As Trollinger says this, he starts to feel his heart beat harder and harder.

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:28.360
Boom, boom. Funny thing about... Boom, boom.

01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:34.360
Troll bodies. They can take a punch, but not from God or Hitler.

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:44.920
Do me a favor, doc. Don't save me. Don't save me. This is no life.

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:49.720
I won't. Maybe... No, wait! Maybe you break the rule this time.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:55.560
That goes against my code. I have to save you. I can do no harm.

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.560
Oh, Hippocratic Oath...

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:05.160
Oh my God, Julie, did I hear you say Hippocratic Oath?

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.520
Hippocratic Oath, right?

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.680
Oh my God, it left me so much elbow pain.

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:10.840
There it was. Seriously.

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:16.520
When I was studying nursing, Hippocratic Oath Betch.

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.600
Oh my God, first of all, when you started...

01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.760
I just want to say... You know it, right?

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.600
I just want to say you always shit on your haircut when you started nursing,

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.840
but seriously, it was so cute.

01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.840
Oh my God, but it's totally bad.

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:33.160
Somebody save that man. He's dying over there. There's a man dying in the bar.

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:37.240
Back to the present at Hank's Last Stand,

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:40.600
where Dr. Friend was revealing his past to the gang.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.880
We're just being nurses. Fuck.

01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:49.160
We fucking do shit all day.

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:50.200
All day long.

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:54.280
So sometimes we fucking hang out and talk about shoes.

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.400
What about you? What do you do? Do you save lives?

01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.240
Meanwhile, in the future...

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:00.920
In the future!

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:06.120
In a goddamn board game, we like to save lives.

01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:06.840
And save this guy.

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.520
As the nurses continue talking,

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:13.240
we move from the planet into the vacuum of space,

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:16.120
and slowly to the center of the universe,

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:24.680
where God and Hitler float in the center of all reality.

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:28.040
And they're watching a sitcom about two nurses called...

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:30.680
I'm silent. I'm a female. I'm silent.

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.760
God and Hitler are watching a sitcom called Perkler and Perkler's.

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:48.760
They live on the Upper East Side, and they have girlfriends, and they're gross.

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:51.160
And we're crazy about it, not really.

01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.360
Hitler's hand reaches out with a remote.

01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:57.000
God's closes over the top of it, stopping him.

01:50:58.280 --> 01:50:59.080
Don't, Hitler.

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:03.880
I just have a problem with the way you treat yourself.

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:06.680
I feel like he treats himself so badly.

01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:09.240
Wait, me or him? Me or your husband?

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:10.920
Both of you, but you more.

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:11.880
Okay, I know.

01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:12.360
Just imagine you're so fast.

01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:13.560
Stenos Klopengas!

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.800
That has been Harmontown.

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.120
Craig Kikowski, everybody.

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:26.600
D'Amose Brown.

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:31.000
Erin McGathy, Spencer Crittenden.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:31.880
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:36.680
Curtis Armstrong, everybody.

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.440
Hagit Brewster.

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.480
And your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:51.640
And Kris Boruff, and Sarah Hill, and Zac McKeever, who are back there doing all the technical

01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:52.920
shit every week.

01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:55.400
Chris and Sarah are doing the live streaming stuff.

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:58.120
Earthshine Jane for laying down the sexy booze on us.

01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:02.120
Yeah, for hunting down Curtis on the streets.

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:09.560
I think we did it.

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:12.440
Did you get any of that?

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:27.000
Yeah, it's a good show.
