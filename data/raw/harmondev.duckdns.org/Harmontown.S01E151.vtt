{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:09.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, in the Meltdown showroom, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:21.000\nI am your Comptroller, Jeff Davis. Please welcome your judging master, Spencer Crittenden, to the stage.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:33.000\nAnd now please welcome the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:42.000\nThank you, Jeff Davis everybody.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:55.000\nI was almost going to pull my phone out and put my drink down for a physical ritual that has long oppressed me, but I'm free now.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:03.000\nDan is presenting the audience his new Apple Watch, what do they call it, Apple Watch?\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:06.000\nYep, I only need to free a hand to swipe.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:18.000\nEver, ever note, ever note, boop. Here we go, let's talk about Jurassic World.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:30.000\nOr if you prefer, let's talk about the Apple Watch. Oh, grandpa. No one calls him I anymore.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:40.000\nBlack people aren't I people. They sure aren't Dan. They're just Apple people.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:52.000\nRemember when, we've talked about this 8,000 times, my grandparents think that your grandparents probably too think that black people are supposed to be called colored people, that that is polite.\n\n01:52.000 --> 02:01.000\nYou all roll your eyes at that. I roll my eyes at that. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, however.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:07.000\nBit of a pickle. Stationary already ordered.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:10.000\nIt's just one of those funny things that happens to a species.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:13.000\nDid you hear about that lady from Tacoma?\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:26.000\nWell, I almost didn't. Everybody, yes. The leader of the Spokane Washington chapter of the NAACP was outed by her parents as being a tan white lady.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:32.000\nAfter, I don't know how many years. Do we know how many years she successfully, 10?\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:48.000\nThere's always weird, weird conversations that are happening, which are totally awesome and healthy, especially in the midst of, for instance, you know, the transgender movement, which has everything to do with what you are born as does not define you.\n\n02:48.000 --> 03:01.000\nAbsolutely not. And then there's an equally, like, totally valid, like, clearly obvious observation that, like, if you were born as a blunt blue-eyed lady, you do not have the right to go to a tanning booth,\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:06.000\nfrizz your hair, and then become the say that you're getting hate mail because you're so black.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:12.000\nThis is all good, in my opinion. This is all fantastic.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:18.000\nI mean, I'm sure other people have the right to be offended or care way more than I do. As far as I'm concerned, seems like fun.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nOh, man.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:21.000\nWhy not?\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:28.000\nEverything's fun to us, yeah. That's called privilege. I think that's what they mean when they say check your privilege.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:35.000\nAs long as we don't, like, get involved, we're fine. That's the new political correctness. We just get to say, fuck it.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nLike, that's us being the most open-minded we can be. What are you doing?\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nJane is here. Earthshine Jane.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nAll right.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:49.000\nWhat's your last name, George? You want your last name out there?\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:53.000\nJust Jane. Earthshine Jane is your Twitter handle, correct?\n\n03:53.000 --> 04:02.000\nAside from the fact that Jane has been the purveyor and distributor for us of fine absence and awesome booze, did you make this glass bottle, too?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nI did not. I have a friend who's a master glass blower now.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nI designed it, but he made it.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nThis is really good. This is fantastic.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nAnd so I have a bottle of...\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:15.000\nI mean, sadly, I have the dregs of a bottle of...\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nThe rest of it's in the decanter.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:23.000\nOh, it's in here. You've broken it in half. I love it. Jane, can I do a commercial for Jane's absence?\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:27.000\nI took this absence of malice to a party, and I actually had about that much.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nI had about, like, maybe a little bit more than that.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:33.000\nBrought it to a party where I was dressed as David Bowie, because it was a glam party.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nAnd you had a David Bowie party.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:41.000\nI just had one laying around. And I took this to the party, and everybody there wanted to know how to get more of it.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nThis stuff is really groovy, and it gets you high.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:49.000\nWhy don't we find out how... Jane, do you want to come up and talk or... No.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nIt's cool. No.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.000\nThere was hesitation there.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nOh, okay. All right. No. Okay. Cool.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nFine. Good. Oh, great.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nWe'll talk later on.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nThat's great. That's the first time I might get in trouble.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:07.000\nI'll be getting a whole stick of, like, don't come up if you don't want to come up, actually, finally, like...\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nBecause I'm always saying it as the prayer.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nBy the way, if you don't want to be exploited...\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:15.000\nWell, also, there might be some sort of agencies that might care about that.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:18.000\nNo, there's all kinds of shit. Well, it was just ironically why...\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nWhich is why there's a story to tell and why I want to talk to you eventually.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nBut, like I said, like, tweet me when the adventure is over.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nAlso, while we're thanking people for gifts, this was sent to me...\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nApparently, it's been here for a month or two.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nTweet me when the adventure is over.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:36.000\nThat's the title of my book.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nThat's my wake me for the weekend.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nI got this little gift backstage, Dan.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:45.000\nIt's from a person by the hilarious name of Susan Shipper.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nAnd I was shipped to me first-class U.S. postal.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:52.000\nAnd I opened it up and it's a Scottish ski-and-do, which is what you put in your sock if you weren't killed.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nDid you mention it was through a rat?\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nI did not mention that.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:57.000\nAs it came out of the envelope?\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nIt's a different message.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nIt's a weapon. It's a knife that you keep in your sock if you weren't killed.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nBut then I was like, why would somebody give me that?\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nAnd I looked at it. There's a little emerald on the side here.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:07.000\nIt's an emerald dagger.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nI love it.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nIs that from a Scottish fan? Is the address in Scotland?\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nSusan Shipper doesn't sound terribly Scottish, but I love it.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nWhat is the address? Is there a return address?\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nDon't say it out loud.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:27.000\nWell, the wholesale cutlery store in Arlington, Texas.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nAll right. This watch is short.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:32.000\nOne of the shortcomings has to do with the settings I programmed into it.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:39.000\nIt vibrates my wrist every time someone tweets at me.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nEvery time somebody you know tweets you?\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nOr anytime anybody tweets you?\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nYou know, you set it up however you want.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nI made a mistake.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nI also immediately got all these games on my watch,\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nso at any given moment it'll buzz and I'll go like,\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\noh, that could be, someone needs a kidney.\n\n06:55.000 --> 07:00.000\nNo, Spymaster needs to know if he should face down these dogs.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:01.000\nYes or no.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nDo it.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nThere's like these games for the watch that are so dumb\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:11.000\nthat they're basically just like some guy, like a fictional guy,\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:15.000\nbuzzes your watch every six hours to let you know he needs more training.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nCan you Minecraft?\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nNo, you can't Minecraft. Everyone stop making fun of me.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nWhich brings me to a new thing.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nI don't even mean that because I don't take it personally\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:32.000\nbecause that's one of the four agreements.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nBy Don Miguel Ruiz, which my wife Erin McGathy turned me on to.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nThe four agreements, Jeff.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:42.000\nThe audiobook takes less time to listen to than this podcast,\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:46.000\nwhich I have not done yet, but I got into the first agreement.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:54.000\nBut the four agreements are, god damn this fucking watch.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nSpymaster, are you getting a watch?\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nOh, now there's another fucking tweet.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nNow people, of course, are tweeting me.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nYou guys are great.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:06.000\nIt's like the Simpsons where they're all shocking each other.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nI get it. You're amazing.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nThat's hilarious.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nI'm not going to judge you for it.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:19.000\nI'm just going to say it doesn't take talent to do what you're doing.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:25.000\nIt's just digital equivalent of throwing a tomato.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nIt doesn't take any talent.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nYou're creating a culture of fear, which is what I've learned from this book.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:37.000\nAnyway, so the first agreement is don't train raptors.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nNo, I'm getting my notes mixed up.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nThe first of the four agreements is,\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nand this is the four agreements by Miguel Ruiz.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nThe audio book is $10, which is what you paid to get in here.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nIt is two hours long, so if you listen...\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nWhat are the agreements?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nThe agreements are.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nFirst, can I explain what he means by agreement?\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nYes, please do.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nHe starts with the cosmology.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nEverything that we're experiencing right now is a dream.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nThat's not new.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:14.000\nThere's a famous song about rowing boats.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nI'm not kidding, I was thinking about that on the way here.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:21.000\nI'm like, God damn, they hide the secret in a fucking plain sight.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nIt's on the back of a cereal box.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nLife is but a fucking dream, motherfucker!\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nThen we watched The Matrix and we're like, holy shit!\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nYeah, row, row your boat!\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nI wanted to say the n-word so bad.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nRow, row your boat!\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:45.000\nWe are all dreaming right now.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:49.000\nIf life were but a dream, why not say the n-word after that?\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nBecause I don't want to pollute that dream for other people,\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nbecause we're in a shared dream also.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nIs that one of the agreements?\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nDon't drop an n-bomb and someone else's dream.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:02.000\nNo, the first agreement is be impeccable with your word,\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nand so we'll get to that.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nThere's some work on that one.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nI'll probably die getting that one right.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:14.000\nBut the idea, the cosmology is, we are all made of light.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nThe light between stars.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:22.000\nEasy to laugh at, young man.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nHe's not laughing at that concept.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:27.000\nHe's laughing at you fishing your way through this.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nYou don't know him.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nTrevor?\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nHe's laughing at the wrong shit.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.000\nI've met him.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\nHe's three minutes from his next DUI.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:45.000\nBut his dad's a senator, and I'm not bringing him up.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:49.000\nWe're all light.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nWhat is that?\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nWhat's the implication of that?\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nWhy is that important?\n\n10:55.000 --> 11:02.000\nIt's a model of light.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nWhat do you mean why is that important?\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:09.000\nWell, is that a necessary principle for the rest of the agreements?\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:10.000\nI think so.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nOkay, sorry.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:14.000\nBut you could probably do away with it after, I think,\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nbecause it never really comes back to it.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nBy the way, don't forget we're all light.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nThat's what I'm asking.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nI'm just taking you through the guy's whole cosmology.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:26.000\nThank you.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nDo you guys like the format where we bring Spencer up before me?\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nI thought that was a good choice.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nThank you, thank you.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nWhy are we saving him for dessert?\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nI couldn't be more nervous.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nI'm sure it really puts a lot more responsibility.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nWe have no idea.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:41.000\nIf Spencer is dessert,\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nSpencer's like the dessert cart laying off the side of the table\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nwhile you're eating dinner.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nYou're eyeing that cake the whole time.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nYou get to look at that delicious cake over there.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nSpencer, you're like a sexy cannoli sitting over there.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nThat sounds good.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nThere are some people who are here for the first time\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nand they're wondering, why am I watching this?\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nI'll tell you, it's for my book reviews.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nWhat are the goddamn agreements?\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:15.000\nThe cosmology is we're made of light.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nLife is a dream.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nWe're all dreaming right now.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nYou dream when you go to sleep,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:22.000\nand yeah, your dog also dreams and he's like,\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:27.000\nyou know, we're dreaming when we're awake too\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nbecause this is all an illusion.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nObviously, the difference between this dream\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nand the one you have when you're asleep\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nis simply the fact that this one's consistent,\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nwhich makes you think it's more real\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nbecause it will be here tomorrow,\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:41.000\nbut it also means it was here before you were born.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.000\nIt's as artificial a reality\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:47.000\nas the ones that you have when you go to sleep at night.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nLife is a dream.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nWe all share it, and that doesn't mean bad.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nIt doesn't mean less real than important.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nJust to put yourself in that space\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nwhere you think of reality,\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\neverything that we're living right now as

They're telling you,\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nthis is how you live in this dream.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nThis is what the alphabet is.

We took over the Earth\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nand we have created a dream\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nof very, very focused, very artificial things.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nAnd the only\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nproblem with it is that reality\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nis obscured\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nby the smoke that we create between all of us.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nWe're never actually...\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nHe says,\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\ngranted, I listened to this for a half hour\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nand I turned it

--> 14:58.000\nSo every time you're looking at anything with your eyes,\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nyou're actually seeing something\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nthat is simply reflective of something

reflecting each other\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nand the truth\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nis right in front of us\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nbut we have all been indoctrinated into a

dream.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nWe're going to wake up when we die.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nIt has nothing to do with afterlife or anything.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nIt's just to say

16:30.000\nor a bad enough boy.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nIt's all driven by fear\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nand prejudice and judgment\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nand just constant

Lutheran?\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nYou're saying...\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nLutheran is...\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nNo, I'm not...\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nI'm not trying to

light.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nIt looks like Catholic.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nYou've got stained glass windows and there's dudes wearing robes.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nYou know how

--> 30:00.000\nIt's Martin Luther.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nMartin Luther was the first guy to say,\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nlook, religion should be accessible\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nto the people.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nSo just sit and leave?\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nWell, I mean, I...\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nYou do a little call and response and stuff like that.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nHe said, for instance,\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nBibles should not have to be in Latin.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nOh, well, that's fair.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nIt's a dead language.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nThere's people who would argue with you,\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nbut yeah, I wouldn't be one of them\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nbecause Latin is not Aramaic.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nIt's the language God was talking.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nNo one knows Aramaic either.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nBibles should be...\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nDon't come knocking.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nWhich I believe was\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nDeuteronomy 211.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nYou're saying then that if you believe\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nin a creationist mythology\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nthat God created the universe from nothing\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nand created everything, you think that's an act\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nof self-loathing and low self-esteem on his part?\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nYou did say\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nHitler and God had low self-esteem.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nIf you don't,\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nthey have something in common, which is a...\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nOh, Hitler and God\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nhave something in common.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nIf you can't...\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nDan Harmon says...\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nGod is Hitler.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nWell, but think about it.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nJesus got crucified for saying\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nthe simple fact of people would go,\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\noh, are you God?\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nAnd he would go, well, technically, yeah.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nAnd they'd be like, that's enough, string them up.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nHe's like, no, we all are.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nIt's fine.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nWe're all outside the box.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nIt's not going to\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nget you laid in a Halloween party\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nto come into a costume\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nthat's like Hitler, but with a halo.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nAnd you're like, what's your point?\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nBecause Hitler was God.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nNo, that's not a good message to send.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nHe made a lot of mistakes as a human being.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nI'm saying that...\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nWait, Hitler or God?\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nWait, God or Hitler?\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nYou're the one that's...\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nNo, I'm asking you.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nYou're equating God with Hitler.\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nI'm telling you the one thing they had in common.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nMaybe they both like fried eggs,\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nbut the one thing that I know that they had in common\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nis that they weren't happy\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nwith their beginning state.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nGod wasn't happy.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nThe creationism...\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nMy God, the God that I believe in.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nThe birth of all existence, all this light that we are\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nand the mirrors that we all...\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nThat's the

have to agree with that.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nThe Four Agreements are all...\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nThe first one's stupid, we're all light.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nNo, no, that wasn't the first one.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nThat wasn't the first one.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nFuck you, no, don't gossip.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nThat's the first one.\n\n32:46.000 -->

would not disagree with that which is why I stopped\n\n44:30.640 --> 44:37.720\ndoing it that's every note I got after every improv show I ever did we just\n\n44:37.720 --> 44:42.760\nstart a really good improv last night in a room full of eight people who as a\n\n44:42.760 --> 44:49.400\nAaron come out here so you can tell us who that was Erin McGathy\n\n44:49.400 --> 45:05.000\nand white she's a great actress a beautiful red head and a sex box thank\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:09.080\nyou Patrick I was just like obsessively fixing my hair backstage now I think I\n\n45:09.080 --> 45:13.240\nhave a cocker-spaniel thing I love it no it looks beautiful thanks guys USS\n\n45:13.240 --> 45:18.200\nrock n roll is our the group that we saw yeah what are the words names of those\n\n45:18.200 --> 45:27.200\nkids Annie and Annie O'Connell Levin O'Connell and yeah Annie O'Connell Levin\n\n45:27.200 --> 45:31.240\nO'Connell I love Rick really good long-form improv I got so different from\n\n45:31.240 --> 45:35.720\nlike like short-form improv is like it's a parlor trick it's like we we learn\n\n45:35.720 --> 45:40.000\nskills that we can use I'm saying we because anybody can I'm not saying I'm\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.720\ngood at it I'm just mean like in short-form improv which I was trained in\n\n45:42.720 --> 45:46.720\nit's like they go okay here's all these disciplines and here's how you use them\n\n45:46.720 --> 45:50.440\nto make a quarter come out of someone's ear and you could like like Jeff is you\n\n45:50.440 --> 45:55.040\nknow does it like on like national television is that still a thing national\n\n45:55.040 --> 45:59.600\ntelevision yeah it's still national but when you're short-form improv is like\n\n45:59.600 --> 46:03.280\nit's like vaudeville like it's like be funny immediately so you don't like like\n\n46:03.280 --> 46:06.080\nour friend Derek Marys made a good analogy for short-form improv versus\n\n46:06.080 --> 46:09.200\nlong-form short-form is like if you're on a dirt bike there's a ramp every\n\n46:09.200 --> 46:12.320\ncouple seconds so you don't ever get that much runway and you don't ever get\n\n46:12.320 --> 46:16.360\nthat much air long-form is a lot of runway and you build up a lot of speed so\n\n46:16.360 --> 46:19.800\nwhen a joke hits you get to fly for a long time like so the payoff is way\n\n46:19.800 --> 46:24.920\nbigger if you can like make a joke land in a long-form situation short-form like\n\n46:24.920 --> 46:28.280\nwho's line is like joke joke joke joke joke joke you can also be like I mean\n\n46:28.280 --> 46:31.600\nanother way another way to illustrate the difference is you could show up and\n\n46:31.600 --> 46:36.000\nand walk into a room and go oh there's only four other people here and for a\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:39.160\nshort-form improv show that pretty much that doesn't mean it's gonna be a bad\n\n46:39.160 --> 46:42.960\nshow it could be the most memorable show of your life but but depending on what\n\n46:42.960 --> 46:47.440\nthey how they react backstage but it generally means this short-form improv\n\n46:47.440 --> 46:50.440\nengine is not gonna get the gas it needs but if you come in and there's four\n\n46:50.440 --> 46:52.880\nother people in the room there's a little black box and you're watching like\n\n46:52.880 --> 46:58.480\ngood disciplines like long-form improv people you I mean they may do a better\n\n46:58.480 --> 47:01.520\nshow for four people than they could have ever done for 40 people it's like you\n\n47:01.520 --> 47:05.040\nwalk out it's like church I mean like if you walk into a church and it's empty\n\n47:05.040 --> 47:11.160\nyou're I don't know it's like so there's more God for you or Hitler whatever you\n\n47:11.160 --> 47:16.120\nwant to use as your placeholder well I think we we saw it just really quick we\n\n47:16.120 --> 47:19.760\nsaw it we saw improv at the now theater in Los Angeles if you're interested in\n\n47:19.760 --> 47:28.160\nlong-form improv the hardcore shit that's Craig Kikowski laughing I improv\n\n47:28.160 --> 47:33.600\nguru right yeah Craig Craig is you who's many

59:40.240\ndon't remember all of Harmontown has led up to this point this is the most\n\n59:40.240 --> 59:44.920\nimportant moment well I was gonna ask you just because I didn't want to be\n\n59:44.920 --> 59:50.040\nremiss and having you on stage like we've farted around and had fun but you're\n\n59:50.040 --> 59:55.560\na performer that has been funny for a very long time and probably is admired\n\n59:55.560 --> 59:59.320\nby a lot of people when they watch you on screen and stuff it was just so I'm\n\n59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.560\nnot remiss as an interviewer I don't want to do my job wrong like is there a\n\n01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:08.200\nphilosophy that you follow because your ability to as I wrote be the person that\n\n01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:13.040\ndropped in and nailed it you know you wrote that I wrote that as a Valentine\n\n01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:21.960\nI wrote everything you said motherfucker no I know but the fact that you wrote\n\n01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.920\nfor me to say in the last episode as someone who came in late and nailed it\n\n01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:34.320\nand I was so scared to say it because I didn't know at that point if I had like\n\n01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:44.640\nto me I didn't know but no I just did to you what Aaron does to me all the time I'm so sorry what you just do it no I like I you you\n\n01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:52.480\nnever mind can we put a pin in that no I was put a pin in that oh my god this\n\n01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.080\nhas become something else no no like like well is there anything like when\n\n01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:03.960\nyou're when you before you step in front of eight fucking giant cameras 5,000\n\n01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.680\nlights 200 people dangling from rafters you know like is there like different\n\n01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.240\nactors say different things about how are they able to do comedy or drama or\n\n01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.200\nanything in that in that totally artificial environment because all we see\n\n01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.160\non the screen is it like it's because of the courtesy of these craftsmen who make\n\n01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.680\nthings look like a living room and look like a courtroom in Mississippi in 1950\n\n01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.160\nlike all we see is reality and then these amazing actors and we don't realize\n\n01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.480\nthat it's like Jesus Christ the environment is so unnatural and you get\n\n01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.640\nlike particularly comedic actors are able to exude all of this like weird\n\n01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.320\nhuman energy is there anything that you do do you kneel in front of a mirror in\n\n01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.040\nyour trailer do you remind yourself that you have a mantra are you crazy you this\n\n01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:54.440\nis I'm gonna say this is Dan being a really generous thoughtful man\n\n01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:00.880\npodcaster

before you step in front of cameras I don't I was\n\n01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.080\nthinking about this recently did I tell you about finding my my booger\n\n01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:07.680\nbiography you did yes you said that was what I used to I actually found in a\n\n01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:14.760\nnotebook the because I was trained as an actor and that what you do as an actor\n\n01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.760\nis in order to understand your character you write a biography of it and no one\n\n01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.840\nwill ever know what you've written but you'll know and that's why you do that\n\n01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:31.560\nand I found my biography that I wrote in 1983 for Booger revenge of the nerd for\n\n01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.920\nrevenge of the revenge of the nerd that was what I used to do I don't do it\n\n01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:43.360\nanymore because no one ever gives me roles where I where they actually start\n\n01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.360\nin a place and end in a place those don't really happen that well my friend\n\n01:04:47.360 --> 01:05:06.600\nthat's about to change how was I yeah I just I just yeah I just I liked it\n\n01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.240\nI

Is your\n\n01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:16.900\ndoorbell a real doorbell? I thought it was, I assumed, I'm sorry. Yes, it's a real doorbell.\n\n01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:21.620\nYou just walked into my house. Oh, I thought it was Don's doorbells and that I assumed that the\n\n01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:29.100\ndoorbell on the outside was just a, I'm sorry. Don's doorbells was run by my son downstairs. Sorry,\n\n01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:45.220\nwhat? You just close the door and then try to talk to me. Your son is important. Your son is\n\n01:11:45.220 --> 01:12:11.420\nimportant. Thank you. Don's doorbells is downstairs. Thank you. You get the idea. Mike Myers must\n\n01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:33.460\nhave been so young. Jeff, are we still in the improv? Should I run Don's doorbells? Yes,\n\n01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:42.460\nyeah. Don, it's me. Don's doorbells here. I'm slightly Scottish, slightly Irish. What's\n\n01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:57.420\nhappening? I love doorbells and you are? I am my son's father. My son is important. Don is\n\n01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:13.420\nimportant. Do you need me to call 911? Yes, and one. We got it, we got it. That's a fucking\n\n01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:28.740\nextra one. I almost blew it. But then I added the extra one. Did Curtis' character really go\n\n01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.940\nfrom point A to point B? Did we really see that develop? Or is that just another one of those\n\n01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:40.140\none note? This is what I mean. I thought I was going somewhere I didn't really go. You know what\n\n01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:46.740\nI did wrong, I endowed Curtis with a low status character. Curtis, I am. No, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.660\nNo, no, no, no. I love the love of God. Can I overrule this, Dan? I say if we're going to do\n\n01:13:51.660 --> 01:14:00.660\nany more Curtis character development, we save it for Shadow Run, everybody. Shadow Run. Okay,\n\n01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:07.700\nso we got Nightblade. We got, we should bring Demorge up here. DeMorge Brown on the stage,\n\n01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:22.340\nplease, DeMorge Brown. A cavalcade of stars tonight at Armageddon. Oh yeah. Demorge, why don't\n\n01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:33.500\nyou sit here. Sit here and take this mic. But I could stand. I will say Spencer is still sitting\n\n01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:38.860\nlower than the sea level. That's true. I was thinking, you know, they also have taller chairs.\n\n01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:46.300\nIt's a real confluence of factors here. We're having too much fun. Thank you. Thank you. You\n\n01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.620\nwant a taller chair. I'm fine. We probably have to get Padgett up to speed and what the hell we're\n\n01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.620\ndoing here, right? Padgett, are you familiar with? Should I get out? No, no, you're staying with us\n\n01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:58.220\nfor certain. We'd like you to help us play a game. It's like a role-playing game. Oh, it's\n\n01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:04.500\ncalled Dungeons and Dragons. It is. It's called Shadow Run. Oh, this? I don't know. It's like,\n\n01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:11.540\nthink of it kind of like the Matrix, the future. We're kind of like mercenaries, like Badasses\n\n01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:16.460\nfor hire. And what role will Padgett be playing? Well, see, that's the deal. I mean, we've got a\n\n01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:22.300\nwhole group of people here. Oh, do you have a chair coming in? Yeah, I don't have a character\n\n01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:27.660\nsheet for Hacker. That's the problem. Because he's a plot device. No, I'll do it. No, no,\n\n01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:32.940\nI think she should do, she should do Dr. Friend. No, no, you're Dr. Friend. All right, I'll do\n\n01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:37.260\nDr. Friend. Well, wait, let's hear him out. Let's hear him out. Well, I was just thinking that maybe\n\n01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:46.020\nDr. Friend, maybe what has happened is Dr. Friend has gone into sort of a time warp time thing and\n\n01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:55.500\nhas has changed and is now is now being played temporarily by Padgett. I don't know what's\n\n01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:59.500\nhappening. We don't actually have too many people, do we? We do have too many people. We have too\n\n01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:05.500\nmany people. I'm telling you, Jim Nightbill. Trust me. Who would I lie? Why would I lie to you? Oh\n\n01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:13.500\nmy God, I love you are I am willing to stand by the softest arm and cheer everyone on. Spencer,\n\n01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:21.940\nis it possible to have without anybody else being a Hawkeye? Maybe. What's a Hawkeye? Hawkeye is a\n\n01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:28.060\ncharacter that you don't want to be a Hawkeye. Spencer. Could she be some sort of NPC and come\n\n01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:32.860\nand join? Can I be an NPC? Well, yeah, I mean, there's all sorts of things that we could do\n\n01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:38.180\nsuccessfully. I mean, I'm telling you now, it's just I don't have a character sheet for an extra\n\n01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:45.860\ncharacter. So if you don't need a sheet, I'll walk away. We all have those days where we feel\n\n01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:56.620\ndifferent than we do the day before. I call those, I guess that's every day. But maybe would it be\n\n01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:06.220\nokay if Padgett was like my memories or Jeff just made an interesting pitch that it would take\n\n01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:14.380\nSpencer's yes to go with this. That what we do is take our shirts off. No, I'm not. We give everybody\n\n01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:21.020\ntwo eggs. We do a very special episode where we do a flashback and find out about Dr. Friend's\n\n01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:27.740\norigins. But it would have to be like, I mean, Spencer would be off the grid, off the map. Oh,\n\n01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:36.820\nyeah, it would be a real improv show. Which I mean, you guys are the masters of that thing. I\n\n01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:42.220\nthink if I, you know, Spencer, your job would be maybe to just define whatever needs to be defined\n\n01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:47.100\nin the spatial. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and change scenes. I'm just, yeah, you guys got to do some\n\n01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:55.980\nlifting though. And I just leave and go to the bathroom. No, no, my mom, Padgett, Padgett, we\n\n01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:00.420\nneed you for this. You're an actor and we need you. No, you need someone to leave. I will be that\n\n01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:05.700\nperson. No, no, what is happening? We're going on a magic carpet ride right now and you're on board\n\n01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:16.300\nfor this. We've done that before. I'm just asking for this to be happening. Spencer, I'm sorry you\n\n01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:22.060\nhad to see this. You're fine. Don't worry about it. Please tell me that's how Jeff initiates sex.\n\n01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:36.500\nYou want to go on a magic carpet ride? Dan, why don't you code DM and you at least you said Dan,\n\n01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:41.900\ngo over it with Spencer and you guys together come up with the you do the intro for wherever we are\n\n01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:50.060\nand this is going to be bad. Oh, he did it. Jesus. Let me tell you that chairs the wrong height.\n\n01:18:50.060 --> 01:19:01.820\nNobody gets a chair, a folding IKEA chair over an audience like Dan Harmon. He's crazy, but he's\n\n01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:05.940\ngreat. Well, Padgett, this is your wheelhouse because you're also on an amazing show called\n\n01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:19.060\nThrilling Adventure Hour. Were you? We're not using character sheets. We're freestelling us. This is\n\n01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:25.220\nthe origin story of Padgett Curtis's character as Dr. Friend. He is a, would you want to describe\n\n01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:31.900\nyour character to her briefly? To the extent that I understand it. Thank you. Dr. Friend and I\n\n01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:40.020\ndon't really. Dr. Friend is a part of the gang. He is a medical man, but he's a medical man who is\n\n01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:46.420\ndisturbed and he has a past. Okay. But no one really knows what that is. Okay. And among the\n\n01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:57.300\nthings that he's done in the course of this is he has powers that he can use on people like, no,\n\n01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.940\nno, wait a minute. I'll tell you. Oh my God. If there's files, I want a file. He does things like\n\n01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:09.100\nhe can do healing powers. Healing. So in the course of one of our adventures, if we get hurt,\n\n01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:16.380\nif somebody gets hurt and is dying, you have a healing power. Yeah. Right. And that everybody\n\n01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:21.460\nhas powers of some kind. Okay. Yeah, it's kind of like a magical world, Padgett, but it's also the\n\n01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:26.420\nfuture. So it's tech, it's technological, but there's also spells and magic. So it's like the\n\n01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:33.420\nfuture and a lot of criminal activity. And also, and also it's Seattle. I have no file. So I have\n\n01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:39.260\nno power tonight is just focused on the mysterious past. Now this is this is backstory. So none of\n\n01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:43.300\nus are going to be playing. No one is going to be. You're an even playing field with the rest of\n\n01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:48.980\nus. Only only Curtis knows what is. Sorry, I'm very competitive. And I want powers and a file.\n\n01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:54.540\nI'm sorry. You're allowed to be whoever all your roles will become apparent. It's a special one\n\n01:20:54.540 --> 01:21:01.020\noff episode. We're exploring the origins of a character. So Spencer, what year is it when\n\n01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:09.380\nwe're normally playing shadow run? 2074. Okay. And how old how old do we think Dr. Friend is? Oh,\n\n01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:28.380\nhe's a good 27. What's 27 and four minus 27. Yep. What somebody say 3646 2046. Our story begins\n\n01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:41.820\nin 2046 AD at Baltimore General Hospital. Ivy overruns the decrepit building, which has not\n\n01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:52.180\nbeen the same since the fall of the hospital. And the healthcare program. Still patients are\n\n01:21:52.180 --> 01:22:02.060\nserved here. But they're never happy to be served. They only have to be. We move through the front\n\n01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:10.260\ndoors of the hospital and down the decrepit halls and start to pick up the whales of a woman giving\n\n01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:25.820\nbirth. We enter the delivery room. Certainly not the most sterile one we've ever seen. That's\n\n01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:35.860\nright. Keep going. Keep going. Breathe. Push. Push. I'm afraid, Mark. Why? I've never done this\n\n01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:43.580\nbefore you asshole. Why am I afraid? It's all right. We're in the hospital. People are looking\n\n01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:51.220\nafter us. Nothing can go wrong. Come on. Look, do you have you heard from my sister? No, no,\n\n01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:58.220\nI've tried to reach her, but there's no answer on her on her chip phone. She's she's always so\n\n01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:04.140\nwild. Always trying to find a good time. Always giving wigs to men. She's having casual sexual\n\n01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:11.580\nrelationships with. Just if you hear from Anastasia, just tell her to get here now. She's\n\n01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:21.140\nI'll try her again. It's all I can do. Dr. Gerber. Dr. Gerber. Anastasia in room one. Anastasia's\n\n01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:39.500\nhere. Keep pushing. Dr. Gerber. Dr. Gerber. There was a Curtis. This is this is this is when you were born. This is 27 years old. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. This is totally\n\n01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:46.620\nmisunderstood. 27 years earlier. I'm in there. 27 years. I don't have to worry. Did I blow it? Okay. No, no, no. You were\n\n01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:55.500\nright. I was wrong. What? I thought I was still Dr. Friend. And in fact, I'm still someone who knows the\n\n01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:03.420\npregnant woman giving birth. No, no, I'm the baby. I'm in there. What? I'm in there. He's in here. I need a man to play\n\n01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:11.300\nyour dad. So now Dr. Gerber. Dr. Gerber. I am. Oh my God. Get my office. I want you in my office right now. Dr.\n\n01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:17.260\nGerber. What's wrong? What have I done? Dr. Gerber. What have you done? What haven't you done? Don't you realize that you're\n\n01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:25.140\nthe brother of the person who is the father of the child you're delivering right now? Oh, that's good. It's Anastasia. I'm a\n\n01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:36.540\ndrug intern. Anastasia. I don't get it. I thought you knocked me up. I got a baby that's gonna be the brother of that\n\n01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:43.540\nbaby. I don't care whose baby it is. All I know is it's gonna look a lot like that doctor right there. No, no, listen to\n\n01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:51.260\nme. Anastasia. Dr. Gerber. Anastasia. What happened to us was a long time ago. That's in the history. No, I was like\n\n01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:56.940\nnine months ago. Okay. Calling Dr. Craig Kikowski. We need help in long form\n\n01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:05.980\nimprov. Calling Dr. Craig Kikowski. Our long form improv is in critical condition. Critical condition. Dr.\n\n01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:23.380\nKikowski. Paging Dr. Kikowski. Dr. Kikowski. Yes, I was playing golf. What can I do? Well, we've got a patient\n\n01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:35.580\nhere in crisis. And I thought I knew what I was doing. Patient in crisis. You guys, you guys, I'm an orderly. You'll\n\n01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:44.860\nnever see me again. I'm interrupting this very focused scene about the origin of a character to let you know that at\n\n01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:56.220\nthis point in future sci fi history, some big shit is happening forest gump style on the tele viewer. Look. They all\n\n01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:07.220\nlook to the TV to see a news report about something. Dr. Kikowski. Well, it seems that Vitas is back again. It's\n\n01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:14.340\nwaving the nation faster than ever before. We got babies turned left ways, babies turned down ways and adults\n\n01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:21.140\nturned back ways. It's an ugly world. You got to not touch anybody. Don't even bother washing your hands. Cut off\n\n01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:31.020\nyour hands. Wash the stumps. We're talking Vitas. It's back, baby. I'm out of here. Have you guys made sure that\n\n01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:41.700\nyour baby is please don't be offended by this, but human. God, please. Look, someone, someone take this metal card\n\n01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:48.460\nwith a number sketch in it. Officer Gerber, your brother's number is listed there. If you could get in touch. You know\n\n01:26:48.460 --> 01:27:02.900\nwhat? I'll have a look at that number. If I could. Obama? Look, no one, no one, no one trusts you since the\n\n01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:16.180\npickle scandal of 2014. Well, I believe pickle scandal was a little later. Yes, it was. That's fine. We've got a\n\n01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:29.340\nquality. Here we go. Strangely enough, we've got emergency breach birth. Oh, good God, it's hideous. Come out. We\n\n01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:39.580\ndon't know what it is. It's an orderly that was just hanging out beneath it. God damn it. I'm a long form improv\n\n01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:51.580\ndoctor and not an OBGYN. I also don't know if you can save this six years later at the friend household. It's a\n\n01:27:51.580 --> 01:28:04.700\nshame. What's a shame, mom? That long form improv. It's a shame. They tried. I've heard you talk about that\n\n01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:12.140\nsometimes, but you never really explain. Because I don't want to talk about all of it, son. Well, even a little bit.\n\n01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:25.180\nBaby, I think he's old enough. He is old enough to hear the story of how Obama came to the hospital. And you slit\n\n01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:37.820\nthe throat of a ghost orderly. He is old enough. That has been distilled. Grandson. Into a sentence. Grandson, it's your\n\n01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:44.380\ngrandfather. Would you come out on the porch with me a moment? I just want to have a talk with you. Well, sure. Sure,\n\n01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:54.620\nGraham. By the way, in the background, cars are flying. That's never going to goddamn happen. Grandson, I won't be around a whole much\n\n01:28:54.620 --> 01:29:03.660\nlonger. Oh, these damned flying cars. When I was a boy, there was no, we had pickles until that horrible scandal came along.\n\n01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:11.900\nAnd I want to tell you this before I pass along, son. Okay. I want you to follow in my footsteps and be a doctor. However, you\n\n01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:19.420\ndo understand that you're not like other people, boy. What do you mean? Have you ever noticed anything weird happen to you at\n\n01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:34.580\nnight when you're laying in bed all alone? Yeah, five months earlier. Come on. Come on. Rudy. Your boy. Your boy. There's\n\n01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:41.940\nnothing there. There's nothing. Oh, no, there. No, there is. There's injured injured injured. Honey, it's time to go to bed.\n\n01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:50.660\nOh, no. But it's look at Rudy. There's something wrong. He got his leg caught in a trap. Rudy's an old dog. No, he's young young young.\n\n01:29:50.660 --> 01:30:04.300\nI can heal him. You. You have the power to heal. You have the power to heal. He'll heal heal. Honey, go to\n\n01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:11.980\nbed. Everything's fine. Rudy's fine. No, I healed him. Grandson back to the present. So Grandson, remember that time you\n\n01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:19.300\nhealed the dog with your mind? Yes. I do remember it. But I thought it was all a dream. It wasn't a dream. And we're not all\n\n01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:34.460\nlight. That's horseshit. We're real people. We're here right now. I want to make one agreement with you, son. Okay. Grandson, that\n\n01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:41.900\nis. You were you were contaminated at birth by V talks and you're you're going to suffer some very special skills and some\n\n01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:53.140\nvery special special detriments inside Papi's chest. His heart beats heavier and heavier. Oh, I'm dying. Don't heal me,\n\n01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:59.420\nboy. Don't heal me. Let it let let it happen naturally. Boom, boom. Let it I don't know. Do I see that look in your eyes,\n\n01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:22.260\nGrandson? I see that look. Oh, cut to a doctor explains V talks completely lethal. It'll kill you in 100% of\n\n01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:30.300\nsituations. And less maybe some crazy shit is in your genes like you have troll stuff. I'm a doctor.\n\n01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:52.580\nCambridge bells fade up on the scene of friends grandpa dying and we dissolve to the now not perfectly manicured lawns of an Ivy League medical\n\n01:31:52.580 --> 01:32:08.980\nkegs and date rapes of old. No, it's it's good. Well, there's a couple ways the future will be better. There's there's more\n\n01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:16.220\neducation. There's put into this like sex ed is no longer about just what diseases you can get me actually tell kids\n\n01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:27.460\nbefore they get horny about consent. Okay, so we zoom in on a medical proscenium and into a medical the medical class.\n\n01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:48.140\nSon, I'm here to show you the medical college you should go to. And so what do you think? Hey, friend, it's real weird.\n\n01:32:48.140 --> 01:33:00.340\nWe have to watch these meetings, right? I know. Geez. I just want my son to pick the best college Princeton. All right,\n\n01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:09.620\nokay, thank you, Mrs. Friend. And I think that will put an end to parents day here at medical school. If that's what you say,\n\n01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:20.220\nalways. But I never approved of it. It feels weird. Now, as we were saying, how does nanotechnology affect the human condition?\n\n01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:31.980\nAnd what is human? After all, Mr. Friend, perhaps you'd be more willing to answer that or does your troll nature confuse the\n\n01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:41.660\nissue? The camera whispers about friend whispers about friend. Not good enough. Weird. We is a weird guy. The camera\n\n01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:49.740\npushes through those students and lands on a troll like Dr. Friend. Now 21 years old from inside from inside his mind a voice\n\n01:33:49.740 --> 01:34:03.660\nspeaks. Trust your instincts, Doc. Do you like French fries, Doc? Trust your instincts, Doc.\n\n01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:17.940\nMy troll DNA has nothing to do with my work as a doctor. Oh, really? We have ourselves a protege. Wait, what do you\n\n01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:31.540\ncall it? A protege. I spent the year teaching in France. I'm your protege. Get out of here, Dave. All right.\n\n01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:41.940\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, please, I think this could be a teachable moment here at hologram, John F. Kennedy Ivy League Medical\n\n01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:55.460\nSchool for the surgical and nanotechnological art. Please do indulge us, the world's first troll surgeon. What do you feel\n\n01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:01.720\nabout Hellman's law regarding the inefficacy of nanotechnological devices in the bloodstream?\n\n01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:13.560\nInefficacy? Good word. Dana, also out. This is not English. I'm sorry. I do worry we were having tea in the\n\n01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.880\nhole. Also, you, Mrs. Stevenson. I don't care how much I'm blind on my ret. Doctor, doctor, I would love to.\n\n01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:25.800\nProfessor, Professor, do you mean to tell me that you're going to let a troll person get up and tell me about\n\n01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:35.880\nnanotechnology? Yes, you all have to start listening. It's a new world. Trolls are every bit as worthy and\n\n01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:44.840\nacceptable as doctors as any of the rest of you. And I'm going to prove it. We will. As, as friend\n\n01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:52.680\nspeaks, sweat drips from his armpits in a way that is inhuman and it creates puddles beneath him.\n\n01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:58.040\nWell, perhaps before you advise us on our physiology, you should manage your own. Look at the puddles.\n\n01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:07.160\nBut he's not wrong. Look at the puddles. You'll have to work much harder or the world will have to get\n\n01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:13.560\nmuch worse before you're successful. Just, just as his competition is happening. I'll work harder.\n\n01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:27.960\nAnd you'll regret this as long as you live. The professors, the professors face begins to melt\n\n01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:41.640\nlike butter in a microwave dripping to the ground. Beautiful. Blood goes into a signature that says\n\n01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:50.360\nDr. Friend. Cut to 2000 something, but it's a courtroom. It's a futuristic courtroom. Dr. Friend\n\n01:36:50.360 --> 01:37:05.960\nis in shackles facing a hologram of a judge. Dr. Friend. Dr. Friend. Is it in fact your contention\n\n01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:20.360\nthat you have the power of the mind at your will as a healing device? I'm reminded, of course,\n\n01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:27.800\nof the story of a child who had a mere human cold, which has been eradicated for some decades.\n\n01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:35.000\nBut his parents thought that they could through Christian science and the word of God heal this\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:42.200\nyoung man and did not give him syrup of Ipacaca, Sudafed, or whatever crude inventions they had\n\n01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:51.400\nat that time. Is it possible that you, as a non-human doctor, claim to understand the human\n\n01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:57.320\nworkings that were first profligated by Von Lee and hooking his microscope?\n\n01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:07.720\nYour Honor, is there a question for my clients? The question is. Prosecutor Sanders, we've asked\n\n01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:17.000\nthis many times before. If you could please rephrase your monologues into a single sentence.\n\n01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.480\nObjection, Your Honor. And I don't think she knew what she was going to say after she said\n\n01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:35.080\nProsecutor Sanders. Orderly asshole. Well now, Ms. Emily. Hold on. Your objection was about me\n\n01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:40.200\nnot knowing what I was going to say in an improvised sketch? Don't take it personally.\n\n01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:50.040\nI'm not. I'm not. I'm just a loyal as the Latinos would say abogato in a three-dimensional\n\n01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:56.200\nsituation, but we have added a fourth dimension and a fifth dimension, and I'm reminded of Sophocles\n\n01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:02.920\nwho once said, good lord, how is a person to defend themselves when they don't own enemy?\n\n01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:08.760\nAs this courtroom drama is unfolding, a weird green vapor starts filling up the courtroom\n\n01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:18.360\nfrom underneath the cracks in the doors. Spencer? Yes. Yes, Jeff. Tell him about the\n\n01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:28.760\ngases coming into the room. Oh, it's, there's gas. As a court stenographer, I'm sorry to weigh in\n\n01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:37.400\non the record, but something's wrong with the gas coming from the flower. The gas, the gas itself\n\n01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:45.000\nflows from amorphous diaphanous to solid and stinking form. I'm just, I'm talking as fast as I\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.920\ncan. I'm just a jury member, but I tell you what, this gas makes me want to say everything I never\n\n01:39:50.920 --> 01:40:01.560\ndid. I wish I would have taken a bath and a barrel of flour. I wish I would have hit a man with my\n\n01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:05.240\ncar. One by one, people from the back of the courtroom start dropping dead and suffocating\n\n01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:11.640\nfrom this green vapor emanating through the room. While it's happening, because it's such\n\n01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:18.520\ndramatic juxtaposition, Dr. Friend, as if he's not the one making it happen, gives his final argument\n\n01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:31.640\nabout himself. I am a troll, but I'm more than just a troll. I'm a troll who cares deeply about\n\n01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:42.760\nall species. Objection, your honor, people are interrupting his monologue right now.\n\n01:40:42.760 --> 01:41:02.760\nIt's in my head. I was adopted. I just realized I'm adopted. And you're all,\n\n01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:10.760\nall of you going to regret this day because I'm going to right now clear the green fog from this\n\n01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:21.320\nroom just before you die. And then you're going to see the sort of troll I am. As your lawyer,\n\n01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:27.800\nI would have been appreciating being brought in on this strategy. As the green fog clears,\n\n01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:35.800\nthere is nothing left but a sea or galley, as they call it, gallery. What do they call it in\n\n01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:50.600\nthe courtroom? A sea of corpses, corpses. I'm a lowly court stenographer, but I know from going\n\n01:41:50.600 --> 01:42:03.720\nto college it's a galley of dead people. You're alive! It's a bit surprising that a troll would\n\n01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:14.440\nsurprise me with science. Wait, as a tall man or a black man? Well, you know, I'm part of a lot\n\n01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:21.080\nof old qualities, but really the thing is, it's a science. As Dr. Friend slips out the courtroom\n\n01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:25.880\ndoors, we crane shot on the conversation between those two characters who are immune to green gas.\n\n01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:35.240\nCut to a Rolling Stones cue blares as we cut to the inside of a cyber tavern.\n\n01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:42.600\nJust to clarify, Dr. Friend did not save those people. No, everyone died. Okay. Sorry, go ahead.\n\n01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:52.760\nI'll never stop. Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm the overused Rolling Stones cue.\n\n01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:00.440\nI'm the song that's used every time you want. Yeah, it's like $45,000 every time you use it.\n\n01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:10.760\nThe camera pushes down the bar. As visa holograms inform us of the state of the new world,\n\n01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:19.400\nthe dragon president has been assassinated. BTL ships are infected with VVRL viral nanos.\n\n01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:29.480\nWomen are equal. That's the sci-fi future. Everything's insane. Women are equal. Everyone has agency.\n\n01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:45.720\nAs your new president, Herman Cain, you know, folks once asked me what would I do\n\n01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:49.640\nif I did not win this election and I said I would make mayonnaise.\n\n01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:57.160\nIn fact, I did win the presidency and I'm still going to make mayonnaise.\n\n01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:04.120\nI am reminded of the movie motion picture officer and a gentleman in which Richard\n\n01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:11.640\nGears' character's name was Mayo, but his nickname was Mayonnaise. We arrive at a lone Dr. Friend,\n\n01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:23.160\nnow fully troll, now fully alone. He nurses his indescript drink through troll lips\n\n01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:28.040\nand mutters to himself dramatically.\n\n01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:45.800\nI wonder if I'll ever get over the guilt that I feel for not having cured all of those people in\n\n01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:57.720\nthe courtroom. Why can't you save me? Your indescript wounds haunt you.\n\n01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:04.840\nYou know what? The thing is Obamacare doc, Obamacare, and French fries. Do you like them?\n\n01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:14.760\nYou haven't fixed anything. You talk about saving people. The camera swivels to reveal\n\n01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:21.240\na trench-co-cloaked troll of a different age nursing his own drink.\n\n01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:30.840\nHe knocks back the glass with the air of an old school drunk before turning his yellow gaze\n\n01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:40.280\non his racial compatriot. Fuck people. Fuck them all. What do you mean?\n\n01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:46.600\nWhat, how many favors have they done you? Did they cure you?\n\n01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:52.920\nThey give a fuck whether you live or die? Doctor? No, they didn't.\n\n01:45:53.960 --> 01:46:01.880\nMy name is Detective Emil Trollinger. Of Emil Trollinger, Trollinger.\n\n01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:10.040\nIt's a German name, but I was originally Jewish. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Think about how that feels.\n\n01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:17.080\nFeels, feels. We cut to the moment when he became German and not Jewish. Or not.\n\n01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:22.920\nWhy is Ellis Island still open? So embarrassing, embarrassing, embarrassing.\n\n01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:31.880\nWhy do I have to... Well, we were working on some sort of trap. Cut back. What are you saying to me?\n\n01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:38.920\nI'm saying to you that this world we used to think was a world is the world we thought came after\n\n01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:47.560\nthis world. This is hell, my friend, and it's divided into two groups of people. People who give a fuck\n\n01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:53.960\nof people who live to see tomorrow. Give a fuck, see tomorrow. My name is Detective Trollinger.\n\n01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:59.240\nTrollinger, Trollinger, Trollinger. I used to be a cop until I became a fucking troll.\n\n01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:07.880\nA fucking troll, a fucking troll. Now I organize Shadow Runs for Shadow Runners.\n\n01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.600\nAnd if you call or visit text this number, you could get involved in that world.\n\n01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.640\nComplicated, complicated, complicated. Visit text is bullshit. I don't care. Why wouldn't you just...\n\n01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:24.680\nThose voices you're hearing are called what the troll community calls the inner critic.\n\n01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:30.280\nDon't deny me, don't deny me. I'm totally... You know, the thing that... What I like the most\n\n01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:36.200\nis ice cream, doc. I'd like to go to Martha's. One of the troll voices is just Obama talking about.\n\n01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:39.320\nJust do my best. That's our curse.\n\n01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:46.600\nHey, Trollinger, Trollinger, you're gonna order something? I'm trying to run a cybertavern here.\n\n01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:54.440\nHey, what are you looking at? Where's the horseshoe? I'll take double what I had on the side of the hair.\n\n01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:01.560\nTrollinger, I have worked very hard to achieve something in my life,\n\n01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.360\nand I've been knocked down every time I stood up.\n\n01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:12.200\nOh, well, you must be the only one. Sound of my eyes rolling so far back, they roll back around\n\n01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.720\nand came up from the bottom in our forever owed one rotation.\n\n01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:25.320\nAs Trollinger says this, he starts to feel his heart beat harder and harder.\n\n01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:28.360\nBoom, boom. Funny thing about... Boom, boom.\n\n01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:34.360\nTroll bodies. They can take a punch, but not from God or Hitler.\n\n01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:44.920\nDo me a favor, doc. Don't save me. Don't save me. This is no life.\n\n01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:49.720\nI won't. Maybe... No, wait! Maybe you break the rule this time.\n\n01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:55.560\nThat goes against my code. I have to save you. I can do no harm.\n\n01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.560\nOh, Hippocratic Oath...\n\n01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:05.160\nOh my God, Julie, did I hear you say Hippocratic Oath?\n\n01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.520\nHippocratic Oath, right?\n\n01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.680\nOh my God, it left me so much elbow pain.\n\n01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:10.840\nThere it was. Seriously.\n\n01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:16.520\nWhen I was studying nursing, Hippocratic Oath Betch.\n\n01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.600\nOh my God, first of all, when you started...\n\n01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.760\nI just want to say... You know it, right?\n\n01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.600\nI just want to say you always shit on your haircut when you started nursing,\n\n01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.840\nbut seriously, it was so cute.\n\n01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.840\nOh my God, but it's totally bad.\n\n01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:33.160\nSomebody save that man. He's dying over there. There's a man dying in the bar.\n\n01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:37.240\nBack to the present at Hank's Last Stand,\n\n01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:40.600\nwhere Dr. Friend was revealing his past to the gang.\n\n01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.880\nWe're just being nurses. Fuck.\n\n01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:49.160\nWe fucking do shit all day.\n\n01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:50.200\nAll day long.\n\n01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:54.280\nSo sometimes we fucking hang out and talk about shoes.\n\n01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.400\nWhat about you? What do you do? Do you save lives?\n\n01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.240\nMeanwhile, in the future...\n\n01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:00.920\nIn the future!\n\n01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:06.120\nIn a goddamn board game, we like to save lives.\n\n01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:06.840\nAnd save this guy.\n\n01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.520\nAs the nurses continue talking,\n\n01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:13.240\nwe move from the planet into the vacuum of space,\n\n01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:16.120\nand slowly to the center of the universe,\n\n01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:24.680\nwhere God and Hitler float in the center of all reality.\n\n01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:28.040\nAnd they're watching a sitcom about two nurses called...\n\n01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:30.680\nI'm silent. I'm a female. I'm silent.\n\n01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.760\nGod and Hitler are watching a sitcom called Perkler and Perkler's.\n\n01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:48.760\nThey live on the Upper East Side, and they have girlfriends, and they're gross.\n\n01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:51.160\nAnd we're crazy about it, not really.\n\n01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.360\nHitler's hand reaches out with a remote.\n\n01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:57.000\nGod's closes over the top of it, stopping him.\n\n01:50:58.280 --> 01:50:59.080\nDon't, Hitler.\n\n01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:03.880\nI just have a problem with the way you treat yourself.\n\n01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:06.680\nI feel like he treats himself so badly.\n\n01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:09.240\nWait, me or him? Me or your husband?\n\n01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:10.920\nBoth of you, but you more.\n\n01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:11.880\nOkay, I know.\n\n01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:12.360\nJust imagine you're so fast.\n\n01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:13.560\nStenos Klopengas!\n\n01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.800\nThat has been Harmontown.\n\n01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.120\nCraig Kikowski, everybody.\n\n01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:26.600\nD'Amose Brown.\n\n01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:31.000\nErin McGathy, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:31.880\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:36.680\nCurtis Armstrong, everybody.\n\n01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.440\nHagit Brewster.\n\n01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.480\nAnd your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:51.640\nAnd Kris Boruff, and Sarah Hill, and Zac McKeever, who are back there doing all the technical\n\n01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:52.920\nshit every week.\n\n01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:55.400\nChris and Sarah are doing the live streaming stuff.\n\n01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:58.120\nEarthshine Jane for laying down the sexy booze on us.\n\n01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:02.120\nYeah, for hunting down Curtis on the streets.\n\n01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:09.560\nI think we did it.\n\n01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:12.440\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:27.000\nYeah, it's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[128777]}
