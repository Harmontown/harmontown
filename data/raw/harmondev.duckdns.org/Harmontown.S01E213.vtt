Yeah\n\n01:45.840 --> 01:51.760\nYou were in town for a grandma funeral, right? Yeah, my my dad's mom passed away\n\n01:52.320 --> 01:56.200\nShe she accomplished her mission. She was a just just pushing 90\n\n01:57.320 --> 01:59.320\nAnd and the\n\n02:00.040 --> 02:03.480\nDementia which we're learning new things about this ago\n\n02:03.480 --> 02:08.800\nWe all maybe have it like like we all just kind of have it in varying degrees and then\n\n02:09.600 --> 02:15.320\nBut but like you know, it's it's really kind of like the the tragically typical way to\n\n02:16.200 --> 02:22.720\nThat a story ends is that which are there my parents were moving her in the process of helping her move because the dementia\n\n02:22.720 --> 02:27.760\nGot to a point where she really needed to live with people her husband had passed a while ago\n\n02:27.760 --> 02:36.520\nAnd while packing like just the energy and the confusion of like, you know, when you're when you're a person with\n\n02:36.760 --> 02:40.080\nIn that stage of dementia all of a sudden\n\n02:40.600 --> 02:46.240\nThere's your ships being put in boxes and all this stuff and she something got triggered where she's like\n\n02:46.240 --> 02:49.160\nI got to check on my my I got to get the cat from the basement\n\n02:49.160 --> 02:54.360\nShe doesn't have a cat in the basement and she like she fell down the stairs and\n\n02:54.360 --> 03:00.960\nAnd a broker hip and they took her to the hospital and then it's this is just that the tragic ironies of like this\n\n03:00.960 --> 03:06.960\nIs just like Joseph Campbell like like like like you have to we have to accept that our lives\n\n03:07.280 --> 03:13.080\nthe last parts of them are but like if you can't be attached to this flesh because the\n\n03:13.400 --> 03:15.920\nThe the the way we go out is so\n\n03:16.440 --> 03:21.880\nJust ridiculous if we're lucky enough to make it through a healthy life and and just to have this this this\n\n03:21.880 --> 03:25.800\nChassis just rust and fall apart\n\n03:25.800 --> 03:29.000\nYou know you have to but it get because it just gets so from there\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:34.040\nIt just gets so cartoonish because they it's like you have dementia and you have a broken hips and then they are like\n\n03:35.200 --> 03:36.960\nwe can't\n\n03:36.960 --> 03:40.000\ngive her a new hip because\n\n03:40.840 --> 03:47.000\nShe won't be able to participate in her recovery because she'll forget she has a bionic hip\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:53.840\nWhich you need to you need sanctions and participation in order to have one of those things take she'll\n\n03:54.280 --> 03:59.000\nShe'll forget and she'll just she'll step on it the wrong way and she won't know what's going on\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.440\nAnd it'll it'll get all fucked up\n\n04:00.440 --> 04:04.320\nIt'll be a fate worse than than a than a peaceful death for her\n\n04:04.320 --> 04:07.840\nI the not that that was the only thing she was also she went into a coma\n\n04:08.480 --> 04:14.920\nBut it's also like then you also think like like oh if she comes out of this coma then she's gonna be in\n\n04:14.920 --> 04:19.920\nIn you know with her dementia. She's gonna be in bed with a broken hip for the remainder of her life\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.560\nWhich is though if those things start to heal they heal wrong as you have to re break them\n\n04:25.120 --> 04:28.080\nAnd and she'll be she'll be coming in and out of\n\n04:28.840 --> 04:30.880\ncontinuity and\n\n04:30.880 --> 04:35.360\nRe-learning every five minutes. Oh shit. I have an incredibly painful\n\n04:36.320 --> 04:40.680\nThing that I didn't know about like like just imagine like that horrible kind of fate\n\n04:40.680 --> 04:47.360\nWhich is like probably really common like are you gonna like dementia being a very common way that we go out like just that?\n\n04:47.480 --> 04:52.400\nCD skipping and and and that relationship with like this this other really common thing\n\n04:52.400 --> 04:56.120\nWhich is we all tend to kind of fall off a porch and break our hip. This is sad\n\n04:56.120 --> 04:59.320\nI don't I'm not trying to bring everybody down, but if I did it would go something like that\n\n05:00.640 --> 05:05.160\nBut but I mean I think that's you know you're 25 you're listening to the podcast you you know\n\n05:05.160 --> 05:11.120\nIt's like like the obvious message from that is Carpe diem and like get your get your licks in place a monopoly with your family\n\n05:11.120 --> 05:13.100\nWhich is what I did\n\n05:13.100 --> 05:15.560\nBut it was such a trip like what we're driving into town\n\n05:15.680 --> 05:19.400\nWe're like you're bussing into town. We've done a show like in\n\n05:20.040 --> 05:26.720\nLansing or something like that the night before that we're driving to Milwaukee and I point towards the historic third word, right?\n\n05:26.720 --> 05:31.040\nThat's down with the original comedy sports was right mm-hmm and or not the original one\n\n05:31.040 --> 05:32.600\nBut the one that I met you at yeah\n\n05:32.600 --> 05:37.160\nYou were like around the corner from where Schrab and I did comedy sports before we left and I met and it's like\n\n05:37.160 --> 05:40.120\nI was saying to the guys in the bus like oh, it's like right right down there in\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:44.200\n1994 that's where I met Dan Harmon and Rob Schwab and\n\n05:44.400 --> 05:50.080\nThen I got a text an hour later and you're there and you came to our show and you watched me do improv\n\n05:50.080 --> 05:55.200\nAnd I was at this restaurant the spy themed restaurant called safe house and you're like that's where I first did stand up\n\n05:55.200 --> 05:56.720\nYeah, yeah, it was yeah\n\n05:56.720 --> 06:03.680\nI'd be like 17 and like because they have like this spy theme there that was made it an easier place to be underage and do stand\n\n06:03.680 --> 06:07.680\nUp because the spy thing was like what's the password and you're like gibble gobble Google and\n\n06:08.840 --> 06:10.840\nAnd so like you could kind of like\n\n06:11.440 --> 06:17.560\nTheir eyes less on the prize of like law enforcement and more on like that like this whole like are you James Bond and like go through\n\n06:17.560 --> 06:20.440\nThe bookcase and all this I had to dance around like a chicken for 10 seconds\n\n06:20.440 --> 06:23.920\nAnd then I didn't know that I'm also on camera and the bar\n\n06:23.920 --> 06:28.920\nYeah, that's the idea there is that they're the people in the front room like they're there\n\n06:28.920 --> 06:32.760\nIt's basically just like Rocky Horror Picture Show. Are you a virgin or have you been here before?\n\n06:32.760 --> 06:34.760\nYou know, it's like the password is\n\n06:35.280 --> 06:40.120\nWhere was when I was going there are you I'm looking for a safe house. First of all, that's not a word\n\n06:41.320 --> 06:45.120\nSecond of all, that's that I mean that doesn't I mean that that's what your enemies are gonna say\n\n06:47.920 --> 06:50.840\nRight if I had said to the gal because like you walk in there\n\n06:50.840 --> 06:54.600\nThere's no sign for it. There was me and then and this like this other woman like like like, you know\n\n06:54.600 --> 06:59.920\nLike early 30s gal like walking up and she's like, do you know where this place is?

It says like international exports\n\n07:14.120 --> 07:18.040\nSomething like that and she's like you know the password like no, I don't it's like well\n\n07:18.040 --> 07:24.240\nThen I'm gonna send you on a mission to old McDonald's farm. You have to click like a chicken and dance around in circles for 10 seconds\n\n07:24.800 --> 07:26.800\nIf I had said no\n\n07:26.960 --> 07:32.400\nLike I want to go have a veggie burger. She wouldn't let me in right you she's not allowed to say go fuck yourself\n\n07:33.080 --> 07:37.240\nNo, I don't know. I'm sure that's a subject of every morning meeting there depending on\n\n07:38.320 --> 07:40.800\nDepending on how business is doing, you know, I don't know. I\n\n07:41.240 --> 07:45.040\nMaybe maybe for a happy hour. I don't know if like that guy from bar rescue came in\n\n07:45.040 --> 07:48.440\nMaybe he'd yell at them. I go you're you're turning people away\n\n07:50.680 --> 07:53.480\nWhat what's out the door? What's out the door?\n\n07:57.040 --> 07:59.200\nYou see out there a street\n\n08:01.120 --> 08:04.640\nA street in a city which which city\n\n08:05.880 --> 08:09.040\nMilwaukee the biggest cheese and beer\n\n08:09.040 --> 08:17.280\nThe capital in the world you need to go turn around. I've rescued your bar. It's called cheese ballers\n\n08:20.200 --> 08:26.520\nAnyway, sorry, I got carried away doing observational comedy with a cable show that were you doing a depression of an actual thing?\n\n08:29.360 --> 08:33.240\nJohn taffers like you've never seen bar rescue. You gotta watch a couple of episodes\n\n08:33.240 --> 08:40.320\nFuck it. No, I don't I'll give you some I'll give you some starter points first bar rescue for watch the pirate bar episode\n\n08:40.920 --> 08:44.520\nI think it's in Pittsburgh. Is that where it is?

Okay\n\n08:50.280 --> 08:52.600\nBut also no matter what episode you watch\n\n08:53.160 --> 08:56.840\nWatch it with your laptop open to Facebook and just type in the name of the bar\n\n08:56.840 --> 09:04.080\nWhile you're watching the episode because the episode always ends with it being rescued and then you always you just go to\n\n09:04.080 --> 09:09.600\nYou go to the their Facebook page, and there's always a blog entry. That's like, so here's the thing these fuckers\n\n09:10.840 --> 09:14.400\nLike they left and then just blazing saddles fell apart\n\n09:15.640 --> 09:21.400\nThey installed some unlicensed beer taps in the walls that were shaped like hands because\n\n09:21.400 --> 09:29.280\nHe's just said that hands were an important thing with our demographic and now there's just hands dripping illegal booze\n\n09:29.440 --> 09:33.680\nEverywhere that the bar they made was out of one by fours\n\n09:33.680 --> 09:38.040\nThis is like you had turned my eggs in it was was was blazing saddles in there\n\n09:38.040 --> 09:42.160\nIs that an actual one? No, no, I'm saying like blazing saddles. They make a fake town and\n\n09:42.680 --> 09:44.800\nIt's like they kind of like they're a TV show\n\n09:44.800 --> 09:49.320\nI mean though TV shows have line producers line producers jobs are to like save money\n\n09:49.320 --> 09:55.320\nThey're rescuing a bar and saving money for the TV show about how the bar got rescued largely in tales\n\n09:55.760 --> 09:59.400\nMaking it look a lot like a rescued bar from certain angles\n\n10:00.360 --> 10:06.200\nAnd then leaving as it falls apart behind you. That's how you keep your job as a line producer\n\n10:07.120 --> 10:13.640\nDid I meet this person through you the person that is there a gay bar call blazing saddles? It's like it's like a it's kind of like I\n\n10:14.240 --> 10:17.960\nMean it got to be you Dan because you're you're my go-to for gay bar\n\n10:17.960 --> 10:24.400\nI information it sounds like a rehab program. I forget who told me the story, but like this guy\n\n10:25.920 --> 10:28.760\nIs there a gay bar called blazing saddles where it's kind of like like\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.560\nCoyote ugly with a dance, but it's all gay bar and stuff and\n\n10:34.080 --> 10:40.680\nApparently it's like it's like a huge. It's like huge money-making like enterprise. This guy was\n\n10:40.680 --> 10:48.240\nmarried a woman she'd do she cheated on him right off the bat, but her but her family was the mob\n\n10:48.720 --> 10:54.080\nlike she was like straight up like mafia family and this guy married into this family and\n\n10:55.040 --> 10:58.040\nShe cheated on him, but the family didn't want any disgrace\n\n10:58.040 --> 11:04.320\nSo the bomb mob boss said to this guy like he was just telling the story to this woman like at another bar in New York\n\n11:04.560 --> 11:06.560\nMaybe Dino told me the story\n\n11:06.560 --> 11:14.640\nLike my wife cheated on me and I went and then her father called me and said look\n\n11:14.960 --> 11:19.540\nIt's not gonna be public. We're not gonna talk about it. She cheated on you. We know about it\n\n11:20.160 --> 11:22.800\nAnything you want. Here's a beer. They gave him a bag of money\n\n11:23.560 --> 11:27.120\nLike and said whatever you need. Let me know and he goes\n\n11:27.120 --> 11:32.160\nI want to open a bar and he because he'd met this woman at another bar and said I want to open a gay bar called blazing saddles\n\n11:32.160 --> 11:36.280\nWhere the people get up and dance around and whatever. He's not gay. He's never opened a bar\n\n11:37.280 --> 11:44.000\nHe and so he went to the guy said you're like you can't open a bar in New York without the mobs consent\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:48.560\nBecause you like you have to like there's so much. I think I read that on the subreddit\n\n11:50.080 --> 11:56.720\nHe opened a gay bar with this person with a bag full of mob money and and the mobs like blessing and now he's like worth a\n\n11:56.720 --> 12:04.000\nFucking fortune because his wife made the movie based on the bar or that it. No, it might not be called blazing saddles\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nI think it\n\n12:06.280 --> 12:10.280\nI'll throw up the story. I was like I can't do it with the perfect joke. It's like Jeff\n\n12:10.280 --> 12:12.720\nYou just remember you don't have a cat in the basement\n\n12:16.920 --> 12:19.120\nDo I have to mention that I make this whole thing up\n\n12:19.120 --> 12:22.480\nWell, we all do is what I was what I'm I went saw blazing saddles in the theater\n\n12:22.480 --> 12:29.200\nThey showed up the arc light because a gene gene Wilder is a sad demise went and saw one of my favorite movies of all time\n\n12:29.320 --> 12:33.040\nBlazing saddles.

Wait, I heard you. I don't know about this technology\n\n13:39.040 --> 13:43.600\nCan I get a little more of that apparently apparently some guy named Reggie Watts knows about it.

Do you believe in weatherproof in your home?\n\n16:03.800 --> 16:10.280\nHow can you proof against something that's a phenomenon older than your own species?\n\n16:11.160 --> 16:13.160\nDance don't weatherproof\n\n16:14.600 --> 16:16.600\nDance isn't weatherproof\n\n16:16.600 --> 16:21.720\nYic yic a yicky the yak you fucked your mama so hard.

She became a boy scout event\n\n16:38.360 --> 16:43.400\nYo, but back to the things you believe in or not\n\n16:45.560 --> 16:47.000\nYo\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:54.040\nDateline Loch Ness I fucked your mama for her dress. It was consensual. She liked to be ravished\n\n16:57.080 --> 16:59.080\nThat's what they called it back then\n\n16:59.080 --> 17:01.080\nRavishing\n\n17:03.960 --> 17:05.960\nHashtag rape culture\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.520\nOkay, okay. All right. Hashtag rap culture\n\n17:14.520 --> 17:20.280\nBringing it back taking back the night I went on the banks of Loch Ness and studied all night\n\n17:20.600 --> 17:25.960\nUntil I saw a little head coming out took a photo of it and the scream didn't shout\n\n17:25.960 --> 17:32.840\nI prove it. I believe in the Loch Ness monster. Yeah, that shit was a log\n\n17:34.520 --> 17:36.520\nIt was a piece of floating wood\n\n17:38.360 --> 17:43.400\nCautionary tale those airplane tickets cost me $8,000\n\n17:43.400 --> 17:56.360\nIt's like it's like I never left\n\n17:57.560 --> 18:02.120\nIt's like I never left that was amazing. Thank you what we have been just\n\n18:03.160 --> 18:07.800\nLiving in twilight until you had this thing. Yeah, I have good ideas about\n\n18:08.360 --> 18:09.400\nAbout what the show needs\n\n18:09.400 --> 18:14.440\nI also we need a big screen up here so that they can see stuff that we bring up and then we could do the whole\n\n18:14.600 --> 18:15.800\nGraham Norton thing\n\n18:15.800 --> 18:20.920\nI could go look at this dog on the internet and everybody'd be like, whoa, dude. We could be ellen and I want to look at the dog\n\n18:22.040 --> 18:26.680\nI want to look at the dog. Yeah, you want to look at the dog. I want to look at the dog. What's but you know what?\n\n18:27.400 --> 18:29.400\nYou can't look at the dog\n\n18:30.360 --> 18:32.360\nwhen\n\n18:32.760 --> 18:34.760\nWhen your show is wack\n\n18:34.760 --> 18:40.840\nMaybe maybe that should be on a stand or something\n\n18:42.600 --> 18:45.160\nI mean, I mean it looks cool when you bend over like\n\n18:47.320 --> 18:49.320\nLike that\n\n18:49.320 --> 18:52.920\nI don't think there's any reason to do anything but you doing that with that vocoder\n\n18:52.920 --> 18:58.360\nI kind of did that last week. You know, you know, let's you know, I got overdue last week. I was working man. I know\n\n18:58.520 --> 19:00.520\nNo, I wasn't I wasn't yelling.

Yeah, I would like to have him back\n\n19:11.560 --> 19:15.080\nYou know, he started when he started he told the story about being Andy Dick at a Starbucks\n\n19:15.560 --> 19:20.760\nI thought was very it was kind of enthralling. Yeah, I'm out of breath from bending over\n\n19:24.440 --> 19:26.600\nTo press comedy rap buttons\n\n19:26.600 --> 19:28.600\nI\n\n19:30.200 --> 19:32.200\nThere were warning signs\n\n19:34.680 --> 19:36.680\nI gotta get on that elliptical man\n\n19:37.480 --> 19:42.040\nYou have one leave. He's not in his head. Do you have one at the crib? You got you got an elliptical out the house?\n\n19:42.040 --> 19:44.040\nYeah, you don't you don't use it\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.080\nI'm getting around to it. I need a special outfit\n\n19:48.680 --> 19:50.680\nI can't get on it in my underwear\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:54.120\nYou're at your own house. You can do whatever you like. You can you need a track suit\n\n19:54.120 --> 20:00.920\nYeah, I need to get a special a special special special tracksuit pop over pop over dan go to lululemon and treat yourself\n\n20:02.120 --> 20:05.240\nEven though they're sweatshops and you know what that means. Is that a new sponsor?\n\n20:08.920 --> 20:10.920\nAll right, I'm sure we they could be\n\n20:11.800 --> 20:18.200\nCan we talk I'd like to talk about something because I've done a lot of traveling. Um, I just want to talk I don't want okay\n\n20:18.200 --> 20:23.240\nThe airlines this airline that airline they're the worst they're the best whatever\n\n20:24.520 --> 20:26.520\nWhat all of them all the airlines?\n\n20:27.400 --> 20:29.400\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\n20:29.880 --> 20:33.800\nWhat is our relationship supposed to be with that fucking seatbelt sign?\n\n20:34.360 --> 20:37.000\nWhat is it supposed to symbolize? What does it mean?\n\n20:37.560 --> 20:41.800\nLike the more questions you ask the more data you gather the more experiments you do\n\n20:41.800 --> 20:48.360\nWhether it's getting up when that thing's lit or waiting for it to turn green or having a conversation with one of these\n\n20:49.240 --> 20:50.760\npeople\n\n20:50.760 --> 20:58.520\nLike it's like all it the truth that just comes to light is like well, okay if we had it our way you'd always be sitting\n\n20:59.640 --> 21:04.040\nOkay, but you can't always sit you're on a fucking plane for three hours\n\n21:04.440 --> 21:07.400\nSo there's a light that's just always on that's like\n\n21:07.400 --> 21:14.040\nIt's a green light with a picture of a seatbelt with the arrow going the seatbelt is unlatched\n\n21:14.040 --> 21:20.440\nBut the arrow is going like this like like this this seatbelts going to get latched on the sun\n\n21:20.680 --> 21:22.680\nOkay, so that would seem to indicate\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:27.880\nFasten your seatbelts everybody which they make you do at the top of the flight\n\n21:28.360 --> 21:35.320\nThey never turn that fucking thing off ever if you ever have to take a shit like they don't you just get up and you're like\n\n21:35.320 --> 21:40.040\nYou know it just it's always random the interaction you have they're like we'd like you to sit\n\n21:40.040 --> 21:43.800\nAnd so if you really have to take a shit real bad you go I got to take a shit real bad\n\n21:43.800 --> 21:46.680\nThey're like well, I have no I have no legal right to stop you\n\n21:46.920 --> 21:52.920\nYeah, they're they're not allowed to if you want to get up you can get up and you can go do it\n\n21:52.920 --> 21:57.640\nBut they are legally bound to say we don't advise it. We can't say you should yeah\n\n21:57.720 --> 22:03.000\nSo expressing that with a sign that's like just a thing that's lit up like that's very\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.800\nThat's just boy who cried wolf because it's just like okay\n\n22:05.800 --> 22:12.360\nYou know I'm just going to ignore everything that you do like because like what is this my sign problem on planes is that there's the\n\n22:12.440 --> 22:17.080\nthere's the sign for the lavatory and it's a man and a woman and the woman is\n\n22:17.880 --> 22:19.880\ndesigned as\n\n22:20.200 --> 22:26.200\nThere's there's a man and a woman standing in between there's a sink in between them right and on a pedestal and it was a toilet\n\n22:26.440 --> 22:29.400\nYeah, or it's a little like it's a little sink kind of thing a basin\n\n22:29.400 --> 22:35.160\nIt's a basin in the middle on a pedestal, but the thing is if you turn that basin over that's the woman's dress\n\n22:35.880 --> 22:37.880\nShe's dressed like an upside-down sink\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nI find that very diminishing\n\n22:42.200 --> 22:44.440\nClick she's a receptacle. Yeah, or or\n\n22:45.800 --> 22:49.560\nOr or or or or a or an agent of hygiene\n\n22:50.680 --> 22:52.840\nI don't know. Maybe they're cleaner than us\n\n22:52.840 --> 22:57.800\nLike next time look at that sink and then look at the woman. She's just an upside-down sink with a head on top of it\n\n22:57.880 --> 22:59.880\nthey don't know what they're doing on these things and\n\n23:00.840 --> 23:04.200\nAnd it's disturbing because obviously I probably don't have to point this out\n\n23:04.200 --> 23:09.320\nIt's like a 90 ton piece of metal that they fling into the air and rely on some weird\n\n23:09.880 --> 23:11.880\npre-Newtonian principle\n\n23:11.880 --> 23:16.200\nTo just keep it going like a paper airplane those things aren't like spaceships where it's like\n\n23:16.920 --> 23:18.760\nYou know there's thrusters and stuff on there\n\n23:18.760 --> 23:24.520\nBut really the whole thing is like there's like little fans in there that if the plane's already in the air\n\n23:24.760 --> 23:26.760\nIt tends to stay in the air\n\n23:27.560 --> 23:31.560\nThat's what a turbine is as I understand it just air is rushing through the thing\n\n23:31.880 --> 23:36.920\nAnd then the things spin because air is coming through and because the things spin the plane stays up\n\n23:37.080 --> 23:39.080\nLike there's a problem with that system\n\n23:39.640 --> 23:42.360\nIf that thing gets trans what if someone turns the air off?\n\n23:43.880 --> 23:45.640\nLike god\n\n23:45.640 --> 23:50.680\nWhich he sometimes does and probably will if we keep this up if the if if if if one of the engines\n\n23:51.960 --> 23:57.560\nTurn off the wind. He's gonna turn off though. What if he just start what if god just says, okay for the next 10 seconds\n\n23:57.560 --> 24:00.520\nI just want to write can I get everyone's attention. Well put your seatbelt on\n\n24:03.480 --> 24:09.880\nIf god if god hey, I don't know what the symbol is but if if god turns off the air ladies and gentlemen\n\n24:09.960 --> 24:11.960\nPlease put your seat belt on\n\n24:11.960 --> 24:17.880\nPut your seat belt on I asked god just turned off the air\n\n24:19.080 --> 24:22.280\nPut your seat belt on and hug the person next to you\n\n24:23.720 --> 24:26.680\nWell, that's what i'm saying. It's an ungodly thing getting on these things and\n\n24:27.720 --> 24:29.720\nand people are dying all the time and\n\n24:31.160 --> 24:32.920\nI just like we don't pay any attention to it\n\n24:32.920 --> 24:38.200\nWe're just like do you think the guy in the cockpit has a degree in this shit like he I don't know. I don't think so\n\n24:38.280 --> 24:39.960\nI think he's\n\n24:39.960 --> 24:43.160\nI think he's wearing like a little captain crunch outfit and like I\n\n24:44.600 --> 24:51.400\nFrom my experience like I don't I the average person is an idiot like just the average person because\n\n24:51.960 --> 24:57.240\nAverage IQ is 100. Yeah, do you want a 100 IQ man flying your plane or lady?\n\n24:59.880 --> 25:03.240\nNice say just as stupid as men give yourselves a hand\n\n25:04.360 --> 25:05.880\nuh\n\n25:05.880 --> 25:11.640\nThe the the he's just I mean it's like with the epaulets and the things and it's like it feels like compensation\n\n25:12.120 --> 25:14.680\nLike doesn't it man those epaulets\n\n25:17.400 --> 25:20.920\nWow those epaulets are really bringing me down man\n\n25:21.560 --> 25:25.480\nI just don't believe the way I what is the thing about the epa why the epaulets though?\n\n25:26.440 --> 25:31.400\nThere's no function there. Yeah, what what's up with those epaulets because if they dressed the way that they\n\n25:31.400 --> 25:37.480\nOnly at only the level that they needed to you'd be even more freaked out because he would look like a time-warner cable guy\n\n25:37.560 --> 25:39.160\nso they\n\n25:39.160 --> 25:40.760\nSo they have to look true\n\n25:40.760 --> 25:44.760\nWe're more comforted when they dress like captain crunch. We think okay. We want that. Yeah\n\n25:45.320 --> 25:50.520\nI want more. I want more of that like if a guy with like two sets of epaulets came on\n\n25:50.520 --> 25:53.000\nI would be holy shit. We got a really good pilot here\n\n25:53.720 --> 25:57.240\nThey kind of do like a good cup bad cup thing like if the stock is wavering\n\n25:57.240 --> 26:01.720\nThey're like we got to amp this up. Well, it's just scenario seven so that's like a guy comes on with epaulets. He goes\n\n26:02.120 --> 26:05.560\nUh, we're we're gonna we're everybody buckle up\n\n26:05.560 --> 26:10.760\nWe're gonna go over the Grand Canyon and then another guy comes on with like two epaulets and goes like get out of here\n\n26:11.160 --> 26:14.360\nGet out of here go over the Grand Canyon. That's a big hole. Yeah\n\n26:16.200 --> 26:22.440\nSorry about that ladies and gentlemen. I'd be up front like yeah, come on. Thank you for flying united. I'm captain. No\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\ncolonel\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nJohn Jommer from yeah\n\n26:27.400 --> 26:33.800\nWe're gonna fly around to the Grand Canyon. Nice like you should when there's a big hole in the earth\n\n26:34.520 --> 26:41.480\nThat's the whole point of a plane to not crash into shit. Don't fly over the Grand Canyon. Yeah, I'm gonna fly around it\n\n26:42.280 --> 26:44.440\nYou buckle up. You know what don't buckle up\n\n26:45.720 --> 26:53.000\nBecause it won't matter turn the light off do jumping jacks take two iPads plug them both in and rub them on a laptop\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:57.400\nAnd and do little Elvis kicks because if I'm doing my job, right?\n\n26:57.480 --> 27:00.920\nThat's what you can do because that's what rich people do when they get in their private jets\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:04.760\nThey don't have seatbelts up. Let's make an okay go video right now\n\n27:07.240 --> 27:09.960\nI'm gonna turn this shit upside down\n\n27:11.080 --> 27:13.080\nDenzel style\n\n27:13.560 --> 27:15.560\nDenzel\n\n27:15.720 --> 27:17.160\nDenzel\n\n27:17.160 --> 27:23.160\nDenzel. Yeah, I know it doesn't you reduce him in stature. It's Denzel\n\n27:24.200 --> 27:25.960\nDenzel\n\n27:25.960 --> 27:28.520\nYou make you make him sound like a forgotten reindeer\n\n27:32.760 --> 27:34.760\nI'd dash or I'd prance or Denzel\n\n27:35.560 --> 27:37.400\nDenzel whatever\n\n27:37.400 --> 27:39.560\nYou can you're there for redundancy in case\n\n27:40.280 --> 27:44.120\nJasher and prancer like have a bad back Denzel. Yeah Denzel comes off the bench\n\n27:44.120 --> 27:47.320\nYeah, if if if Blitzen has a sword\n\n27:49.720 --> 27:51.720\nOr sully hey, so\n\n27:53.160 --> 28:01.160\nSo cody cody got uh, which she got an uber from my place after we got home from the airport and her uber driver's name was strategy\n\n28:01.160 --> 28:12.040\nWas it really yeah, I know it was strategy. Well, I mean was it right? It was on the screen. Yeah, I had a uber guy named Beethoven\n\n28:16.200 --> 28:19.640\nThese are guys who obviously in their former name they did something really terrible\n\n28:20.760 --> 28:25.080\nAs an uber driver or they switched uber accounts. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah\n\n28:25.080 --> 28:31.160\nYeah, yeah strategy. That's good. Yeah, that's their other reddit account\n\n28:32.520 --> 28:38.120\nBecause you never know like like what can people see when I do you go on reddit? Do you do you if you stop doing that?\n\n28:38.440 --> 28:40.440\nDo you look at your reddit for porn?\n\n28:40.920 --> 28:42.600\nor for\n\n28:42.600 --> 28:44.600\nReddit has porn\n\n28:44.600 --> 28:55.480\nYeah, it has uh, it has highly sordid curated hierarchically arranged porn with\n\n28:57.480 --> 29:00.200\nYou can comment on it and get up voted and down voted it's\n\n29:00.840 --> 29:05.800\nOf everything you could ever gain from reddit is as applicable as to porn as everything else\n\n29:06.600 --> 29:11.000\nUh, Duncan. No, I don't really I don't really frequent reddit because I'm a narcissist and I haven't like I\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:15.560\nI I the the my favorite thing about reddit was like, you know, I'd go to walks\n\n29:16.040 --> 29:20.120\nCommunity and the rick and morty and the Dan Harmon and stuff and I just it's too\n\n29:20.840 --> 29:22.840\nI'm too loathsome a person to\n\n29:23.080 --> 29:26.440\nto to and too narcissistic to to continue to\n\n29:27.160 --> 29:32.680\nDisappoint people as a human being on this level and then also read about myself incessantly\n\n29:36.600 --> 29:38.600\nUncle Dennis is here\n\n29:38.600 --> 29:43.800\nI have a real Uncle Dennis. I met him. I'm bad at making up names. So\n\n29:45.160 --> 29:51.000\nFor Uncle Dennis if he's I brought Uncle Dennis to your impromptu show. Yeah, it's fun. And he yeah, he had a blast\n\n29:52.360 --> 29:53.720\nBecause he's a fan\n\n29:53.720 --> 30:00.200\nAnd it was a very funny show. Thank you. You and Ryan Stiles did the uh, did uh, Neil Diamond and Gordon Lightfoot singing a duet\n\n30:00.200 --> 30:04.520\nAnd it was really funny. Remember when we went to see Neil Diamond in Las Vegas?\n\n30:04.520 --> 30:06.520\nYeah\n\n30:07.560 --> 30:09.560\nWell, we went we went to see\n\n30:10.200 --> 30:13.800\nRemember this do you remember we had not well. I remember I didn't go but I\n\n30:14.680 --> 30:16.920\nI was on mushrooms and you came back from\n\n30:17.640 --> 30:20.760\nConcert and it was like three hours on a hotel room floor\n\n30:21.640 --> 30:26.280\nListening to Rob describe the Neil Diamond concert. That was my Neil Diamond concert\n\n30:27.160 --> 30:32.120\nI got that was the best. I got to go backstage with sam slammin who got us the tickets and we we met\n\n30:32.120 --> 30:36.840\nUh, we met Neil Diamond for the show and I was really excited about that and uh\n\n30:37.560 --> 30:41.800\nAs I've seen like at that point I said like I think I've seen him eight times in concert\n\n30:41.880 --> 30:46.200\nAt that I think that was my sixth time and so I meet Neil Diamond right before the show and I go\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:51.560\nMr. Diamond's pleasure to meet you. This is my this will be my sixth time seeing you and he takes my hand and he goes\n\n30:52.680 --> 30:54.680\nA fan\n\n30:58.600 --> 31:01.080\nAnd then the groovy as part of it was that his uh\n\n31:01.080 --> 31:06.840\nUh, uh his assistants like this big bouncer guy like he's kind of like handler and like bodyguard guy\n\n31:07.640 --> 31:10.040\nHad a wind up like disposable camera\n\n31:10.520 --> 31:13.560\nAnd he goes get together and he took like snap snap snap\n\n31:14.120 --> 31:17.960\nWine wine wine snap and and and then gave me the camera and he goes keep it\n\n31:19.560 --> 31:22.600\nNeil Diamond has become a human wedding\n\n31:25.640 --> 31:27.480\nI didn't give you a mason jar and he's like look\n\n31:27.480 --> 31:30.920\nWe're free refills and then and then you can you can use it at home. So I\n\n31:31.640 --> 31:33.000\nWhen I would go see Neil Diamond in concert\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:37.960\nI would always try to predict what the first song he would sing would be and and and I one time I was right about it\n\n31:37.960 --> 31:45.320\nBut usually you're not right because you've got a million songs. Um, so we we're leaving him and uh, it was me drew carry\n\n31:46.280 --> 31:52.040\nSam and I think nick vanne was back there too because our friend like produced like Neil Diamond a long time ago or something\n\n31:52.920 --> 31:56.360\nAnd uh, we're leaving and I said, well, hey have a great show. Uh, give him hell out there\n\n31:56.360 --> 31:58.360\nAnd he goes Neil Diamond goes like what?\n\n32:01.320 --> 32:06.440\nLike I was leaving and the director of saving silverman was there like like they just made that movie\n\n32:06.680 --> 32:10.440\nSo he was talking to him and I go give him hell and he goes what I go\n\n32:11.800 --> 32:14.760\nGive him hell man. Like I have a good show. He was like\n\n32:15.960 --> 32:17.960\nWe will\n\n32:19.240 --> 32:24.040\nAnd he's like give me a weird look. I'm like, okay. All right, man. I know I mean like knock him dead like give him\n\n32:24.040 --> 32:30.200\nHell is like what? Yeah, how dare you so we leave and sam was like, what the fuck was that about?\n\n32:30.280 --> 32:31.960\nI'm like, I don't know\n\n32:31.960 --> 32:33.480\nThe first song\n\n32:33.480 --> 32:35.480\nIt was a new song. He had called give him hell\n\n32:37.480 --> 32:39.480\nTotally\n\n32:42.680 --> 32:48.600\nYou're not supposed to fucking know that jack. How did that leak? Yeah, how did that leak at a time of no leaks?\n\n32:48.600 --> 32:55.240\nThe IT guy told me it was airtight tonight\n\n32:57.720 --> 32:59.720\nMan stage with you and I'm doing Neil Diamond\n\n33:00.840 --> 33:04.520\nUh, can you honor tune Neil Diamond? How would that work? Yes? Yes?\n\n33:07.080 --> 33:09.080\nDo you have a song that might work for that? Let's see\n\n33:13.720 --> 33:15.720\nFar\n\n33:15.720 --> 33:18.120\nWe've been traveling far\n\n33:21.640 --> 33:29.160\nWithout a home. Oh wait, our home is the village of mushrooms because I sound like a smurf\n\n33:31.320 --> 33:33.320\nNo, I think the answer is you can't do Neil Diamond\n\n33:35.320 --> 33:37.320\nNot a tune\n\n33:37.960 --> 33:41.560\nMy friend Johnny Polanski is a guy. I played some of his music on the show before\n\n33:41.560 --> 33:47.400\nHe was he's a session guitar player and he did a I think 12 songs was like one of Neil Diamond's last records\n\n33:48.120 --> 33:49.880\nIs that Rick Rubin maybe?\n\n33:49.880 --> 33:56.200\nAnd so he worked with Neil for a few weeks and I'm a as I say like I'm a giant Neil Diamond fan\n\n33:56.200 --> 34:00.280\nSo I made him tell me a thousand stories Neil would come in every morning without his toupee\n\n34:00.920 --> 34:05.720\nAnd he wore a denim jumpsuit like a onesie\n\n34:05.720 --> 34:11.480\nI'd like just denim and then he and like 10 a.m. He'd have a cognac like jean jammers\n\n34:13.800 --> 34:16.760\nI'm sorry jean jammers like jean jammers\n\n34:18.760 --> 34:20.760\nWait a second\n\n34:21.720 --> 34:24.600\nJust keep doing that. That makes me so happy\n\n34:25.720 --> 34:31.480\nBut uh, so so he would just come in just like brandy and a cigar and he would talk he never talked to my friend Johnny and uh\n\n34:31.480 --> 34:36.760\nWhen Johnny was finally done. He was wrapped on it and he was packing up his guitar leaving for the final day\n\n34:37.640 --> 34:41.160\nNeil comes out of the booth and he's like, hey, you're Johnny, right? Because yeah, look, I'm sorry\n\n34:41.640 --> 34:43.640\nI didn't really get to talk to you that much\n\n34:43.960 --> 34:48.040\nUh, but it was really pleasure working with you and if I ever do another record, I want you to be on it\n\n34:48.520 --> 34:51.800\nBecause you're I like you I like I like what you do and Johnny's like, thanks, man\n\n34:51.960 --> 34:54.840\nI absolutely and he was Johnny. Let me tell you something\n\n34:54.840 --> 35:01.560\nYou're a real motherfucker, and I mean that and I mean that in the best possible way\n\n35:03.960 --> 35:09.160\nYou could you could do worse. Yeah, I fucking knew worse than oh my god. I look I\n\n35:10.680 --> 35:14.840\nUm despite all outward appearances, I'm straight, but I would I would make out with Neil diamonds\n\n35:15.080 --> 35:19.560\nI would fucking make out with Neil diamond. I would have made out with bowie bowie and Neil. I would have fucking\n\n35:19.560 --> 35:21.560\nI would totally make out with\n\n35:21.720 --> 35:23.720\nUh, but that's it\n\n35:23.720 --> 35:24.680\nSpencer\n\n35:24.680 --> 35:29.880\nOh, spencer is uh, taking a spencer is spencer's feels like shit and we said we text him\n\n35:30.280 --> 35:34.600\nHe said i'm gonna bow out of the show tonight and we he said I feel like shit\n\n35:34.600 --> 35:39.240\nWe said someone said like diarrhea and and and he said it takes more than that to keep me down\n\n35:40.280 --> 35:42.280\nOr something like that. I paraphrase, but\n\n35:42.840 --> 35:45.480\nSo whatever it is, it could be emotional diarrhea\n\n35:46.120 --> 35:52.040\nYou know the price of spencer psychologically, you know like like being spencer. I mean, can you imagine what goes on up there?\n\n35:52.040 --> 35:55.080\nI said, I had a pretty good colonic this morning\n\n35:56.840 --> 36:00.920\nYou know, you know, wait, wait, wait, put a pin in that for one second. I did\n\n36:01.880 --> 36:04.120\nYou did put a pin in it. Is that why you needed that colonic?\n\n36:04.840 --> 36:09.080\nAre you one of those guys the needles on the on the ballpoint those guys? I'm your friend\n\n36:13.880 --> 36:17.720\nI want to know why you put a pin and rob is pretty well because because I was gonna\n\n36:18.040 --> 36:21.880\nI do think it's kind of funny the idea that the oj simpson thing is dominating the emmy's because when you looked at the\n\n36:21.880 --> 36:24.200\nCredits of that of that very enjoyable show\n\n36:24.760 --> 36:29.960\nIt was like literally everybody like like if that show sweeps the emmy's it's almost sort of like\n\n36:30.760 --> 36:37.880\nLike everybody worked on that like they weren't there like brilsteins and grays and the and also like people that don't even like they were\n\n36:37.880 --> 36:40.360\nLike it was the the the god the larry\n\n36:41.480 --> 36:44.120\nScott alexander's in the like the it was like\n\n36:44.920 --> 36:50.680\nEvery single human being that had ever made anything for television or movies had had some kind of like credit on that show\n\n36:50.680 --> 36:54.440\nSo now they're like sweeping the emmy's and it's like are they happy or sad about that?\n\n36:54.760 --> 36:58.040\nIs this the a travolta one? Yeah, okay. Yeah, I just wanted you know\n\n36:58.200 --> 37:02.440\nThey go to the parties and I was like 500 people and they all have emmy's and it's like you guys already had them\n\n37:02.760 --> 37:08.920\nOr oscars and like like and you didn't beat any of each other. So there's no satisfaction there. They must be bummed out\n\n37:08.920 --> 37:13.560\nThat's my thing. I bet they're like going to each other in like smaller groups and going like man\n\n37:14.280 --> 37:18.680\nThis emmy's worth nothing. I know right because the guy we hated is also working on it\n\n37:18.680 --> 37:20.680\nYeah, all right\n\n37:21.640 --> 37:24.200\nI guess I guess I guess I am different than the audience\n\n37:25.400 --> 37:27.560\nI guess I do think about different shit. I'm just\n\n37:28.440 --> 37:33.080\nSpeaking maybe I'm an artist speaking of different shit Rob. Let's talk about your calling. Let's talk about this high colonic\n\n37:33.240 --> 37:38.920\nWe can edit out my shitty observations about the emmy's. No, it was good. Have you ever tried these colonics? They're great\n\n37:39.160 --> 37:43.880\nNot a I've only only never a high one. What's a high colonic? I've never I've never I don't know what a\n\n37:43.960 --> 37:47.880\nIt seems like if it's high you're doing it wrong. I don't know what you're talking about\n\n37:47.880 --> 37:53.960\nI just have a regular high colonic is the yeah, you see you go to somebody they put a put a hose up your butt. What happens?\n\n37:55.080 --> 37:59.240\nYes, yeah, yeah, I went to this I went to the lady and she and she\n\n38:00.200 --> 38:03.720\nI've been going for a while and I was a little skeptical\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:10.040\nBut I I'm I'm all right with it. It's not too bad. It's good. It's good\n\n38:10.040 --> 38:18.600\nShe she she did say the first time I did it. It's like I don't use an adult one. I use a child applicator\n\n38:18.680 --> 38:20.680\nAnd I was like does that mean it's like\n\n38:21.400 --> 38:23.560\nBesides a little boys dick\n\n38:25.160 --> 38:29.560\nA look wait wait wait wait. Oh my okay. Okay. All right. Yeah. I\n\n38:30.440 --> 38:33.400\nRoller coaster ride can I rewind a little bit on that one?\n\n38:34.280 --> 38:39.720\nI thought I thought you were I thought you were being flattered because she was implying that your butt hole was as tight\n\n38:39.720 --> 38:41.400\nas a little boys\n\n38:41.400 --> 38:43.400\nBut then you wouldn't even\n\n38:43.400 --> 38:48.440\nI don't know what's going on behind my back. All she said is like use most most colonic\n\n38:49.080 --> 38:52.120\nDoctors use well, she's not a doctor, but most colonic\n\n38:52.680 --> 38:55.880\nShe's just a person I met at a bar somewhere\n\n38:57.240 --> 39:00.040\nShe said she does tarot readings and then right right right\n\n39:00.600 --> 39:04.840\nAnd then weirdly, but I use a child whether it's the fool or the death guard. She's like, you know what that means\n\n39:04.920 --> 39:06.840\nShe's saying you got a lot of extra shit\n\n39:06.840 --> 39:11.080\nShe said I'm I'm going to give you the child one because that's better than the adult one\n\n39:11.080 --> 39:14.360\nBut your thing is that you think it was supposed to be more like a little because it's\n\n39:14.920 --> 39:18.520\nMore like a little boys penis. Well, not a little girls\n\n39:22.120 --> 39:27.160\nYou think the colonic instrument is is built on being a dick girth. Yeah\n\n39:28.440 --> 39:30.440\nWell, I mean\n\n39:30.680 --> 39:36.280\nMaybe I I'm just assuming I just I don't know how I've never had a colonic\n\n39:36.280 --> 39:38.280\nSo like did they they're great\n\n39:40.120 --> 39:42.680\nBut you sound attentive you said it was only pretty good\n\n39:43.640 --> 39:47.800\nThey're pretty I and it wasn't too bad. It was all right. I like I mean like I\n\n39:48.840 --> 39:55.240\nI mean I feel a lot healthier. Do they insert the instrument up your butt? Yes, I got and so you got the baby one\n\n39:55.560 --> 39:57.800\nI got the baby one because of your delicious\n\n39:58.520 --> 40:01.400\nWell, no, she didn't she's your words not mine\n\n40:01.400 --> 40:08.600\nShe well, she's something I really love she said other my colleagues use a larger gauge\n\n40:09.240 --> 40:10.840\nof\n\n40:10.840 --> 40:12.840\nanimator\n\n40:13.960 --> 40:19.720\nThe the animator.

I bought a new house. There were jets\n\n42:29.880 --> 42:32.680\nSo your ass was up against the side of the tub\n\n42:33.800 --> 42:35.560\nYeah, because well\n\n42:35.560 --> 42:37.560\nYeah, but well dot dot dot\n\n42:38.280 --> 42:44.840\nExplain that what is it?

No, it wasn't\n\n42:48.760 --> 42:53.400\nBut put his ass up against the jet and then he was surprised that it was weird\n\n42:53.960 --> 43:01.320\nNo, I I was surprised when water was strange off my asshole and filled me up like a water balloon\n\n43:01.880 --> 43:06.840\nBecause because before that all it did was tickle the rim and make me happier\n\n43:09.560 --> 43:13.640\nBut then one day I like I just I flew too close to the sun as Jeff said and I\n\n43:13.640 --> 43:18.760\nAnd I was like I was scissoring and like like I you know you\n\n43:19.400 --> 43:21.000\nYou you get used to shit\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:25.240\nThis is why I'm afraid to fly because the guys in the cockpit like it's like how soon\n\n43:25.800 --> 43:30.760\nYou start to take technology for granted like like like you know these guys are like, how do you know the guy in the\n\n43:30.760 --> 43:35.560\nYou don't know what they're doing in the cockpit the doors closed.

Yeah, you were the you were and that's why you were shining\n\n43:58.040 --> 44:00.040\nLike the Chrysler building. Yes\n\n44:00.120 --> 44:05.320\nThis is a lot of people die hard fans are like why am I being punished for being a fan? I know all this, you know\n\n44:05.320 --> 44:10.920\nIt's like like like like like we need a little Stanley in the corner to just like have it be on the video feed\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nwith a him coming up and going like\n\n44:13.080 --> 44:15.080\nWeb heads will remember that\n\n44:15.320 --> 44:22.760\nYeah, Dan got a tub and was fucking jerking off like a crazy person like and had discovered like jets on his butthole\n\n44:23.160 --> 44:28.840\nAnd then one day I was like I went too far and the setting was too high and it just like it's that difference\n\n44:28.840 --> 44:34.440\nYou know when you take a water balloon and like you can if you hold it underneath the faucet just turn on the faucet\n\n44:34.440 --> 44:38.360\nLike no water's gonna go in that water balloon and then there's that day with that moment\n\n44:38.360 --> 44:42.680\nLike I just like all of a sudden and it's like a binary thing. It's either happening or not\n\n44:43.080 --> 44:46.520\nAnd like it was just like all of a sudden. I was like, oh, yeah\n\n44:48.360 --> 44:50.120\nlike\n\n44:50.120 --> 44:51.960\nit was like\n\n44:51.960 --> 44:56.040\nThere's there's probably people in the audience who know who are more who are more\n\n44:57.560 --> 45:02.600\nYou know, they they take their butt for more of a ride, you know, like like they're more they're more experts in this\n\n45:02.600 --> 45:08.600\nKind of off-roading thing. They're like, yeah, I know exactly what happened. Your v8 got in the front wheel drive and\n\n45:09.320 --> 45:11.320\nLike that happened to me in Kentucky\n\n45:12.120 --> 45:13.720\non a four-wheeler and\n\n45:13.720 --> 45:19.640\nBut I was like this was the I was I was just I was a newcomer to the whole involving the button anything other than\n\n45:19.880 --> 45:22.600\nThan the the just the for a sharpie. Yeah\n\n45:24.280 --> 45:27.880\nAnd so all of a sudden I had the sensation that I've never had before which is which was the\n\n45:28.760 --> 45:31.320\nIn reverse the sensation of pooping\n\n45:31.320 --> 45:37.320\nIt was like all of a sudden there was just like all so so much like just filling me up\n\n45:38.120 --> 45:40.120\nIn a place where I was like\n\n45:40.440 --> 45:45.480\nAnd I like got up out of the tub and like went over to the toilet instinctively and sat down on it\n\n45:45.480 --> 45:52.600\nAnd I was like and then it was just like flood came out and I was like, oh, I just gave myself an accidental enema\n\n45:53.480 --> 45:57.160\nAnd how did you feel it's pretty good pretty good?\n\n45:57.160 --> 46:03.640\nIt was good.

Yeah. Yeah, he did however somebody pointed out. He did leave a very uh very concise\n\n47:35.080 --> 47:39.400\nUh, I think chevy, you know, like he would he's the last person to\n\n47:40.040 --> 47:47.160\nWhat if you if you listed his crimes or or bad qualities that would definitely not on that list would be\n\n47:47.800 --> 47:49.000\nlike\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:55.560\nUh shame like he's not like he would he loves as long as it's funny like he'll share stuff and kind of guy\n\n47:55.560 --> 48:01.240\nI don't think it was his idea to like downplay it or or welly and double speak the idea of going into rehab because he left a\n\n48:01.240 --> 48:05.720\nuh, it was on his uh, what's that dumb thing that's like to twitter for\n\n48:06.680 --> 48:13.720\nCelebrities who say like like it's like, oh you're famous. Why should you do what normal people do like like that?\n\n48:14.280 --> 48:16.440\nThat that that selfie you took might be worth money one day\n\n48:17.080 --> 48:22.120\nDon't give that away. Isn't that what that thing is? I don't know. Did I just get sardonic about something for no reason?\n\n48:23.320 --> 48:27.480\nAll I know is it was it was like a little paragraph and he said uh, I'm going in because\n\n48:27.480 --> 48:31.240\nMy love of vodka needs to be something I am paraphrasing\n\n48:31.320 --> 48:33.960\nBut it was it was it was it was all very clear\n\n48:34.280 --> 48:39.880\nHe's like I'm going in because my my family's I don't want them to have to worry about me and like like all that stuff\n\n48:39.880 --> 48:43.080\nI don't know how that tune-up stuff. That's probably some spokesman who\n\n48:44.280 --> 48:49.160\nTrying to do their job the right way trying to protect and all this stuff and mitigate like and then it gets\n\n48:49.400 --> 48:53.400\nThen that becomes the funny thing. It's like get this he's going in for a tune-up\n\n48:54.360 --> 48:56.360\nWhy are you sitting over there? Why did you go?\n\n48:56.360 --> 49:02.200\nAre you like the new Spencer?

That's\n\n49:41.800 --> 49:45.720\nFinally now I can I suck at that trough?\n\n49:45.720 --> 49:55.560\nI don't like that the flight attendant welcomes you to the city that you're arriving in with them\n\n49:56.680 --> 49:58.680\nIt just seems\n\n49:58.920 --> 50:01.640\nIt's just a little bit of a needless mindfuckie like\n\n50:02.520 --> 50:05.960\nBullying thing. Yeah, I'll call it what it is bullying\n\n50:07.400 --> 50:12.840\nWhy is it why is it welcome to Chicago and it's like you just got here too motherfucker?\n\n50:12.840 --> 50:20.440\nWhy is that bullying though, why is that bullying because the unspoken part of that is you'd newbie\n\n50:21.640 --> 50:28.680\nYou piece of shit that would that if the plane crashed would fall for the float cushion thing while I sprung out in a\n\n50:29.640 --> 50:31.640\ninspector gadget parachute\n\n50:32.520 --> 50:34.520\nYou might be reading into that a little\n\n50:34.520 --> 50:40.920\nYou might might be reading into that. I think they're just trying to be nice to you\n\n50:43.720 --> 50:47.320\nWelcome to welcome to Chicago. They say yeah, yeah, they\n\n50:48.120 --> 50:52.280\nI also don't like I guess I guess there's no direct flights from Los Angeles to Milwaukee\n\n50:52.280 --> 50:55.880\nBut I get and I I was like it's a real drag like you can't for real. Yeah\n\n50:56.120 --> 50:59.080\nNo, wow, but I guess that's I was thinking I was thinking about it\n\n50:59.080 --> 51:02.840\nI was like well, okay, so we're flying from LA to phoenix and then from phoenix to Milwaukee and that's\n\n51:02.840 --> 51:08.680\nThat might be better. I guess because like well if you're flying from Los Angeles to Milwaukee\n\n51:09.640 --> 51:11.080\nlike\n\n51:11.080 --> 51:14.520\nStatistically speaking like the reason for that is that something's gone wrong\n\n51:17.080 --> 51:23.000\nSouthwest I think I think southwest goes direct is the only direct flight to Milwaukee, but they suck\n\n51:23.800 --> 51:25.960\nAre the other ones that do the comedy the con?\n\n51:26.120 --> 51:31.800\nYes, they they do like the the the fucking Muppet voices and donald duck shit\n\n51:31.800 --> 51:37.960\nIt's just a piece of shit. It's like a bus with wings. They just like oh hey get on board\n\n51:38.280 --> 51:40.840\nI hope you get a seat and somebody's sitting on the floor\n\n51:41.800 --> 51:45.320\nThere's two people with chickens next to you. It's the worst\n\n51:45.800 --> 51:49.240\nI got on a plane a few days ago. Where was I coming back from I forget?\n\n51:50.120 --> 51:52.120\nand I was\n\n51:52.120 --> 51:54.600\nI walked up to the gate right at boarding time\n\n51:54.600 --> 51:58.120\nI didn't know if I was late or earlier or whatever and I said that are you boarding?\n\n51:58.120 --> 52:02.840\nUh, yeah priority. Are you priority? I'm like, yeah, I'm first class. I got on\n\n52:03.080 --> 52:08.120\nI was the first person on the plane. I didn't know that was not intentional. I thought maybe I was a couple minutes late\n\n52:08.920 --> 52:10.920\nI found a $20 bill\n\n52:11.400 --> 52:13.640\nOn the jet bridge like a little walkway\n\n52:14.120 --> 52:17.240\nAnd I just went at doing can if I can put that in the old pocket\n\n52:17.320 --> 52:18.600\nOkay, all right\n\n52:18.600 --> 52:22.840\nAnd I get on the plane and then there's two flight attendants there and they're like, oh, are we boarding already?\n\n52:22.840 --> 52:28.360\nI didn't realize we were boarding. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, we're right up right this way. Like where'd you see like I'm in 2a\n\n52:28.760 --> 52:33.080\nAnd I sat down and like I was the very first person on so it wasn't like somebody was on that plane\n\n52:33.080 --> 52:35.800\nI dropped that money. Maybe it was one of the flight attendants. I don't know\n\n52:36.520 --> 52:39.960\nUm, so I'm sitting there and I got the $20 in my pocket\n\n52:40.680 --> 52:43.240\nAnd we get up we get in the air\n\n52:43.800 --> 52:48.760\nAnd the the flight attendant comes down through all the people in first class. Hey, did somebody drop $20?\n\n52:48.760 --> 52:50.760\nI\n\n52:51.080 --> 52:53.240\nMeaning like we're like, I was like, no\n\n52:55.080 --> 52:59.560\nI I did not drop $20. I did the opposite of dropping well, I did\n\n53:01.320 --> 53:03.240\nBut I was like\n\n53:03.240 --> 53:05.240\nThat meant it was hers, right?\n\n53:05.240 --> 53:09.640\nBut she was trying to lay a little trap there like no, I found $20 and she would go mine\n\n53:10.520 --> 53:12.040\nI don't know. I don't know\n\n53:12.040 --> 53:13.480\nBut like\n\n53:13.480 --> 53:20.280\nDid somebody else drop $20 too? It was very confusing. She's like, I lost $20. Well, I know if I ask if anyone found it\n\n53:20.280 --> 53:22.760\nThe answer will be no, but maybe if I say\n\n53:23.400 --> 53:25.400\nHas anyone lost 20\n\n53:25.400 --> 53:29.960\nSomebody would go. Oh, I feel so guilty. It's like I wouldn't you're supposed to yell fire instead\n\n53:29.960 --> 53:31.960\nBut then I went I went and bought my girlfriend\n\n53:32.520 --> 53:34.280\ncigarettes with it\n\n53:34.280 --> 53:36.280\n$20 cigarettes\n\n53:36.760 --> 53:38.760\nI got her a couple how long are they?\n\n53:38.760 --> 53:43.560\nThey're the extra longs\n\n53:44.600 --> 53:49.000\nBut then she we walked out and she goes, you know that like that that was counterfeit\n\n53:49.880 --> 53:53.480\nI'm like, what she's like. It was it was printed all wrong. The borders were all fucked up\n\n53:54.200 --> 53:57.320\nI think I think I've picked up and stole and\n\n53:59.160 --> 54:01.160\nI think like like like like some like\n\n54:02.120 --> 54:08.120\nSome major awesome like criminal was like taking that plane and was dropping counterfeit 20s\n\n54:08.120 --> 54:11.960\nLike they like a bullet hole in his duffel bag or hers\n\n54:14.840 --> 54:18.120\nLike like like was was like hemorrhaging counterfeit 20s or something\n\n54:18.120 --> 54:18.680\nYeah, yeah\n\n54:18.680 --> 54:24.280\nAnd that and that so that it was that that you found one and then someone else found another one\n\n54:24.280 --> 54:28.120\nIt was like a summer drop in 20s all over the place and there's like a guy bleeding out and then\n\n54:28.680 --> 54:30.920\nIn coach the guy just another martini\n\n54:32.680 --> 54:35.000\nNo, no, haven't seen any errands 20s\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nBecause he got shot\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:44.120\nYeah, I don't know. I'm not gonna make up the whole to live in die in LA kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah to live in die in LA\n\n54:44.280 --> 54:47.640\nYeah, fine. I'm derivative. All right, but wow\n\n54:49.480 --> 54:54.040\nSo defensive. Yeah, you're not just came back from Milwaukee. I have like a lot of like\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:58.680\nI got along with my mom for two days. So now I'm back here and I'm like, what'd you mean by that?\n\n54:58.680 --> 55:00.680\nWhat'd you mean by that? What'd you mean by that?\n\n55:00.680 --> 55:07.000\nI had to go somewhere it is an amazing city because like I met the nicest people and like just like\n\n55:07.880 --> 55:09.400\nLike people that were there to see my show\n\n55:09.400 --> 55:11.960\nBut also our fans of Harmontown or rick and morty, whatever\n\n55:12.280 --> 55:16.920\nThere is this awesome openness and sweetness to the Midwest and to Milwaukee in particular\n\n55:17.320 --> 55:19.320\nBut also a lot of like weird like\n\n55:20.360 --> 55:25.240\nNot not shame or self. It was just so self-effacing, right? Yes. Yeah, you're yes\n\n55:25.240 --> 55:29.240\nThey they they they they diminish themselves in your eyes\n\n55:32.280 --> 55:35.240\nYes, because the people who draw focus get kicked out\n\n55:37.480 --> 55:43.400\nOf Milwaukee, uh, like me and Trump. No, it's it. Yeah, it's like it's it's it's very similar\n\n55:43.400 --> 55:50.040\nI mean, it's geographically and I think genetically and culturally and psychologically and spiritually like a very close cousin to Canada\n\n55:50.040 --> 55:53.800\nI mean, it's like you're you're right up there. You're you're a hop skip and a jump\n\n55:53.800 --> 55:59.000\nYou're in a very cool. You're in a climate that's like inhospitable like you're in God's crosshairs\n\n55:59.160 --> 56:03.160\nIf you if you if you get cocky then the question becomes why are you so cocky?\n\n56:03.160 --> 56:07.720\nWhy don't you go somewhere warm? So the answer has to be don't get cocky don't get cocky\n\n56:07.800 --> 56:09.800\nthat has to be the mantra of\n\n56:09.800 --> 56:11.800\nOf a more seasonal climate\n\n56:12.360 --> 56:17.000\nAnd and Milwaukee's like that. So so on the surface of it. There's this wonderful\n\n56:17.720 --> 56:22.040\nHumility and and camaraderie fraternity or sorority\n\n56:22.040 --> 56:29.720\nYou are fucking nailing it today. I'm fucking like I I'm I'm inclusiving the fuck out of tonight\n\n56:31.400 --> 56:35.960\nLike tomorrow's uh headlines are gonna be like Dean Harmon included everybody\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:45.720\nAfter the fact. Yeah. Well, is it yeah asterisks were flying and and all benefited women were receiving their their alms\n\n56:46.520 --> 56:48.520\num\n\n56:48.520 --> 56:53.880\nOn the tails of sentences with a with a appendage. Uh uh, uh, um\n\n56:55.480 --> 57:03.880\nCaps were doffed to the fairer sex at a speed uh comparable only to the bionic uh, uh, advocate\n\n57:07.160 --> 57:09.640\nOf a lesser known franchise from the seventies\n\n57:09.640 --> 57:21.640\nGentlemen, we can rebuild him with an understanding that women are human.\n\n57:21.640 --> 57:23.560\nTake that corrupt lumberjack.\n\n57:23.560 --> 57:25.920\nYou could have been a woman.\n\n57:25.920 --> 57:26.920\nOr lumberjill.\n\n57:26.920 --> 57:27.920\nAll right.\n\n57:27.920 --> 57:28.920\nHe plussed it.\n\n57:28.920 -->

like the surface of that Milwaukee thing.\n\n57:44.920 --> 57:45.920\nIt's really beautiful.\n\n57:45.920 --> 57:46.920\nI understand.\n\n57:46.920 --> 57:48.120\nIt's a great city.\n\n57:48.120 --> 57:49.200\nIt's by a great lake.\n\n57:49.200 --> 57:50.920\nIt's a great place by a great lake.\n\n57:50.920 --> 57:52.920\nThat's so dumb.\n\n57:52.920 --> 57:56.400\nIt's a great place by a great lake?\n\n57:56.400 --> 57:57.400\nYeah.\n\n57:57.400 --> 57:58.400\nOkay.\n\n57:58.400 --> 57:59.400\nI mean, what do you want?\n\n57:59.400 --> 58:00.400\nAll right.\n\n58:00.400 --> 58:02.200\nI wanted a better motto.\n\n58:02.200 --> 58:07.320\nWe can't just say, we make the beer.\n\n58:07.320 --> 58:08.520\nBecause we largely don't anymore.\n\n58:08.520 --> 58:10.080\nThey don't make the beer.\n\n58:10.080 --> 58:11.080\nYeah.\n\n58:11.080 --> 58:20.440\nAnyways, underneath it, because it comes from, I think, self-loathing, so there's like benefits\n\n58:20.440 --> 58:26.800\nto, there's a cushion on top of you when you arrange yourself around a religion of humility.\n\n58:26.800 --> 58:28.840\nLike, you're like, who am I to say?\n\n58:28.840 --> 58:29.840\nWho am I?\n\n58:29.840 --> 58:31.280\nThat's like a very Midwestern thing.\n\n58:31.280 --> 58:32.280\nLike, what do I know?\n\n58:32.280 --> 58:33.280\nAnd all this stuff.\n\n58:33.280 --> 58:36.800\nBut that doesn't automatically make you a good person.\n\n58:36.800 --> 58:41.320\nAnd it doesn't automatically mean a conversation with you, like everyone walks away not having\n\n58:41.320 --> 58:42.640\ntheir soul stolen.\n\n58:42.640 --> 58:47.280\nLike, because when that's your religion, it's like also like, well, then it's, you have\n\n58:47.280 --> 58:48.880\nto kind of question everything.\n\n58:48.880 --> 58:50.200\nYou have to question all ambition.\n\n58:50.200 --> 58:55.960\nYou have to question, and there's no such thing as a typical anything, so don't get offended\n\n58:55.960 --> 58:58.320\nif you're listening in Milwaukee and going, this isn't me.\n\n58:58.320 --> 58:59.520\nYou don't understand anything.\n\n58:59.520 --> 59:04.200\nI'm just talking about a artificial construct, a median.\n\n59:04.200 --> 59:08.560\nBut that's my, that's my kind of feeling about that compass is like, oh yeah, on one hand,\n\n59:08.560 --> 59:13.080\nlike I'm so grateful I grew up somewhere where you're, it's a crime to think that you're\n\n59:13.080 --> 59:14.080\nall that.\n\n59:14.080 --> 59:18.800\nLike it's just a straight up fucking social crime that especially back then was like way\n\n59:18.800 --> 59:25.240\nhigher than when we were still just, when the definition of feminism was still believing\n\n59:25.240 --> 59:26.880\nwomen can do better.\n\n59:26.880 --> 59:32.600\nThe, the, the, the, it was like, we first and foremost were like, don't get cocky.\n\n59:32.600 --> 59:38.200\nLike, your friend, your old friend and now my new ish friend, Dave Friedel, his toes\n\n59:38.200 --> 59:39.200\nare falling off.\n\n59:39.200 --> 59:40.680\nLike he's got no toes on one of his feet.\n\n59:40.680 --> 59:46.800\nHe has, we call him Friedel and now he has several free toes.\n\n59:46.800 --> 59:47.800\nAnd his 9-11.\n\n59:47.800 --> 59:48.800\nAll right.\n\n59:48.800 --> 59:54.560\nDon't cheer that, a lot of people died.\n\n59:54.560 --> 59:59.240\nHe, he, a lot of people died in that day.\n\n59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240\nDon't, don't share it.\n\n01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240\nPlease don't share it.\n\n01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240\nBut Friedel.\n\n01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.240\nDefensive.\n\n01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:08.240\nFriedel handles that with such like, I don't get why people were cheering.\n\n01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.840\nThey were like, ooh, woo, woo, yeah.\n\n01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.360\nOur, our, our audience, Rob, I don't know if you know this is mostly Al-Qaeda.\n\n01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.560\nWe got a couple, we got a couple Isis.\n\n01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.800\nThat's mostly old school, just straight up Taliban.\n\n01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800\nActually.\n\n01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.880\nThat's why I, I, I have, I have Al-Qaeda, like parasites.\n\n01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.800\nThat's why I was doing the, I think that was Candida though.\n\n01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.640\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.640\nCandida?\n\n01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640\nWhat?\n\n01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640\nWhat?\n\n01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:47.200\nDo you think there's places in like, like little cloisters where, where like like sleeper\n\n01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.520\ncells or caves or whatever we're supposed to, wherever the people that are like the,\n\n01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.640\nthe Adams family, the, the Nermatology that like, the, the, the, uh, like, uh, does you\n\n01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.280\nthink 9-11's like Cinco de Mayo?\n\n01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.280\nLike they, like they kind of like, like it's more, like there's like, like there's kind\n\n01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.080\nof like a little like, like there's a, do you think there's a color scheme?\n\n01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080\nI think it's, I think it's just our audience.\n\n01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.600\nThat's curious for 9-11.\n\n01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.480\nAnd thousands of people in New Jersey, thousands.\n\n01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480\nI saw it.\n\n01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480\nI saw it.\n\n01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.480\nAnd Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.\n\n01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.360\nCan we please get back to what we were talking about?\n\n01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.000\nCan you believe that fucking guy?\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nHe's the best.\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nHe's the best.\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nAre we annoying you?\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nWith our birther's shit?\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nSo what is he?\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nHe's out of his mind.\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nHe's going to become my hero.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nHe is the fucking, like just doing donuts.\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nLike, like, like, like there's only a, there's a certain point where he becomes a Duke of\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nHazard.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.560\nAnd it's like, you go from like, oh, you're lying piece of shit and then all of a sudden\n\n01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.560\nyou just go, wait.\n\n01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.320\nThe Duke of Hazard.\n\n01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.520\nI'd like to see that prequel.\n\n01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.120\nLadies and gentlemen, the Duke of Hazard.\n\n01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.280\nLadies and gentlemen, I, I am the Duke of Hazard.\n\n01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.120\nI, here's Sergeant Lee, my car.\n\n01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120\nSergeant?\n\n01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.320\nOh, he was back before he was a general.\n\n01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.720\nBefore he was a general.\n\n01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.640\nBut I didn't know that, that, that General Lee was originally an enlisted car.\n\n01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640\nYes.\n\n01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.640\nHe rose the ranks all the way.\n\n01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.640\nHoly shit.\n\n01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.640\nDid you see that giant cockroach?\n\n01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.640\nGiant cockroach.\n\n01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.640\nFucking crawling on the wall.\n\n01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.960\nAnybody see that in the front?\n\n01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.360\nThat if it, if I could see it from here, I'm further back than you.\n\n01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360\nAm I in danger?\n\n01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360\nWas it by me?\n\n01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360\nWhat happened?\n\n01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360\nNo, it was crawling on the red wall.\n\n01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.240\nIt's over by, it's, it's over by Steve Levy's head.\n\n01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.920\nIt's probably an important time to announce that the, the meltdown is opening a restaurant.\n\n01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.360\nThe, the, the, the, the patty meltdown.\n\n01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.280\nThat was a big fucking cockroach.\n\n01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.440\nThe patty meltdown.\n\n01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.560\nThat was a big cockroach.\n\n01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.720\nThat was a, that was a big enough cockroach that that might have been a bat.\n\n01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.720\nYeah.\n\n01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.720\nLike, we're not sure.\n\n01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.720\nThat was like a shadow.\n\n01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.920\nIt was bigger than my thumb.\n\n01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920\nI'll tell you that.\n\n01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920\nI don't like bugs.\n\n01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920\nI don't like them.\n\n01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.920\nI had a spider go into my ear one time and I almost lost my fucking mind.\n\n01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.920\nWhat?\n\n01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.200\nYou told, you told the story of the podcast before you, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.200\nBut in the control room, you don't have to worry.\n\n01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.200\nIt went up in diagonal.\n\n01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.200\nSo it's above your heads.\n\n01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200\nYeah.\n\n01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.200\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.200\nYeah, don't worry.\n\n01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.200\nIt might just descend on you at a moment's notice.\n\n01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.560\nIt would have to be, it would have to be a tremendously heavy, unwieldy cockroach to\n\n01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560\nfall on you.\n\n01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.560\nIt would, it would, it's body would have to have so much mass that it's, it's legs\n\n01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.200\ndesigned to anchor itself in, in the ceiling would, would be, would be unable to do so.\n\n01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.120\nAnd that's a roach that would just be off the grid, a rogue roach.\n\n01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.760\nIf there's one of them, there's like a thousand more in the wall.\n\n01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.760\nA thousand.\n\n01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.400\nNone with, none with nothing to lose, like that one.\n\n01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.000\nYou guys are about to get creep shot.\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.680\nAlso, that, that cockroach is, I think like one day away from retirement.\n\n01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680\nRight.\n\n01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.680\nHaving hunted itself to near extinction, like having, having, having, having boxed out\n\n01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.200\nall the other roaches by beating them to the dried droplets of milk under every refrigerator.\n\n01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.400\nAnd now it's just like, I don't, I have nowhere to go.\n\n01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.280\nI'm like, I'm like, I'm like the hustler.\n\n01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.480\nLike I was like, there's no Minnesota fats out here for me.\n\n01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.480\nAnd it's just like, now it's just climbing walls, like a spider.\n\n01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.880\nIt's just kind of like, what do I do, eat a bird now?\n\n01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.720\nDo I, do I discover fire?\n\n01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.000\nI think I've got like six hours left in my lifespan, I, I'm, I'm, I'm bursting with\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nbabies.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.760\nI, I should probably just, I should probably just fall into Steve Levy's hair backstage.\n\n01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.760\nYeah.\n\n01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.760\nAll right.\n\n01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.760\nOr write that book.\n\n01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.760\nGot to write that book.\n\n01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.760\nGot to write that book.\n\n01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.760\nOh, write that book.\n\n01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:33.240\nOh, you know, if I could give the cockroach any advice, write the book.\n\n01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240\nWrite the book.\n\n01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240\nWrite the book.\n\n01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240\nYou have all the time in the world.\n\n01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.320\nYou think you've got more time than you do.\n\n01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.320\nYou do not.\n\n01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.320\nI'll go further than that.\n\n01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.320\nWork with a collaborator because you're busy.\n\n01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.320\nYou're a busy cockroach.\n\n01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320\nYeah.\n\n01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:48.280\nYou're, you're, you're, you're running Rick and Morty, you're trying to, you're not\n\n01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280\na cockroach.\n\n01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.920\nLike how, it's not a ghost writer.\n\n01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.920\nIt's not the same thing.\n\n01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.240\nIt's a person that's there to help keep you on target and like move you along.\n\n01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.040\nAre you, how's your book coming along dad?\n\n01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.040\nVery well.\n\n01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.040\nWhat's your book?\n\n01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.400\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.080\nWhat, what are you talking about?\n\n01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080\nI care.\n\n01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.080\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080\nWill you tell me later?\n\n01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.080\nWhat's it about?\n\n01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080\nI don't know man.\n\n01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080\nI'm making it up as I go.\n\n01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080\nIt's just a book.\n\n01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:15.560\nI'm like, oh, one time I fucking took a shit in a tree and then I'm like, oh, here's a\n\n01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.200\n10 funny ways to make a pound cake.\n\n01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.400\nIt's like this print is dead.\n\n01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400\nYou just make shit up.\n\n01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400\nYou took a shit in a tree?\n\n01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400\nYeah.\n\n01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400\nOh, no, or did I?\n\n01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.400\nMaybe I'm just trying to move books.\n\n01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.400\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.000\nI don't even know who I am anymore.\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.520\nI've become more brand than you.\n\n01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.380\nWhat's the, what's the title of the, the book?\n\n01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.760\nWhat is the title of the book, Dan?\n\n01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.760\nYou do that last.\n\n01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.960\nIt's called the, it's called the, the Pupin Tree.\n\n01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.960\nI'll put it on the show.\n\n01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.520\nYou do that last?\n\n01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.040\nYou come up with the title last.\n\n01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.760\nWho does?\n\n01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.080\nThe Royal U. The person writing the book.\n\n01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.440\nYou go, you, you write the book and then you go, now what should this be called?\n\n01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.800\nThat's what, how it happens?\n\n01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.300\nYeah.\n\n01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.480\nIn my opinion, if you're doing it right, yeah.\n\n01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.480\nOkay.\n\n01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.480\nWell, okay.\n\n01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.000\nHere's a, here's an example of why not, why to do it that way.\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.320\nThe alternative would be, okay, I'm going to write a book and it's going to be called\n\n01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.680\nThe Boy Who Fought a Shark.\n\n01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.680\nOkay.\n\n01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.680\nAll right.\n\n01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.680\nSo then you start writing.\n\n01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680\nOkay.\n\n01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.680\nOnce upon a time there was a boy.\n\n01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.680\nOh, and then he went to the beach.\n\n01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.680\nOh.\n\n01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.680\nOh, and then he fought a shark.\n\n01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.680\nOkay.\n\n01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.680\nWhat?\n\n01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.680\nWhat?\n\n01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.680\nWow.\n\n01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.680\nPage one.\n\n01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.680\nHe fights the shark on page one.\n\n01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.680\nHe fights the shark?\n\n01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.680\nHe went to the beach and he fought a shark.\n\n01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.680\nSo now you're like, I'm fucked.\n\n01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.680\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\n01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.680\nAnd then you're like, here's the thing about fighting a shark.\n\n01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.680\nAnd then you're like, God damn it.\n\n01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.680\nGod damn it.\n\n01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.200\nAnd then you're like, just the title fucked you.\n\n01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200\nJust light.\n\n01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200\nRight.\n\n01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.200\nAnd then you come up with a name later.\n\n01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.200\nRight, right, right.\n\n01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.200\nI shouldn't have to tell you guys this.\n\n01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.440\nYou shouldn't, you shouldn't tell me it.\n\n01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.520\nIf the book was done now, what would it be called?\n\n01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:52.480\nTwo paragraphs about my grade school principal.\n\n01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480\nYou're only two paragraphs.\n\n01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.480\nAnd other stories.\n\n01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.080\nAnd other ways to date in this modern world.\n\n01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.680\nNo, I don't know.\n\n01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.320\nIt would be called, no, I'm not going to, there is a conceit to it.\n\n01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:08.160\nI'm not going to tell you because that's, when did the show become you guys violating\n\n01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.160\nmy NDAs?\n\n01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.160\nAll right.\n\n01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:16.320\nThat's always been our show.\n\n01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:23.240\nYou know, my favorite scene in the Steve Jobs movie is the, it's the one, thank you.\n\n01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.760\nIt's the one where he's like, where he, where he's, he's, he's on his deathbed.\n\n01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.760\nIt's very tender scene.\n\n01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.080\nAnd he's got, and he goes like, wait, one more thing, spoilers.\n\n01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.880\nYou should, you should be able to hold the send button down halfway.\n\n01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.240\nAnd then, and if you push it too hard, you, you have to start over.\n\n01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:45.040\nAnd then, but if you, then if you swipe up, you can send confetti.\n\n01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:51.720\nAnd they're like, holy shit, right up to the bitter end, that guy with the fucking ideas.\n\n01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.760\nHe just told us the ending balloons, balloons confetti of you, but then if you swipe right\n\n01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:03.760\nballoons, say the apples lost its grip a little bit, but I'm still buying the thing.\n\n01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.160\nDid you get the new phone?\n\n01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.160\nUh, it's common, but I'm talking, you know, have you installed the new software?\n\n01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160\nYes.\n\n01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.160\nDo you have the new software?\n\n01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.440\nI don't think so.\n\n01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.480\nCan you see balloons and confetti when I send them to you?\n\n01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.480\nNo.\n\n01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.480\nYeah.\n\n01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.480\nYou got to get that.\n\n01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:24.320\nHow's your eye watch, your Apple watch?\n\n01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.320\nAt the office.\n\n01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.320\nYeah.\n\n01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320\nYeah.\n\n01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.080\nThat didn't, didn't, didn't stick.\n\n01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:35.880\nIt seemed really cool that I had that Apple watch seemed really cool.\n\n01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.880\nSpeaking, speaking.\n\n01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880\nIt seemed so cool.\n\n01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880\nIt was cool.\n\n01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.680\nLike it was like a little, a little phone on your wrist, but it was connected to your\n\n01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.680\nphone.\n\n01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.680\nRight.\n\n01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.680\nIs that how it was?\n\n01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:47.680\nYes.\n\n01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:57.680\nApple watch seemed kind of cool.\n\n01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.680\nSeemed kind of cool.\n\n01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.680\nYeah.\n\n01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:10.240\nWell, I, yeah, I got into a rhythm of every time I believe these people, I get my life\n\n01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.240\nimproves.\n\n01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.040\nThese people, you know, that changes.\n\n01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040\nThese people.\n\n01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.040\nYes.\n\n01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.040\nI mean, it's the Apple people.\n\n01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:26.280\nYeah, the Apple people, Dan Harmon, we're coming to your house.\n\n01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280\nWe are the Apple people.\n\n01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.160\nWe have this new watch we want to show you.\n\n01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.040\nIt seems kind of cool.\n\n01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.200\nHow would you like to wear it for maybe nine episodes?\n\n01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.280\nHow did you get in here?\n\n01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:46.440\nIn 209, I'm sorry, I just wanted to talk to Dan Harmon for a second.\n\n01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440\nApple people.\n\n01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.440\nApple people.\n\n01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440\nYes.\n\n01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.440\nYou're in violation of the United States ordinance.\n\n01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.440\nOh shit.\n\n01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440\n3524.\n\n01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.440\nOh

01:09:57.440\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440\nNo.\n\n01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.440\nNo.\n\n01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.440\nYou have nine seconds to comply.\n\n01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440\nJust let me go.\n\n01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440\nI have a wife and children.\n\n01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440\nSeven.\n\n01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440\nPlease.\n\n01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440\nSix.\n\n01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.440\nPlease don't.\n\n01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.440\nFive.\n\n01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440\nJesus, somebody.\n\n01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440\nFour.\n\n01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.440\nSix.\n\n01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.440\nHelp me.\n\n01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440\nOh my God.\n\n01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.440\nTwo.\n\n01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.440\nOne.\n\n01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.440\nOh shit.\n\n01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.440\nOh right.\n\n01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.440\nGo

01:10:28.440\nI forgot my gun.\n\n01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.920\nI'm only a prototype in 209 on trespassing duty.\n\n01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.840\nI'm just supposed to roar at people and give them 10 seconds to comply.\n\n01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.440\nIt's okay.\n\n01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.560\nI overstepped my bounds as an Apple person.\n\n01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.560\nIt's not you.\n\n01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.560\nThe system is flawed.\n\n01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.680\nThere's a direct implication that forces me involved and yet I can't back it up.\n\n01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.520\nDon't go there.\n\n01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.520\nYou're not flawed.\n\n01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.360\nThe system's not flawed.\n\n01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.120\nI'm just as much to blame as you.\n\n01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.440\nDon't beat yourself up.\n\n01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.440\nEd, come on.\n\n01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.040\nSit on the couch with me for a second.\n\n01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.040\nI can't sit.\n\n01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:12.040\nOr climb stairs.\n\n01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:18.520\nI was in the break room yesterday and I heard the only reason I'm being manufactured is\n\n01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:25.520\nbecause of interference with a much more progressive anthropomorphized RoboCop project.\n\n01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:30.880\nNow don't talk like that, Edward, please.\n\n01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.880\nThat's not.\n\n01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880\nYou know something?\n\n01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.880\nI'm a piece of shit.\n\n01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:34.880\nNo you're not.\n\n01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880\nA cautionary tale.\n\n01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880\nNo you're not.\n\n01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880\nLook at your mirror right now.\n\n01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.880\nLook at the mirror.\n\n01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880\nLook at that.\n\n01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.440\nYou know when I look at your mirror, look at that.\n\n01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.440\nLook at you.\n\n01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.560\nAll you need is to comb your hair just a little bit.\n\n01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560\nLook at that.\n\n01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:52.280\nLet's comb your hair and maybe let's flip this collar up.\n\n01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.280\nLook at that.\n\n01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.280\nHey.\n\n01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.280\nHoly cow.\n\n01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280\nWho's this handsome guy?\n\n01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.280\nLook at this guy.\n\n01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.280\nYeah.\n\n01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.280\nYeah.\n\n01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:12.800\nYou are objectifying me using intimacy to make me feel better, but sending a larger message\n\n01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.000\nthat our bodies are what define us.\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.560\nYou have 10 seconds to apologize.\n\n01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.000\nAnd I know you don't have a gun so this is all bullshit.\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nI tried to help you.\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.720\nI will hashtag this and people will find out.\n\n01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.720\nAll right.\n\n01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.720\nYou

01:12:33.720\nOkay.\n\n01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.720\nAll right.\n\n01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.720\nHey.\n\n01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:36.720\nHey.\n\n01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:37.720\nHave a nice life.\n\n01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.720\nFuckface.\n\n01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.720\nWhat?\n\n01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.720\nLet's see.\n\n01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:41.720\nNo.\n\n01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.720\nNo.\n\n01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.720\nYou see.\n\n01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:44.720\nYou're a piece of shit.\n\n01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.840\nAnd I didn't want to say this before but you're a fat ass fucking piece of fuck shit.\n\n01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.840\nYou know?\n\n01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.840\nYou don't have a gun.\n\n01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.840\nYou look like shit.\n\n01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.040\nYou flipped your collar over.\n\n01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.040\nYou looked worse.\n\n01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.600\nYou suck every dick in this building.\n\n01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:04.360\nAnd I know because I talked to the person at the front counter.\n\n01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.920\nWe all know.\n\n01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.920\nYou suck.\n\n01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920\nOkay.\n\n01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.680\nSo I tried to be nice to you.\n\n01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.800\nThis is why no one likes you because you're a fucking piece of shit.\n\n01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.720\nBy the way, say hello to Periscope.\n\n01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.720\nOkay.\n\n01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.720\nGreat.\n\n01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720\nBecause you're being periscoped.\n\n01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:21.720\nOkay.\n\n01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.720\nOh no.\n\n01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.720\nOh no.\n\n01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.720\nFacebook.\n\n01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.720\nOh no.\n\n01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.720\nOh no.\n\n01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.720\nOkay.\n\n01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:28.720\nYeah.\n\n01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.720\nOh no.\n\n01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.720\nThe rain is over.\n\n01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.720\nOkay.\n\n01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.720\nGreat.\n\n01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.720\nGoodbye.\n\n01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.720\nGoodbye.\n\n01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.720\nSo.\n\n01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.720\nGoodbye.\n\n01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.720\nI'm closing the door.\n\n01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.720\nDear Facebook.\n\n01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.720\nIs that how they started?\n\n01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:50.720\nAbout 10 seconds ago I had a conversation with a colleague.\n\n01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:58.720\nWe're not colleagues.\n\n01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720\nWe're not colleagues.\n\n01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.720\nI just came to the door looking for Dan Harvey.\n\n01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.720\nWe're not colleagues.\n\n01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:08.720\nAt this moment I'm afraid for my safety.\n\n01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.720\nI have no guns.\n\n01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:15.720\nI was built for enforcement and I walk like a chicken.\n\n01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.720\nIt's how I was made.\n\n01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:24.720\nAnd until recently I thought that was fine.\n\n01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:37.720\nTo make a note about figuring out that reaction they felt like if they were lines crossed,\n\n01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.720\nthey were crossed before that.\n\n01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:46.720\nMaybe I was being too nuanced or anyways.\n\n01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.720\nThe video speaks for itself.\n\n01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.720\nThis is what I have to deal with.\n\n01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:58.720\nAnd now I don't know what I'm going to do.\n\n01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.720\nBrrrrrr. Also.\n\n01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:00.720\nBrrrrrr. I also have no hands. Hello.\n\n01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.720\nHello Ed.\n\n01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.720\nThis is your mother.\n\n01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720\nMom you're on speaker.\n\n01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.720\nI don't have fingers.\n\n01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.720\nSo I just typed... the phone.\n\n01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.720\nYour father and I want to know if you're coming over this weekend.\n\n01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:16.720\nMom I'm going through some shit.\n\n01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.720\nWhy are you going..\n\n01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.720\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.720\nJust let us know.\n\n01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.720\nIt's a simple question.\n\n01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.720\nAll you have to do is say are you coming over?\n\n01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.720\nIt's never a simple question with you.\n\n01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.720\nI need support right now.\n\n01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.720\nI just need to know if I should.\n\n01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:39.720\nI need to....\n\n01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:40.720\nI need to defrost the potato salad.\n\n01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.720\nAnd I have to start on Thursday because it's like a block of ice over here.\n\n01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.720\nSo are you coming or not?\n\n01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.720\nIf you're not coming it's fine.\n\n01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.720\nYou know you don't.\n\n01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.720\nThere's only so many years left with your father.\n\n01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.720\nBut you know if you don't want to.\n\n01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.720\nIf you don't want to come over it's fine.\n\n01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.720\nMom.\n\n01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.720\nMom.\n\n01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.720\nYes.\n\n01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.720\nYou don't recognize that as blackmail.\n\n01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:03.720\nYou don't recognize what you just did as emotional blackmail.\n\n01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720\nI do.\n\n01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.720\nYou have 10 seconds to acknowledge.\n\n01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:08.720\nEverything.\n\n01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.720\nI don't even.\n\n01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.720\nYou are a toxic person.\n\n01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.720\nEverything is 10 seconds with you.\n\n01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.720\nEverything is 10 seconds with you.\n\n01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.720\nWhen all I want is 24 hours on the weekend.\n\n01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.720\nDuring that 24 hours what are you going to say?\n\n01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:23.720\nWhy don't you have a boyfriend?\n\n01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:24.720\nWell.\n\n01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.720\nWhen the answer is complicated.\n\n01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.720\nYes.\n\n01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.720\nWell.\n\n01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.720\nI mean it just seems you know.\n\n01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.720\nYou know that you know you're the top military item of the next year.\n\n01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:40.720\nAnd it just seems you should have a boyfriend at least.\n\n01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:41.720\nSomething.\n\n01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:42.720\nYou know.\n\n01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.720\nI don't expect you to understand when you talk like that.\n\n01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.720\nThat you're hurting me.\n\n01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.720\nI don't know how to explain it.\n\n01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.720\nOh.\n\n01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.720\nI'm so terrible.\n\n01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.720\nI'm so terrible.\n\n01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.720\nI didn't say that.\n\n01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.720\nI'm so terrible.\n\n01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.720\nWill you hear this?\n\n01:16:58.720 --> 01:16:59.720\nWill you hear this?\n\n01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.720\nThere's something saying to me right now.\n\n01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.720\nWill you get on?\n\n01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720\nAsk him if he's coming over.\n\n01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.720\nJust ask him if he's coming over.\n\n01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.720\nI already did William.\n\n01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:14.720\nAnd he said he's going through some SHIT right now.\n\n01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.720\nAnd I just you know all I wanted to know was to get a little bit of fair warning.\n\n01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:27.720\nTell him I ironically said he has 10 seconds to fucking grow a pair.\n\n01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.720\nYes.\n\n01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.720\nEdward, would you please answer your father?\n\n01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720\nYes.\n\n01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.720\nYes.\n\n01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.720\nI'll come for Thanksgiving.\n\n01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720\nThank you.\n\n01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.720\nOkay.\n\n01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.720\nAll right.\n\n01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.720\nNow I'm going to go mow the lawn.\n\n01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.720\nOkay.\n\n01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.720\nWhat's the matter?\n\n01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.720\nWhat's going on over there?\n\n01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720\nOh, honey.\n\n01:17:50.720

01:17:55.720\nIs dad okay?\n\n01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.720\nOh.\n\n01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.720\nOh.\n\n01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.720\nWilliam.\n\n01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.720\nOh, honey.\n\n01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:02.720\nOh.\n\n01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.720\nHow do you give me?\n\n01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.720\nTell Edward goodbye.\n\n01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.720\nTell him he doesn't have to come.\n\n01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.720\nEdward.\n\n01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.720\nNo, no.\n\n01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.720\nI'm on my way.\n\n01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:10.720\nNo, it's too...\n\n01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.720\nNo, it's too...\n\n01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:12.720\nNo.\n\n01:18:12.720 -->

You won't be able to take a direct leap there.\n\n01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.220\nFat, fat!\n\n01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.720\nWelcome to Phoenix.\n\n01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.720\nYeah, you just got here too!\n\n01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.720\nYou're inside me!\n\n01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.220\nI'm just being nice.\n\n01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:27.220\nI'm going to fucking kill myself!\n\n01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.720\nHi, I need a...\n\n01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.720\nI need a flight to Phoenix.\n\n01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:38.720\nYes, uh, uh, you're in boarding group one. Just remember that.\n\n01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.720\nOkay, that should be really easy.\n\n01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.720\nThree hours later...\n\n01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:48.720\nHello, at this point in time, we'd like to have a game.\n\n01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.720\nIt was time to have a premiere group, Global Access,\n\n01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.720\na Golden Star members alliance.\n\n01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.720\nThere were uniformed members in the security,\n\n01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.720\nso we went down with a...\n\n01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.720\nWhat? What did she say?\n\n01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.720\nI don't know, I'm just waking up myself.\n\n01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.720\nEd 209.\n\n01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.720\nAlright, please don't tell anyone you saw me here.\n\n01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.720\nYes. No, you don't even know who I am.\n\n01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.720\nOh, I thought you were a fan.\n\n01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.720\nNo.\n\n01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.720\nI'm the Apple person that you kicked out.\n\n01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.720\nOh my god.\n\n01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.720\nGerald.\n\n01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.720\nYou're the...\n\n01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.720\nI was the person that tried to give you some self-esteem\n\n01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.720\nby combing your hair and popping your collar.\n\n01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.720\nAnd you were such a dick.\n\n01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.720\nExcuse me.\n\n01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.720\nHe just teleported.\n\n01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.720\nI'm on the wing now, because I don't like you.\n\n01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720\nThe wing of...\n\n01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.720\nThe plane?\n\n01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:47.720\nOkay.\n\n01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.720\nYeah.\n\n01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.720\nYou just...\n\n01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.720\nYou really played fucking Hellfire with my space work.\n\n01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:58.720\nI'm now burdened with...\n\n01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.720\nYes, and in you, but you didn't listen to me.\n\n01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.720\nI was in a terminal.\n\n01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.720\nI had not boarded yet.\n\n01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:09.720\nAlso, how is this character going to have an arc?\n\n01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.720\nHe was just a dick to me.\n\n01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.720\nIt's not 20 years later.\n\n01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.720\nHey, hey, hey.\n\n01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.720\nOh.\n\n01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.720\nYeah.\n\n01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.720\nIt doesn't have to be this way.\n\n01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:28.720\nFlight attendant, there's a white male on the wing of the plane\n\n01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:36.720\nexperiencing privileged turbulence.\n\n01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.720\nI think he might bring the whole plane down\n\n01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.720\nin a desperate quest to maintain his comfort.\n\n01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.720\nSir, we're going to have to ask you to take a seat.\n\n01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.720\nWe're going to have to ask you to board and take a seat.\n\n01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.720\nHow do you know I'm a sir?\n\n01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.720\nYou're Ed. 2 or 9.\n\n01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.720\nI can't sit.\n\n01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.720\nThe Ed is ED, it's an acronym.\n\n01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.720\nThe polite thing would be to ask me that shit.\n\n01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.720\nI'm sorry, I should have asked for your pronoun.\n\n01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.720\nHow do you present yourself?\n\n01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.720\nBy not sitting.\n\n01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.720\nYo, man, come on, just sit so we can take off.\n\n01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:20.720\nI explained to the ticket person, I don't sit.\n\n01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.720\nWe're going to have to ask you to...\n\n01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.720\nWe're running classification.\n\n01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.720\nWhy is he not sitting?\n\n01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.720\nJust sit down.\n\n01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.720\nSit down so we can get on with our lives.\n\n01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.720\nWhy can't you sit for one second?\n\n01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.720\nHydraulic system's overloaded.\n\n01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:57.720\nI know I have to sit.\n\n01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:07.720\nDo you believe in cultural assimilation?\n\n01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.720\nI don't.\n\n01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.720\nWe're now landing in Phoenix.\n\n01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.720\nWelcome.\n\n01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.720\nOh wait, not Phoenix.\n\n01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.720\nDetroit, where are we going?\n\n01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.720\nMilwaukee, I don't know.\n\n01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.720\nOkay, great, we're here.\n\n01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.720\nLimping in pain, sacrificed all my happiness,\n\n01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.720\nmy greatest identity and comfort.\n\n01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:32.720\nI want us to get to my parents' house.\n\n01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.720\nMy father needs medical assistance.\n\n01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:45.720\nI'll have to take an Uber.\n\n01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.720\nAt least their job is just to pick me up\n\n01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.720\nand transport me to a place.\n\n01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.720\nHow could that ever involve\n\n01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:58.720\nstripping me of my humanity?\n\n01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.720\nHello, bro.\n\n01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.720\nYou got to put it in your destination.\n\n01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.720\nThe address is in the app.\n\n01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:06.720\nI don't have a destination.\n\n01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.720\nThe app is designed to have the address put in it.\n\n01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.720\nI always use it.\n\n01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:16.720\nThe whole idea of this app is to not have to talk to people.\n\n01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.720\nYou want a water?\n\n01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:18.720\nYou want some candy?\n\n01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.720\nI got some candies up there.\n\n01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:20.720\nI don't need candy or water.\n\n01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.720\nThat's very nice.\n\n01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.720\nThat makes you very different from a cab.\n\n01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.720\nWhy is your cat in here?\n\n01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.720\nBecause Dr. Mittens comes with me wherever I go.\n\n01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:34.720\nIt's a good luck charm for me.\n\n01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.720\nMy father is sick and I need you to take him to the hospital.\n\n01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.720\nYou have to put the destination in.\n\n01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.720\nJust take a left up here.\n\n01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:42.720\nThis is one way street.\n\n01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:46.720\nI have to go right there.\n\n01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.720\nThat's not true.\n\n01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.720\nDr. Mittens, can I pull over?\n\n01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.720\nBecause Dr. Mittens has to go pee-pee time.\n\n01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.720\nFuck.\n\n01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.720\nHere you go.\n\n01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.720\nDr. Mittens, go right out and go pee.\n\n01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.720\nHe's an outside cat, but he likes to ride with me.\n\n01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:04.720\nZip.\n\n01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.720\nHe wears little...\n\n01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.720\nWhy does your cat wear pants?\n\n01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:16.720\nHe wears little kitty pants because it's mostly to keep his hair off the seats so that you're not uncomfortable.\n\n01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.720\nIt never occurred to you that if your hair...\n\n01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.720\nThe seat is a bad thing.\n\n01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.720\nThe cat should stay.\n\n01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.720\nLook, if you have so many problems, you should take a left.\n\n01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.720\nFuck.\n\n01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.720\nOkay, can we go?\n\n01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:39.720\nNo, I'm charging already because we've been going for a minute and a half.\n\n01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.720\nI know, just go.\n\n01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:41.720\nTake me to the address.\n\n01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.720\nOkay, I'm going.\n\n01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.720\nWould you like music or what do you want?\n\n01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720\nNothing.\n\n01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.720\nI got my own music I have, I have a little band.\n\n01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.720\nFine, I don't care, I don't care.\n\n01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.720\nIt's a mariachi band that me and my friends have together.\n\n01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.720\nI don't care.\n\n01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.720\nI'm super Mexican, so I...\n\n01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.720\nCan you please keep your eyes on the road?\n\n01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.720\nBro, you're being very aggressive right now.\n\n01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.720\nYou have 10 seconds to come the fuck down.\n\n01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.720\nOkay.\n\n01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:17.720\nOkay, we'll just go in silence and we'll just...\n\n01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.720\nYou just be quiet, I'll be quiet, I'll do anything.\n\n01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.720\nNo.\n\n01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.720\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.720\nWake up!\n\n01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.720\nOh!\n\n01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:41.720\nGod damn it!\n\n01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.720\nJesus Christ!\n\n01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.720\nI fell asleep, I fell asleep!\n\n01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720\nOh, Professor Mittens!\n\n01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.720\nNo!\n\n01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:47.720\nProfessor Dr. Mittens!\n\n01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.720\nDr. Mittens!\n\n01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:50.720\nOh, no!\n\n01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.720\nNot like this!\n\n01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:52.720\nI'm getting out of the corner.\n\n01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:53.720\nNot like this!\n\n01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.720\nOh, God damn it!\n\n01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:17.720\nI'm taking your cat because you can't take care of it and if it's a doctor, you might be able to help my dad.\n\n01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.720\nDad!\n\n01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.720\nDad!\n\n01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:29.720\nKeep Monica!\n\n01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:35.720\nWe just had a roller coaster installed in the backyard.\n\n01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:43.720\nGlad you could finally make it, Edward Monica.\n\n01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.720\nYour father's on his deathbed, he's got three breaths left.\n\n01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.720\nI'm glad you could finally take off time from your busy schedule.\n\n01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.720\nGet out of my way!\n\n01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.720\nHow?\n\n01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.720\nOut my leg!\n\n01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:54.720\nDad!\n\n01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.720\nDad!\n\n01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:56.720\nGet, get, get, get!\n\n01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.720\nDad!\n\n01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.720\nYou have three breaths to love me.\n\n01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.720\nDad, I can save you.\n\n01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.720\nThey can save everyone.\n\n01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.720\nThat's one breath.\n\n01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.720\nOxygen resources depleting.\n\n01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.720\nI don't care.\n\n01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:25.720\nFinal add to a nine breath take inflating father.\n\n01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:38.720\nHydraulic reserves channeled into father saving.\n\n01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:49.720\nLife force at 20%, 10%, 5%.\n\n01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:57.720\nWelcome to life.\n\n01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:05.720\nEven though I was already here.\n\n01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:19.720\nIt's a roller coaster.\n\n01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:31.720\nMy character's dead.\n\n01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:32.720\nMegan!\n\n01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:33.720\nMegan, what happened?\n\n01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.720\nWhere's my boy?\n\n01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.720\nMy girl, Monica.\n\n01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:44.720\nEdward Monica just gave his or her life to save him.\n\n01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.720\nNo.\n\n01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:50.720\nBut I was, I wanted to die.\n\n01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.720\nI know.\n\n01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.720\nI know.\n\n01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.720\nI know.\n\n01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:57.720\nOur marriage has been loveless for so many years.\n\n01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:58.720\nI know.\n\n01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.720\nAnd you're racist?\n\n01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.720\nI know.\n\n01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.720\nYou're a terrible person.\n\n01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.720\nI'm a straight up, I'm a straight up Trumpy.\n\n01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.720\nAnd I just, you know, he's not going to win.\n\n01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:07.720\nI know.\n\n01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.720\nI know.\n\n01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.720\nI know.\n\n01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.720\nI, he, this, this awful person.\n\n01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:13.720\nHe didn't have to, she didn't have to do that.\n\n01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:14.720\nI know.\n\n01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.720\nAlso, did we ever figure out the pronoun?\n\n01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.720\nIt was just so much effort.\n\n01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.720\nYeah.\n\n01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:21.720\nYeah.\n\n01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:22.720\nYeah.\n\n01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.720\nYeah.\n\n01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.720\nYeah.\n\n01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.720\nThis is a disaster.\n\n01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.720\nSo I feel great.\n\n01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:27.720\nI feel good.\n\n01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720\nFeel pretty good.\n\n01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720\nI know.\n\n01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:36.720\nWell, the potato salad is thought out.\n\n01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.720\nBut there's only enough for you and me.\n\n01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.720\nI don't want to live anymore.\n\n01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:48.720\nBut now I'm so full of life force.\n\n01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:57.720\nThere's a portal on Monica 209 shaped just like my hand.\n\n01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:58.720\nWhat?\n\n01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.720\nI'm going to put my hand on that.\n\n01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.720\nHand shaped portal.\n\n01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:15.720\nGenetic cybernetic amalgamation program initiating Robocop program developing embryonic phase\n\n01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:20.720\ninitiated.\n\n01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:26.720\nCome quietly or there will be trouble.\n\n01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:32.720\nOh, who am I?\n\n01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:39.720\nI have hands and Peter Weller's mouth.\n\n01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.720\nMurphy.\n\n01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:44.720\nI will call myself Murphy.\n\n01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.720\nIt's you.\n\n01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:47.720\nMurphy.\n\n01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.720\nMom.\n\n01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.720\nDo you want to go on the roller coaster?\n\n01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.720\nI do.\n\n01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:00.720\nBut it'll come at a price, son, daughter.\n\n01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.720\nI'll have to die again.\n\n01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.720\nJust let me go this time.\n\n01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.720\nLet it happen.\n\n01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:15.720\nDad, dead or alive, you're coming with me.\n\n01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:25.720\nDo you believe in Robocop metaphors for cultural complexities?\n\n01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:34.720\nWe fucking nailed it.\n\n01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.720\nGod damn it.\n\n01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.720\nI wish it was 10 o'clock so we could have ended on that.\n\n01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.720\nIt was fucking good.\n\n01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:45.720\nI got out the whole Apple Watch people coming back.\n\n01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:48.720\nYeah, I didn't really help.\n\n01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.720\nI thought it would be a good, you know, just kind of.\n\n01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:57.720\nI think it developed his character or her character of going, like the road of trials,\n\n01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.720\nlike enemies and allies.\n\n01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:03.720\nI just wasn't listening to his space work.\n\n01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.720\nSo it fucked up everything.\n\n01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:10.720\nI think if I learned anything from that story, it's that, you know, you have to go with the way you feel\n\n01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:15.720\nand not, you know, the way some external force, even inside of you,\n\n01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:20.720\nmight say things should be changed and edited, like you should go with your original feeling.\n\n01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:26.720\nSo if you really wanted that guy to have a, will come back there, fine, you know.\n\n01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.720\nBecause we really atoned it through that character.\n\n01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:33.720\nIt's like, no matter what your programming is, you still have to define yourself,\n\n01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:35.720\nno matter how you're wired.\n\n01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.720\nYes, because to just follow your...\n\n01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.720\nHe learned to sit.\n\n01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.720\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:43.720\nAt a huge cost.\n\n01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.720\nBut that was a dark, that was not a good thing.\n\n01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:51.720\nIn my opinion, I think you should be able to interpret true art, which I believe that was.\n\n01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.720\nYou should be allowed to interpret it however you want.\n\n01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:00.720\nI think actually there was a transphobic message there, as well as a more uplifting.\n\n01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:04.720\nWhen I felt it was a Christ myth about somebody who was being crucified,\n\n01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.720\nbut Archie Bunker might go like, yeah, geez, they just need to learn to sit.\n\n01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:18.720\nBut that starts a conversation, you know, with your parents and with your neighbors.\n\n01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.720\nI fucking, that was genius.\n\n01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:22.720\nWere his parents robots, too?\n\n01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.720\nI don't know, I think they were Peter Weller and Nancy Allen, I guess.\n\n01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.720\nThe whole time?\n\n01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.720\nObviously we diverted from the canon of the original feature.\n\n01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:39.720\nBut it came almost like an origin story for Murphy, like we gave birth to...\n\n01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:46.720\nThere were some looper elements in there, because it seemed like Ed was lamenting the Robocop program in the break room,\n\n01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.720\nbut then ended up being the birth of it?\n\n01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:49.720\nYeah.\n\n01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:52.720\nLook, I don't want to ruin it, you know?\n\n01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.720\nRemember the first Matrix movie?\n\n01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:58.720\nWe got in and got out and we didn't find out until two movies later it was all a piece of shit.\n\n01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:03.720\nWe didn't even think to take a second look.\n\n01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.720\nIt was like, that was amazing, I haven't seen wire work in an American film in a long time.\n\n01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:13.720\nAnd maybe we are all batteries, that makes sense, don't think about it.\n\n01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:16.720\nOf course that's a perfectly legitimate source of voltage.\n\n01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:21.720\nI think Ed's conversation with his mom was very touching, I like that.\n\n01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.720\nI like the whole thing, we're ruining it.\n\n01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.720\nWe can't be afraid to just move on and come up with an even better closer.\n\n01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.720\nIs there some product we have to advertise?\n\n01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:33.720\nDo we?\n\n01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720\nMeundies.\n\n01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.720\nYeah, we're going to do it in the studio though.\n\n01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:37.720\nOh, okay.\n\n01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:38.720\nWhat?\n\n01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.720\nWhat?\n\n01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.720\nWe're going to do meundies in the studio because...\n\n01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.720\nWhat's meundies?\n\n01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:44.720\nOh, glad you asked.\n\n01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.720\nI mean...\n\n01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.720\nWell, you're not familiar with the softest, most comfortable underwear on the planet Earth.\n\n01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:54.720\nThey're made out of modal fabric.\n\n01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.720\nAnd if you don't like them, you get to poop on them.\n\n01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.720\nSend them back for free.\n\n01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:07.720\nThey send you another pair.\n\n01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:11.720\nI heard Georgia Hardstark, she did the meundies ad on making a murderer.\n\n01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.720\nI'm not making a murderer, my favorite murderer.\n\n01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.720\nAnd she pronounced it medall, or something like that.\n\n01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:18.720\nMedall.\n\n01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:19.720\nI was a fancier.\n\n01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:20.720\nYeah.\n\n01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.720\nI don't know how you say it.\n\n01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:25.720\nI just know that it's an underwear company that we're apparently shilling for it, and\n\n01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.720\nthey should try them out.\n\n01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.720\nI think that's very negative language.\n\n01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.720\nI truly am wearing them right now.\n\n01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:30.720\nAre you really?\n\n01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:31.720\nThey're genuinely softer than cotton.\n\n01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.720\nAre they caressing your genitals in a romantic fashion?\n\n01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.720\nYeah, but it doesn't have to be a sexual thing.\n\n01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:42.720\nI don't believe you.\n\n01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.720\nI want proof.\n\n01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:48.720\nWell, I may not be wearing them, so I'm not going to...\n\n01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.720\nI'm still...\n\n01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:50.720\nI'm not going to throw my...\n\n01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.720\nI'm letting Nigel eat the cotton underwear slowly.\n\n01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:59.720\nWho's Nigel?\n\n01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.720\nNigel is Dan's man-servant.\n\n01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:08.720\nWhen Dan gets rid of his old underwear, Nigel will...\n\n01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:09.720\nEat it?\n\n01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.720\nHe'll eat the old underwear.\n\n01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:12.720\nI got a vibe.\n\n01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:15.720\nI hooked up a vibe in my...\n\n01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:20.720\nIs anybody in the audience rich enough to have a six-foot room to just spare?\n\n01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.720\nI'm a game designer, kind of.\n\n01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.720\nGame designer?\n\n01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.720\nHave you done stuff in VR?\n\n01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.720\nThat's why I got into game design.\n\n01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.720\nPornography?\n\n01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:33.720\nAny pornography?\n\n01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.720\nWell, I just...\n\n01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.720\nDuncan Tressel, I was just talking to him because he's really into VR.\n\n01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.720\nHe sent me this odd link that I don't quite...\n\n01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:43.720\nI'm not experienced enough with VR yet to understand the context of this.\n\n01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.720\nI've only been doing the demos.\n\n01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:49.720\nI did immediately, almost immediately, I brought up Pornhub Premium.\n\n01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.720\nJust within virtual space, I just wanted to know...\n\n01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:53.720\nWhat's it like?\n\n01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:54.720\nWould it be different if you were just...\n\n01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:58.720\nIf the website on which you watch porn, if it was all of a sudden,\n\n01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.720\nit's just in front of you and the answer is,\n\n01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.720\nwell, it's like having porn blown up in front of you,\n\n01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.720\nbut they're obviously making VR porn.\n\n01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.720\nI just haven't gotten into it yet,\n\n01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.720\nalthough the dress form in Tilt Brush already made me a little...\n\n01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.720\nIt's like different backgrounds.\n\n01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.720\nI have no idea what any of the last eight and a half has been about.\n\n01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:28.720\nI got turned on by a virtual mannequin.\n\n01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.720\nMannequins are already virtual.\n\n01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.720\nI was like, you know, there's this amazing...\n\n01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.720\nGoogle made this app called Tilt Brush.\n\n01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:40.720\nIf you ever get into one of these things and you only have a certain amount of time,\n\n01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.720\nthe most impressive thing to do first is go to Tilt Brush,\n\n01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:44.720\nbecause it's like...\n\n01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.720\nThe most impressive thing is it's this...\n\n01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.720\nThe tracking, that's what it is.\n\n01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:53.720\nThat's why in the 90s, we were talking about VR incessantly,\n\n01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.720\nlike honeycomb commercials and things were like, VR's here and it wasn't.\n\n01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:59.720\nBut I think it's the tracking technology,\n\n01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:03.720\nbecause you're holding these things now and they're just tracking perfectly.\n\n01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.720\nSo everything that you're doing in there,\n\n01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.720\nI was on Mars that was assembled out of Mars rover pictures.\n\n01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:13.720\nThe locomotion thing is always going to be an issue now,\n\n01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.720\nbecause it's like you got your rich people who can afford to have one of these systems\n\n01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.720\nwhere you have external trackers where you're like,\n\n01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.720\nokay, it's like the equivalent of a swimming pool, basically,\n\n01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:29.720\nbecause you're like, who has the real estate to give over a bedroom to this system\n\n01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.720\nwhere you have to have total floor space?\n\n01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.720\nAnd then the odd thing is, well, it's so impressive that you can kind of do this casual,\n\n01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:41.720\nlike walk around, but you can't go bounding off into the woods immediately.\n\n01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:45.720\nSo everything is based on kind of teleportation right now.\n\n01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.720\nYou have to just teleport to places and then you can walk around six feet in that area.\n\n01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:52.720\nBut it's just unbelievable.\n\n01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:56.720\nThere's no question once you're in it, you're like, okay, that's it, world's over.\n\n01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:01.720\nIn terms of storytelling, I don't even know how we're going to do our job anymore,\n\n01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:07.720\nbecause I do know it's time to retire, because it's going to be a whole different skill set\n\n01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:14.720\nthat I think AI is even going to be better at, because your job as a writer in a post-VR world\n\n01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:21.720\nis going to have so much more to do with volume and kind of procedurally generated,\n\n01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:24.720\nlike just volumes of eavesdroppable material,\n\n01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:28.720\nbecause I think your job is going to be to create the illusion of infinity.\n\n01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.720\nSo since the Lumiere brothers were like, oh, fade in on this, cut to that.\n\n01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.720\nHere's what you see now, and here's what you see now.\n\n01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.720\nWe were all born into this world and we don't even know.\n\n01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:45.720\nSo now you put on this thing and it's like, oh, everything has to be based on just like,\n\n01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:49.720\nit has to be like that thing in New York where you're walking around\n\n01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:52.720\nin the mid-summer night's dream production and you can go through people's panties.\n\n01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:59.720\nIt has to, everything's going to sleep no more, what's it called?\n\n01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.720\nFaith No More.\n\n01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.720\nIt's called Faith No More.\n\n01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.720\nFaith No More at Rockefeller Center.\n\n01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.720\nEverybody knows what we're talking about.\n\n01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:06.720\nIt's going to be like that.\n\n01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:09.720\nYou're going to want to, it's going to be like soap opera writing a little bit that way,\n\n01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.720\nthe volume, because you're going to like, oh, you can't...\n\n01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.720\nVR people come to Lego like every other week,\n\n01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.720\nlike we're always talking about like the next stage of it.\n\n01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.720\nHave you put on the helmet?\n\n01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.720\nSo you're, are you, what are you...\n\n01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:23.720\nInto it?\n\n01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.720\nYeah.\n\n01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.720\nYeah, it's kind of cool.\n\n01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:30.720\nI mean, I've been over at Justin's house and I've, you know, gone underwater and saw the whale, you know.\n\n01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.720\nI went over the mountain and I met the elephant.\n\n01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:36.720\nSo to speak?\n\n01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.720\nYeah.\n\n01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.720\nAnd I was like, and I took it off and I was like, you, and I go, porn, what's up with that?\n\n01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.720\nAnd how soon...\n\n01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.720\nWell, so, okay, so, Junkin, yeah, maybe this is a cool...\n\n01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:48.720\nAnd when can I check out of what I'm doing right now?\n\n01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.720\nI'll link to a Reddit thread.\n\n01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.720\nAnd honestly, this is also cryptic to me because I don't, I'm not familiar with any of this.\n\n01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:58.720\nI said, I said, I was just talking to him about VR and I said, I was asking, is there just...\n\n01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.720\nMy immediate question is, okay, this is fun, but is there, are there games where my fat ass can sit in a chair?\n\n01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.720\nLike I just want to drive or fly a helicopter.\n\n01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.720\nLike I don't, I can only stand in a virtual museum and walk around and go, whoo,\n\n01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:14.720\nbefore my feet get tired like at a museum.\n\n01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:20.720\nSo I was like, let me sit in our games where I can sit in a chair and be like in a flying chair and go shoot people or something.\n\n01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.720\nAnd he's like, there's a space game, but I can't figure out how to make it work.\n\n01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.720\nAnd he said, like, have you...\n\n01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:28.720\nHe just said porn, question mark.\n\n01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.720\nAnd I said, porn, I only went as far as to experiment with pulling a pornhub on a screen,\n\n01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:37.720\nblah, blah, blah, dress form and tilt brush.\n\n01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:38.720\nAnd then...\n\n01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:40.720\nI don't get the tilt brush.\n\n01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720\nWhat's a tilt brush?\n\n01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.720\nA tilt brush is an art app. Okay, so it's like, like, it's like a MS paint in virtual reality.\n\n01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.720\nOkay.\n\n01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.720\nThat will blow your mind the most because you're painting, you can paint not in 3D space,\n\n01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:58.720\nbut you can also, your brush, the thing that makes me freak out is the palette interface.\n\n01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:08.720\nIt's, you have, where your wrist would be, you have this cube that you can rotate by swiping.\n\n01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.720\nIt's an immediate indication of how much more convenient it's going to be to work in VR\n\n01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.720\nin terms of menus and like UI and stuff.\n\n01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:23.720\nIt's because you're just like, there's a cube on your wrist that just goes flip, flip, flip, flip.\n\n01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.720\nAnd it's like all these different, like, so okay, you pick your brushes,\n\n01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:32.720\nand then you pick like a fire brush, you know, and you paint with fucking fire in the air.\n\n01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.720\nAnd it's like, and you can just make a tunnel of fire and stick your head through the air.\n\n01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:42.720\nThen you can grab the whole space and shrink it down and rotate it and all this stuff.\n\n01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:45.720\nCan you get turned on by this tilt brush?\n\n01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:48.720\nSo one of the, oh man, the fire.\n\n01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.720\nSo they have different backgrounds you can change it to.\n\n01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:55.720\nSo if you wanted to like sculpt or something, there's like a little pedestal there.\n\n01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.720\nYou can't touch the pedestal.\n\n01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:00.720\nYou're holding these things, but it's like, it already makes you think like, oh shit,\n\n01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:03.720\nwhatever the Disney of the future is, if people are still, you know,\n\n01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:09.720\npeople are just going to obviously, that's how you're going to model like the Mickey Mouses of the future.\n\n01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:12.720\nYou're going to, I haven't done Minecraft now.\n\n01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.720\nBut I'm downloading Grand Theft Auto 5.\n\n01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:21.720\nJustin told me, I just stood in the strip club for like 10 minutes and just looked around.\n\n01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.720\nBut that's the scary part because it's like, well, guess what you do next?\n\n01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.720\nYou start shooting everyone.\n\n01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:30.720\nLike that's how, or you're playing the game wrong.\n\n01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.720\nSo it's like, already you just get fucking terrified.\n\n01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.720\nOr at least if you're over 40, you do.\n\n01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:38.720\nIf you're your age, maybe you're like, yeah.\n\n01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.720\nAnd maybe that will save us.\n\n01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.720\nMaybe people need to go do that.\n\n01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.720\nYeah, it'll probably save us.\n\n01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.720\nThat's definitely what will probably happen.\n\n01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.720\nIt'll save us for sure.\n\n01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.720\nYou want to get it out of your system.\n\n01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.720\nYeah, yeah, it'll save us.\n\n01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.720\nEverybody with an Eli Roth DVD on their TV, like they've got it all out of their system.\n\n01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.720\nThat's why violent crime went down so much.\n\n01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.720\nBut I just sound like grandparents.\n\n01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.720\nBut I guess...\n\n01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.720\nGrandparent Auto.\n\n01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:11.720\nWhere's the goddamn... I can't find the park.\n\n01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.720\nHow do you make it shoot?\n\n01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:16.720\nWhere's my grandchildren?\n\n01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:18.720\nBut to answer your question...\n\n01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.720\nWhere's my grandchildren?\n\n01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.720\nOne of the backgrounds in Tilbrush.\n\n01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:23.720\nWho am I?\n\n01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:26.720\nGet this strip club off of my lawn.\n\n01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:30.720\nWhere's my lawn?\n\n01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.720\nYou can change the background to anything you want.\n\n01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.720\nSo you can be standing in infinite space and painting shit.\n\n01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.720\nYou go to a white room, a black room.\n\n01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:38.720\nYou can have like a marble pedestal in front of you.\n\n01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:40.720\nYou want to make shit on top of that.\n\n01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:42.720\nYou can make it any kind of room you want?\n\n01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.720\nYou asked me a fucking question, man.\n\n01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.720\nAnd I'm in the middle of answering it for 10 minutes.\n\n01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:55.720\nAnd the question is, Dan, tell us about your fucking sexually perverse brain.\n\n01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:57.720\nAnd why you're a monster.\n\n01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:59.720\nAnd I'm trying to get there. I'm trying.\n\n01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.720\nOne of the backgrounds that you can change it to is like a dress form.\n\n01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:09.720\nWhat do you call it?\n\n01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.720\nA maiden form.\n\n01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.720\nIt's a torso.\n\n01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.720\nIt's for pinning fabric to...\n\n01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.720\nI think it's called a maiden form, right?\n\n01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:20.720\nA dress form?\n\n01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:22.720\nA dress form.\n\n01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.720\nIt's a dress form.\n\n01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.720\nSo you're switching buttons.\n\n01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.720\nOh, there's Saturn. And I'm in the desert.\n\n01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.720\nAnd I'm painting and stuff.\n\n01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:32.720\nAnd then it's like, oh, the dress form.\n\n01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.720\nAnd I was just like...\n\n01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.720\nIt's a life-sized torso in front of you.\n\n01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.720\nNo head.\n\n01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:42.720\nThere's no head.\n\n01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.720\nOh my God.\n\n01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:46.720\nNo head.\n\n01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.720\nA headless torso.\n\n01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.720\nSo high.\n\n01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.720\nI feel like you guys are interpreting this the wrong way.\n\n01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.720\nMaybe not. I don't know.\n\n01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:56.720\nTake me to jail.\n\n01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.720\nWhat I'm trying to do is say already it's like...\n\n01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.720\nCody, run for the hills.\n\n01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:02.720\nTechnology is so primitive.\n\n01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.720\nIt's like you're in virtual reality,\n\n01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:06.720\nbut there's a thing that is life-sized in front of you\n\n01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.720\nthat even thinly represents.\n\n01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.720\nThat has no brain.\n\n01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.720\nSo think about Jessica Rabbit.\n\n01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.720\nYou think about the ideal of beauty.\n\n01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.720\nSometimes actually not only it filters reality,\n\n01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:20.720\nbut sometimes it seems like...\n\n01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:23.720\nthe whole point is that it's not real.\n\n01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.720\nThere's going to be this whole...\n\n01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:28.720\nYou look at today, we have celebious sexuals,\n\n01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.720\nand we're in this modern world,\n\n01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.720\nand people are finding out all these different ways to be turned on.\n\n01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:36.720\nAnd now we're going to have the first generation born into a world where...\n\n01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.720\nCelebious? What?\n\n01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:40.720\nYeah, people who just identify as like,\n\n01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.720\nlook, here's my sexuality.\n\n01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.720\nWell, I don't know.\n\n01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:46.720\nYou'd have to talk to one of them.\n\n01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.720\nI don't want to miscarry it and say,\n\n01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.720\nfame gives me a boner.\n\n01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.720\nThat sounds... whatever.\n\n01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.720\nBut it's like, I'm a celebious sexual.\n\n01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.720\nGod, why am I fucking explaining myself to you?\n\n01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.720\nThe fucking...\n\n01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:00.720\nYes, it's a dress bar,\n\n01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:02.720\nbut it couldn't be less.\n\n01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:04.720\nIt's like the vague hint of femininity\n\n01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.720\nin the vague hint of like a thing in front of you.\n\n01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.720\nAnd immediately...\n\n01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.720\nOf course, I was just like...\n\n01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:12.720\nYou put your hands out there\n\n01:48:12.720 -->
