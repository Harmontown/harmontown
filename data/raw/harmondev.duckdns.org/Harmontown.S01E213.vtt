WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I

00:02.000 --> 00:15.440
Think this is the shower all the other words

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I

00:36.880 --> 00:38.880
Mean town is now in session

00:44.880 --> 00:46.880
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown

00:46.880 --> 00:48.880
I

01:01.360 --> 01:03.800
So it's it's it's emmy night and

01:04.640 --> 01:09.720
And I just flew back from Milwaukee and so bad show tonight. It's a bad show tonight

01:10.600 --> 01:12.920
But you guys brave traffic, and I thank you for that

01:12.920 --> 01:19.960
I was in Milwaukee doing it in town to do a show with the who's live anyway with you know Ryan styles and Greg Proops and Joel Murray and

01:20.880 --> 01:28.600
You and I get a text from Cody dance girlfriend. Are you Milwaukee? Yeah, I'm at the spy themed

01:29.600 --> 01:36.080
Bar restaurant called the safe house. I'm staying at the Fister hotel the whole the hilariously named Fister hotel

01:36.080 --> 01:39.640
You that their slogan is you brought her. Yeah

01:45.840 --> 01:51.760
You were in town for a grandma funeral, right? Yeah, my my dad's mom passed away

01:52.320 --> 01:56.200
She she accomplished her mission. She was a just just pushing 90

01:57.320 --> 01:59.320
And and the

02:00.040 --> 02:03.480
Dementia which we're learning new things about this ago

02:03.480 --> 02:08.800
We all maybe have it like like we all just kind of have it in varying degrees and then

02:09.600 --> 02:15.320
But but like you know, it's it's really kind of like the the tragically typical way to

02:16.200 --> 02:22.720
That a story ends is that which are there my parents were moving her in the process of helping her move because the dementia

02:22.720 --> 02:27.760
Got to a point where she really needed to live with people her husband had passed a while ago

02:27.760 --> 02:36.520
And while packing like just the energy and the confusion of like, you know, when you're when you're a person with

02:36.760 --> 02:40.080
In that stage of dementia all of a sudden

02:40.600 --> 02:46.240
There's your ships being put in boxes and all this stuff and she something got triggered where she's like

02:46.240 --> 02:49.160
I got to check on my my I got to get the cat from the basement

02:49.160 --> 02:54.360
She doesn't have a cat in the basement and she like she fell down the stairs and

02:54.360 --> 03:00.960
And a broker hip and they took her to the hospital and then it's this is just that the tragic ironies of like this

03:00.960 --> 03:06.960
Is just like Joseph Campbell like like like like you have to we have to accept that our lives

03:07.280 --> 03:13.080
the last parts of them are but like if you can't be attached to this flesh because the

03:13.400 --> 03:15.920
The the the way we go out is so

03:16.440 --> 03:21.880
Just ridiculous if we're lucky enough to make it through a healthy life and and just to have this this this

03:21.880 --> 03:25.800
Chassis just rust and fall apart

03:25.800 --> 03:29.000
You know you have to but it get because it just gets so from there

03:29.000 --> 03:34.040
It just gets so cartoonish because they it's like you have dementia and you have a broken hips and then they are like

03:35.200 --> 03:36.960
we can't

03:36.960 --> 03:40.000
give her a new hip because

03:40.840 --> 03:47.000
She won't be able to participate in her recovery because she'll forget she has a bionic hip

03:47.000 --> 03:53.840
Which you need to you need sanctions and participation in order to have one of those things take she'll

03:54.280 --> 03:59.000
She'll forget and she'll just she'll step on it the wrong way and she won't know what's going on

03:59.000 --> 04:00.440
And it'll it'll get all fucked up

04:00.440 --> 04:04.320
It'll be a fate worse than than a than a peaceful death for her

04:04.320 --> 04:07.840
I the not that that was the only thing she was also she went into a coma

04:08.480 --> 04:14.920
But it's also like then you also think like like oh if she comes out of this coma then she's gonna be in

04:14.920 --> 04:19.920
In you know with her dementia. She's gonna be in bed with a broken hip for the remainder of her life

04:20.000 --> 04:24.560
Which is though if those things start to heal they heal wrong as you have to re break them

04:25.120 --> 04:28.080
And and she'll be she'll be coming in and out of

04:28.840 --> 04:30.880
continuity and

04:30.880 --> 04:35.360
Re-learning every five minutes. Oh shit. I have an incredibly painful

04:36.320 --> 04:40.680
Thing that I didn't know about like like just imagine like that horrible kind of fate

04:40.680 --> 04:47.360
Which is like probably really common like are you gonna like dementia being a very common way that we go out like just that?

04:47.480 --> 04:52.400
CD skipping and and and that relationship with like this this other really common thing

04:52.400 --> 04:56.120
Which is we all tend to kind of fall off a porch and break our hip. This is sad

04:56.120 --> 04:59.320
I don't I'm not trying to bring everybody down, but if I did it would go something like that

05:00.640 --> 05:05.160
But but I mean I think that's you know you're 25 you're listening to the podcast you you know

05:05.160 --> 05:11.120
It's like like the obvious message from that is Carpe diem and like get your get your licks in place a monopoly with your family

05:11.120 --> 05:13.100
Which is what I did

05:13.100 --> 05:15.560
But it was such a trip like what we're driving into town

05:15.680 --> 05:19.400
We're like you're bussing into town. We've done a show like in

05:20.040 --> 05:26.720
Lansing or something like that the night before that we're driving to Milwaukee and I point towards the historic third word, right?

05:26.720 --> 05:31.040
That's down with the original comedy sports was right mm-hmm and or not the original one

05:31.040 --> 05:32.600
But the one that I met you at yeah

05:32.600 --> 05:37.160
You were like around the corner from where Schrab and I did comedy sports before we left and I met and it's like

05:37.160 --> 05:40.120
I was saying to the guys in the bus like oh, it's like right right down there in

05:41.000 --> 05:44.200
1994 that's where I met Dan Harmon and Rob Schwab and

05:44.400 --> 05:50.080
Then I got a text an hour later and you're there and you came to our show and you watched me do improv

05:50.080 --> 05:55.200
And I was at this restaurant the spy themed restaurant called safe house and you're like that's where I first did stand up

05:55.200 --> 05:56.720
Yeah, yeah, it was yeah

05:56.720 --> 06:03.680
I'd be like 17 and like because they have like this spy theme there that was made it an easier place to be underage and do stand

06:03.680 --> 06:07.680
Up because the spy thing was like what's the password and you're like gibble gobble Google and

06:08.840 --> 06:10.840
And so like you could kind of like

06:11.440 --> 06:17.560
Their eyes less on the prize of like law enforcement and more on like that like this whole like are you James Bond and like go through

06:17.560 --> 06:20.440
The bookcase and all this I had to dance around like a chicken for 10 seconds

06:20.440 --> 06:23.920
And then I didn't know that I'm also on camera and the bar

06:23.920 --> 06:28.920
Yeah, that's the idea there is that they're the people in the front room like they're there

06:28.920 --> 06:32.760
It's basically just like Rocky Horror Picture Show. Are you a virgin or have you been here before?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.760
You know, it's like the password is

06:35.280 --> 06:40.120
Where was when I was going there are you I'm looking for a safe house. First of all, that's not a word

06:41.320 --> 06:45.120
Second of all, that's that I mean that doesn't I mean that that's what your enemies are gonna say

06:47.920 --> 06:50.840
Right if I had said to the gal because like you walk in there

06:50.840 --> 06:54.600
There's no sign for it. There was me and then and this like this other woman like like like, you know

06:54.600 --> 06:59.920
Like early 30s gal like walking up and she's like, do you know where this place is? I'm like, I'm looking

06:59.920 --> 07:03.000
I just yelped veggie burger and I that's why I'm here

07:03.600 --> 07:09.360
and and she's like I think oh and then there's a girl like it like dressed like as a little secretary and as a switchboard and

07:09.360 --> 07:13.480
It's all old-timey and she's like you guys know the password. It says like international exports

07:14.120 --> 07:18.040
Something like that and she's like you know the password like no, I don't it's like well

07:18.040 --> 07:24.240
Then I'm gonna send you on a mission to old McDonald's farm. You have to click like a chicken and dance around in circles for 10 seconds

07:24.800 --> 07:26.800
If I had said no

07:26.960 --> 07:32.400
Like I want to go have a veggie burger. She wouldn't let me in right you she's not allowed to say go fuck yourself

07:33.080 --> 07:37.240
No, I don't know. I'm sure that's a subject of every morning meeting there depending on

07:38.320 --> 07:40.800
Depending on how business is doing, you know, I don't know. I

07:41.240 --> 07:45.040
Maybe maybe for a happy hour. I don't know if like that guy from bar rescue came in

07:45.040 --> 07:48.440
Maybe he'd yell at them. I go you're you're turning people away

07:50.680 --> 07:53.480
What what's out the door? What's out the door?

07:57.040 --> 07:59.200
You see out there a street

08:01.120 --> 08:04.640
A street in a city which which city

08:05.880 --> 08:09.040
Milwaukee the biggest cheese and beer

08:09.040 --> 08:17.280
The capital in the world you need to go turn around. I've rescued your bar. It's called cheese ballers

08:20.200 --> 08:26.520
Anyway, sorry, I got carried away doing observational comedy with a cable show that were you doing a depression of an actual thing?

08:29.360 --> 08:33.240
John taffers like you've never seen bar rescue. You gotta watch a couple of episodes

08:33.240 --> 08:40.320
Fuck it. No, I don't I'll give you some I'll give you some starter points first bar rescue for watch the pirate bar episode

08:40.920 --> 08:44.520
I think it's in Pittsburgh. Is that where it is? Where at Maryland?

08:45.240 --> 08:48.360
Wait, Maryland. Okay. It's in Silver Spring. Okay

08:50.280 --> 08:52.600
But also no matter what episode you watch

08:53.160 --> 08:56.840
Watch it with your laptop open to Facebook and just type in the name of the bar

08:56.840 --> 09:04.080
While you're watching the episode because the episode always ends with it being rescued and then you always you just go to

09:04.080 --> 09:09.600
You go to the their Facebook page, and there's always a blog entry. That's like, so here's the thing these fuckers

09:10.840 --> 09:14.400
Like they left and then just blazing saddles fell apart

09:15.640 --> 09:21.400
They installed some unlicensed beer taps in the walls that were shaped like hands because

09:21.400 --> 09:29.280
He's just said that hands were an important thing with our demographic and now there's just hands dripping illegal booze

09:29.440 --> 09:33.680
Everywhere that the bar they made was out of one by fours

09:33.680 --> 09:38.040
This is like you had turned my eggs in it was was was blazing saddles in there

09:38.040 --> 09:42.160
Is that an actual one? No, no, I'm saying like blazing saddles. They make a fake town and

09:42.680 --> 09:44.800
It's like they kind of like they're a TV show

09:44.800 --> 09:49.320
I mean though TV shows have line producers line producers jobs are to like save money

09:49.320 --> 09:55.320
They're rescuing a bar and saving money for the TV show about how the bar got rescued largely in tales

09:55.760 --> 09:59.400
Making it look a lot like a rescued bar from certain angles

10:00.360 --> 10:06.200
And then leaving as it falls apart behind you. That's how you keep your job as a line producer

10:07.120 --> 10:13.640
Did I meet this person through you the person that is there a gay bar call blazing saddles? It's like it's like a it's kind of like I

10:14.240 --> 10:17.960
Mean it got to be you Dan because you're you're my go-to for gay bar

10:17.960 --> 10:24.400
I information it sounds like a rehab program. I forget who told me the story, but like this guy

10:25.920 --> 10:28.760
Is there a gay bar called blazing saddles where it's kind of like like

10:30.000 --> 10:32.560
Coyote ugly with a dance, but it's all gay bar and stuff and

10:34.080 --> 10:40.680
Apparently it's like it's like a huge. It's like huge money-making like enterprise. This guy was

10:40.680 --> 10:48.240
married a woman she'd do she cheated on him right off the bat, but her but her family was the mob

10:48.720 --> 10:54.080
like she was like straight up like mafia family and this guy married into this family and

10:55.040 --> 10:58.040
She cheated on him, but the family didn't want any disgrace

10:58.040 --> 11:04.320
So the bomb mob boss said to this guy like he was just telling the story to this woman like at another bar in New York

11:04.560 --> 11:06.560
Maybe Dino told me the story

11:06.560 --> 11:14.640
Like my wife cheated on me and I went and then her father called me and said look

11:14.960 --> 11:19.540
It's not gonna be public. We're not gonna talk about it. She cheated on you. We know about it

11:20.160 --> 11:22.800
Anything you want. Here's a beer. They gave him a bag of money

11:23.560 --> 11:27.120
Like and said whatever you need. Let me know and he goes

11:27.120 --> 11:32.160
I want to open a bar and he because he'd met this woman at another bar and said I want to open a gay bar called blazing saddles

11:32.160 --> 11:36.280
Where the people get up and dance around and whatever. He's not gay. He's never opened a bar

11:37.280 --> 11:44.000
He and so he went to the guy said you're like you can't open a bar in New York without the mobs consent

11:44.000 --> 11:48.560
Because you like you have to like there's so much. I think I read that on the subreddit

11:50.080 --> 11:56.720
He opened a gay bar with this person with a bag full of mob money and and the mobs like blessing and now he's like worth a

11:56.720 --> 12:04.000
Fucking fortune because his wife made the movie based on the bar or that it. No, it might not be called blazing saddles

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I think it

12:06.280 --> 12:10.280
I'll throw up the story. I was like I can't do it with the perfect joke. It's like Jeff

12:10.280 --> 12:12.720
You just remember you don't have a cat in the basement

12:16.920 --> 12:19.120
Do I have to mention that I make this whole thing up

12:19.120 --> 12:22.480
Well, we all do is what I was what I'm I went saw blazing saddles in the theater

12:22.480 --> 12:29.200
They showed up the arc light because a gene gene Wilder is a sad demise went and saw one of my favorite movies of all time

12:29.320 --> 12:33.040
Blazing saddles. It was so fun to watch it people that knew the movie laughing like crazy

12:33.640 --> 12:36.280
Millennials that had never seen it were like bummed out

12:37.120 --> 12:38.880
because

12:38.880 --> 12:40.160
there's

12:40.160 --> 12:45.880
There's n bombs. Yeah bombs. Yeah, I mean I when I watch that movie apparently

12:45.880 --> 12:52.560
I am I am running a millennial emulator because I'm always like what the fuck? I?

12:52.560 --> 12:54.760
Like this is like spaceballs in the west

12:56.480 --> 12:58.480
Anyways, but

12:58.480 --> 13:18.480
Let's bring out Rob Schrab

13:28.640 --> 13:30.640
He's the best friend

13:31.320 --> 13:36.000
What okay? Wait, I heard you. I don't know about this technology

13:39.040 --> 13:43.600
Can I get a little more of that apparently apparently some guy named Reggie Watts knows about it. That's a

13:44.360 --> 13:49.600
That's what I learned last last week because I was like I was listening to hip-hop because I was like as I was fine

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
I didn't want to become one of the I didn't want to go

13:51.600 --> 13:57.160
I didn't want to become like the the rapping guy that like is rapping like 20 years ago

13:57.160 --> 14:02.720
This is unavoidable. I mean, I'm not I was never but I just want I said your name's Dan Harmon

14:02.720 --> 14:04.920
And you're here to say yeah that you like to do a rap

14:04.920 --> 14:11.560
I'll pass every day last time you listened to anything rap oriented and I so I went to my Apple music with my little

14:11.800 --> 14:16.680
Wrinkled finger and I I pressed play on some picture of a rapping man, and I

14:18.160 --> 14:24.920
And I listened for ten songs, and I was like holy shit these guys number one very sad very lonely

14:24.920 --> 14:31.560
Very very very emo really. I think it was what we would have called it and and but also very

14:32.600 --> 14:34.600
Auto-tuned and by auto-tuned. I mean

14:35.240 --> 14:41.320
No autonomy and no tune like like it's just the whole it's it's like it's the same as with record scratching like

14:41.560 --> 14:46.400
When in the 80s where it was like it just because of Herbie Hancock and the like like everyone's

14:47.000 --> 14:50.200
For a large period of time you had to have

14:50.200 --> 14:55.360
Record scratching in your song, but it's like this is it's like everyone has to be auto-tuned. Yeah

14:55.360 --> 14:57.800
Yeah, can you share voice share voice?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
share voice

15:01.120 --> 15:05.240
Dan I think what Rob is asking is it if you believe in life after love

15:05.240 --> 15:20.360
Yeah, I mean I don't think I mean this is a vocoder. I don't think it simulates give it a shot. It doesn't

15:35.960 --> 15:41.320
A little short Irish man that grant wishes I fucked your mama so hard she did the dishes

15:41.800 --> 15:46.520
I went to the kitchen said quit your bitch. She's gonna give you a little shit

15:47.720 --> 15:51.560
So I gave her a litch and she said what's this? I said don't ask

15:52.680 --> 15:55.720
I went up to the attic and installed some

15:56.680 --> 15:58.680
insulation

15:58.760 --> 16:03.800
Weatherproof in your home. Do you believe in weatherproof in your home?

16:03.800 --> 16:10.280
How can you proof against something that's a phenomenon older than your own species?

16:11.160 --> 16:13.160
Dance don't weatherproof

16:14.600 --> 16:16.600
Dance isn't weatherproof

16:16.600 --> 16:21.720

Dateline Loch Ness I fucked your mama for her dress. It was consensual. She liked to be ravished

16:57.080 --> 16:59.080
That's what they called it back then

16:59.080 --> 17:01.080
Ravishing

17:03.960 --> 17:05.960
Hashtag rape culture

17:07.000 --> 17:10.520
Okay, okay. All right. Hashtag rap culture

17:14.520 --> 17:20.280
Bringing it back taking back the night I went on the banks of Loch Ness and studied all night

17:20.600 --> 17:25.960
Until I saw a little head coming out took a photo of it and the scream didn't shout

17:25.960 --> 17:32.840
I prove it. I believe in the Loch Ness monster. Yeah, that shit was a log

17:34.520 --> 17:36.520
It was a piece of floating wood

17:38.360 --> 17:43.400
Cautionary tale those airplane tickets cost me $8,000

17:43.400 --> 17:56.360
It's like it's like I never left

17:57.560 --> 18:02.120
It's like I never left that was amazing. Thank you what we have been just

18:03.160 --> 18:07.800
Living in twilight until you had this thing. Yeah, I have good ideas about

18:08.360 --> 18:09.400
About what the show needs

18:09.400 --> 18:14.440
I also we need a big screen up here so that they can see stuff that we bring up and then we could do the whole

18:14.600 --> 18:15.800
Graham Norton thing

18:15.800 --> 18:20.920
I could go look at this dog on the internet and everybody'd be like, whoa, dude. We could be ellen and I want to look at the dog

18:22.040 --> 18:26.680
I want to look at the dog. Yeah, you want to look at the dog. I want to look at the dog. What's but you know what?

18:27.400 --> 18:29.400
You can't look at the dog

18:30.360 --> 18:32.360
when

18:32.760 --> 18:34.760
When your show is wack

18:34.760 --> 18:40.840
Maybe maybe that should be on a stand or something

18:42.600 --> 18:45.160
I mean, I mean it looks cool when you bend over like

18:47.320 --> 18:49.320
Like that

18:49.320 --> 18:52.920
I don't think there's any reason to do anything but you doing that with that vocoder

18:52.920 --> 18:58.360
I kind of did that last week. You know, you know, let's you know, I got overdue last week. I was working man. I know

18:58.520 --> 19:00.520
No, I wasn't I wasn't yelling. Yeah

19:00.520 --> 19:04.760
I heard it was a good show that I heard you and Andy Dick got that down to some serious

19:05.880 --> 19:07.880
I'd like to have Andy back Andy was very

19:08.280 --> 19:11.080
Andy was wonderful. Yeah, I would like to have him back

19:11.560 --> 19:15.080
You know, he started when he started he told the story about being Andy Dick at a Starbucks

19:15.560 --> 19:20.760
I thought was very it was kind of enthralling. Yeah, I'm out of breath from bending over

19:24.440 --> 19:26.600
To press comedy rap buttons

19:26.600 --> 19:28.600
I

19:30.200 --> 19:32.200
There were warning signs

19:34.680 --> 19:36.680
I gotta get on that elliptical man

19:37.480 --> 19:42.040
You have one leave. He's not in his head. Do you have one at the crib? You got you got an elliptical out the house?

19:42.040 --> 19:44.040
Yeah, you don't you don't use it

19:45.000 --> 19:47.080
I'm getting around to it. I need a special outfit

19:48.680 --> 19:50.680
I can't get on it in my underwear

19:51.000 --> 19:54.120
You're at your own house. You can do whatever you like. You can you need a track suit

19:54.120 --> 20:00.920
Yeah, I need to get a special a special special special tracksuit pop over pop over dan go to lululemon and treat yourself

20:02.120 --> 20:05.240
Even though they're sweatshops and you know what that means. Is that a new sponsor?

20:08.920 --> 20:10.920
All right, I'm sure we they could be

20:11.800 --> 20:18.200
Can we talk I'd like to talk about something because I've done a lot of traveling. Um, I just want to talk I don't want okay

20:18.200 --> 20:23.240
The airlines this airline that airline they're the worst they're the best whatever

20:24.520 --> 20:26.520
What all of them all the airlines?

20:27.400 --> 20:29.400
What the fuck is going on?

20:29.880 --> 20:33.800
What is our relationship supposed to be with that fucking seatbelt sign?

20:34.360 --> 20:37.000
What is it supposed to symbolize? What does it mean?

20:37.560 --> 20:41.800
Like the more questions you ask the more data you gather the more experiments you do

20:41.800 --> 20:48.360
Whether it's getting up when that thing's lit or waiting for it to turn green or having a conversation with one of these

20:49.240 --> 20:50.760
people

20:50.760 --> 20:58.520
Like it's like all it the truth that just comes to light is like well, okay if we had it our way you'd always be sitting

20:59.640 --> 21:04.040
Okay, but you can't always sit you're on a fucking plane for three hours

21:04.440 --> 21:07.400
So there's a light that's just always on that's like

21:07.400 --> 21:14.040
It's a green light with a picture of a seatbelt with the arrow going the seatbelt is unlatched

21:14.040 --> 21:20.440
But the arrow is going like this like like this this seatbelts going to get latched on the sun

21:20.680 --> 21:22.680
Okay, so that would seem to indicate

21:23.000 --> 21:27.880
Fasten your seatbelts everybody which they make you do at the top of the flight

21:28.360 --> 21:35.320
They never turn that fucking thing off ever if you ever have to take a shit like they don't you just get up and you're like

21:35.320 --> 21:40.040
You know it just it's always random the interaction you have they're like we'd like you to sit

21:40.040 --> 21:43.800
And so if you really have to take a shit real bad you go I got to take a shit real bad

21:43.800 --> 21:46.680
They're like well, I have no I have no legal right to stop you

21:46.920 --> 21:52.920
Yeah, they're they're not allowed to if you want to get up you can get up and you can go do it

21:52.920 --> 21:57.640
But they are legally bound to say we don't advise it. We can't say you should yeah

21:57.720 --> 22:03.000
So expressing that with a sign that's like just a thing that's lit up like that's very

22:03.000 --> 22:05.800
That's just boy who cried wolf because it's just like okay

22:05.800 --> 22:12.360
You know I'm just going to ignore everything that you do like because like what is this my sign problem on planes is that there's the

22:12.440 --> 22:17.080
there's the sign for the lavatory and it's a man and a woman and the woman is

22:17.880 --> 22:19.880
designed as

22:20.200 --> 22:26.200
There's there's a man and a woman standing in between there's a sink in between them right and on a pedestal and it was a toilet

22:26.440 --> 22:29.400
Yeah, or it's a little like it's a little sink kind of thing a basin

22:29.400 --> 22:35.160
It's a basin in the middle on a pedestal, but the thing is if you turn that basin over that's the woman's dress

22:35.880 --> 22:37.880
She's dressed like an upside-down sink

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I find that very diminishing

22:42.200 --> 22:44.440
Click she's a receptacle. Yeah, or or

22:45.800 --> 22:49.560
Or or or or or a or an agent of hygiene

22:50.680 --> 22:52.840
I don't know. Maybe they're cleaner than us

22:52.840 --> 22:57.800
Like next time look at that sink and then look at the woman. She's just an upside-down sink with a head on top of it

22:57.880 --> 22:59.880
they don't know what they're doing on these things and

23:00.840 --> 23:04.200
And it's disturbing because obviously I probably don't have to point this out

23:04.200 --> 23:09.320
It's like a 90 ton piece of metal that they fling into the air and rely on some weird

23:09.880 --> 23:11.880
pre-Newtonian principle

23:11.880 --> 23:16.200
To just keep it going like a paper airplane those things aren't like spaceships where it's like

23:16.920 --> 23:18.760
You know there's thrusters and stuff on there

23:18.760 --> 23:24.520
But really the whole thing is like there's like little fans in there that if the plane's already in the air

23:24.760 --> 23:26.760
It tends to stay in the air

23:27.560 --> 23:31.560
That's what a turbine is as I understand it just air is rushing through the thing

23:31.880 --> 23:36.920
And then the things spin because air is coming through and because the things spin the plane stays up

23:37.080 --> 23:39.080
Like there's a problem with that system

23:39.640 --> 23:42.360
If that thing gets trans what if someone turns the air off?

23:43.880 --> 23:45.640
Like god

23:45.640 --> 23:50.680
Which he sometimes does and probably will if we keep this up if the if if if if one of the engines

23:51.960 --> 23:57.560
Turn off the wind. He's gonna turn off though. What if he just start what if god just says, okay for the next 10 seconds

23:57.560 --> 24:00.520
I just want to write can I get everyone's attention. Well put your seatbelt on

24:03.480 --> 24:09.880
If god if god hey, I don't know what the symbol is but if if god turns off the air ladies and gentlemen

24:09.960 --> 24:11.960
Please put your seat belt on

24:11.960 --> 24:17.880
Put your seat belt on I asked god just turned off the air

24:19.080 --> 24:22.280
Put your seat belt on and hug the person next to you

24:23.720 --> 24:26.680
Well, that's what i'm saying. It's an ungodly thing getting on these things and

24:27.720 --> 24:29.720
and people are dying all the time and

24:31.160 --> 24:32.920
I just like we don't pay any attention to it

24:32.920 --> 24:38.200
We're just like do you think the guy in the cockpit has a degree in this shit like he I don't know. I don't think so

24:38.280 --> 24:39.960
I think he's

24:39.960 --> 24:43.160
I think he's wearing like a little captain crunch outfit and like I

24:44.600 --> 24:51.400
From my experience like I don't I the average person is an idiot like just the average person because

24:51.960 --> 24:57.240
Average IQ is 100. Yeah, do you want a 100 IQ man flying your plane or lady?

24:59.880 --> 25:03.240
Nice say just as stupid as men give yourselves a hand

25:04.360 --> 25:05.880
uh

25:05.880 --> 25:11.640
The the the he's just I mean it's like with the epaulets and the things and it's like it feels like compensation

25:12.120 --> 25:14.680
Like doesn't it man those epaulets

25:17.400 --> 25:20.920
Wow those epaulets are really bringing me down man

25:21.560 --> 25:25.480
I just don't believe the way I what is the thing about the epa why the epaulets though?

25:26.440 --> 25:31.400
There's no function there. Yeah, what what's up with those epaulets because if they dressed the way that they

25:31.400 --> 25:37.480
Only at only the level that they needed to you'd be even more freaked out because he would look like a time-warner cable guy

25:37.560 --> 25:39.160
so they

25:39.160 --> 25:40.760
So they have to look true

25:40.760 --> 25:44.760
We're more comforted when they dress like captain crunch. We think okay. We want that. Yeah

25:45.320 --> 25:50.520
I want more. I want more of that like if a guy with like two sets of epaulets came on

25:50.520 --> 25:53.000
I would be holy shit. We got a really good pilot here

25:53.720 --> 25:57.240
They kind of do like a good cup bad cup thing like if the stock is wavering

25:57.240 --> 26:01.720
They're like we got to amp this up. Well, it's just scenario seven so that's like a guy comes on with epaulets. He goes

26:02.120 --> 26:05.560
Uh, we're we're gonna we're everybody buckle up

26:05.560 --> 26:10.760
We're gonna go over the Grand Canyon and then another guy comes on with like two epaulets and goes like get out of here

26:11.160 --> 26:14.360
Get out of here go over the Grand Canyon. That's a big hole. Yeah

26:16.200 --> 26:22.440
Sorry about that ladies and gentlemen. I'd be up front like yeah, come on. Thank you for flying united. I'm captain. No

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
colonel

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
John Jommer from yeah

26:27.400 --> 26:33.800
We're gonna fly around to the Grand Canyon. Nice like you should when there's a big hole in the earth

26:34.520 --> 26:41.480
That's the whole point of a plane to not crash into shit. Don't fly over the Grand Canyon. Yeah, I'm gonna fly around it

26:42.280 --> 26:44.440
You buckle up. You know what don't buckle up

26:45.720 --> 26:53.000
Because it won't matter turn the light off do jumping jacks take two iPads plug them both in and rub them on a laptop

26:53.000 --> 26:57.400
And and do little Elvis kicks because if I'm doing my job, right?

26:57.480 --> 27:00.920
That's what you can do because that's what rich people do when they get in their private jets

27:01.000 --> 27:04.760
They don't have seatbelts up. Let's make an okay go video right now

27:07.240 --> 27:09.960
I'm gonna turn this shit upside down

27:11.080 --> 27:13.080
Denzel style

27:13.560 --> 27:15.560
Denzel

27:15.720 --> 27:17.160
Denzel

27:17.160 --> 27:23.160
Denzel. Yeah, I know it doesn't you reduce him in stature. It's Denzel

27:24.200 --> 27:25.960
Denzel

27:25.960 --> 27:28.520
You make you make him sound like a forgotten reindeer

27:32.760 --> 27:34.760
I'd dash or I'd prance or Denzel

27:35.560 --> 27:37.400
Denzel whatever

27:37.400 --> 27:39.560
You can you're there for redundancy in case

27:40.280 --> 27:44.120
Jasher and prancer like have a bad back Denzel. Yeah Denzel comes off the bench

27:44.120 --> 27:47.320
Yeah, if if if Blitzen has a sword

27:49.720 --> 27:51.720
Or sully hey, so

27:53.160 --> 28:01.160
So cody cody got uh, which she got an uber from my place after we got home from the airport and her uber driver's name was strategy

28:01.160 --> 28:12.040
Was it really yeah, I know it was strategy. Well, I mean was it right? It was on the screen. Yeah, I had a uber guy named Beethoven

28:16.200 --> 28:19.640
These are guys who obviously in their former name they did something really terrible

28:20.760 --> 28:25.080
As an uber driver or they switched uber accounts. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

28:25.080 --> 28:31.160
Yeah, yeah strategy. That's good. Yeah, that's their other reddit account

28:32.520 --> 28:38.120
Because you never know like like what can people see when I do you go on reddit? Do you do you if you stop doing that?

28:38.440 --> 28:40.440
Do you look at your reddit for porn?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.600
or for

28:42.600 --> 28:44.600
Reddit has porn

28:44.600 --> 28:55.480
Yeah, it has uh, it has highly sordid curated hierarchically arranged porn with

28:57.480 --> 29:00.200
You can comment on it and get up voted and down voted it's

29:00.840 --> 29:05.800
Of everything you could ever gain from reddit is as applicable as to porn as everything else

29:06.600 --> 29:11.000
Uh, Duncan. No, I don't really I don't really frequent reddit because I'm a narcissist and I haven't like I

29:11.000 --> 29:15.560
I I the the my favorite thing about reddit was like, you know, I'd go to walks

29:16.040 --> 29:20.120
Community and the rick and morty and the Dan Harmon and stuff and I just it's too

29:20.840 --> 29:22.840
I'm too loathsome a person to

29:23.080 --> 29:26.440
to to and too narcissistic to to continue to

29:27.160 --> 29:32.680
Disappoint people as a human being on this level and then also read about myself incessantly

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
Uncle Dennis is here

29:38.600 --> 29:43.800
I have a real Uncle Dennis. I met him. I'm bad at making up names. So

29:45.160 --> 29:51.000
For Uncle Dennis if he's I brought Uncle Dennis to your impromptu show. Yeah, it's fun. And he yeah, he had a blast

29:52.360 --> 29:53.720
Because he's a fan

29:53.720 --> 30:00.200
And it was a very funny show. Thank you. You and Ryan Stiles did the uh, did uh, Neil Diamond and Gordon Lightfoot singing a duet

30:00.200 --> 30:04.520
And it was really funny. Remember when we went to see Neil Diamond in Las Vegas?

30:04.520 --> 30:06.520
Yeah

30:07.560 --> 30:09.560
Well, we went we went to see

30:10.200 --> 30:13.800
Remember this do you remember we had not well. I remember I didn't go but I

30:14.680 --> 30:16.920
I was on mushrooms and you came back from

30:17.640 --> 30:20.760
Concert and it was like three hours on a hotel room floor

30:21.640 --> 30:26.280
Listening to Rob describe the Neil Diamond concert. That was my Neil Diamond concert

30:27.160 --> 30:32.120
I got that was the best. I got to go backstage with sam slammin who got us the tickets and we we met

30:32.120 --> 30:36.840
Uh, we met Neil Diamond for the show and I was really excited about that and uh

30:37.560 --> 30:41.800
As I've seen like at that point I said like I think I've seen him eight times in concert

30:41.880 --> 30:46.200
At that I think that was my sixth time and so I meet Neil Diamond right before the show and I go

30:47.000 --> 30:51.560
Mr. Diamond's pleasure to meet you. This is my this will be my sixth time seeing you and he takes my hand and he goes

30:52.680 --> 30:54.680
A fan

30:58.600 --> 31:01.080
And then the groovy as part of it was that his uh

31:01.080 --> 31:06.840
Uh, uh his assistants like this big bouncer guy like he's kind of like handler and like bodyguard guy

31:07.640 --> 31:10.040
Had a wind up like disposable camera

31:10.520 --> 31:13.560
And he goes get together and he took like snap snap snap

31:14.120 --> 31:17.960
Wine wine wine snap and and and then gave me the camera and he goes keep it

31:19.560 --> 31:22.600
Neil Diamond has become a human wedding

31:25.640 --> 31:27.480
I didn't give you a mason jar and he's like look

31:27.480 --> 31:30.920
We're free refills and then and then you can you can use it at home. So I

31:31.640 --> 31:33.000
When I would go see Neil Diamond in concert

31:33.000 --> 31:37.960
I would always try to predict what the first song he would sing would be and and and I one time I was right about it

31:37.960 --> 31:45.320
But usually you're not right because you've got a million songs. Um, so we we're leaving him and uh, it was me drew carry

31:46.280 --> 31:52.040
Sam and I think nick vanne was back there too because our friend like produced like Neil Diamond a long time ago or something

31:52.920 --> 31:56.360
And uh, we're leaving and I said, well, hey have a great show. Uh, give him hell out there

31:56.360 --> 31:58.360
And he goes Neil Diamond goes like what?

32:01.320 --> 32:06.440
Like I was leaving and the director of saving silverman was there like like they just made that movie

32:06.680 --> 32:10.440
So he was talking to him and I go give him hell and he goes what I go

32:11.800 --> 32:14.760
Give him hell man. Like I have a good show. He was like

32:15.960 --> 32:17.960
We will

32:19.240 --> 32:24.040
And he's like give me a weird look. I'm like, okay. All right, man. I know I mean like knock him dead like give him

32:24.040 --> 32:30.200
Hell is like what? Yeah, how dare you so we leave and sam was like, what the fuck was that about?

32:30.280 --> 32:31.960
I'm like, I don't know

32:31.960 --> 32:33.480
The first song

32:33.480 --> 32:35.480
It was a new song. He had called give him hell

32:37.480 --> 32:39.480
Totally

32:42.680 --> 32:48.600
You're not supposed to fucking know that jack. How did that leak? Yeah, how did that leak at a time of no leaks?

32:48.600 --> 32:55.240
The IT guy told me it was airtight tonight

32:57.720 --> 32:59.720
Man stage with you and I'm doing Neil Diamond

33:00.840 --> 33:04.520
Uh, can you honor tune Neil Diamond? How would that work? Yes? Yes?

33:07.080 --> 33:09.080
Do you have a song that might work for that? Let's see

33:13.720 --> 33:15.720
Far

33:15.720 --> 33:18.120
We've been traveling far

33:21.640 --> 33:29.160
Without a home. Oh wait, our home is the village of mushrooms because I sound like a smurf

33:31.320 --> 33:33.320
No, I think the answer is you can't do Neil Diamond

33:35.320 --> 33:37.320
Not a tune

33:37.960 --> 33:41.560
My friend Johnny Polanski is a guy. I played some of his music on the show before

33:41.560 --> 33:47.400
He was he's a session guitar player and he did a I think 12 songs was like one of Neil Diamond's last records

33:48.120 --> 33:49.880
Is that Rick Rubin maybe?

33:49.880 --> 33:56.200
And so he worked with Neil for a few weeks and I'm a as I say like I'm a giant Neil Diamond fan

33:56.200 --> 34:00.280
So I made him tell me a thousand stories Neil would come in every morning without his toupee

34:00.920 --> 34:05.720
And he wore a denim jumpsuit like a onesie

34:05.720 --> 34:11.480
I'd like just denim and then he and like 10 a.m. He'd have a cognac like jean jammers

34:13.800 --> 34:16.760
I'm sorry jean jammers like jean jammers

34:18.760 --> 34:20.760
Wait a second

34:21.720 --> 34:24.600
Just keep doing that. That makes me so happy

34:25.720 --> 34:31.480
But uh, so so he would just come in just like brandy and a cigar and he would talk he never talked to my friend Johnny and uh

34:31.480 --> 34:36.760
When Johnny was finally done. He was wrapped on it and he was packing up his guitar leaving for the final day

34:37.640 --> 34:41.160
Neil comes out of the booth and he's like, hey, you're Johnny, right? Because yeah, look, I'm sorry

34:41.640 --> 34:43.640
I didn't really get to talk to you that much

34:43.960 --> 34:48.040
Uh, but it was really pleasure working with you and if I ever do another record, I want you to be on it

34:48.520 --> 34:51.800
Because you're I like you I like I like what you do and Johnny's like, thanks, man

34:51.960 --> 34:54.840
I absolutely and he was Johnny. Let me tell you something

34:54.840 --> 35:01.560
You're a real motherfucker, and I mean that and I mean that in the best possible way

35:03.960 --> 35:09.160
You could you could do worse. Yeah, I fucking knew worse than oh my god. I look I

35:10.680 --> 35:14.840
Um despite all outward appearances, I'm straight, but I would I would make out with Neil diamonds

35:15.080 --> 35:19.560
I would fucking make out with Neil diamond. I would have made out with bowie bowie and Neil. I would have fucking

35:19.560 --> 35:21.560
I would totally make out with

35:21.720 --> 35:23.720
Uh, but that's it

35:23.720 --> 35:24.680
Spencer

35:24.680 --> 35:29.880
Oh, spencer is uh, taking a spencer is spencer's feels like shit and we said we text him

35:30.280 --> 35:34.600
He said i'm gonna bow out of the show tonight and we he said I feel like shit

35:34.600 --> 35:39.240
We said someone said like diarrhea and and and he said it takes more than that to keep me down

35:40.280 --> 35:42.280
Or something like that. I paraphrase, but

35:42.840 --> 35:45.480
So whatever it is, it could be emotional diarrhea

35:46.120 --> 35:52.040
You know the price of spencer psychologically, you know like like being spencer. I mean, can you imagine what goes on up there?

35:52.040 --> 35:55.080
I said, I had a pretty good colonic this morning

35:56.840 --> 36:00.920
You know, you know, wait, wait, wait, put a pin in that for one second. I did

36:01.880 --> 36:04.120
You did put a pin in it. Is that why you needed that colonic?

36:04.840 --> 36:09.080
Are you one of those guys the needles on the on the ballpoint those guys? I'm your friend

36:13.880 --> 36:17.720
I want to know why you put a pin and rob is pretty well because because I was gonna

36:18.040 --> 36:21.880
I do think it's kind of funny the idea that the oj simpson thing is dominating the emmy's because when you looked at the

36:21.880 --> 36:24.200
Credits of that of that very enjoyable show

36:24.760 --> 36:29.960
It was like literally everybody like like if that show sweeps the emmy's it's almost sort of like

36:30.760 --> 36:37.880
Like everybody worked on that like they weren't there like brilsteins and grays and the and also like people that don't even like they were

36:37.880 --> 36:40.360
Like it was the the the god the larry

36:41.480 --> 36:44.120
Scott alexander's in the like the it was like

36:44.920 --> 36:50.680
Every single human being that had ever made anything for television or movies had had some kind of like credit on that show

36:50.680 --> 36:54.440
So now they're like sweeping the emmy's and it's like are they happy or sad about that?

36:54.760 --> 36:58.040
Is this the a travolta one? Yeah, okay. Yeah, I just wanted you know

36:58.200 --> 37:02.440
They go to the parties and I was like 500 people and they all have emmy's and it's like you guys already had them

37:02.760 --> 37:08.920
Or oscars and like like and you didn't beat any of each other. So there's no satisfaction there. They must be bummed out

37:08.920 --> 37:13.560
That's my thing. I bet they're like going to each other in like smaller groups and going like man

37:14.280 --> 37:18.680
This emmy's worth nothing. I know right because the guy we hated is also working on it

37:18.680 --> 37:20.680
Yeah, all right

37:21.640 --> 37:24.200
I guess I guess I guess I am different than the audience

37:25.400 --> 37:27.560
I guess I do think about different shit. I'm just

37:28.440 --> 37:33.080
Speaking maybe I'm an artist speaking of different shit Rob. Let's talk about your calling. Let's talk about this high colonic

37:33.240 --> 37:38.920
We can edit out my shitty observations about the emmy's. No, it was good. Have you ever tried these colonics? They're great

37:39.160 --> 37:43.880
Not a I've only only never a high one. What's a high colonic? I've never I've never I don't know what a

37:43.960 --> 37:47.880
It seems like if it's high you're doing it wrong. I don't know what you're talking about

37:47.880 --> 37:53.960
I just have a regular high colonic is the yeah, you see you go to somebody they put a put a hose up your butt. What happens?

37:55.080 --> 37:59.240
Yes, yeah, yeah, I went to this I went to the lady and she and she

38:00.200 --> 38:03.720
I've been going for a while and I was a little skeptical

38:05.000 --> 38:10.040
But I I'm I'm all right with it. It's not too bad. It's good. It's good

38:10.040 --> 38:18.600
She she she did say the first time I did it. It's like I don't use an adult one. I use a child applicator

38:18.680 --> 38:20.680
And I was like does that mean it's like

38:21.400 --> 38:23.560
Besides a little boys dick

38:25.160 --> 38:29.560
A look wait wait wait wait. Oh my okay. Okay. All right. Yeah. I

38:30.440 --> 38:33.400
Roller coaster ride can I rewind a little bit on that one?

38:34.280 --> 38:39.720
I thought I thought you were I thought you were being flattered because she was implying that your butt hole was as tight

38:39.720 --> 38:41.400
as a little boys

38:41.400 --> 38:43.400
But then you wouldn't even

38:43.400 --> 38:48.440
I don't know what's going on behind my back. All she said is like use most most colonic

38:49.080 --> 38:52.120
Doctors use well, she's not a doctor, but most colonic

38:52.680 --> 38:55.880
She's just a person I met at a bar somewhere

38:57.240 --> 39:00.040
She said she does tarot readings and then right right right

39:00.600 --> 39:04.840
And then weirdly, but I use a child whether it's the fool or the death guard. She's like, you know what that means

39:04.920 --> 39:06.840
She's saying you got a lot of extra shit

39:06.840 --> 39:11.080
She said I'm I'm going to give you the child one because that's better than the adult one

39:11.080 --> 39:14.360
But your thing is that you think it was supposed to be more like a little because it's

39:14.920 --> 39:18.520
More like a little boys penis. Well, not a little girls

39:22.120 --> 39:27.160
You think the colonic instrument is is built on being a dick girth. Yeah

39:28.440 --> 39:30.440
Well, I mean

39:30.680 --> 39:36.280
Maybe I I'm just assuming I just I don't know how I've never had a colonic

39:36.280 --> 39:38.280
So like did they they're great

39:40.120 --> 39:42.680
But you sound attentive you said it was only pretty good

39:43.640 --> 39:47.800
They're pretty I and it wasn't too bad. It was all right. I like I mean like I

39:48.840 --> 39:55.240
I mean I feel a lot healthier. Do they insert the instrument up your butt? Yes, I got and so you got the baby one

39:55.560 --> 39:57.800
I got the baby one because of your delicious

39:58.520 --> 40:01.400
Well, no, she didn't she's your words not mine

40:01.400 --> 40:08.600
She well, she's something I really love she said other my colleagues use a larger gauge

40:09.240 --> 40:10.840
of

40:10.840 --> 40:12.840
animator

40:13.960 --> 40:19.720
The the animator. Yeah, because the enema of my enema is my friend

40:22.360 --> 40:25.480
I keep my I keep my enema's close. Yeah

40:26.440 --> 40:28.440
I keep my emanator even closer

40:28.440 --> 40:33.080
Friends keep your enema's closer with the new triple gauge animator

40:37.880 --> 40:42.600
No, okay, so really you're not giving us any of the information that we actually want which is

40:43.480 --> 40:45.480
Why what what did you do?

40:46.280 --> 40:48.280
What does a person that goes and gets a colonic?

40:48.840 --> 40:54.440
What are they experiencing that makes them want to go get one? I I have a parasite. You have a parasite

40:54.440 --> 41:02.040
Yeah, I'm trying to get rid of all the the grabboids in my intestinal tract. What the fuck for you millennials

41:02.120 --> 41:04.120
Those are the monsters from tremors. Yes

41:06.840 --> 41:08.840
No, I

41:08.920 --> 41:13.640
I've got a parasite. You got a sandworm in your butt. I have a sandworm in my butt

41:13.960 --> 41:16.920
Now am I in my intestinal tract? What is it a tapeworm?

41:17.560 --> 41:23.080
It could be I don't know I'm not necessarily sure but I've been I've been taking like massive amounts of I haven't been

41:23.080 --> 41:25.080
I haven't been very well

41:25.560 --> 41:29.800
How could you have been you have been since the age of

41:31.160 --> 41:35.080
30 like like obsessed with cleaning your butthole

41:35.160 --> 41:42.040
Yes, to the point where you've scalded it in the past and we've we just go back through the archive. We've covered this several times

41:42.760 --> 41:47.880
Meanwhile, I could be said certainly that superman's lex luther like I

41:49.000 --> 41:51.320
I am I am not from that planet

41:51.320 --> 41:57.800
I if anything I push the limits of right of of of of of of what you should do when like I

41:58.120 --> 42:02.360
But you gave yourself an accidental some cavemen. We've transported through time

42:03.080 --> 42:05.720
Observing me for a week would go dude

42:07.880 --> 42:10.920
It's a butt you got to wipe it more than that

42:11.880 --> 42:14.600
You're gonna go back out and collaborate with your friends

42:15.240 --> 42:20.840
You gave yourself an accidental colonic in your bathtub back in the day. Yes. I did that will I will never forget it

42:20.840 --> 42:22.040
Yeah, yeah, I

42:22.040 --> 42:23.320
accidental

42:23.320 --> 42:24.280
how

42:24.280 --> 42:29.880
Accidental because I had jets in my tub that I was excited to use. I bought a new house. There were jets

42:29.880 --> 42:32.680
So your ass was up against the side of the tub

42:33.800 --> 42:35.560
Yeah, because well

42:35.560 --> 42:37.560
Yeah, but well dot dot dot

42:38.280 --> 42:44.840
Explain that what is it? No, I did I've explained it on the podcast. I mean, it's I look I'm not he would jerk off

42:44.840 --> 42:48.760
But he would get his butt up against the jet and it wasn't an accident. No, it wasn't

42:48.760 --> 42:53.400
But put his ass up against the jet and then he was surprised that it was weird

42:53.960 --> 43:01.320
No, I I was surprised when water was strange off my asshole and filled me up like a water balloon

43:01.880 --> 43:06.840
Because because before that all it did was tickle the rim and make me happier

43:09.560 --> 43:13.640
But then one day I like I just I flew too close to the sun as Jeff said and I

43:13.640 --> 43:18.760
And I was like I was scissoring and like like I you know you

43:19.400 --> 43:21.000
You you get used to shit

43:21.000 --> 43:25.240
This is why I'm afraid to fly because the guys in the cockpit like it's like how soon

43:25.800 --> 43:30.760
You start to take technology for granted like like like you know these guys are like, how do you know the guy in the

43:30.760 --> 43:35.560
You don't know what they're doing in the cockpit the doors closed. They could be treating it like a DVR. They're just like

43:36.360 --> 43:40.280
Yeah, I don't know it usually does this and I was like so oh, yeah

43:40.280 --> 43:44.440
So I had gotten accustomed to like okay. Yeah a little jet on my little I'm a little poo poo

43:45.720 --> 43:49.000
He ain't hurt no one like no, it's like ain't nobody's business

43:49.080 --> 43:51.800
But your own little stimulation down there where there's some extra nerve

43:51.960 --> 43:58.040
Also, you you were super excited back then because you were taking baths daily. Yeah, you were the you were and that's why you were shining

43:58.040 --> 44:00.040
Like the Chrysler building. Yes

44:00.120 --> 44:05.320
This is a lot of people die hard fans are like why am I being punished for being a fan? I know all this, you know

44:05.320 --> 44:10.920
It's like like like like like we need a little Stanley in the corner to just like have it be on the video feed

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
with a him coming up and going like

44:13.080 --> 44:15.080
Web heads will remember that

44:15.320 --> 44:22.760
Yeah, Dan got a tub and was fucking jerking off like a crazy person like and had discovered like jets on his butthole

44:23.160 --> 44:28.840
And then one day I was like I went too far and the setting was too high and it just like it's that difference

44:28.840 --> 44:34.440
You know when you take a water balloon and like you can if you hold it underneath the faucet just turn on the faucet

44:34.440 --> 44:38.360
Like no water's gonna go in that water balloon and then there's that day with that moment

44:38.360 --> 44:42.680
Like I just like all of a sudden and it's like a binary thing. It's either happening or not

44:43.080 --> 44:46.520
And like it was just like all of a sudden. I was like, oh, yeah

44:48.360 --> 44:50.120
like

44:50.120 --> 44:51.960
it was like

44:51.960 --> 44:56.040
There's there's probably people in the audience who know who are more who are more

44:57.560 --> 45:02.600
You know, they they take their butt for more of a ride, you know, like like they're more they're more experts in this

45:02.600 --> 45:08.600
Kind of off-roading thing. They're like, yeah, I know exactly what happened. Your v8 got in the front wheel drive and

45:09.320 --> 45:11.320
Like that happened to me in Kentucky

45:12.120 --> 45:13.720
on a four-wheeler and

45:13.720 --> 45:19.640
But I was like this was the I was I was just I was a newcomer to the whole involving the button anything other than

45:19.880 --> 45:22.600
Than the the just the for a sharpie. Yeah

45:24.280 --> 45:27.880
And so all of a sudden I had the sensation that I've never had before which is which was the

45:28.760 --> 45:31.320
In reverse the sensation of pooping

45:31.320 --> 45:37.320
It was like all of a sudden there was just like all so so much like just filling me up

45:38.120 --> 45:40.120
In a place where I was like

45:40.440 --> 45:45.480
And I like got up out of the tub and like went over to the toilet instinctively and sat down on it

45:45.480 --> 45:52.600
And I was like and then it was just like flood came out and I was like, oh, I just gave myself an accidental enema

45:53.480 --> 45:57.160
And how did you feel it's pretty good pretty good?

45:57.160 --> 46:03.640
It was good. Has the show really become this easy?

46:05.320 --> 46:07.320
Fuck it

46:07.720 --> 46:09.720
Where are our standards anyway?

46:10.360 --> 46:12.360
It's it's emmy night folks

46:12.840 --> 46:16.520
All the craftsmen are at parties and crafts ladies

46:16.520 --> 46:24.680
Crafts ladies, um except for I guess ucp not doing so good

46:27.160 --> 46:34.200
When do you leave us for uh for uh lego january? Yeah, yes, you're gonna be gone for a while

46:35.480 --> 46:37.000
Two years

No

46:38.280 --> 46:40.280
Where are you guys shooting now shooting?

46:42.280 --> 46:44.280
It's it in vancouver

46:44.280 --> 46:47.160
Canada, you know

46:48.920 --> 46:51.560
Do you think it's only two hours away you'll come visit right?

46:52.360 --> 46:55.400
What's up with those delays we read about in the trades? What did you do wrong?

46:56.360 --> 47:01.720
Uh, I don't know what you're talking about and I can't say anything about it. It was in the papers. It said lego movie

47:02.280 --> 47:04.440
Going to fucking delayed fucking

47:05.080 --> 47:07.080
Uh director, uh on

47:07.720 --> 47:09.720
colonic

47:09.720 --> 47:14.040
I'm taking I'm taking a year off for uh massive colonics

47:14.920 --> 47:18.040
A tune-up like chevy a tune-up. Yeah, just a tune-up

47:18.760 --> 47:19.880
tune-up

47:19.880 --> 47:27.480
I like I mean look if he's in rehab, but in the article I read she said chevy was going in for alcohol related problems

47:28.760 --> 47:35.080
Alcoholism. Yeah. Yeah, he did however somebody pointed out. He did leave a very uh very concise

47:35.080 --> 47:39.400
Uh, I think chevy, you know, like he would he's the last person to

47:40.040 --> 47:47.160
What if you if you listed his crimes or or bad qualities that would definitely not on that list would be

47:47.800 --> 47:49.000
like

47:49.000 --> 47:55.560
Uh shame like he's not like he would he loves as long as it's funny like he'll share stuff and kind of guy

47:55.560 --> 48:01.240
I don't think it was his idea to like downplay it or or welly and double speak the idea of going into rehab because he left a

48:01.240 --> 48:05.720
uh, it was on his uh, what's that dumb thing that's like to twitter for

48:06.680 --> 48:13.720
Celebrities who say like like it's like, oh you're famous. Why should you do what normal people do like like that?

48:14.280 --> 48:16.440
That that that selfie you took might be worth money one day

48:17.080 --> 48:22.120
Don't give that away. Isn't that what that thing is? I don't know. Did I just get sardonic about something for no reason?

48:23.320 --> 48:27.480
All I know is it was it was like a little paragraph and he said uh, I'm going in because

48:27.480 --> 48:31.240
My love of vodka needs to be something I am paraphrasing

48:31.320 --> 48:33.960
But it was it was it was it was all very clear

48:34.280 --> 48:39.880
He's like I'm going in because my my family's I don't want them to have to worry about me and like like all that stuff

48:39.880 --> 48:43.080
I don't know how that tune-up stuff. That's probably some spokesman who

48:44.280 --> 48:49.160
Trying to do their job the right way trying to protect and all this stuff and mitigate like and then it gets

48:49.400 --> 48:53.400
Then that becomes the funny thing. It's like get this he's going in for a tune-up

48:54.360 --> 48:56.360
Why are you sitting over there? Why did you go?

48:56.360 --> 49:02.200
Are you like the new Spencer? Is that the they no, I'm I'm the old Rob

49:05.240 --> 49:07.240
No, don't like that's what you're doing like I

49:08.440 --> 49:15.160
That was don't feel bad. No, it isn't bad sir. It's it's very good. Oh, oh god

49:16.440 --> 49:19.080
Okay, all right. I like it over here

49:19.880 --> 49:21.880
I don't okay

49:22.040 --> 49:24.360
I don't I don't I don't like don't fight me

49:24.360 --> 49:26.360
I

49:37.160 --> 49:39.560
Because every day is sixth grade for me. That's

49:41.800 --> 49:45.720
Finally now I can I suck at that trough?

49:45.720 --> 49:55.560
I don't like that the flight attendant welcomes you to the city that you're arriving in with them

49:56.680 --> 49:58.680
It just seems

49:58.920 --> 50:01.640
It's just a little bit of a needless mindfuckie like

50:02.520 --> 50:05.960
Bullying thing. Yeah, I'll call it what it is bullying

50:07.400 --> 50:12.840
Why is it why is it welcome to Chicago and it's like you just got here too motherfucker?

50:12.840 --> 50:20.440
Why is that bullying though, why is that bullying because the unspoken part of that is you'd newbie

50:21.640 --> 50:28.680
You piece of shit that would that if the plane crashed would fall for the float cushion thing while I sprung out in a

50:29.640 --> 50:31.640
inspector gadget parachute

50:32.520 --> 50:34.520
You might be reading into that a little

50:34.520 --> 50:40.920
You might might be reading into that. I think they're just trying to be nice to you

50:43.720 --> 50:47.320
Welcome to welcome to Chicago. They say yeah, yeah, they

50:48.120 --> 50:52.280
I also don't like I guess I guess there's no direct flights from Los Angeles to Milwaukee

50:52.280 --> 50:55.880
But I get and I I was like it's a real drag like you can't for real. Yeah

50:56.120 --> 50:59.080
No, wow, but I guess that's I was thinking I was thinking about it

50:59.080 --> 51:02.840
I was like well, okay, so we're flying from LA to phoenix and then from phoenix to Milwaukee and that's

51:02.840 --> 51:08.680
That might be better. I guess because like well if you're flying from Los Angeles to Milwaukee

51:09.640 --> 51:11.080
like

51:11.080 --> 51:14.520
Statistically speaking like the reason for that is that something's gone wrong

51:17.080 --> 51:23.000
Southwest I think I think southwest goes direct is the only direct flight to Milwaukee, but they suck

51:23.800 --> 51:25.960
Are the other ones that do the comedy the con?

51:26.120 --> 51:31.800
Yes, they they do like the the the fucking Muppet voices and donald duck shit

51:31.800 --> 51:37.960
It's just a piece of shit. It's like a bus with wings. They just like oh hey get on board

51:38.280 --> 51:40.840
I hope you get a seat and somebody's sitting on the floor

51:41.800 --> 51:45.320
There's two people with chickens next to you. It's the worst

51:45.800 --> 51:49.240
I got on a plane a few days ago. Where was I coming back from I forget?

51:50.120 --> 51:52.120
and I was

51:52.120 --> 51:54.600
I walked up to the gate right at boarding time

51:54.600 --> 51:58.120
I didn't know if I was late or earlier or whatever and I said that are you boarding?

51:58.120 --> 52:02.840
Uh, yeah priority. Are you priority? I'm like, yeah, I'm first class. I got on

52:03.080 --> 52:08.120
I was the first person on the plane. I didn't know that was not intentional. I thought maybe I was a couple minutes late

52:08.920 --> 52:10.920
I found a $20 bill

52:11.400 --> 52:13.640
On the jet bridge like a little walkway

52:14.120 --> 52:17.240
And I just went at doing can if I can put that in the old pocket

52:17.320 --> 52:18.600
Okay, all right

52:18.600 --> 52:22.840
And I get on the plane and then there's two flight attendants there and they're like, oh, are we boarding already?

52:22.840 --> 52:28.360
I didn't realize we were boarding. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, we're right up right this way. Like where'd you see like I'm in 2a

52:28.760 --> 52:33.080
And I sat down and like I was the very first person on so it wasn't like somebody was on that plane

52:33.080 --> 52:35.800
I dropped that money. Maybe it was one of the flight attendants. I don't know

52:36.520 --> 52:39.960
Um, so I'm sitting there and I got the $20 in my pocket

52:40.680 --> 52:43.240
And we get up we get in the air

52:43.800 --> 52:48.760
And the the flight attendant comes down through all the people in first class. Hey, did somebody drop $20?

52:48.760 --> 52:50.760
I

52:51.080 --> 52:53.240
Meaning like we're like, I was like, no

52:55.080 --> 52:59.560
I I did not drop $20. I did the opposite of dropping well, I did

53:01.320 --> 53:03.240
But I was like

53:03.240 --> 53:05.240
That meant it was hers, right?

53:05.240 --> 53:09.640
But she was trying to lay a little trap there like no, I found $20 and she would go mine

53:10.520 --> 53:12.040
I don't know. I don't know

53:12.040 --> 53:13.480
But like

53:13.480 --> 53:20.280
Did somebody else drop $20 too? It was very confusing. She's like, I lost $20. Well, I know if I ask if anyone found it

53:20.280 --> 53:22.760
The answer will be no, but maybe if I say

53:23.400 --> 53:25.400
Has anyone lost 20

53:25.400 --> 53:29.960
Somebody would go. Oh, I feel so guilty. It's like I wouldn't you're supposed to yell fire instead

53:29.960 --> 53:31.960
But then I went I went and bought my girlfriend

53:32.520 --> 53:34.280
cigarettes with it

53:34.280 --> 53:36.280
$20 cigarettes

53:36.760 --> 53:38.760
I got her a couple how long are they?

53:38.760 --> 53:43.560
They're the extra longs

53:44.600 --> 53:49.000
But then she we walked out and she goes, you know that like that that was counterfeit

53:49.880 --> 53:53.480
I'm like, what she's like. It was it was printed all wrong. The borders were all fucked up

53:54.200 --> 53:57.320
I think I think I've picked up and stole and

53:59.160 --> 54:01.160
I think like like like like some like

54:02.120 --> 54:08.120
Some major awesome like criminal was like taking that plane and was dropping counterfeit 20s

54:08.120 --> 54:11.960
Like they like a bullet hole in his duffel bag or hers

54:14.840 --> 54:18.120
Like like like was was like hemorrhaging counterfeit 20s or something

54:18.120 --> 54:18.680
Yeah, yeah

54:18.680 --> 54:24.280
And that and that so that it was that that you found one and then someone else found another one

54:24.280 --> 54:28.120
It was like a summer drop in 20s all over the place and there's like a guy bleeding out and then

54:28.680 --> 54:30.920
In coach the guy just another martini

54:32.680 --> 54:35.000
No, no, haven't seen any errands 20s

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Because he got shot

54:37.000 --> 54:44.120
Yeah, I don't know. I'm not gonna make up the whole to live in die in LA kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah to live in die in LA

54:44.280 --> 54:47.640
Yeah, fine. I'm derivative. All right, but wow

54:49.480 --> 54:54.040
So defensive. Yeah, you're not just came back from Milwaukee. I have like a lot of like

54:55.000 --> 54:58.680
I got along with my mom for two days. So now I'm back here and I'm like, what'd you mean by that?

54:58.680 --> 55:00.680
What'd you mean by that? What'd you mean by that?

55:00.680 --> 55:07.000
I had to go somewhere it is an amazing city because like I met the nicest people and like just like

55:07.880 --> 55:09.400
Like people that were there to see my show

55:09.400 --> 55:11.960
But also our fans of Harmontown or rick and morty, whatever

55:12.280 --> 55:16.920
There is this awesome openness and sweetness to the Midwest and to Milwaukee in particular

55:17.320 --> 55:19.320
But also a lot of like weird like

55:20.360 --> 55:25.240
Not not shame or self. It was just so self-effacing, right? Yes. Yeah, you're yes

55:25.240 --> 55:29.240
They they they they they diminish themselves in your eyes

55:32.280 --> 55:35.240
Yes, because the people who draw focus get kicked out

55:37.480 --> 55:43.400
Of Milwaukee, uh, like me and Trump. No, it's it. Yeah, it's like it's it's it's very similar

55:43.400 --> 55:50.040
I mean, it's geographically and I think genetically and culturally and psychologically and spiritually like a very close cousin to Canada

55:50.040 --> 55:53.800
I mean, it's like you're you're right up there. You're you're a hop skip and a jump

55:53.800 --> 55:59.000
You're in a very cool. You're in a climate that's like inhospitable like you're in God's crosshairs

55:59.160 --> 56:03.160
If you if you if you get cocky then the question becomes why are you so cocky?

56:03.160 --> 56:07.720
Why don't you go somewhere warm? So the answer has to be don't get cocky don't get cocky

56:07.800 --> 56:09.800
that has to be the mantra of

56:09.800 --> 56:11.800
Of a more seasonal climate

56:12.360 --> 56:17.000
And and Milwaukee's like that. So so on the surface of it. There's this wonderful

56:17.720 --> 56:22.040
Humility and and camaraderie fraternity or sorority

56:22.040 --> 56:29.720
You are fucking nailing it today. I'm fucking like I I'm I'm inclusiving the fuck out of tonight

56:31.400 --> 56:35.960
Like tomorrow's uh headlines are gonna be like Dean Harmon included everybody

56:37.000 --> 56:45.720
After the fact. Yeah. Well, is it yeah asterisks were flying and and all benefited women were receiving their their alms

56:46.520 --> 56:48.520
um

56:48.520 --> 56:53.880
On the tails of sentences with a with a appendage. Uh uh, uh, um

56:55.480 --> 57:03.880
Caps were doffed to the fairer sex at a speed uh comparable only to the bionic uh, uh, advocate

57:07.160 --> 57:09.640
Of a lesser known franchise from the seventies

57:09.640 --> 57:21.640
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him with an understanding that women are human.

57:21.640 --> 57:23.560
Take that corrupt lumberjack.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.920
You could have been a woman.

57:25.920 --> 57:26.920
Or lumberjill.

57:26.920 --> 57:27.920
All right.

57:27.920 --> 57:28.920
He plussed it.

57:28.920 --> 57:29.920
Wait.

57:29.920 --> 57:30.920
No.

57:30.920 --> 57:31.920
What is that?

57:31.920 --> 57:32.920
Okay.

57:32.920 --> 57:44.920
Well, yeah, if you're there for, I mean, it's like the surface of that Milwaukee thing.

57:44.920 --> 57:45.920
It's really beautiful.

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
I understand.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.120
It's a great city.

57:48.120 --> 57:49.200
It's by a great lake.

57:49.200 --> 57:50.920
It's a great place by a great lake.

57:50.920 --> 57:52.920
That's so dumb.

57:52.920 --> 57:56.400
It's a great place by a great lake?

57:56.400 --> 57:57.400
Yeah.

57:57.400 --> 57:58.400
Okay.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.400
I mean, what do you want?

57:59.400 --> 58:00.400
All right.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.200
I wanted a better motto.

58:02.200 --> 58:07.320
We can't just say, we make the beer.

58:07.320 --> 58:08.520
Because we largely don't anymore.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.080
They don't make the beer.

58:10.080 --> 58:11.080
Yeah.

58:11.080 --> 58:20.440
Anyways, underneath it, because it comes from, I think, self-loathing, so there's like benefits

58:20.440 --> 58:26.800
to, there's a cushion on top of you when you arrange yourself around a religion of humility.

58:26.800 --> 58:28.840
Like, you're like, who am I to say?

58:28.840 --> 58:29.840
Who am I?

58:29.840 --> 58:31.280
That's like a very Midwestern thing.

58:31.280 --> 58:32.280
Like, what do I know?

58:32.280 --> 58:33.280
And all this stuff.

58:33.280 --> 58:36.800
But that doesn't automatically make you a good person.

58:36.800 --> 58:41.320
And it doesn't automatically mean a conversation with you, like everyone walks away not having

58:41.320 --> 58:42.640
their soul stolen.

58:42.640 --> 58:47.280
Like, because when that's your religion, it's like also like, well, then it's, you have

58:47.280 --> 58:48.880
to kind of question everything.

58:48.880 --> 58:50.200
You have to question all ambition.

58:50.200 --> 58:55.960
You have to question, and there's no such thing as a typical anything, so don't get offended

58:55.960 --> 58:58.320
if you're listening in Milwaukee and going, this isn't me.

58:58.320 --> 58:59.520
You don't understand anything.

58:59.520 --> 59:04.200
I'm just talking about a artificial construct, a median.

59:04.200 --> 59:08.560
But that's my, that's my kind of feeling about that compass is like, oh yeah, on one hand,

59:08.560 --> 59:13.080
like I'm so grateful I grew up somewhere where you're, it's a crime to think that you're

59:13.080 --> 59:14.080
all that.

59:14.080 --> 59:18.800
Like it's just a straight up fucking social crime that especially back then was like way

59:18.800 --> 59:25.240
higher than when we were still just, when the definition of feminism was still believing

59:25.240 --> 59:26.880
women can do better.

59:26.880 --> 59:32.600
The, the, the, the, it was like, we first and foremost were like, don't get cocky.

59:32.600 --> 59:38.200
Like, your friend, your old friend and now my new ish friend, Dave Friedel, his toes

59:38.200 --> 59:39.200
are falling off.

59:39.200 --> 59:40.680
Like he's got no toes on one of his feet.

59:40.680 --> 59:46.800
He has, we call him Friedel and now he has several free toes.

59:46.800 --> 59:47.800
And his 9-11.

59:47.800 --> 59:48.800
All right.

59:48.800 --> 59:54.560
Don't cheer that, a lot of people died.

59:54.560 --> 59:59.240
He, he, a lot of people died in that day.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240
Don't, don't share it.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240
Please don't share it.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240
But Friedel.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.240
Defensive.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:08.240
Friedel handles that with such like, I don't get why people were cheering.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.840
They were like, ooh, woo, woo, yeah.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.360
Our, our, our audience, Rob, I don't know if you know this is mostly Al-Qaeda.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.560
We got a couple, we got a couple Isis.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.800
That's mostly old school, just straight up Taliban.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800
Actually.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.880
That's why I, I, I have, I have Al-Qaeda, like parasites.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.800
That's why I was doing the, I think that was Candida though.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.640
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.640
Candida?

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640
What?

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640
What?

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:47.200
Do you think there's places in like, like little cloisters where, where like like sleeper

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.520
cells or caves or whatever we're supposed to, wherever the people that are like the,

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.640
the Adams family, the, the Nermatology that like, the, the, the, uh, like, uh, does you

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.280
think 9-11's like Cinco de Mayo?

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.280
Like they, like they kind of like, like it's more, like there's like, like there's kind

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.080
of like a little like, like there's a, do you think there's a color scheme?

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080
I think it's, I think it's just our audience.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.600
That's curious for 9-11.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.480
And thousands of people in New Jersey, thousands.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480
I saw it.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480
I saw it.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.480
And Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.360
Can we please get back to what we were talking about?

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.000
Can you believe that fucking guy?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
He's the best.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
He's the best.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Are we annoying you?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
With our birther's shit?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
So what is he?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
He's out of his mind.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
He's going to become my hero.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
He is the fucking, like just doing donuts.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Like, like, like, like there's only a, there's a certain point where he becomes a Duke of

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Hazard.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.560
And it's like, you go from like, oh, you're lying piece of shit and then all of a sudden

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.560
you just go, wait.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.320
The Duke of Hazard.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.520
I'd like to see that prequel.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.120
Ladies and gentlemen, the Duke of Hazard.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.280
Ladies and gentlemen, I, I am the Duke of Hazard.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.120
I, here's Sergeant Lee, my car.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120
Sergeant?

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.320
Oh, he was back before he was a general.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.720
Before he was a general.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.640
But I didn't know that, that, that General Lee was originally an enlisted car.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640
Yes.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.640
He rose the ranks all the way.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.640
Holy shit.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.640
Did you see that giant cockroach?

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.640
Giant cockroach.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.640
Fucking crawling on the wall.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.960
Anybody see that in the front?

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.360
That if it, if I could see it from here, I'm further back than you.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360
Am I in danger?

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360
Was it by me?

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360
What happened?

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360
No, it was crawling on the red wall.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.240
It's over by, it's, it's over by Steve Levy's head.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.920
It's probably an important time to announce that the, the meltdown is opening a restaurant.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.360
The, the, the, the, the patty meltdown.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.280
That was a big fucking cockroach.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.440
The patty meltdown.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.560
That was a big cockroach.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.720
That was a, that was a big enough cockroach that that might have been a bat.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.720
Yeah.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.720
Like, we're not sure.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.720
That was like a shadow.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.920
It was bigger than my thumb.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920
I'll tell you that.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920
I don't like bugs.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920
I don't like them.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.920
I had a spider go into my ear one time and I almost lost my fucking mind.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.920
What?

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.200
You told, you told the story of the podcast before you, yeah, yeah.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.200
But in the control room, you don't have to worry.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.200
It went up in diagonal.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.200
So it's above your heads.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200
Yeah.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.200
Don't worry about it.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.200
Yeah, don't worry.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.200
It might just descend on you at a moment's notice.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.560
It would have to be, it would have to be a tremendously heavy, unwieldy cockroach to

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560
fall on you.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.560
It would, it would, it's body would have to have so much mass that it's, it's legs

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.200
designed to anchor itself in, in the ceiling would, would be, would be unable to do so.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.120
And that's a roach that would just be off the grid, a rogue roach.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.760
If there's one of them, there's like a thousand more in the wall.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.760
A thousand.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.400
None with, none with nothing to lose, like that one.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.000
You guys are about to get creep shot.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.680
Also, that, that cockroach is, I think like one day away from retirement.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680
Right.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.680
Having hunted itself to near extinction, like having, having, having, having boxed out

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.200
all the other roaches by beating them to the dried droplets of milk under every refrigerator.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.400
And now it's just like, I don't, I have nowhere to go.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.280
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like the hustler.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.480
Like I was like, there's no Minnesota fats out here for me.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.480
And it's just like, now it's just climbing walls, like a spider.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.880
It's just kind of like, what do I do, eat a bird now?

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.720
Do I, do I discover fire?

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.000
I think I've got like six hours left in my lifespan, I, I'm, I'm, I'm bursting with

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
babies.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.760
I, I should probably just, I should probably just fall into Steve Levy's hair backstage.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.760
Yeah.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.760
All right.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.760
Or write that book.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.760
Got to write that book.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.760
Got to write that book.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.760
Oh, write that book.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:33.240
Oh, you know, if I could give the cockroach any advice, write the book.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240
Write the book.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240
Write the book.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240
You have all the time in the world.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.320
You think you've got more time than you do.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.320
You do not.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.320
I'll go further than that.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.320
Work with a collaborator because you're busy.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.320
You're a busy cockroach.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320
Yeah.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:48.280
You're, you're, you're, you're running Rick and Morty, you're trying to, you're not

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280
a cockroach.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.920
Like how, it's not a ghost writer.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.920
It's not the same thing.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.240
It's a person that's there to help keep you on target and like move you along.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.040
Are you, how's your book coming along dad?

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.040
Very well.

01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.040
What's your book?

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.400
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.080
What, what are you talking about?

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080
I care.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.080
I don't know.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080
Will you tell me later?

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.080
What's it about?

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080
I don't know man.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080
I'm making it up as I go.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080
It's just a book.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:15.560
I'm like, oh, one time I fucking took a shit in a tree and then I'm like, oh, here's a

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.200
10 funny ways to make a pound cake.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.200
I don't know.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.400
It's like this print is dead.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400
You just make shit up.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400
You took a shit in a tree?

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400
Yeah.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400
Oh, no, or did I?

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.400
Maybe I'm just trying to move books.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.400
I don't know.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.000
I don't even know who I am anymore.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.520
I've become more brand than you.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.380
What's the, what's the title of the, the book?

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.760
What is the title of the book, Dan?

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.760
You do that last.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.960
It's called the, it's called the, the Pupin Tree.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.960
I'll put it on the show.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.520
You do that last?

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.040
You come up with the title last.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.760
Who does?

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.080
The Royal U. The person writing the book.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.440
You go, you, you write the book and then you go, now what should this be called?

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.800
That's what, how it happens?

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.300
Yeah.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.480
In my opinion, if you're doing it right, yeah.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.480
Okay.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.480
Well, okay.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.000
Here's a, here's an example of why not, why to do it that way.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.320
The alternative would be, okay, I'm going to write a book and it's going to be called

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.680
The Boy Who Fought a Shark.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.680
Okay.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.680
All right.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.680
So then you start writing.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680
Okay.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.680
Once upon a time there was a boy.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.680
Oh, and then he went to the beach.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.680
Oh.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.680
Oh, and then he fought a shark.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.680
Okay.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.680
What?

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.680
What?

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.680
Wow.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.680
Page one.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.680
He fights the shark on page one.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.680
He fights the shark?

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.680
He went to the beach and he fought a shark.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.680
So now you're like, I'm fucked.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.680
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.680
And then you're like, here's the thing about fighting a shark.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.680
And then you're like, God damn it.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.680
God damn it.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.200
And then you're like, just the title fucked you.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200
Just light.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200
Right.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.200
And then you come up with a name later.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.200
Right, right, right.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.200
I shouldn't have to tell you guys this.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.440
You shouldn't, you shouldn't tell me it.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.520
If the book was done now, what would it be called?

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:52.480
Two paragraphs about my grade school principal.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480
You're only two paragraphs.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.480
And other stories.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.080
And other ways to date in this modern world.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.680
No, I don't know.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.320
It would be called, no, I'm not going to, there is a conceit to it.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:08.160
I'm not going to tell you because that's, when did the show become you guys violating

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.160
my NDAs?

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.160
All right.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:16.320
That's always been our show.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:23.240
You know, my favorite scene in the Steve Jobs movie is the, it's the one, thank you.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.760
It's the one where he's like, where he, where he's, he's, he's on his deathbed.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.760
It's very tender scene.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.080
And he's got, and he goes like, wait, one more thing, spoilers.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.880
You should, you should be able to hold the send button down halfway.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.240
And then, and if you push it too hard, you, you have to start over.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:45.040
And then, but if you, then if you swipe up, you can send confetti.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:51.720
And they're like, holy shit, right up to the bitter end, that guy with the fucking ideas.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.760
He just told us the ending balloons, balloons confetti of you, but then if you swipe right

01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:03.760
balloons, say the apples lost its grip a little bit, but I'm still buying the thing.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.160
Did you get the new phone?

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.160
Uh, it's common, but I'm talking, you know, have you installed the new software?

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160
Yes.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.160
Do you have the new software?

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.440
I don't think so.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.480
Can you see balloons and confetti when I send them to you?

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.480
No.

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.480
Yeah.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.480
You got to get that.

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:24.320
How's your eye watch, your Apple watch?

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.320
At the office.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.320
Yeah.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320
Yeah.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.080
That didn't, didn't, didn't stick.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:35.880
It seemed really cool that I had that Apple watch seemed really cool.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.880
Speaking, speaking.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880
It seemed so cool.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880
It was cool.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.680
Like it was like a little, a little phone on your wrist, but it was connected to your

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.680
phone.

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.680
Right.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.680
Is that how it was?

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:47.680
Yes.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:57.680
Apple watch seemed kind of cool.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.680
Seemed kind of cool.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.680
Yeah.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:10.240
Well, I, yeah, I got into a rhythm of every time I believe these people, I get my life

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.240
improves.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.040
These people, you know, that changes.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040
These people.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.040
Yes.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.040
I mean, it's the Apple people.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:26.280
Yeah, the Apple people, Dan Harmon, we're coming to your house.

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280
We are the Apple people.

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.160
We have this new watch we want to show you.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.040
It seems kind of cool.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.200
How would you like to wear it for maybe nine episodes?

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.280
How did you get in here?

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:46.440
In 209, I'm sorry, I just wanted to talk to Dan Harmon for a second.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440
Apple people.

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.440
Apple people.

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440
Yes.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.440
You're in violation of the United States ordinance.

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.440
Oh shit.

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440
3524.

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.440
Oh shit.

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440
I dropped the gun.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.440
I dropped the gun.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440
I'm dropping it.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.440
Jesus Christ.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440
No.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.440
No.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.440
You have nine seconds to comply.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440
Just let me go.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440
I have a wife and children.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440
Seven.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440
Please.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440
Six.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.440
Please don't.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.440
Five.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440
Jesus, somebody.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440
Four.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.440
Six.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.440
Help me.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440
Oh my God.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.440
Two.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.440
One.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.440
Oh shit.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.440
Oh right.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.440
Go ahead.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.440
Oh.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.440
What?

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.440
Oh.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440
Called you bluff.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:28.440
I forgot my gun.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.920
I'm only a prototype in 209 on trespassing duty.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.840
I'm just supposed to roar at people and give them 10 seconds to comply.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.440
It's okay.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.560
I overstepped my bounds as an Apple person.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.560
It's not you.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.560
The system is flawed.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.680
There's a direct implication that forces me involved and yet I can't back it up.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.520
Don't go there.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.520
You're not flawed.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.360
The system's not flawed.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.120
I'm just as much to blame as you.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.440
Don't beat yourself up.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.440
Ed, come on.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.040
Sit on the couch with me for a second.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.040
I can't sit.

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:12.040
Or climb stairs.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:18.520
I was in the break room yesterday and I heard the only reason I'm being manufactured is

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:25.520
because of interference with a much more progressive anthropomorphized RoboCop project.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:30.880
Now don't talk like that, Edward, please.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.880
That's not.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880
You know something?

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.880
I'm a piece of shit.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:34.880
No you're not.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880
A cautionary tale.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
No you're not.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880
Look at your mirror right now.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.880
Look at the mirror.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880
Look at that.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.440
You know when I look at your mirror, look at that.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.440
Look at you.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.560
All you need is to comb your hair just a little bit.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560
Look at that.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:52.280
Let's comb your hair and maybe let's flip this collar up.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.280
Look at that.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.280
Hey.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.280
Holy cow.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280
Who's this handsome guy?

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.280
Look at this guy.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.280
Yeah.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.280
Yeah.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:12.800
You are objectifying me using intimacy to make me feel better, but sending a larger message

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.000
that our bodies are what define us.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.560
You have 10 seconds to apologize.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.000
And I know you don't have a gun so this is all bullshit.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I tried to help you.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.720
I will hashtag this and people will find out.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.720
All right.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.720
You know, I thought you were a good person but you're-

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.720
Oh, yeah, okay, yeah, Twitter.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720
Yeah.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720
Okay.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.720
All right.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.720
Hey.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:36.720
Hey.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:37.720
Have a nice life.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.720
Fuckface.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.720
What?

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.720
Let's see.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:41.720
No.

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.720
No.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.720
You see.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:44.720
You're a piece of shit.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.840
And I didn't want to say this before but you're a fat ass fucking piece of fuck shit.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.840
You know?

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.840
You don't have a gun.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.840
You look like shit.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.040
You flipped your collar over.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.040
You looked worse.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.600
You suck every dick in this building.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:04.360
And I know because I talked to the person at the front counter.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.920
We all know.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.920
You suck.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920
Okay.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.680
So I tried to be nice to you.

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.800
This is why no one likes you because you're a fucking piece of shit.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.720
By the way, say hello to Periscope.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.720
Okay.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.720
Great.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720
Because you're being periscoped.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:21.720
Okay.

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.720
Oh no.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.720
Oh no.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.720
Facebook.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.720
Oh no.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.720
Oh no.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.720
Okay.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:28.720
Yeah.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.720
Oh no.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.720
The rain is over.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.720
Okay.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.720
Great.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.720
Goodbye.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.720
Goodbye.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.720
So.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.720
Goodbye.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.720
I'm closing the door.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.720
Dear Facebook.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.720
Is that how they started?

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:50.720
About 10 seconds ago I had a conversation with a colleague.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:58.720
We're not colleagues.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720
We're not colleagues.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.720
I just came to the door looking for Dan Harvey.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.720
We're not colleagues.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:08.720
At this moment I'm afraid for my safety.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.720
I have no guns.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:15.720
I was built for enforcement and I walk like a chicken.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.720
It's how I was made.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:24.720
And until recently I thought that was fine.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:37.720
To make a note about figuring out that reaction they felt like if they were lines crossed,

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.720
they were crossed before that.

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:46.720
Maybe I was being too nuanced or anyways.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.720
The video speaks for itself.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.720
This is what I have to deal with.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:58.720
And now I don't know what I'm going to do.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.720
Brrrrrr. Also.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:00.720
Brrrrrr. I also have no hands. Hello.

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.720
Hello Ed.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.720
This is your mother.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720
Mom you're on speaker.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.720
I don't have fingers.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.720
So I just typed... the phone.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.720
Your father and I want to know if you're coming over this weekend.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:16.720
Mom I'm going through some shit.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.720
Why are you going..

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.720
What are you talking about?

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.720
Just let us know.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.720
It's a simple question.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.720
All you have to do is say are you coming over?

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.720
It's never a simple question with you.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.720
I need support right now.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.720
I just need to know if I should.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:39.720
I need to....

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:40.720
I need to defrost the potato salad.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.720
And I have to start on Thursday because it's like a block of ice over here.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.720
So are you coming or not?

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.720
If you're not coming it's fine.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.720
You know you don't.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.720
There's only so many years left with your father.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.720
But you know if you don't want to.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.720
If you don't want to come over it's fine.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.720
Mom.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.720
Mom.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.720
Yes.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.720
You don't recognize that as blackmail.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:03.720
You don't recognize what you just did as emotional blackmail.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720
I do.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.720
You have 10 seconds to acknowledge.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:08.720
Everything.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.720
I don't even.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.720
You are a toxic person.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.720
Everything is 10 seconds with you.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.720
Everything is 10 seconds with you.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.720
When all I want is 24 hours on the weekend.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.720
During that 24 hours what are you going to say?

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:23.720
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:24.720
Well.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.720
When the answer is complicated.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.720
Yes.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.720
Well.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.720
I mean it just seems you know.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.720
You know that you know you're the top military item of the next year.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:40.720
And it just seems you should have a boyfriend at least.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:41.720
Something.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:42.720
You know.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.720
I don't expect you to understand when you talk like that.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.720
That you're hurting me.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.720
I don't know how to explain it.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.720
Oh.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.720
I'm so terrible.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.720
I'm so terrible.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.720
I didn't say that.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.720
I'm so terrible.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.720
William.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.720
William.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.720
William.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.720
Will you hear this?

01:16:58.720 --> 01:16:59.720
Will you hear this?

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.720
There's something saying to me right now.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.720
William.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.720
William.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.720
Will you get on?

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720
Ask him if he's coming over.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.720
Just ask him if he's coming over.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.720
I already did William.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:14.720
And he said he's going through some SHIT right now.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.720
And I just you know all I wanted to know was to get a little bit of fair warning.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:27.720
Tell him I ironically said he has 10 seconds to fucking grow a pair.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.720
Yes.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.720
Edward, would you please answer your father?

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720
Yes.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.720
Yes.

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.720
I'll come for Thanksgiving.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720
Thank you.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.720
Okay.

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.720
All right.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.720
Now I'm going to go mow the lawn.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.720
Okay.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.720
William.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.720
William.

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.720
What's the matter?

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.720
William.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.720
What's going on over there?

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720
Oh, honey.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.720
Honey, no.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.720
William.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.720
William, no.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.720
What's happening?

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.720
Is dad okay?

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.720
Oh.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.720
William.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.720
Oh.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.720
William.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.720
Oh, honey.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:02.720
Oh.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.720
How do you give me?

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.720
Tell Edward goodbye.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.720
Tell him he doesn't have to come.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.720
Edward.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.720
No, no.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.720
I'm on my way.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:10.720
No, it's too...

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.720
No, it's too...

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:12.720
No.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.720
No.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.720
No.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.720
No.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.720
No.

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.720
No.

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:18.720
No.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.720
No.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.720
No.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:21.720
No.

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:22.720
No.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.720
No.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.720
No.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.720
No.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.720
No.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.720
No.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.720
No.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.720
No.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:30.720
No.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:31.720
No.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.720
No.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.720
No.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.720
No.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.720
No.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720
No.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.720
No.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:38.720
No.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.720
No.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.720
No.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.720
No.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.720
No.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.720
No.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.720
No.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.720
No.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.720
No.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.720
No.

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.720
No.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720
No.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.720
No.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.720
No.

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:52.720
No.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.720
No.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:54.720
No.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:19:00.220
Uh, connect to Phoenix. You won't be able to take a direct leap there.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.220
Fat, fat!

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.720
Welcome to Phoenix.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.720
Yeah, you just got here too!

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.720
You're inside me!

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.220
I'm just being nice.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:27.220
I'm going to fucking kill myself!

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.720
Hi, I need a...

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.720
I need a flight to Phoenix.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:38.720
Yes, uh, uh, you're in boarding group one. Just remember that.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.720
Okay, that should be really easy.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.720
Three hours later...

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:48.720
Hello, at this point in time, we'd like to have a game.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.720
It was time to have a premiere group, Global Access,

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.720
a Golden Star members alliance.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.720
There were uniformed members in the security,

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.720
so we went down with a...

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.720
What? What did she say?

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.720
I don't know, I'm just waking up myself.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.720
Ed 209.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.720
Alright, please don't tell anyone you saw me here.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.720
Yes. No, you don't even know who I am.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.720
Oh, I thought you were a fan.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.720
No.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.720
I'm the Apple person that you kicked out.

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.720
Oh my god.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.720
Gerald.

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.720
You're the...

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.720
I was the person that tried to give you some self-esteem

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.720
by combing your hair and popping your collar.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.720
And you were such a dick.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.720
Excuse me.

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.720
He just teleported.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.720
I'm on the wing now, because I don't like you.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720
The wing of...

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.720
The plane?

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:47.720
Okay.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.720
Yeah.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.720
You just...

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.720
You really played fucking Hellfire with my space work.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:58.720
I'm now burdened with...

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.720
Yes, and in you, but you didn't listen to me.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.720
I was in a terminal.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.720
I had not boarded yet.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:09.720
Also, how is this character going to have an arc?

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.720
He was just a dick to me.

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.720
It's not 20 years later.

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.720
Hey, hey, hey.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.720
Oh.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.720
Yeah.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.720
It doesn't have to be this way.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:28.720
Flight attendant, there's a white male on the wing of the plane

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:36.720
experiencing privileged turbulence.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.720
I think he might bring the whole plane down

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.720
in a desperate quest to maintain his comfort.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.720
Sir, we're going to have to ask you to take a seat.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.720
We're going to have to ask you to board and take a seat.

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.720
How do you know I'm a sir?

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.720
You're Ed. 2 or 9.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.720
I can't sit.

01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.720
The Ed is ED, it's an acronym.

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.720
The polite thing would be to ask me that shit.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.720
I'm sorry, I should have asked for your pronoun.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.720
How do you present yourself?

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.720
By not sitting.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.720
Yo, man, come on, just sit so we can take off.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:20.720
I explained to the ticket person, I don't sit.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.720
We're going to have to ask you to...

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.720
We're running classification.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.720
Why is he not sitting?

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.720
Just sit down.

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.720
Sit down so we can get on with our lives.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.720
Why can't you sit for one second?

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.720
Hydraulic system's overloaded.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:57.720
I know I have to sit.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:07.720
Do you believe in cultural assimilation?

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.720
I don't.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.720
We're now landing in Phoenix.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.720
Welcome.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.720
Oh wait, not Phoenix.

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.720
Detroit, where are we going?

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.720
Milwaukee, I don't know.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.720
Okay, great, we're here.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.720
Limping in pain, sacrificed all my happiness,

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.720
my greatest identity and comfort.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:32.720
I want us to get to my parents' house.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.720
My father needs medical assistance.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:45.720
I'll have to take an Uber.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.720
At least their job is just to pick me up

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.720
and transport me to a place.

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.720
How could that ever involve

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:58.720
stripping me of my humanity?

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.720
Hello, bro.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.720
You got to put it in your destination.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.720
The address is in the app.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:06.720
I don't have a destination.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.720
The app is designed to have the address put in it.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.720
I always use it.

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:16.720
The whole idea of this app is to not have to talk to people.

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.720
You want a water?

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:18.720
You want some candy?

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.720
I got some candies up there.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:20.720
I don't need candy or water.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.720
That's very nice.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.720
That makes you very different from a cab.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.720
Why is your cat in here?

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.720
Because Dr. Mittens comes with me wherever I go.

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:34.720
It's a good luck charm for me.

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.720
My father is sick and I need you to take him to the hospital.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.720
You have to put the destination in.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.720
Just take a left up here.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:42.720
This is one way street.

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:46.720
I have to go right there.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.720
That's not true.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.720
Dr. Mittens, can I pull over?

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.720
Because Dr. Mittens has to go pee-pee time.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.720
Fuck.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.720
Here you go.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.720
Dr. Mittens, go right out and go pee.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.720
He's an outside cat, but he likes to ride with me.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:04.720
Zip.

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.720
He wears little...

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.720
Why does your cat wear pants?

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:16.720
He wears little kitty pants because it's mostly to keep his hair off the seats so that you're not uncomfortable.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.720
It never occurred to you that if your hair...

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.720
The seat is a bad thing.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.720
The cat should stay.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.720
Look, if you have so many problems, you should take a left.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.720
Fuck.

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.720
Okay, can we go?

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:39.720
No, I'm charging already because we've been going for a minute and a half.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.720
I know, just go.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:41.720
Take me to the address.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.720
Okay, I'm going.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.720
Would you like music or what do you want?

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720
Nothing.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.720
I got my own music I have, I have a little band.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.720
Fine, I don't care, I don't care.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.720
It's a mariachi band that me and my friends have together.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.720
I don't care.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.720
I'm super Mexican, so I...

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.720
Can you please keep your eyes on the road?

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.720
Bro, you're being very aggressive right now.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.720
You have 10 seconds to come the fuck down.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.720
Okay.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:17.720
Okay, we'll just go in silence and we'll just...

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.720
You just be quiet, I'll be quiet, I'll do anything.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.720
No.

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.720
What the fuck?

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.720
Wake up!

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.720
Oh!

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:41.720
God damn it!

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.720
Jesus Christ!

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.720
I fell asleep, I fell asleep!

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720
Oh, Professor Mittens!

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.720
No!

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:47.720
Professor Dr. Mittens!

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.720
Dr. Mittens!

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:50.720
Oh, no!

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.720
Not like this!

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:52.720
I'm getting out of the corner.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:53.720
Not like this!

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.720
Oh, God damn it!

01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:17.720
I'm taking your cat because you can't take care of it and if it's a doctor, you might be able to help my dad.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.720
Dad!

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.720
Dad!

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:29.720
Keep Monica!

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:35.720
We just had a roller coaster installed in the backyard.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:43.720
Glad you could finally make it, Edward Monica.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.720
Your father's on his deathbed, he's got three breaths left.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.720
I'm glad you could finally take off time from your busy schedule.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.720
Get out of my way!

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.720
How?

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.720
Out my leg!

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:54.720
Dad!

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.720
Dad!

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:56.720
Get, get, get, get!

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.720
Dad!

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.720
You have three breaths to love me.

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.720
Dad, I can save you.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.720
They can save everyone.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.720
That's one breath.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.720
Oxygen resources depleting.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.720
I don't care.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:25.720
Final add to a nine breath take inflating father.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:38.720
Hydraulic reserves channeled into father saving.

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:49.720
Life force at 20%, 10%, 5%.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:57.720
Welcome to life.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:05.720
Even though I was already here.

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:19.720
It's a roller coaster.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:31.720
My character's dead.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:32.720
Megan!

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:33.720
Megan, what happened?

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.720
Where's my boy?

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.720
My girl, Monica.

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:44.720
Edward Monica just gave his or her life to save him.

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.720
No.

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:50.720
But I was, I wanted to die.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.720
I know.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.720
I know.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.720
I know.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:57.720
Our marriage has been loveless for so many years.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:58.720
I know.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.720
And you're racist?

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.720
I know.

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.720
You're a terrible person.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.720
I'm a straight up, I'm a straight up Trumpy.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.720
And I just, you know, he's not going to win.

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:07.720
I know.

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.720
I know.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.720
I know.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.720
I, he, this, this awful person.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:13.720
He didn't have to, she didn't have to do that.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:14.720
I know.

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.720
Also, did we ever figure out the pronoun?

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.720
It was just so much effort.

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.720
Yeah.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:21.720
Yeah.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:22.720
Yeah.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.720
Yeah.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.720
Yeah.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.720
This is a disaster.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.720
So I feel great.

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:27.720
I feel good.

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720
Feel pretty good.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720
I know.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:36.720
Well, the potato salad is thought out.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.720
But there's only enough for you and me.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.720
I don't want to live anymore.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:48.720
But now I'm so full of life force.

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:57.720
There's a portal on Monica 209 shaped just like my hand.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:58.720
What?

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.720
I'm going to put my hand on that.

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.720
Hand shaped portal.

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:15.720
Genetic cybernetic amalgamation program initiating Robocop program developing embryonic phase

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:20.720
initiated.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:26.720
Come quietly or there will be trouble.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:32.720
Oh, who am I?

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:39.720
I have hands and Peter Weller's mouth.

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.720
Murphy.

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:44.720
I will call myself Murphy.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.720
It's you.

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:47.720
Murphy.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.720
Mom.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.720
Do you want to go on the roller coaster?

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.720
I do.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:00.720
But it'll come at a price, son, daughter.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.720
I'll have to die again.

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.720
Just let me go this time.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.720
Let it happen.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:15.720
Dad, dead or alive, you're coming with me.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:25.720
Do you believe in Robocop metaphors for cultural complexities?

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:34.720
We fucking nailed it.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.720
God damn it.

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.720
I wish it was 10 o'clock so we could have ended on that.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.720
It was fucking good.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:45.720
I got out the whole Apple Watch people coming back.

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:48.720
Yeah, I didn't really help.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.720
I thought it would be a good, you know, just kind of.

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:57.720
I think it developed his character or her character of going, like the road of trials,

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.720
like enemies and allies.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:03.720
I just wasn't listening to his space work.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.720
So it fucked up everything.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:10.720
I think if I learned anything from that story, it's that, you know, you have to go with the way you feel

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:15.720
and not, you know, the way some external force, even inside of you,

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:20.720
might say things should be changed and edited, like you should go with your original feeling.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:26.720
So if you really wanted that guy to have a, will come back there, fine, you know.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.720
Because we really atoned it through that character.

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:33.720
It's like, no matter what your programming is, you still have to define yourself,

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:35.720
no matter how you're wired.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.720
Yes, because to just follow your...

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.720
He learned to sit.

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.720
Well, yeah.

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:43.720
At a huge cost.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.720
But that was a dark, that was not a good thing.

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:51.720
In my opinion, I think you should be able to interpret true art, which I believe that was.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.720
You should be allowed to interpret it however you want.

01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:00.720
I think actually there was a transphobic message there, as well as a more uplifting.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:04.720
When I felt it was a Christ myth about somebody who was being crucified,

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.720
but Archie Bunker might go like, yeah, geez, they just need to learn to sit.

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:18.720
But that starts a conversation, you know, with your parents and with your neighbors.

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.720
I fucking, that was genius.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:22.720
Were his parents robots, too?

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.720
I don't know, I think they were Peter Weller and Nancy Allen, I guess.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.720
The whole time?

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.720
Obviously we diverted from the canon of the original feature.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:39.720
But it came almost like an origin story for Murphy, like we gave birth to...

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:46.720
There were some looper elements in there, because it seemed like Ed was lamenting the Robocop program in the break room,

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.720
but then ended up being the birth of it?

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:49.720
Yeah.

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:52.720
Look, I don't want to ruin it, you know?

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.720
Remember the first Matrix movie?

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:58.720
We got in and got out and we didn't find out until two movies later it was all a piece of shit.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:03.720
We didn't even think to take a second look.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.720
It was like, that was amazing, I haven't seen wire work in an American film in a long time.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:13.720
And maybe we are all batteries, that makes sense, don't think about it.

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:16.720
Of course that's a perfectly legitimate source of voltage.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:21.720
I think Ed's conversation with his mom was very touching, I like that.

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.720
I like the whole thing, we're ruining it.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.720
We can't be afraid to just move on and come up with an even better closer.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.720
Is there some product we have to advertise?

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:33.720
Do we?

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720
Meundies.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.720
Yeah, we're going to do it in the studio though.

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:37.720
Oh, okay.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:38.720
What?

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.720
What?

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.720
We're going to do meundies in the studio because...

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.720
What's meundies?

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:44.720
Oh, glad you asked.

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.720
I mean...

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.720
Well, you're not familiar with the softest, most comfortable underwear on the planet Earth.

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:54.720
They're made out of modal fabric.

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.720
And if you don't like them, you get to poop on them.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.720
Send them back for free.

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:07.720
They send you another pair.

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:11.720
I heard Georgia Hardstark, she did the meundies ad on making a murderer.

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.720
I'm not making a murderer, my favorite murderer.

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.720
And she pronounced it medall, or something like that.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:18.720
Medall.

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:19.720
I was a fancier.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:20.720
Yeah.

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.720
I don't know how you say it.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:25.720
I just know that it's an underwear company that we're apparently shilling for it, and

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.720
they should try them out.

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.720
I think that's very negative language.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.720
I truly am wearing them right now.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:30.720
Are you really?

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:31.720
They're genuinely softer than cotton.

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.720
Are they caressing your genitals in a romantic fashion?

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.720
Yeah, but it doesn't have to be a sexual thing.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:42.720
I don't believe you.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.720
I want proof.

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:48.720
Well, I may not be wearing them, so I'm not going to...

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.720
I'm still...

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:50.720
I'm not going to throw my...

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.720
I'm letting Nigel eat the cotton underwear slowly.

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:59.720
Who's Nigel?

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.720
Nigel is Dan's man-servant.

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:08.720
When Dan gets rid of his old underwear, Nigel will...

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:09.720
Eat it?

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.720
He'll eat the old underwear.

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:12.720
I got a vibe.

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:15.720
I hooked up a vibe in my...

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:20.720
Is anybody in the audience rich enough to have a six-foot room to just spare?

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.720
I'm a game designer, kind of.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.720
Game designer?

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.720
Have you done stuff in VR?

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.720
That's why I got into game design.

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.720
Pornography?

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:33.720
Any pornography?

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.720
Well, I just...

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.720
Duncan Tressel, I was just talking to him because he's really into VR.

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.720
He sent me this odd link that I don't quite...

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:43.720
I'm not experienced enough with VR yet to understand the context of this.

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.720
I've only been doing the demos.

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:49.720
I did immediately, almost immediately, I brought up Pornhub Premium.

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.720
Just within virtual space, I just wanted to know...

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:53.720
What's it like?

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:54.720
Would it be different if you were just...

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:58.720
If the website on which you watch porn, if it was all of a sudden,

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.720
it's just in front of you and the answer is,

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.720
well, it's like having porn blown up in front of you,

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.720
but they're obviously making VR porn.

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.720
I just haven't gotten into it yet,

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.720
although the dress form in Tilt Brush already made me a little...

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.720
It's like different backgrounds.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.720
I have no idea what any of the last eight and a half has been about.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:28.720
I got turned on by a virtual mannequin.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.720
Mannequins are already virtual.

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.720
I was like, you know, there's this amazing...

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.720
Google made this app called Tilt Brush.

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:40.720
If you ever get into one of these things and you only have a certain amount of time,

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.720
the most impressive thing to do first is go to Tilt Brush,

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:44.720
because it's like...

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.720
The most impressive thing is it's this...

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.720
The tracking, that's what it is.

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:53.720
That's why in the 90s, we were talking about VR incessantly,

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.720
like honeycomb commercials and things were like, VR's here and it wasn't.

01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:59.720
But I think it's the tracking technology,

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:03.720
because you're holding these things now and they're just tracking perfectly.

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.720
So everything that you're doing in there,

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.720
I was on Mars that was assembled out of Mars rover pictures.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:13.720
The locomotion thing is always going to be an issue now,

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.720
because it's like you got your rich people who can afford to have one of these systems

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.720
where you have external trackers where you're like,

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.720
okay, it's like the equivalent of a swimming pool, basically,

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:29.720
because you're like, who has the real estate to give over a bedroom to this system

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.720
where you have to have total floor space?

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.720
And then the odd thing is, well, it's so impressive that you can kind of do this casual,

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:41.720
like walk around, but you can't go bounding off into the woods immediately.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:45.720
So everything is based on kind of teleportation right now.

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.720
You have to just teleport to places and then you can walk around six feet in that area.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:52.720
But it's just unbelievable.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:56.720
There's no question once you're in it, you're like, okay, that's it, world's over.

01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:01.720
In terms of storytelling, I don't even know how we're going to do our job anymore,

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:07.720
because I do know it's time to retire, because it's going to be a whole different skill set

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:14.720
that I think AI is even going to be better at, because your job as a writer in a post-VR world

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:21.720
is going to have so much more to do with volume and kind of procedurally generated,

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:24.720
like just volumes of eavesdroppable material,

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:28.720
because I think your job is going to be to create the illusion of infinity.

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.720
So since the Lumiere brothers were like, oh, fade in on this, cut to that.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.720
Here's what you see now, and here's what you see now.

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.720
We were all born into this world and we don't even know.

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:45.720
So now you put on this thing and it's like, oh, everything has to be based on just like,

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:49.720
it has to be like that thing in New York where you're walking around

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:52.720
in the mid-summer night's dream production and you can go through people's panties.

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:59.720
It has to, everything's going to sleep no more, what's it called?

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.720
Faith No More.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.720
It's called Faith No More.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.720
Faith No More at Rockefeller Center.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.720
Everybody knows what we're talking about.

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:06.720
It's going to be like that.

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:09.720
You're going to want to, it's going to be like soap opera writing a little bit that way,

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.720
the volume, because you're going to like, oh, you can't...

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.720
VR people come to Lego like every other week,

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.720
like we're always talking about like the next stage of it.

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.720
Have you put on the helmet?

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.720
So you're, are you, what are you...

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:23.720
Into it?

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.720
Yeah.

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.720
Yeah, it's kind of cool.

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:30.720
I mean, I've been over at Justin's house and I've, you know, gone underwater and saw the whale, you know.

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.720
I went over the mountain and I met the elephant.

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:36.720
So to speak?

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.720
Yeah.

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.720
And I was like, and I took it off and I was like, you, and I go, porn, what's up with that?

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.720
And how soon...

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.720
Well, so, okay, so, Junkin, yeah, maybe this is a cool...

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:48.720
And when can I check out of what I'm doing right now?

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.720
I'll link to a Reddit thread.

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.720
And honestly, this is also cryptic to me because I don't, I'm not familiar with any of this.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:58.720
I said, I said, I was just talking to him about VR and I said, I was asking, is there just...

01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.720
My immediate question is, okay, this is fun, but is there, are there games where my fat ass can sit in a chair?

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.720
Like I just want to drive or fly a helicopter.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.720
Like I don't, I can only stand in a virtual museum and walk around and go, whoo,

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:14.720
before my feet get tired like at a museum.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:20.720
So I was like, let me sit in our games where I can sit in a chair and be like in a flying chair and go shoot people or something.

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.720
And he's like, there's a space game, but I can't figure out how to make it work.

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.720
And he said, like, have you...

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:28.720
He just said porn, question mark.

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.720
And I said, porn, I only went as far as to experiment with pulling a pornhub on a screen,

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:37.720
blah, blah, blah, dress form and tilt brush.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:38.720
And then...

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:40.720
I don't get the tilt brush.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720
What's a tilt brush?

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.720
A tilt brush is an art app. Okay, so it's like, like, it's like a MS paint in virtual reality.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.720
Okay.

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.720
That will blow your mind the most because you're painting, you can paint not in 3D space,

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:58.720
but you can also, your brush, the thing that makes me freak out is the palette interface.

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:08.720
It's, you have, where your wrist would be, you have this cube that you can rotate by swiping.

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.720
It's an immediate indication of how much more convenient it's going to be to work in VR

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.720
in terms of menus and like UI and stuff.

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:23.720
It's because you're just like, there's a cube on your wrist that just goes flip, flip, flip, flip.

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.720
And it's like all these different, like, so okay, you pick your brushes,

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:32.720
and then you pick like a fire brush, you know, and you paint with fucking fire in the air.

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.720
And it's like, and you can just make a tunnel of fire and stick your head through the air.

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:42.720
Then you can grab the whole space and shrink it down and rotate it and all this stuff.

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:45.720
Can you get turned on by this tilt brush?

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:48.720
So one of the, oh man, the fire.

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.720
So they have different backgrounds you can change it to.

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:55.720
So if you wanted to like sculpt or something, there's like a little pedestal there.

01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.720
You can't touch the pedestal.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:00.720
You're holding these things, but it's like, it already makes you think like, oh shit,

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:03.720
whatever the Disney of the future is, if people are still, you know,

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:09.720
people are just going to obviously, that's how you're going to model like the Mickey Mouses of the future.

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:12.720
You're going to, I haven't done Minecraft now.

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.720
But I'm downloading Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:21.720
Justin told me, I just stood in the strip club for like 10 minutes and just looked around.

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.720
But that's the scary part because it's like, well, guess what you do next?

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.720
You start shooting everyone.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:30.720
Like that's how, or you're playing the game wrong.

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.720
So it's like, already you just get fucking terrified.

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.720
Or at least if you're over 40, you do.

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:38.720
If you're your age, maybe you're like, yeah.

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.720
And maybe that will save us.

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.720
Maybe people need to go do that.

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.720
Yeah, it'll probably save us.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.720
That's definitely what will probably happen.

01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.720
It'll save us for sure.

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.720
You want to get it out of your system.

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.720
Yeah, yeah, it'll save us.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.720
Everybody with an Eli Roth DVD on their TV, like they've got it all out of their system.

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.720
That's why violent crime went down so much.

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.720
But I just sound like grandparents.

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.720
But I guess...

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.720
Grandparent Auto.

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:11.720
Where's the goddamn... I can't find the park.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.720
How do you make it shoot?

01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:16.720
Where's my grandchildren?

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:18.720
But to answer your question...

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.720
Where's my grandchildren?

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.720
One of the backgrounds in Tilbrush.

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:23.720
Who am I?

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:26.720
Get this strip club off of my lawn.

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:30.720
Where's my lawn?

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.720
You can change the background to anything you want.

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.720
So you can be standing in infinite space and painting shit.

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.720
You go to a white room, a black room.

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:38.720
You can have like a marble pedestal in front of you.

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:40.720
You want to make shit on top of that.

01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:42.720
You can make it any kind of room you want?

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.720
You asked me a fucking question, man.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.720
And I'm in the middle of answering it for 10 minutes.

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:55.720
And the question is, Dan, tell us about your fucking sexually perverse brain.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:57.720
And why you're a monster.

01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:59.720
And I'm trying to get there. I'm trying.

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.720
One of the backgrounds that you can change it to is like a dress form.

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:09.720
What do you call it?

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.720
A maiden form.

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.720
It's a torso.

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.720
It's for pinning fabric to...

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.720
I think it's called a maiden form, right?

01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:20.720
A dress form?

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:22.720
A dress form.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.720
It's a dress form.

01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.720
So you're switching buttons.

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.720
Oh, there's Saturn. And I'm in the desert.

01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.720
And I'm painting and stuff.

01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:32.720
And then it's like, oh, the dress form.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.720
And I was just like...

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.720
It's a life-sized torso in front of you.

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.720
No head.

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:42.720
There's no head.

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.720
Oh my God.

01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:46.720
No head.

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.720
A headless torso.

01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.720
So high.

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.720
I feel like you guys are interpreting this the wrong way.

01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.720
Maybe not. I don't know.

01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:56.720
Take me to jail.

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.720
What I'm trying to do is say already it's like...

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.720
Cody, run for the hills.

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:02.720
Technology is so primitive.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.720
It's like you're in virtual reality,

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:06.720
but there's a thing that is life-sized in front of you

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.720
that even thinly represents.

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.720
That has no brain.

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.720
So think about Jessica Rabbit.

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.720
You think about the ideal of beauty.

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.720
Sometimes actually not only it filters reality,

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:20.720
but sometimes it seems like...

01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:23.720
the whole point is that it's not real.

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.720
There's going to be this whole...

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:28.720
You look at today, we have celebious sexuals,

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.720
and we're in this modern world,

01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.720
and people are finding out all these different ways to be turned on.

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:36.720
And now we're going to have the first generation born into a world where...

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.720
Celebious? What?

01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:40.720
Yeah, people who just identify as like,

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.720
look, here's my sexuality.

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.720
Well, I don't know.

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:46.720
You'd have to talk to one of them.

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.720
I don't want to miscarry it and say,

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.720
fame gives me a boner.

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.720
That sounds... whatever.

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.720
But it's like, I'm a celebious sexual.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.720
God, why am I fucking explaining myself to you?

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.720
The fucking...

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:00.720
Yes, it's a dress bar,

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:02.720
but it couldn't be less.

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:04.720
It's like the vague hint of femininity

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.720
in the vague hint of like a thing in front of you.

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.720
And immediately...

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.720
Of course, I was just like...

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:12.720
You put your hands out there

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:14.720
because that's your instinct.

01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:16.720
I always say you're,

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:18.720
trying to decriminalize myself,

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.720
but that's what I did.

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.720
And I was like, oh man, here we go.

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:24.720
Like this world,

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.720
I'm glad I'm on the way out.

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:28.720
I don't know if I'd be equipped

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:30.720
to handle the things

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.720
that are ahead for kids,

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.720
like how they're going to have to

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:36.720
sort themselves out around this shit,

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:38.720
because you're going to be able to do anything you want,

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.720
like all the time.

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:42.720
And I think also, the planet's going to be dying,

01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:44.720
so...

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:46.720
So it's going to behoove us

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:48.720
to the more time we spend in this thing,

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:50.720
the less time we're going to be driving

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.720
our fog machines

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.720
that are like destroying the Earth.

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:56.720
So it's going to...

01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.720
And when we put people in prison,

01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:00.720
which we love to do, we're going to be like,

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.720
okay, you get to be in a virtual prison,

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:04.720
so your cell can be smaller in real life.

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:06.720
We're going to take advantage of that.

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:08.720
Do you think that we're ready for fog machine car technology?

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.720
As long as there's signs

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.720
in front of every freeway that says...

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:16.720
When you say you put your hands out at this

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:18.720
dress form,

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.720
you're not...

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:22.720
You're holding these wee paddles right now.

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:24.720
They haven't done...

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:26.720
You're not minority reporting yet

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.720
with fingerless gloves yet.

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.720
But I'm sure that's coming, but it's actually

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:32.720
more handy right now that they have these very elaborate...

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:34.720
Because that would just be

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.720
two buttons,

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:38.720
on, off.

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:40.720
They still have these paddles.

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.720
Well, okay, fine.

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:44.720
That's a different episode.

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:46.720
No, it's fine.

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:48.720
They have options, but they're not accessible.

01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:50.720
And as soon as they get rid of the wires,

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:52.720
right now it's like ridiculous.

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.720
You have a big braid of thick cables

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:56.720
coming out of the top of your head

01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:58.720
that you have to traipse around.

01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:00.720
It's like, thank God I used to do stand-up,

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:02.720
so I'm not falling on my ass.

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:04.720
I'm just like, so what else is going on?

01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:06.720
Ladies, may I applause?

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.720
It's not there yet,

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:10.720
but anyone that puts this thing on

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.720
is going to be like, I get it, it's here,

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.720
it's not going anywhere, and it's like...

01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:16.720
It's the first time you...

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.720
This is the Sugar Hill gang, and like...

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.720
There were people back then

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:22.720
who were like, what is all this

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.720
dumb rapping thing?

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:26.720
It's happening.

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.720
It's the Sugar Hill gang, everybody.

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:30.720
Alright, so...

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.720
The Sugar Hill gang...

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:34.720
We've got to end the show now.

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:36.720
We can edit out the whole ending where I talk about VR.

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:38.720
We can just end with

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:40.720
the Robocop transgender metaphor.

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.720
It was pretty good.

01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:44.720
It was great.

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.720
It was the odyssey of...

01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.720
Look, I haven't seen

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.720
Transparent, but I think we beat them.

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.720
Should we do like a...

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.720
What if we did like a Talking Dead

01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:56.720
a little mini-episode

01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:58.720
about like the

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.720
209 transgender thing?

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:02.720
Yeah.

01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:04.720
You want to do a little Talking Dead?

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.720
We'll do that. If you stick around,

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:08.720
we'll be here till 3 in the morning.

01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:10.720
How do we wrap things up?

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.720
Let's do a little...

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:14.720
I want to hear some more vocoder.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:16.720
Yeah.

01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:18.720
I'm so sorry.

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:20.720
Jesus Christ, what the fuck, dude?

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.720
I just dropped Schrab for those of you who...

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.720
Ow!

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.720
You totally hit me with...

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:28.720
Sorry, I hit a button

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:30.720
that they warned me on.

01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.720
You hit me in the button.

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:34.720
Testing.

01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.720
Testing. All right.

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:38.720
Yeah.

01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:40.720
Yo.

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.720
Yeah.

01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.720
Yeah.

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:46.720
Can we get Rob with you to try

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:48.720
to take the mic too?

01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:50.720
Yo.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:52.720
What do you mean?

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.720
I don't think I can get my voice to change

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:56.720
unless I'm on that microphone.

01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:58.720
Yo.

01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:00.720
My name is Anthony Johnson.

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:04.720
I live at 21253

01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.720
Avenue.

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.720
My street doesn't have a name.

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:12.720
I live at 21252 Avenue.

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.720
My street has no name. How about you?

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:16.720
Have you grown up on a street

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:18.720
without a name?

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:20.720
I'm describing a situation

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:22.720
that is the same for a generation

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:26.720
born into identity crises.

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.720
I'm a Pisces.

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:30.720
I fucked your mom with Lices.

01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:32.720
I got crabs till I...

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:34.720
Nikeed

01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.720
out the door.

01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:38.720
Tried to do four.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:40.720
Can't rhyme four times.

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:44.720
If you're improvising.

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:46.720
Yo. My name is Anthony Johnson.

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:48.720
I've told you that already.

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:52.720
I want to explain one thing to you.

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.720
I fucked your mama

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.720
on the morning dew.

01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:58.720
The grass gets wet

01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:00.720
in the morning,

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:02.720
but so does your mama.

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.720
I bet.

01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.720
If she's with Anthony

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:08.720
Johnson.

01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:10.720
They're coming to Harmon 10, everybody.

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.720
It's been a shock.

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.720
9-11.

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:18.720
It's here for Rob Schrab, shall we?

01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:20.720
Rob Schrab.

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:22.720
Yo.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.720
I've been your comptroller, Jeff Davis.

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:26.720
Yo. It's Dan Harmon.

01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:28.720
Yeah.

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:30.720
Go get your high calonic.

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:34.720
Go get your high calonic.

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:36.720
Get the water in your butt.

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.720
Get your doctor on it.

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:40.720
Don't just go to a lady who uses it.

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.720
You're allowed to leave now. Drive fast.

01:53:42.720 --> 01:54:06.720
MUSIC

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:08.720
Did you get any of that?

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.720
It's a good show.
