00:00.000 --> 00:11.080
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.560
Welcome to the NerdMelt Theater.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.920
How are you all tonight?

00:13.920 --> 00:20.800
Thank you, loyal harmonians for coming.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.320
Thank you for listening out there in the podcast to ether.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.880
Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown,

00:26.880 --> 00:28.880
Dan Harmon.wn.

00:28.880 --> 00:40.880
Thank you.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.080
I got nothing tonight.

00:42.080 --> 00:45.080
I got nothing to talk about.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.080
See me after the show.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.480
You may have your $10 back.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.280
I'm looking at my phone because I said to people,

00:53.280 --> 00:54.560
what do you want me to talk about?

00:54.560 --> 00:56.560
Got any questions?

00:56.560 --> 00:58.560
Hashtag Harmontown.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.560
You guys did good.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.560
Thank you.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.560
Good audience.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.560
I don't want you to mistake my low energy tonight for lack of love

01:07.560 --> 01:09.560
because I edit the Harmontown podcast.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.560
We took a little break.

01:11.560 --> 01:16.560
I edited two in a row over at Puny Studios with Dustin Marshall.

01:16.560 --> 01:20.560
I missed you guys.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.560
You're a good audience.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.560
You're good people.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.560
Shut up.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.560
I got nothing tonight.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.560
I have no passion.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.560
I have no topics.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.560
I'm not sad.

01:36.560 --> 01:39.560
I don't have anything to be sad about.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.560
I have a lot of money.

01:41.560 --> 01:48.560
I have so much food that I have extra food stored in my body.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.560
I have extra beds in my house.

01:51.560 --> 01:55.560
So I'm the opposite of homeless.

01:55.560 --> 02:02.560
I have nothing to complain about.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.560
Why are you so sedate?

02:05.560 --> 02:07.560
It's just bio rhythms.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.560
I've been really negative the last few days.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.560
I've been really cranky and in a bad mood all the time.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.560
For no reason. Everything's great.

02:15.560 --> 02:19.560
You gave my girlfriend a dressing down at the drawing room.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.560
I was pleasant about it.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.560
It seemed from her reaction that you were pretty mean.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.560
She has a high value on your opinion.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.560
That's wrong. I told her how I felt.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.560
I didn't beat her up about it.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.560
You said how you felt was her behavior in the last show

02:39.560 --> 02:42.560
where she called on her cell phone.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.560
You said that was the last straw.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.560
Like you have a last straw.

02:47.560 --> 02:54.560
No, the words was the limit of my endurance.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.560
I'm not cliche.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.560
She's not here tonight because she killed herself.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.560
You'll be happy to know.

03:03.560 --> 03:08.560
She's doing a show or something.

03:08.560 --> 03:14.560
She could have killed herself.

03:14.560 --> 03:19.560
Maybe you would have apologized.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.560
He called you in the middle of the show.

03:22.560 --> 03:26.560
Adam Goldberg wanders up here.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.560
This show has no format.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.560
There's nothing to protect.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.560
It's not a diamond mine.

03:32.560 --> 03:38.560
It's a tree house full of empty popcorn bags.

03:38.560 --> 03:43.560
I'm Tori Amos all of a sudden.

03:43.560 --> 03:48.560
It's a turtle racing a grapefruit.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.560
I thought I favored some of the questions.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.560
I'm sorry for the live people.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.560
They're looking at a guy looking at his phone.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.560
It's like sending a signal to you

03:56.560 --> 03:58.560
that I'm not interested in what you're saying.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.560
I am. I'm looking at my phone.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.560
This is a new jacket you're wearing tonight, Dan.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.560
You kind of have an Alan Alda mash field jacket.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.560
We've got a break in the weather.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.560
I know what I did wrong.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.560
I pressed the at Dan Harmon button,

04:13.560 --> 04:16.560
which is my favorite button.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.560
What I have to do is search for Harmontown.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.560
Then I should see some of these doodads.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.560
I don't know. Did I fuck it up somehow?

04:25.560 --> 04:27.560
Welcome to Hollywood, California, everybody.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.560
The entertainment capital of the world.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.560
Here's an example.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.560
Dopamine, at Dopamine, says,

04:35.560 --> 04:37.560
if you were born 200 years ago,

04:37.560 --> 04:39.560
what would you do for a living?

04:39.560 --> 04:41.560
That's a really good question.

04:41.560 --> 04:45.560
That's just an example of a great question.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.560
If I had some passion tonight,

04:47.560 --> 04:49.560
I would have an amazing answer for that.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.560
I think that would be very intriguing.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.560
You were born in the year 1870.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.560
What are you, two? 73?

04:55.560 --> 04:56.560
I guess, yeah.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.560
Okay, so 1873.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.560
Let's make it 1820.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.560
No, 1830. You're 17 years old.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.560
What are you doing in 1830?

05:05.560 --> 05:07.560
Obviously, I would be a writer.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.560
I'm a timeless genius.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.560
I'd love to be able to say,

05:12.560 --> 05:14.560
I'd be an elephant trainer

05:14.560 --> 05:17.560
because the World's Fair would be coming up,

05:17.560 --> 05:20.560
and Mr. Edison would need a new elephant.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.560
No, no, I'd transcend.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.560
I'm like a time lord.

05:25.560 --> 05:29.560
My talent is, if I was born in the year 3000 BC,

05:29.560 --> 05:33.560
I'd invent writing.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.560
I'm a god.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.560
What do you think you would write about

05:38.560 --> 05:40.560
if you were in the year 3000 BC?

05:40.560 --> 05:45.560
Whatever got me about a nice piece of cave.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.560
Remember in ABC's Caveman,

05:47.560 --> 05:51.560
they used to say stuff like that.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.560
They used to cave like the Smurfs you'd Smurfy.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.560
Yeah, they were looking at a female cavewoman

05:57.560 --> 05:59.560
that was working at Pinkberry,

05:59.560 --> 06:02.560
and Nick Krull's character was looking at her butt

06:02.560 --> 06:05.560
and said, I'd like to carve me off a nice piece of that cave.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.560
What?

06:09.560 --> 06:11.560
First of all, that doesn't make any sense.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.560
Second of all, to the extent that I forced my brain

06:13.560 --> 06:15.560
to make it make sense, gross,

06:15.560 --> 06:17.560
because caves are holes,

06:17.560 --> 06:19.560
and then I start to think of vaginas,

06:19.560 --> 06:21.560
and now I'm thinking of carving off vaginas,

06:21.560 --> 06:26.560
and you made me do that, Geico.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.560
Anyways, here's another great one.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.560
Is there a plan to take Harmontown on tour anytime soon?

06:31.560 --> 06:34.560
I'm going to have to say yes, yes.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.560
I thought that would get a bigger response,

06:36.560 --> 06:38.560
but then I realized you guys are...

06:38.560 --> 06:40.560
Why would you...

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
You don't care?

06:41.560 --> 06:43.560
Hey, you're leaving!

06:43.560 --> 06:45.560
Get the hell out of here!

06:45.560 --> 06:49.560
It's the applause from a little iPhone that I'm hearing

06:49.560 --> 06:53.560
from the people in New York and Chicago and things.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.560
Yeah, I think in January,

06:55.560 --> 06:57.560
we're having preliminary conversations about this,

06:57.560 --> 07:00.560
I think what I'm going to do, because I'm turning 40,

07:00.560 --> 07:04.560
maybe get 50 people or so to show up in little cities

07:04.560 --> 07:07.560
across the country, so I think in January,

07:07.560 --> 07:10.560
we'll take a little bus and we'll go around

07:10.560 --> 07:15.560
and we'll do this to people in different cities.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.560
And I want to record it.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.560
Take some Channel 101 kids with us.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.560
They're not kids anymore, they're 48 years old.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.560
But take them with us, do some nice recordings

07:26.560 --> 07:29.560
in the little black boxes and cabarets

07:29.560 --> 07:31.560
throughout the country.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.560
And then come home with hundreds of hours of footage

07:33.560 --> 07:36.560
and then just throw it on some other Channel 101 kid

07:36.560 --> 07:38.560
and go, edit this.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.560
And I'll just sit at home snorting coke off of a piranha.

07:42.560 --> 07:47.560
That's the only way I get high anymore.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.560
Yeah.

07:48.560 --> 07:52.560
Speaking of addictions, I think this might be part of

07:52.560 --> 07:54.560
why I'm all like, I got nothing tonight.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.560
I'm addicted to five-hour energies.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.560
I call them 5HEs now.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.560
It barely takes less time to say.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.560
It's basically the same amount of energy,

08:05.560 --> 08:08.560
but I'm obsessed with energy, I gotta say.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.560
It's fucking up my throat.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.560
I got bad acid reflux.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.560
I'm taking like Zantac on top of Prilosec

08:13.560 --> 08:15.560
to counteract the effects of these five-hour energies

08:15.560 --> 08:17.560
and I'm taking one or two a day.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.560
I mean, if you need 10 hours of energy,

08:19.560 --> 08:22.560
that's another way of saying, just take a nap.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.560
10 hours of energy is your deficit,

08:24.560 --> 08:27.560
then just take the day off and go to sleep.

08:27.560 --> 08:32.560
10 hours of energy, that's not good, Jeff.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.560
I've been addicted to worse things,

08:34.560 --> 08:37.560
but this is making barf on my throat.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.560
Yeah.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.560
Those things taste like poop, too.

08:40.560 --> 08:41.560
It doesn't taste good.

08:41.560 --> 08:43.560
Tastes like energy, you know?

08:43.560 --> 08:45.560
I don't think they want it to taste too good

08:45.560 --> 08:47.560
because then you wouldn't believe that it was giving you energy,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.560
which I don't think it is.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.560
To be quite honest, I've never felt energized by those things.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.560
I think it's a bunch of things.

08:54.560 --> 08:58.560
Well, I accidentally took two on top of each other once.

08:58.560 --> 09:05.560
For God, I took one and I think an hour into one,

09:05.560 --> 09:09.560
I took another and there is something in them

09:09.560 --> 09:12.560
because there is such a thing as too much.

09:12.560 --> 09:17.560
I remember right before I took the second one,

09:17.560 --> 09:19.560
I picked a fight with Erin

09:19.560 --> 09:23.560
and then she heard a totally justified response

09:23.560 --> 09:26.560
about what a piece of shit I was that night.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.560
It was like coming back on me socially

09:28.560 --> 09:30.560
as I was starting to freak out.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.560
I was laying in the bed that I made with my girlfriend

09:35.560 --> 09:38.560
and also going like, baby, please, please, come on.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.560
Come on, take it easy.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.560
I took two five-hour energy.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.560
I can't handle this.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.560
Yeah, but what did you mean before?

09:44.560 --> 09:45.560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.560
It was pretty weird.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.560
It was like the scene in the fifth element

09:49.560 --> 09:52.560
when the guy is choking on the strawberry or whatever the fuck.

09:52.560 --> 09:57.560
Yes, this is Rob Schrab clapping.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.560
Rob Schrab is in the house, is that right?

10:00.560 --> 10:01.560
Hello, Rob.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
Let's see.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.560
Man, I really thought...

10:08.560 --> 10:11.560
I sat in the green room and I favorited things

10:11.560 --> 10:12.560
that I wanted to respond to,

10:12.560 --> 10:18.560
but I guess you guys did such a good job of tweeting stuff at me

10:18.560 --> 10:19.560
that I...

10:19.560 --> 10:20.560
Are you playing Sparkle right now?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.560
Eric Mesquivel says,

10:22.560 --> 10:25.560
I know you're a Joe Campbell guy.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.560
Who else influences your writing?

10:27.560 --> 10:28.560
Are you a McKee fan?

10:28.560 --> 10:30.560
Goldman?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.560
No, I don't know.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.560
I don't know why I favorited that,

10:33.560 --> 10:35.560
if that's all I was going to say.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.560
I don't know what I was thinking.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.560
Not really a question, but if you ever find your way to Colorado,

10:43.560 --> 10:44.560
let me buy you a drink.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.560
Okay.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.560
It's no problem.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.560
Maybe this is hurting things,

10:49.560 --> 10:51.560
me holding this phone and scrolling through the things.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.560
Maybe I need to cut myself loose.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.560
It's not Circus Hill Layout.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.560
I'll tell you that much.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.560
Right.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.560
I mean, I don't know if it's going to be

10:58.560 --> 10:59.560
because I put the phone down,

10:59.560 --> 11:01.560
but I don't think that...

11:01.560 --> 11:02.560
I don't know if the phone's helping.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.560
Are you preoccupied?

11:03.560 --> 11:07.560
Are you just one of those weird kind of...

11:07.560 --> 11:09.560
Well, I'm mad at you for being mean to my girlfriend.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.560
I wasn't mean to her.

11:10.560 --> 11:11.560
You were there when it happened.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.560
It was very brief.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.560
I said it very succinctly.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.560
I didn't hear what you said, but...

11:15.560 --> 11:16.560
Exactly.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.560
It took a couple seconds,

11:17.560 --> 11:19.560
and I just told her she was bumming me the fuck out.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.560
Well, I mean...

11:21.560 --> 11:23.560
But, yeah.

11:23.560 --> 11:29.560
I mean, you told her that she...

11:29.560 --> 11:30.560
I'm curious to know...

11:30.560 --> 11:32.560
Did a bad thing to the show,

11:32.560 --> 11:34.560
and that the audience didn't like what she was doing.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.560
That's not what I said.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.560
That's not what I said.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.560
I really wanted to know what the...

11:37.560 --> 11:39.560
I would love to have heard the journalism

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
that she reported to you.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.560
I didn't know that you guys were going...

11:41.560 --> 11:42.560
I didn't know.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.560
We were at the drawing room,

11:43.560 --> 11:45.560
and I told Erin,

11:45.560 --> 11:46.560
and I was like, ugh.

11:46.560 --> 11:49.560
I gave her a little couple of minutes,

11:49.560 --> 11:51.560
get some shit off my chest,

11:51.560 --> 11:53.560
and then I didn't know that right after that

11:53.560 --> 11:55.560
you guys were going to go have a romantic dinner together,

11:55.560 --> 11:57.560
which I apparently must have poisoned

11:57.560 --> 11:58.560
by having a conversation,

11:58.560 --> 11:59.560
so I'm sorry for that.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.560
Wow.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.560
No.

12:01.560 --> 12:02.560
It was fascinating.

12:02.560 --> 12:08.560
So there's that.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.560
There's that putting a ding in my energy.

12:10.560 --> 12:16.560
I'm not going to blame you for anything, though.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.560
Let's blame Erin.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.560
I'm not going to blame anybody for anything.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.560
Let's blame everything on NT.

12:25.560 --> 12:31.560
How are you, NT?

12:31.560 --> 12:37.560
NT, what's it like?

12:37.560 --> 12:38.560
Come on.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.560
You know we all want to know

12:41.560 --> 12:43.560
to be a student.

12:43.560 --> 12:44.560
Oh, you're not a student.

12:44.560 --> 12:48.560
Okay.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.560
Is NT literally the only black...

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
No, no, okay.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.560
All right.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.560
My search lines went,

12:55.560 --> 12:56.560
bang.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.560
I was scared about it.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.560
Sometimes NT is literally the only

12:59.560 --> 13:02.560
African-American Armenian here.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.560
What's that like?

13:04.560 --> 13:05.560
That's what I'm really curious about,

13:05.560 --> 13:06.560
although I know words.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.560
The words don't matter.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.560
It's not like anything.

13:09.560 --> 13:13.560
It's like, I think I have five black friends, maybe,

13:13.560 --> 13:18.560
and I think if you got them all in a room together,

13:18.560 --> 13:20.560
I think the one thing they would all agree on

13:20.560 --> 13:21.560
is that they're pretty sick and tired

13:21.560 --> 13:25.560
of being reminded by me that they're black.

13:25.560 --> 13:29.560
And probably a microcosm for white America.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.560
They probably wish that they could get through a day

13:32.560 --> 13:35.560
and just forget about it.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.560
That's a luxury that white people have.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.560
When's the last time you stopped

13:40.560 --> 13:41.560
in the middle of the sidewalk?

13:41.560 --> 13:43.560
I'm like, oh, shit, I'm white.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.560
It probably had something to do

13:45.560 --> 13:47.560
with a black person being involved.

13:47.560 --> 13:51.560
You didn't just do it in a vacuum.

13:51.560 --> 13:56.560
It's not a homogenous society yet.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.560
It's not happening.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.560
There's black people out there.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.560
They're in pain.

14:00.560 --> 14:04.560
The next time you see one, don't give them money.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.560
That's not what they want.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.560
That's racist.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.560
Don't give them five.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.560
Even more racist.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.560
Give them a hug.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.560
What if the five was really high?

14:19.560 --> 14:22.560
I don't know, because if it's high enough,

14:22.560 --> 14:25.560
then the next one's got to be way down low.

14:25.560 --> 14:30.560
And then you were at the risk of being too slow.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.560
By the time you finish with that one thing,

14:32.560 --> 14:37.560
you're the most racist person in the world.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.560
Let's talk about race.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.560
Finally.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.560
What's your favorite race?

14:45.560 --> 14:47.560
That's a good question.

14:47.560 --> 14:51.560
By that I mean, which is more fascinating to you?

14:51.560 --> 14:53.560
Black people or Asian people?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.560
Who's more fascinating?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.560
Easily black people.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.560
Black people hands down.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.560
Favorite race to think about.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.560
What race would I want to be?

15:05.560 --> 15:07.560
No offense to our Asian friends.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.560
You're doing fine.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.560
Billions of you.

15:13.560 --> 15:20.560
America was literally built on this practice

15:20.560 --> 15:23.560
that we then were the first country to say,

15:23.560 --> 15:25.560
okay, now this is illegal.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.560
It's just a fascinating, the national psyche,

15:27.560 --> 15:30.560
the social implications,

15:30.560 --> 15:35.560
the swirling meta like racism within non-racism,

15:35.560 --> 15:37.560
within racism within non-racism,

15:37.560 --> 15:39.560
what the definition of it is.

15:39.560 --> 15:44.560
There's no better way to examine it

15:44.560 --> 15:46.560
than with white people and black people.

15:46.560 --> 15:50.560
No offense to our beautiful beige friends.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.560
But fuck you.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.560
It's Bush League stuff.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.560
Who cares?

15:55.560 --> 15:58.560
White and black is where it's at.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.560
When it comes to race obsession.

16:00.560 --> 16:05.560
How racist would 1830s writer Dan Harmon have been?

16:05.560 --> 16:07.560
You gotta be kidding me.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.560
That was kind of a sweet spot for American racism.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.560
It's an uncomfortable thing to think about.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.560
Think about the world.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.560
I was thinking about this just recently,

16:16.560 --> 16:18.560
and I can't remember why.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.560
Somebody was getting kind of high-handed

16:21.560 --> 16:23.560
in some conversation,

16:23.560 --> 16:26.560
and I didn't want to be like a David Cross character

16:26.560 --> 16:29.560
and kind of call him out on it and have a big argument.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.560
I was talking to somebody,

16:31.560 --> 16:35.560
and they said something that made me realize

16:35.560 --> 16:38.560
that they very much take it for granted the fact

16:38.560 --> 16:43.560
that as a nation, we were very, very wrong

16:43.560 --> 16:45.560
for a very long time,

16:45.560 --> 16:47.560
and that we haven't changed that much.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.560
It's only been a certain amount of time,

16:49.560 --> 16:53.560
and that we all kind of inherit this world.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.560
We act like, oh, those aren't my sins.

16:55.560 --> 16:58.560
Some of us are kind of nasty about it.

16:58.560 --> 17:04.560
I didn't have slaves, so excuse me.

17:04.560 --> 17:08.560
You're making quite a bit of noise in the popcorn line,

17:08.560 --> 17:10.560
and it's not my fault.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.560
You know what?

17:11.560 --> 17:13.560
I saw that movie that you guys made,

17:13.560 --> 17:16.560
and if a white person made that movie, it would not be fair.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.560
You'd get all mad about it.

17:19.560 --> 17:25.560
I think that there's a naivete there,

17:25.560 --> 17:30.560
because really, as recently as the 1930s,

17:30.560 --> 17:32.560
there was this whole thing in Europe

17:32.560 --> 17:37.560
that was really on a hand.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.560
I know none of us were there,

17:39.560 --> 17:44.560
but I also know that it wasn't an entire generation of monsters.

17:44.560 --> 17:49.560
They weren't like vampires from a cereal box that all decided.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.560
It's like humanity has it in it to be very cruel, very evil,

17:53.560 --> 17:56.560
and if the person to the left of you

17:56.560 --> 18:00.560
and the person to the right of you is doing something wrong,

18:00.560 --> 18:04.560
we have the capacity in us to not look at it as wrong.

18:04.560 --> 18:09.560
The reason that's important isn't to make ourselves feel guilty

18:09.560 --> 18:12.560
or to pat ourselves on the back for knowing it.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.560
The reason why it's important to know that is relativity

18:15.560 --> 18:18.560
so that you can actually extrapolate from that and go,

18:18.560 --> 18:22.560
okay, so what's going on right now that everyone accepts

18:22.560 --> 18:25.560
is completely right that 100 years from now

18:25.560 --> 18:28.560
might be absolutely fucking ridiculously wrong.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.560
There could be a million things, like that ghost hanging there.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.560
What's that?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.560
Maybe that's offensive, I don't know.

18:35.560 --> 18:40.560
I think we'll certainly look back on not letting gay people get married.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.560
We'll look at that and go, come on.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.560
Yeah, we're doing that with the gay people now.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.560
We're finally giving them some props,

18:48.560 --> 18:50.560
saying sorry about that.

18:50.560 --> 18:56.560
By the way, last show I talked about that gay and lesbian thing,

18:56.560 --> 19:01.560
and I know why I know about that gay and lesbian shelter in Los Angeles.

19:01.560 --> 19:06.560
A guy tweeted me in the wake of this big brouhaha,

19:06.560 --> 19:09.560
there was a small brouhaha, it was like three in the morning,

19:09.560 --> 19:11.560
it was between me and three gay guys,

19:11.560 --> 19:16.560
because my brother tweeted, God, I love my daughter,

19:16.560 --> 19:20.560
and I tweeted at my brother, fag.

19:20.560 --> 19:25.560
Because it's funny, I thought it was funny,

19:25.560 --> 19:27.560
I'm not defending it as funny,

19:27.560 --> 19:29.560
it was a spur of the moment thing,

19:29.560 --> 19:31.560
my brother tweeted, I love my daughter,

19:31.560 --> 19:34.560
and I raised in the 70s, my big brother,

19:34.560 --> 19:37.560
I'm from Wisconsin, without thinking,

19:37.560 --> 19:42.560
without remembering that I'm the Colonel Sanders of NBC sitcom.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.560
I just kind of lost myself.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.560
We're on Twitter, I'm not representing anybody,

19:48.560 --> 19:50.560
I'm just like fag.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.560
And then three guys who happen to be awake,

19:53.560 --> 19:56.560
we're like, one guy said,

19:56.560 --> 19:59.560
you call your brother a fag for loving his daughter?

19:59.560 --> 20:00.560
What kind of monster are you?

20:00.560 --> 20:02.560
I was like, well, that guy's just explaining the joke.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.560
I'm not apologizing to that guy,

20:06.560 --> 20:09.560
you just don't, that's funny, that's ironic, it's funny.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.560
But then other people were like,

20:11.560 --> 20:13.560
you know that word is really hurtful,

20:13.560 --> 20:15.560
kind of like bringing me back down to earth,

20:15.560 --> 20:19.560
and it's really true, like, do you know,

20:19.560 --> 20:24.560
when I was eight years old, nine years old, ten years old,

20:24.560 --> 20:27.560
N.T., I'm so glad you're here so you can forgive me for this.

20:27.560 --> 20:36.560
Just like, we're gonna give N.T. a black people wand,

20:36.560 --> 20:42.560
and he's gonna touch me with it after this.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.560
Maybe he won't.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.560
I don't know.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.560
Well, let's just be clear, at one point,

20:47.560 --> 20:51.560
he represents all black people.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.560
That seems fair.

20:52.560 --> 20:57.560
When I was a kid, N.T.,

20:57.560 --> 21:01.560
when we would play like tag, flashlight tag,

21:01.560 --> 21:04.560
kick the can, whatever, when somebody had to be it,

21:04.560 --> 21:07.560
and the kids would gather in a circle,

21:07.560 --> 21:08.560
and we would go,

21:08.560 --> 21:13.560
I got caught in a new sexy minie, Mow,

21:13.560 --> 21:17.560
and it wasn't Catch a Tiger by the toe.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.560
It wasn't Tiger.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.560
Aw?

21:19.560 --> 21:20.560
Catch a Chevy by the toe.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.560
About half the time it was Catch a Tiger,

21:23.560 --> 21:25.560
and about the other half of the time,

21:25.560 --> 21:27.560
this is the late 70s early 80s,

21:27.560 --> 21:31.560
in the middle of the Midwest in someone's back yard,

21:31.560 --> 21:35.560
and there were, you know,

21:35.560 --> 21:39.400
was playing or not. I can't remember if it was related to that. But it's like, I didn't

21:39.400 --> 21:49.200
even know. I never pictured anything. It was just like a word. I'm bringing that up because

21:49.200 --> 21:56.920
also as late as my late 20s, early 30s. No, fuck that. I was editing community with Stephen

21:56.920 --> 22:03.360
Sprung, my very gay editor for a community. I didn't know he was gay. I didn't bother.

22:03.360 --> 22:08.120
I wasn't processing that. I kept going. I had this habit. I would go. I would see an

22:08.120 --> 22:16.480
edit. I didn't like it. I'd go, that's fucking gay. Fix that. I just saw it like, gay. Just

22:16.480 --> 22:26.440
meaning dumb, retarded, stupid, bad. Then it was weeks before. This is just gay, right?

22:26.440 --> 22:34.680
I wonder if, I wish, I wish. She's just retarded. I wish she was gay. If she wasn't so retarded,

22:34.680 --> 22:38.560
maybe there's a way we could put her on some dates and make her gay so that I could also

22:38.560 --> 22:51.040
use her as an out for everything. She'd be like, my sister could be a Swiss army knife.

22:51.040 --> 23:01.240
But I was out of line. I'm a writer, so it's like the idea of people telling you that something's

23:01.240 --> 23:06.240
not funny or something's off limits or you have to censor yourself. That's the more important

23:06.240 --> 23:13.400
enemy all the time. Because then you're in the den of what evil. You have to guard against

23:13.400 --> 23:23.440
those people. Those are the real people that, I'm still convinced of that, but at the same

23:23.440 --> 23:28.800
time, maybe this is just getting older. Maybe you just get old and then you get bored and

23:28.800 --> 23:33.800
then you start getting sensitive or something. I don't know what my point is. I don't say

23:33.800 --> 23:45.720
fag or gay anymore. I was just saying, maybe there's a new thing. What do we say now? Awesome.

23:45.720 --> 23:51.920
Are there any awesome people in the audience? I don't know. Is gay people the last frontier?

23:51.920 --> 23:59.280
Is there anything left? Are we going to be homogenized after this? Are we going to be

23:59.280 --> 24:07.280
star trek? I think it's a human impulse to marginalize certain people to point out differences.

24:07.280 --> 24:14.360
I think we're fascinated by, we're all insecure. We all have our own kind of needy hang-ups.

24:14.360 --> 24:22.080
We have a desire to point out anybody that's different. Even the best among us, I think.

24:22.080 --> 24:25.920
People worry the slippery slope argument is, okay, so we're all going to get along and

24:25.920 --> 24:29.560
then the next thing will be tall people, redheads, people with freckles.

24:29.560 --> 24:35.920
Well, I think the big one, I think that humanity has a better chance of overcoming racism before

24:35.920 --> 24:42.040
sexism. I think that men are going to hate women longer than they'll hate other races.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.920
I think sexism is maybe the most pervasive and the most ingrained.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.040
What was the order again, didn't it?

24:48.040 --> 24:54.440
Right, ladies? Come on. I can't remember my history now from 8th grade. Black men could

24:54.440 --> 25:00.600
vote in America before women, right? It was first, it was like, okay, these people are

25:00.600 --> 25:07.240
human beings for God's sakes. Let's give them a say in who's president. Yeah, I agree. Shut

25:07.240 --> 25:21.760
up, Tracy. Get back in the kitchen. I love you. That is kind of amazing. It's noteworthy.

25:21.760 --> 25:30.800
Women's hatred of women is just palpable and so justifiable. No. See, it's not funny. It's

25:30.800 --> 25:38.840
not even funny to say it. It sounds so real. Women walk down the street. They have to deal

25:38.840 --> 25:46.880
with that all the time. They feel like that's something that nobody, the shit that I hear

25:46.880 --> 25:54.080
from women, you want to reject it. Come on. It's not that bad, is it? You ever hear women

25:54.080 --> 25:58.760
talk about when they walk down the sidewalk by themselves and somebody drives the car

25:58.760 --> 26:02.800
by and they say something about the window. They make a noise or a face or something.

26:02.800 --> 26:08.480
You want it to not be true. Come on. Life isn't a cartoon, but I've heard it enough from enough

26:08.480 --> 26:15.000
different sources. First three women that told me that, I was like, fuck you, you're lying.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.080
But now I realize they were heroes. I should write them a letter. No, it sounds like men

26:21.080 --> 26:31.880
are pretty frightening. They are frightening. Sorry. If only there was an N.T. of women

26:31.880 --> 26:42.320
here that could somehow, but no. You mean a black woman? No. What's an N.T. of women?

26:42.320 --> 26:48.440
Why? I was making the joke. Who's here to represent the women in the audience? Because

26:48.440 --> 26:54.360
it's a bunch of women is the answer. Adam Goldberg, ladies and gentlemen. Adam Goldberg

26:54.360 --> 27:01.760
starts the stage. How's it going? Hi, Adam Goldberg. Those ladies can't live with them.

27:01.760 --> 27:07.200
Gotta live with the fear of never living with them. Am I right? Yeah. Let's hear it for

27:07.200 --> 27:14.000
Adam Goldberg, everybody. Thank you, Adam. Thank you. He's still here. That was called

27:14.000 --> 27:21.320
an outro. Man, you're treating me like Aaron up here. I think it's amazing for Jeff to

27:21.320 --> 27:25.920
come out and say, you know, women are just unfairly hated. Your girlfriend's bad at D&D.

27:25.920 --> 27:30.360
I know I've only played it three times, but she's played it twice and she's not good at

27:30.360 --> 27:34.080
it. I'm not making Aaron the N.T. of women. I just don't like the thing that she did

27:34.080 --> 27:39.200
that last night. The irony is that the thing that she does that upsets you is calling you

27:39.200 --> 27:45.680
gay. So we've got into the spiral in cat's asshole of prejudice about prejudice. We need

27:45.680 --> 27:52.200
the prejudice about fantasy prejudice. This is interesting. It's literally fantastic racism.

27:52.200 --> 28:06.960
I just want to absolve the show of this aura of, you know, it's hard to be me and to feel

28:06.960 --> 28:11.120
for other people who have different circumstances because, you know, it's hard to, because I

28:11.120 --> 28:15.760
don't want to believe it, but I guess I do. I'm a heroine savior. This is my fucking

28:15.760 --> 28:23.840
face, Dan Harmon. That clearly worked in this side of the room, but it's too mean of me.

28:23.840 --> 28:34.200
What else is going on? I don't know. I made a YouTube video that might be big. I'm not

28:34.200 --> 28:39.000
going to mention it because it's not about promotion, but, you know, I had a job in the

28:39.000 --> 28:46.380
city that's good. Promotion would be tacky and crass. We want to maintain a baseline of integrity here.

28:46.380 --> 28:53.480
I'm the product and I'm unsellable. God, I'm his heroine so much right now.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.920
What about race, Adam? What do you think about race?

28:55.920 --> 28:58.920
I think there are plenty of them and there's just going to be more.

28:58.920 --> 29:07.000
Wait, wait, wait. What do you know that I don't know? They're making new races?

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
Have you been to Pinkberry lately? I haven't, no. They'll swirl the flavors for you.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Pinkberry's making new races? Pinkberry's making new races.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
They've got a green tea chocolate chip. Green tea chocolate chip Filipino, yeah.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
But wait, Adam, not just to be the devil's advocate, because I got nothing else to talk

29:29.000 --> 29:31.480
about. Don't work for the devil, but go on.

29:31.480 --> 29:34.360
But isn't there going to be less races as we go on?

29:34.360 --> 29:41.560
That's true, that's another take on it. But it's been highly theorized that humanity

29:41.560 --> 29:46.920
will eventually get to the point where once you can get all your brain data backed up,

29:46.920 --> 29:49.920
you can have whatever body you like. You can have octopus slippers.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.920
Well, that's for sure. Yeah, 10 years from now, you're going to...

29:51.920 --> 29:57.640
Transhumanism. The end of racism won't end until we're not related to the body we're

29:57.640 --> 29:59.640
born in. That's going to be the end of everything.

29:59.640 --> 30:04.640
That's got to be 15 years from now. You're going to be able to buy the equivalent of

30:04.640 --> 30:10.200
a video game, and you're going to get to just go into your office and close the door and

30:10.200 --> 30:17.280
type in some variables, and you could be a female dog getting fucked by an octopus.

30:17.280 --> 30:21.680
And then just experience what that's like, and then end the program and never tell anybody

30:21.680 --> 30:24.680
about it.

30:24.680 --> 30:33.800
So how is that going to... Then what's marriage? What's the priest supposed to say then?

30:33.800 --> 30:42.120
I now pronounce you two people who are kind of points of departure. You may kiss whatever

30:42.120 --> 30:43.120
and whoever.

30:43.120 --> 30:48.360
I now pronounce you iny and outy. Society will collapse when we can fuck whoever we

30:48.360 --> 30:53.480
want whenever we want. Jeff, you know that the future of our society is being the octopus

30:53.480 --> 30:56.920
or being the dog. That's going to be the Democrats and the Republican.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.480
You're preaching to the choir, baby.

30:59.480 --> 31:05.560
I think we need to answer a few more questions. We being you, this is Harmontown.

31:05.560 --> 31:10.360
Adam, we got an election coming up, Adam. I don't know if you're aware of this.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.360
Oh boy.

31:11.360 --> 31:15.400
We got a big election coming up. It's right around the corner. Who do you like?

31:15.400 --> 31:23.760
This is a good one because... I campaigned for John Edwards in 2007, back before the

31:23.760 --> 31:24.760
whole...

31:24.760 --> 31:25.760
He's not going to get it.

31:25.760 --> 31:26.760
Oh, he's not going to get it.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.600
Well, usually you campaign for him. That's a long shot.

31:28.600 --> 31:33.960
He cheated on a woman with cancer, which is one of the life sublime glories. It's the

31:33.960 --> 31:39.320
VR experience of the future, as you get to be the kind of person who's down with... So

31:39.320 --> 31:45.640
I was up in New Hampshire. The thought ends itself. You're a participant in that.

31:45.640 --> 31:51.120
And God, the fact that I had to pay my own train ticket up to New Hampshire, got to rank

31:51.120 --> 31:56.040
on some doors and the thing about New Hampshire, everyone seems to own a dog there. I don't

31:56.040 --> 31:57.040
know.

31:57.040 --> 32:02.080
That's my experience. That person agrees, but... And as a person of the Jewish persuasion...

32:02.080 --> 32:07.000
I'm sorry, we don't need to interrupt.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.560
Jewish people are horrified of dogs.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.560
We're listening.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.560
We're listening.

32:11.560 --> 32:17.320
That's fine. I know you have to drink to to get through this. So Jewish people, terrified

32:17.320 --> 32:21.840
of dogs. Everyone in New Hampshire owns a dog. You can see that this is... I was like,

32:21.840 --> 32:25.920
oh, knock, knock. Oh, God, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

32:25.920 --> 32:31.160
Steal yourself out of them. Political activism is its own reward. Every single house.

32:31.160 --> 32:38.040
This has become like a Star Search audition video. That might as well be a hairbrush in

32:38.040 --> 32:39.040
your hands.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.040
Oh, God.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.360
But the point of my story...

32:42.360 --> 32:44.320
So, Romney, you're saying.

32:44.320 --> 32:50.880
Oh, of course. Whichever one is against dog ownership. Freedom for... If you love your

32:50.880 --> 32:56.640
dog, you will let it free. There's nothing... You're not helping it. You're not... That's

32:56.640 --> 33:02.040
digging a hole, but I'll gladly dig it. All right. Dig it. Okay, just bring up Steve

33:02.040 --> 33:03.040
if he's here.

33:03.040 --> 33:10.320
Not yet. Adam Goldberg, everybody. Let's say goodnight to him and let's keep going with

33:10.320 --> 33:15.000
this momentum. Hey, BJ, you want to come up here? It was BJ. BJ's the guy that I armwrestled

33:15.000 --> 33:23.480
that one night. You're not as eager as Adam, but I thought I'd pull you up. I like this

33:23.480 --> 33:27.440
idea that we have a family starting to grow.

33:27.440 --> 33:37.720
Dan, do we owe it to our podcast listeners to describe it? In penetrating detail, exactly.

33:37.720 --> 33:43.360
BJ, stand up. Would you please so I can get a good look at you? BJ, for those of you don't

33:43.360 --> 33:51.600
know him, he won the Great Race, the Amazing Race. What was it called? Amazing Race? Yeah.

33:51.600 --> 33:57.160
He won a million clams for a race. He's got a beard. He has a... What is that? Salmon?

33:57.160 --> 34:02.280
Coral? What's that scarf? What do you call that? Is that kind of a coral? Kind of a coral

34:02.280 --> 34:11.880
scarf. It's a silk scarf. He's got a red flannel plaid robe on, and then he's got a mixed

34:11.880 --> 34:17.880
matched black and white kind of plaid trousers, like pajamas. He's in pajamas. He's in pajamas.

34:17.880 --> 34:27.480
He's pouring vodka into a Coke can right now. He's wearing seafoam crux. Seafoam green? Is that

34:27.480 --> 34:36.060
close? Powder? Different color. One is green, one is light blue. God forbid you would be a

34:36.060 --> 34:44.520
conformist in any way. It's Truman Capote after getting hit by a train. But non-lethally, like

34:44.520 --> 34:50.040
he got bounced off of, bounced into the train yard and put himself back together. Oh, God,

34:50.040 --> 34:57.400
what happened? He's pulled up one of his trouser legs to reveal a pretty crude bandage. You're

34:57.400 --> 35:08.240
wounded, BJ. What the hell happened to you? I fell down. Do you care to elaborate? I was

35:08.240 --> 35:20.960
going really fast. Thanks. Thank you. All right. BJ, everybody. BJ, let's keep it going. Let's

35:20.960 --> 35:29.400
keep it going. What else do we got? New black guy. Do you want to come up? Welcome. New black guy,

35:29.400 --> 35:38.640
everybody. New black guy. Chris? This is Chris, everybody. This guy's black. He's got white

35:38.640 --> 35:43.120
jeans on, lots of holes in the legs. Have you been here before, Chris? I'm sorry? Have you been

35:43.120 --> 35:49.720
here before? No, I have not. Okay. Don't be offended if you're a third black person and you're

35:49.720 --> 35:53.200
somewhere I can't see you and you're like, what am I, chop-liver? I just want to see who the other

35:53.200 --> 35:59.760
black guy was. Oh, Enti. Enti always sits in the front row and he's often been the lightning

35:59.760 --> 36:06.680
rod of my white guilt. Dan, I don't want to send you into a spiral of chaotic mania, but we have a

36:06.680 --> 36:11.920
black woman in the audience tonight. Oh, yeah. It's like doubling down. Yeah, it's crazy. How can I

36:11.920 --> 36:18.320
ever relate to anything that you ever experienced? We'll have you up in a minute. Let's ease into it

36:18.320 --> 36:23.360
with a black gentleman, first of all. Let's also buffer it with like, let's bring up like an Indian

36:23.360 --> 36:27.800
guy in between, I don't know, or just a carpenter, like not so that it's not like a race. Do you have

36:27.800 --> 36:36.960
any mini kanju or any Arapaho in here tonight? No? No, go ahead. All right, so Chris, if there's

36:36.960 --> 36:41.160
anything you want to say or else we can ask you questions, I don't know. I mean, you can ask me

36:41.160 --> 36:48.400
whatever. Okay. Well, what are you? Are you a student? No, I'm an assistant at a production company. It's

36:48.400 --> 36:54.040
not really stupid. No, it's nothing. There's nothing. I mean, we didn't break, you know, it's not that

36:54.040 --> 37:00.520
kind of, you don't have to plug anything. Can you tell us what kind of production that you're

37:00.520 --> 37:09.960
working on? It's a TV show. I don't really like a reality show or sitcom or leverage on TNT. Is that

37:09.960 --> 37:19.680
Timothy Hutton from the dark side? What was the show with the crows or the ravens, the Stephen

37:19.680 --> 37:30.280
King story? Dark side? No, no, no. No, I wasn't mad at you. The dark half, the dark half. That was

37:30.280 --> 37:40.520
Timothy Hutton, right? Yes. Okay. And I emerged victorious. Sorry, Chris. Is Timothy Hutton a

37:40.520 --> 37:47.920
producer on that show? No, he's just like the main talent. Yeah, he swings a big dick. He comes

37:47.920 --> 37:51.080
through the office and he goes, who the fuck threw this away? Well, I mean, I don't really

37:51.080 --> 38:03.000
understand why, but whatever. He was an ordinary people. What do you do in the show? I work for

38:03.000 --> 38:08.600
the COO of the production company. So I don't really like work for the show show. So you're on

38:08.600 --> 38:13.520
payroll with the, with like the studio? Like the little production pod? Yeah. Dean Devlin's

38:13.520 --> 38:20.320
company. Oh, Dean Devlin. He did Independence Day, no one knows who. I had a meeting with Dean

38:20.320 --> 38:25.640
Devlin. We met at Shroud back in our, back in our heyday. We had a meeting with him and Roland

38:25.640 --> 38:32.480
Emmerich. And he said that they were excited about Godzilla because they took this thing that was

38:32.480 --> 38:45.200
cheesy and they turned it into something awesome. Are you an aspiring filmmaker? No, actually,

38:45.200 --> 38:51.200
it was, I kind of just moved out LA on a whim. And I just needed something to do. So I worked at a

38:51.200 --> 38:56.960
production company. Fuck it. I'm moving away soon. Oh, really? You've had enough? Yeah, I mean, I've

38:56.960 --> 39:02.480
been here for like three years. So that Timothy Hutton's really getting under your skin. You've

39:02.480 --> 39:09.840
had enough of that fucking asshole. I just had sex, whatever. Wait, but this is now, now you've

39:09.840 --> 39:13.920
got me curious, because there's people, the young people that come to LA, they're, they're hungry

39:13.920 --> 39:18.040
and they want something. If you're moving away, you're, what, what's the aspiration? Is there

39:18.040 --> 39:25.400
something? I'm moving to Peru to teach English. Are you just, oh, okay, okay. I was about to say,

39:25.400 --> 39:29.480
are you just like a trust fun kid? You're very, you're, okay. So you're, you're, you're, but

39:29.480 --> 39:37.440
you're, you're like a, you're like a, kind of a hippie, like, I've done a drug or two. And you're

39:37.440 --> 39:42.160
just kind of, can I ask how old are you? 25. Yeah, okay. Are you going to go to Peru and do

39:42.160 --> 39:48.360
that? Was it called ayahuasca or ayahuasca? Oh God, yes. Oh, really? Are you really going to do

39:48.360 --> 39:54.280
it? Yeah. Like that's my mission to find a shaman in the Amazon forest, like 200 miles away from

39:54.280 --> 40:01.400
civilization. Get really fucked up and then go teach English. I'd probably be better at it. The

40:01.400 --> 40:10.040
first English phrase they all, all your students learn is, oh, look at my hand. Jaguar is, is, is

40:10.040 --> 40:16.360
asking me for a job interview. Ayahuasca is the thing from, but well, this isn't going to help you

40:16.360 --> 40:25.040
from altered states. The William Hurt movie, you guys are whatever. It's, it's Rob. Rob's coming up

40:25.040 --> 40:32.760
next. You drink, you drink this like it's made out of like herbs and root and they just crush it up

40:32.760 --> 40:37.640
and make a drink out of it. You go to the Amazon of this shaman, like, like puts it down your gullet

40:37.640 --> 40:42.640
and then you freak out. And you barf, you barf for a while, right? You barf and have you done it

40:42.640 --> 40:46.760
before? And just do everything. Have you done it before? No, I know people who have done it. Right.

40:46.760 --> 40:52.160
Like, yeah. So how primary is that? Is that the primary thing you're going down there for? No, not

40:52.160 --> 40:59.920
even a little bit. Like that's not my first goal. That's just a side mission. Do you speak

40:59.920 --> 41:05.480
Spanish well? No, but I speak French and Creole, so it won't be hard to learn it. I'll take your word

41:05.480 --> 41:11.360
for it. What? I say I'm going to do it as I learn it. It's not simple. He's 25. He's a millennial.

41:11.360 --> 41:18.400
They don't, they don't, they don't care. They're socially conscious and they, they, they, they're

41:18.400 --> 41:24.800
comfortable in the world. I don't know. It's a, it's a new thing. They're, they're reacting to

41:24.800 --> 41:31.760
Generation X. They're like, why, why did you, why, why, why, why Weezer? Why? Why not? Why not?

41:31.760 --> 41:38.360
Now, Chris, if it was 1830, what do you think you, what would be a, I mean, let's, I mean, what do

41:38.360 --> 41:54.400
you think you'd be up to? Don't ask black people time travel. Just as a rule. Seriously, don't

41:54.400 --> 41:59.640
like it because we can't go back. Please let that be the title of the episode. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No,

41:59.640 --> 42:08.880
that's great. That's the title of this episode. Don't ask black people time travel. Yeah, yeah,

42:08.880 --> 42:14.000
stands out of here. I mean, there's just too good. All right. Well, all right. Well, let's, let's,

42:14.000 --> 42:18.480
let's, let's, let's, let's, let's end on a high point like Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you for

42:18.480 --> 42:29.520
being a sport. All right, let's, let's, let's go to black female. Do you want to come up? What

42:29.520 --> 42:40.320
is your name? Char. Char. Star. Oh, star. Oh, she has a star. She's wearing a star hair. Star.

42:40.320 --> 42:48.240
Star with two Rs. Maybe. No, just, just spelled like the celestial body. That's my, my whole name

42:48.240 --> 42:54.440
Starlene, but I just go by star. Nice. Short for Starlene. That's awesome. Does that star glow in

42:54.440 --> 42:59.600
the dark? What do you have on your head? No, it's just, it's like a Scott Pilgrim thing. Like, I'm

42:59.600 --> 43:06.320
just a big nerd. Sorry. Are you from LA? No, I'm originally from Miami. But I mean, do you live

43:06.320 --> 43:12.080
in LA now? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. North Hollywood. How long have you been here? About two and a half

43:12.080 --> 43:19.120
years. What are your dreams and ambitions? I would like to be a cartoonist and print books and stuff

43:19.120 --> 43:24.840
like that. I just have a webcomic now. So it's, what's it called? Let's plug it. Oh, candy. Candy

43:24.840 --> 43:31.200
comics.com with an eye. Candy with an eye. Candy comics with an eye. Yeah. It's short for candy

43:31.200 --> 43:38.560
apia. All right. So you want to be a cartoonist, you're making it happen for yourself. You're not

43:38.560 --> 43:45.240
a quitter like Chris, you're not going to just fling yourself off into the ice fishing. Go get

43:45.240 --> 43:51.600
hired with a show. That's pretty awesome, though. Like, no, no, he's, he's more activated than us.

43:51.600 --> 43:55.680
Far more noble to go teach. You're like me. You're going to stay here and you're going to, you're

43:55.680 --> 44:02.000
proclaimed to God that you'd rather die of starvation while you do what you do. And then 15

44:02.000 --> 44:06.080
years from now. Pretty much. Yeah. Well, God help you star. Yeah.

44:06.080 --> 44:17.640
How old are you star? 29. 29. He looks like a 22. I moisturize a lot. Just naturally, you know, my

44:17.640 --> 44:23.160
products are just, you're like, she's a great slow. You don't want to look ashy. You have to. You

44:23.160 --> 44:30.920
have to. You get ashy. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that. I know, I know about that culture. I know what

44:30.920 --> 44:36.040
ashy means. I went to predominantly black grade schools and middle schools, Jeff. I was surrounded

44:36.040 --> 44:43.960
by people constantly struggling with ashyness. You're a real hero. Yeah. Boy, I didn't know you'd

44:43.960 --> 44:52.840
been through so much struggle. I dwelt among them, Jeff. I'm sort of like a man called horse. I

44:52.840 --> 44:58.840
was 80s references that don't, I'm already out on a limb of being racist, ironically. And then I,

44:58.840 --> 45:05.800
and then I'm busting out my Tron references. There's no difference between the show and Christmas

45:05.800 --> 45:16.640
with your uncle. It's like, oh, I'm sorry. There's a difference. $10. At least your uncle gives you

45:16.640 --> 45:23.360
socks. Your uncle gives you $10. I'm so sorry, you guys. There's a pair of socks waiting for each of

45:23.360 --> 45:30.320
you by the she-hulk section on your way out. All right, star. Well, let's see. Is there anything

45:30.320 --> 45:36.960
on your mind? You got an open pulpit here. I just like hearing you talk. I don't. Really? I've heard

45:36.960 --> 45:41.560
that before. Like people say, you know what? Because sometimes the show's going bad. I go,

45:41.560 --> 45:45.920
like, ah, this show sucks. And then people go, yeah, but at a certain point, people just like to

45:45.920 --> 45:51.520
listen to you talk. Yeah. Like for whatever reason, all your ramblings end up coming back to some type

45:51.520 --> 45:58.640
of like life affirming point. Yeah. And I just, I don't know, somehow listening to you worry about

45:58.640 --> 46:04.400
everything makes me feel like comforted. Like, okay, I'm not the only one that worries. You know

46:04.400 --> 46:09.520
what I think it is, although I'm the least qualified to say it, I feel like if I were not me, the

46:09.520 --> 46:18.360
thing that would comfort me about listening to me would be like watching me thrash and flail so,

46:18.360 --> 46:26.840
so hard. Like, and actually, like, it's like, well, if there, if there, if things were that bad,

46:26.840 --> 46:31.520
he would have knocked into something by now that would really bum me the fuck out. But really,

46:31.520 --> 46:38.440
it's, I'm so pathetic. I just kind of like, it's like, it's like, if you, if you, if you take acid,

46:38.440 --> 46:42.560
like, I don't know if you're like Chris, if you like, like, you know, like a big drughead. But like,

46:42.560 --> 46:49.200
when I was Chris's age, like, you know, Chris, we're worried about you. You take mushrooms,

46:49.200 --> 46:53.440
you take acid, and there's such a thing as a bad trip, you know, people are scared about a bad

46:53.440 --> 47:00.120
trip. And then there's this idea that worrying about a bad trip can give you a bad trip. So what

47:00.120 --> 47:05.240
happens is this fence goes up, we go like, no, I don't want to talk about it. It's very similar to

47:05.240 --> 47:10.840
any kind of like, like, like, anything. Like, it just always, that's the human mind at work. We

47:10.840 --> 47:16.240
build these fences up, because it's often very healthy of us to sequester ourselves and limit

47:16.240 --> 47:20.760
ourselves. So like, like humans under duress, like you pay, put this on your tongue, and you're

47:20.760 --> 47:25.440
gonna see spots, and you're gonna, the owls might talk to you. Also, you may fucking freak out,

47:25.440 --> 47:31.160
and you think that the earth is opening up and a hand made of logs is dragging you down. But,

47:31.160 --> 47:35.880
but, but just keep eating oranges, and that won't happen. And like, don't talk about it, you're

47:35.880 --> 47:41.880
gonna make it happen, bro, you're gonna make it happen. I try as hard as I can to make it happen,

47:41.880 --> 47:47.600
and it doesn't happen. And I think that's uplifting. Maybe that's my personal theory, as

47:47.600 --> 47:51.680
why people would possibly be willing to tolerate me talking. Because they go, well, if you can't

47:51.680 --> 47:57.640
destroy the earth with your mouth, then maybe it has some sturdiness to it. Maybe things aren't

47:57.640 --> 48:10.240
that bad. Do you agree with that, Star? Yes, I do. Star, ladies and gentlemen. I'm starting to feel,

48:10.240 --> 48:18.640
I think I might be the next Paula Poundstone. We're in Dick Cavett country right now. This is

48:18.640 --> 48:29.800
nice. Who's your friend? Asian guy, come up. Asian guy! What's your name, sir? Jason. Jason,

48:29.800 --> 48:35.160
everybody. Welcome, Jason, to the stage. All right, what's going on? Jason, Jason, what's,

48:35.160 --> 48:44.880
what are Asian people thinking? Why are Asian people second best to you? Oh, yeah, you check

48:44.880 --> 48:52.560
that to heart. Make a comparison. Well, because Asian, to me, in my mind, Asian is half of the

48:52.560 --> 48:57.360
earth. And in fact, the half of the earth that is like teaming with people, so more than half of

48:57.360 --> 49:03.320
the earth. But it just means eastern, because we've gotten so tied up and like, well, I don't want

49:03.320 --> 49:09.840
to be racist by ordering a Korean beer in a Chinese restaurant. So we've started to, you know, and the

49:09.840 --> 49:15.600
most racist thing you could ever do is confuse a Chinese person for a Vietnamese person, etc. So

49:15.600 --> 49:22.400
I'm pretty convinced that white people at one point decided, okay, Asian, let's go. You used to be

49:22.400 --> 49:28.240
Oriental, like, and then we rightfully decided, like, well, that sounds a little awkward and weird.

49:28.240 --> 49:34.800
What is your heritage? Korean. Korean. Anyways, that's the answer. It's like, I don't know,

49:34.800 --> 49:42.760
black's more specific, man. Asian, come on, dime a dozen. I mean, to the point where, you know,

49:42.760 --> 49:47.920
there's some Asian countries that are like, you have to have just one baby. There's too many Asian

49:47.920 --> 49:55.800
people. That's what they're saying. The Asian people are saying it. I didn't say it. Jason,

49:55.800 --> 50:02.840
you're more than welcome here. Just saying, like, I read the news. I don't read the news. I don't

50:02.840 --> 50:09.640
read the news. I get the news about Chinese people from my mother in 1983. Where did you grow up,

50:09.640 --> 50:14.560
Jason? What's that? Where did you grow up here? You know, like, yeah, where'd you go to school? In the

50:14.560 --> 50:21.560
Valley, in North Hollywood, and Burbank. Oh, cool. Yeah. Not that exciting. Nobody's that

50:21.560 --> 50:25.200
exciting. I'm bringing up people because I'm not exciting. Who cares, you know, what's, yeah, who

50:25.200 --> 50:41.040
knows? What are you doing? What are your dreams, aspirations? I am living them already. Can we

50:41.040 --> 50:48.680
ask? Can we pry? Well, I worked in music, so I wanted to do since I was a kid, so I worked out

50:48.680 --> 50:53.800
well enough. What do you do? Are you a musician or do you? No, I work with a lot of musicians and

50:53.800 --> 51:03.320
also work for BMG, do a lot of stuff for them. You're an engineer? Right now I'm doing royalty

51:03.320 --> 51:10.440
stuff. But yeah. You like music that much that just being close to it in that capacity is exciting

51:10.440 --> 51:15.360
for you. Yeah, for money thing, I'm just doing. We're the big companies, but also working with

51:15.360 --> 51:20.840
artists, so I do that on the side. Hmm. Do you feel that Dan Harmon's been fair to the Asians at

51:20.840 --> 51:25.080
Harmontown? Do you feel represented or do you feel there's a lack of Asian representation? I think

51:25.080 --> 51:34.920
there's been favoritism. But to a large extent. But you know, how are Asian people with time

51:34.920 --> 51:50.200
travel questions? I think it depends on the country and the time. Okay, it's it's it's Burma. 1822.

51:50.200 --> 52:02.440
I think. Oh, he's got something. I think Asians are cool with Burma. I don't I haven't read anything

52:02.440 --> 52:08.920
about Asians versus Burmese. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't read any problems. Right. You hear that 1822

52:08.920 --> 52:18.160
Burma? That's a that's a badge you can put on your website. You're gonna get a pass. Your parents

52:18.160 --> 52:25.520
are there. How many generations deep since we know since you're ethnically Asian that at some point

52:25.520 --> 52:34.520
in your lineage, someone came over after a Mayflower thing. That's all I know. How many where

52:34.520 --> 52:41.680
are your parents? America where they born American where your parents moved here. And your parents

52:41.680 --> 52:46.960
are your grandparents. My parents. Okay, so your second generation Korean. That's America. I don't

52:46.960 --> 52:50.760
know how those things work. Yeah. So I think that's what that means second generation because your

52:50.760 --> 52:56.120
parents were immigrants, right? Am I getting this right? I feel like Archie Bunker. He's first

52:56.120 --> 53:00.560
generation America. Oh, oh, first generation Korean American. There you go. So what so his

53:00.560 --> 53:10.280
parents are zero. Yeah, because they're they're Korean. Interesting. This is a great night at

53:10.280 --> 53:13.760
our town. You know, I need to know this stuff. I'm going to start my own town. I need to know

53:13.760 --> 53:22.280
what to say to the Korean people as they join the town. You're zero. Welcome aboard. So this

53:22.280 --> 53:28.120
break. So okay, this is good because I thought like your parents there. So English is a second

53:28.120 --> 53:34.400
language for them. Yeah. So and they are they proof we call them pretty traditional. I mean,

53:34.400 --> 53:44.480
compared to you, Shirley. Yeah. Right. So all right. Your mom and dad's thoughts about black people.

53:44.480 --> 53:50.480
This is because this is what I find fascinating. Like, like, what, what's, you know, like, I'm up

53:50.480 --> 53:56.040
on Mount Olympus, you know, I'm drinking my Diet Coke and watching everybody fight it out. Like,

53:56.040 --> 54:00.920
what's what are the like, but you need to get these glimpses of like, oh, Koreans are the Korean

54:00.920 --> 54:04.960
shop owners, like, like so racist against the black guy, you see it in a movie and you go like,

54:04.960 --> 54:09.440
what's going on? What? Why aren't you guys just burning down the White House? Why aren't you

54:09.440 --> 54:15.720
just mad because you're all poor? And the answer is fucking hegemony. I'm like, like, like, white

54:15.720 --> 54:22.400
people are genius manipulators. So we've taken over the earth. So I want to know what your mom

54:22.400 --> 54:29.920
and dad will like what the weird racist shit they say in the living room about black people. Also,

54:29.920 --> 54:37.560
what are their names? First of all, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. They don't say anything racist. See,

54:37.560 --> 54:42.000
we're just trying to get stuff out based on what happened between Koreans and black people. No,

54:42.000 --> 54:46.320
no, no, no, I'm fine. I'm doing my thing. I'm flailing around and proving that the world's not

54:46.320 --> 54:53.000
that bad. See, see, you just kick every rock over. There's not a scorpion under it. There's

54:53.000 --> 54:57.400
nothing. Nothing's going wrong. Do you ever go to Korea? Have you been there? Yeah. You enjoyed

54:57.400 --> 55:04.680
there? North or south, by the way? That's important. South. Yeah. Okay. Those are good. Good guys. Yeah.

55:04.680 --> 55:17.440
Good guys. Those are the good guys. Yeah. All right. What else? What else? What's going on?

55:17.440 --> 55:26.680
Good. What are we? This is your last chance to ask a first generation Korean something. Don't

55:26.680 --> 55:36.640
waste it then. Breaking bad? What do you think about breaking bad? Breaking bad? Pretty great.

55:36.640 --> 55:42.400
All right. Yeah. See, you're kind of like just like an American person. I am. Yeah, I am more

55:42.400 --> 55:48.440
American, pretty whitewash. Yeah. It's almost like race is an artificial construct. Yeah.

55:48.440 --> 55:58.640
Boring. All right. It's Jason, everybody. Jason. I didn't mean you were boring.

55:58.640 --> 56:04.680
May I make a suggestion? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep going with the racial census of Harmontown.

56:04.680 --> 56:10.560
Get a Hispanic up here. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. That's very important, actually. And I'll tell

56:10.560 --> 56:18.320
you why. Big failing on community. We had Ken Jong, who's Korean, but who apparently ended up

56:18.320 --> 56:22.760
playing a Chinese character. That was always a point of contention. Then Danny Pudi, who was

56:22.760 --> 56:28.000
Indian, was playing a guy who was scripted as Palestinian. That was a point of contention.

56:28.000 --> 56:35.760
But there was basically no Latino people, Latino, Latin people. I thought Starburns was Latino.

56:35.760 --> 56:42.920
This is closer. All right. Who's going to represent the Latin America? Here we go.

56:42.920 --> 56:58.800
What's your name, ma'am? Piper. Piper? Aye, aye, aye. We did have Juliet. I remember when she

56:58.800 --> 57:05.080
was in town, she came up. She's full blown Mexican. She's actually living in Mexico trying to get a

57:05.080 --> 57:10.920
job up here. She's also an animator, too, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Piper, what do you do? I work in

57:10.920 --> 57:21.000
healthcare. Well, I can be specific and say healthcare finance, but that's a little bit more

57:21.000 --> 57:27.520
boring than just healthcare. But it really is so boring. It's fascinating to people who are sick

57:27.520 --> 57:33.800
and tired of hearing about actors and headshots and scripts and stuff. Healthcare is something

57:33.800 --> 57:39.720
you hear. To me, it just bounces off of my head. We're doing political debates right now. We're

57:39.720 --> 57:49.320
talking about HMOs and hedge nuns and the fucking hedge nuns. I don't know what the hell Medicare,

57:49.320 --> 57:53.320
what I don't know what any of that means. I don't expect you to explain it to me. What is your

57:53.320 --> 58:03.560
heritage? Where your ancestors from? I'm Puerto Rican. Puerto Rican? Yeah. Are you going to take

58:03.560 --> 58:13.800
that? I mean, I'm only a half-blood, so. Right. Wait, did you grow up in a bilingual household?

58:13.800 --> 58:19.320
Yes. How'd you do in English classes in school, like writing essays and stuff?

58:19.320 --> 58:26.920
Pretty well. Yeah. I have an ex-girlfriend of mine was an English teacher in Los Angeles,

58:26.920 --> 58:33.240
and there's a phenomenon where very, very bright kids who grew up in bilingual households who

58:33.240 --> 58:38.520
was just where LA is teeming with that. These genius kids, I mean, how many, I don't speak two

58:38.520 --> 58:44.200
languages, but these kids are like, regardless of their IQ, they grow up in these households

58:44.200 --> 58:52.200
where you're bouncing back and forth between Spanish and English, for instance. Apparently,

58:54.040 --> 58:58.200
they suffer in the English grades because they don't actually, they don't get to

58:58.200 --> 59:05.080
buckle down and be Frasier at English. They're more acrobatic, which is a talent unto itself

59:05.080 --> 59:09.720
that should be more valuable than it is, but anyways, I was just curious about that. Well,

59:09.720 --> 59:17.800
I mean, my mother grew up in the States, so it's not like, I just mainly got yelled at in Spanish,

59:17.800 --> 59:23.720
or, you know, like any. Do you speak Spanish? I can read it and write it, but I don't speak it well.

59:23.720 --> 59:29.080
Look, we asked for, let's say, put that down. You're grounded. Clean your room. You're not good

59:29.080 --> 59:33.560
enough. You know, average things that every Hispanic mom says. Is there anyone who feels

59:33.560 --> 59:39.400
they're more Hispanic than? You probably are. You probably are. Oh, no. I see silence. You

59:39.400 --> 59:43.400
win the Thunderdome. You're fine. I thought it'd be interesting if somebody came up and, like,

59:43.400 --> 59:56.120
tried to knock your hat off. All right. What do we ask? What do we ask Piper? What do you think

59:56.120 --> 01:00:03.400
of my writing? You know, I think you're a genius, which I'm not just saying to kiss your ass.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:10.040
That's interesting. I find it interesting. I was told not to respond to any text tonight

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:16.440
because I'm with my hero and didn't want to get heckled. Oh, do I bug people about getting texts

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:22.520
and stuff in the audience? No, just because I was sitting up front. Oh, yeah. It's pretty

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.720
laissez-faire here. It's not rigorously structured. I didn't want to be rude. Okay, Dan Harmon.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.920
Although Jeff will come down on you pretty hard if you're my girlfriend. As far as I can tell,

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:38.520
that's the only standard that's actually upheld. I mean, the night's not over yet. Are you familiar

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:45.080
with my girlfriend, Erin McGathy? No, you know, I've got to be honest. I really just started

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:51.240
watching Community because I'm in love with Donald Glover. Can I just plug that? Yeah. No, you

01:00:51.240 --> 01:01:05.720
can plug that. Yeah. Can I strap that on? Yeah, no, it's good. The kid could use a break. Like,

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:12.040
that's all. Do what you can. Did I spread the word that Donald Glover's out there? He needs your

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:17.880
help, everybody. He's amazing. I think he's, you know, I hate to play favorites and people always

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.680
like, but I would always say people would go as your favorite and then I would go. Nobody,

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.840
I'm not allowed to say that, but then I would always also, supposedly ironically, I would go.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.760
But Donald's my favorite. But the beauty is, I wasn't being ironic. I mean, he's amazing.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:38.680
And he works really hard. And he puts out rap albums and all of his raps are about how hard he

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:44.680
works and how women need to get used to the fact that I'm going to keep working really hard.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:51.640
I'm going to stay up all night. You got a problem with that? I got work to do.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:01.400
It's funny. And he really means it. And some of his raps get really dark,

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.280
like, because he's like, he's actually like literally talking about like working until he

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.800
dropped dead. Kind of like, like it's a, it's poetic. It's disgusting. It's beautiful.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.240
Dan, do you think there's a way this might be too high concept? And if it is, we can edit it out

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.000
from the podcast. Do you think we can bring Spencer up our dungeon master and bring all

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.800
of the people we have of different ethnicities and put them in some sort of D&D Thunderdome

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:29.240
together and maybe settle some, some weird racial Thunderdome?

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.000
I think the only person that's not, that would have a problem with that is Spencer,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.880
because you're talking about characters need character sheets. Is that above and beyond

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:45.080
the call of duty? Spencer, come on up. Let's try, let's try it out.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.440
I'm not sure what's on the table here, but I'm just saying it's like

01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:03.240
we have Spencer, our dungeon master here. We're going to try to settle some old racial scores

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:10.440
here. You're saying we have all of our ethnic guests. Who feels unrepresented ethnically right

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:21.400
now? Anybody? All right, we're good. Does Adam know that Asperger's is in a race? Or is he going

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:29.720
to come bounding up again? We could make him an honorary race. But yeah, I mean what, they're

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.280
going to have to share a microphone. It might be more trouble than it's worth. It's the kind

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:40.760
of idea that makes everyone clap, but then turns out like it doesn't really work. Is there a way

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.560
to make that work, Spencer, or no? Well, I mean, I don't know how to teach tons of people how to

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:50.520
play, but if you guys go along with like that, you're just acting in the in the story of what

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:55.080
the hell we're talking about on stage, like it should be kind of okay. I could make a suggestion.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.320
I don't want to put things too much on the rails, but I am a writer by profession and a storyteller.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:06.760
My suggestion would be that maybe perhaps at some point in the adventure that unfolds, maybe we

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:15.480
would encounter some kind of spiritual situation where there would call for a chorus of spirits

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:22.520
from beyond a multi and that would be like a green chorus. I'm just trying to reverse engineer

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.440
from what it's the reality is going to be like eight people standing in front of a microphone

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.640
going like this. So what would they be playing? Maybe or maybe a hydra.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:39.800
A racial hydra. Should we get Steve up here? Yeah, Steve Agee who was here last week.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:46.600
I know you're you're wondering what you should do, Piper. I wonder too.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.680
Well, well, first of all, let's give Piper her props and we'll let you can have your seat so

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:58.840
that you're a little bit offended. You didn't ask me what my family thinks about black. Well,

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:05.400
I didn't ask everybody. I only asked the Korean guy what his family because I didn't I mean,

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:11.320
I don't know, somehow it felt funnier to do that. Maybe that's a new I discovered a new form of

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:17.160
racism that that I think that's hilarious that Korean people and black people think if they

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.560
wouldn't get along. But I didn't I didn't find anything funny about the idea of digging that up

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:26.920
with with with you. That's okay. I was just feeling left out. Well, don't know. It's all because I

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.080
am a horrible, weird twisted labyrinth of racism. How do your parents feel about black people? Yeah,

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:37.000
tell us now. I mean, I solely date black guys. So they're pretty used to it by now. But it's

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
the reason you do it is because obviously they hate black people. No, no, I mean, I think they're

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.440
okay with it. Why Donald Glover and I should get married. But your dad didn't sit on the edge of

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:54.360
your bed at night and go, will you do me one favor? If you could do one thing for me, Piper,

01:05:54.360 --> 01:06:02.040
please just like really. I mean, something I mean, like when you have a fetish like that,

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.920
maybe, well, I don't know. My mom didn't like hate redheads. No, I mean, I don't care. I'm from

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:11.320
Seattle. My parents are very liberal. What do you think it was? So you're saying you're you're

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:16.280
owning a an actual physical fetish. Like if you if you're walking down the street, you see an

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:23.320
attractive African American man, you you you're gonna like your senses are heightened. Like my

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:29.320
spidey senses. Yeah, probably. Yeah. So what do you think that's childhood experience? Do you think

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:35.080
there was some hot guy that like, you know, I don't even know. Yeah, I don't know. Because I don't

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:40.280
know. I have a thing about redheads. And I don't know, you know, like I had a redhead aunt. That's

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:47.000
creepy. Batgirl was a redhead. I used to watch Batman reruns and Batgirl when she would, Yvonne

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.960
Craig, when she would become Batgirl, she'd have this beautiful red wig like flowing out from under

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:57.000
her bat mask. And she'd be kicking around under tights. And but then there was also Nicole

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.720
McHugh in kindergarten. Like she was this beautiful little redhead. Well, you can't say a kindergarteners

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:10.200
beautiful. I was a kindergartener too. I was I wasn't in a van outside the school. This is hot

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:25.560
kindergarteners. She had everything, man. Could she finger paint? I remember distinctly remember

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.800
her as being a redhead. That's got to be as far back as you can possibly go. That was so but I

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:35.880
don't know. The question is, is my circuit board, does it have a predilection? Do I see the red hair

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:42.120
and it's instinctive? Is there something or is it a childhood experience? We go to our graves

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:47.960
wondering about that. I mean, maybe it was the lack of growing up. I mean, I grew up with like two

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:57.080
black kids. Maybe. I mean, I, you know, I don't know. Yeah. It's like being in Harmontown. Yeah,

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:07.160
except for NT is my neighbor. So I get to see him all the time. Sorry, Dan. Any? I mean, I wish.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.520
Hey, what's that? There's more. There's more to this thing.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:22.520
Oh, yeah, no, you can sit down. Yeah. You know, like that, that spiraled very quickly because I

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:27.320
was like, who's more embarrassed and who like what's what's the backstory? What's going on? I

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.880
could now know it's forever rotating. I don't want to embarrass you guys.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:41.240
Well, because obviously there's some kind of weird platonic. Maybe not. Maybe. No, but I'm saying

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.880
like, we don't, maybe the driver's turned off to the Madonna in after this. I don't, I don't know

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:51.720
who feels what and what's going on. But I know, I know a minefield when I see one. Like, and I've

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.360
been in them and I've, I've appreciated it if people didn't bother to exacerbate it. Steve,

01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.680
AG, how do your parents feel about black people? My parents are dead. They were killed by black

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:09.880
people. Why don't you ask me how I feel about black people, Jeff? Because you own everything.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.440
I assume they're fine with them. My parents are all alive, actually.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.880
My parents were too fine with black people. My parents were so fine with black people that

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.920
they made me racist. They made me the new definition of racist, which is racially obsessed. I've

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:33.480
talked about this a lot of, a lot. Like, it's my, my, my origin story is my mom had, I was playing

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:40.200
with these two Sesame Street figures. One was Gordon and one was Lewis or maybe Mr. Hooper.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:47.160
Let's keep it simple. We're playing with a Mr. Hooper character. That's amazing.

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:59.400
He owned a store. And my mom said, what's the, what's the difference between those two guys

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:05.080
that you're playing with? And I was like, I don't know. She's like, really? You don't know? You

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.560
don't know anything different about them? I said, well, one guy's got an orange shirt. I said,

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:15.320
I said something like Trivial. And my mom, if she had stopped their fucking bullseye,

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:21.560
great 70s liberal mom, instead, she goes like, that is so good because the difference is one

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:27.880
is black and one is white. And it's so good that you don't know because a lot of people do know

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:33.640
the difference. And it's a big thing in this country. And you're going to learn, but my mom

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.640
had a well intended like, like, stuff just made a balloon animal out of my brain. And there was

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:45.640
a mini series about the Holocaust on network TV at some point when I was a kid. And I remember

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:51.080
my mom coming into my bedroom and sitting on the foot of my bed and going, Daniel, wake up. Listen.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.640
It may not happen tomorrow, but it will happen at some point. There is going to be a time when

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:04.280
people start to deny that something called the Holocaust happened. Whoa, what? And you need to

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:11.560
remember that it happened because I might be dead saw a Holocaust deniers. Well, I think they were

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.200
around at the time. I think she read a crawl at the end of a fucking movie and took it to the

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.520
streets. I don't think she was that imaginative. This is the same woman who said of everyone

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.880
loves Raymond. Are these writers under our floorboards? She's pretty impressionable.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:32.040
That's why I moved to LA because I like, like, how do I get this woman to love me? The answer was

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.840
obvious. Like, like, like make the talking box talk.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:46.120
Still hasn't fucking worked. She's still a bitch. All right. All right. It's holy shit. It's 9 30.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:53.160
Yeah. Oh, fuck. Spencer, I love race. Spencer, our denture master, bring us up to date. Where are

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:59.400
we in our journey? When we last met, our heroes had newly resolved to end Admiral Darkstar's

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:05.240
blight on the forest. Coming upon the mound of corpses, Sharpian company discovered an unlikely

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.560
ally in the form of Morris Goldbright, a cleric. Swiftly, they came upon the dark ziggurat,

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.280
thinking quickly quark hit himself in among corpses, infiltrating the dark compound.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:21.400
With a stolen cloak, Sharpie smuggled his compatriots in through the front door.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:27.560
After defeating a skeletal abomination, Sharpie, quark, Mulraine and Morris stopped taking a breather

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:36.200
before the climactic encounter upstairs. Spencer, I love you so much. That was really good.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.920
That was really good. We should call it quits. But more important, more important than me loving

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.160
you. I want to say because I never get a chance to tell you, everybody, everybody loves you.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:50.920
Don't don't don't don't don't let that affect you. I love you guys too. You're all really great.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:55.000
Thanks for the comment that I hear all the time is man, did you hit the fucking jackpot?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.040
Was he a plant? What are you? You asked for a dungeon master and he raised his hand and he

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:02.200
came up and the original idea was that we were going to try out different people every week.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.520
We'd find the best dungeon master, but we found Spencer like everyone else can go.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.640
Is that right? Yeah. Can I tell you guys a weird story about that is like I listened to your podcast

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.280
a few times and I was going to come like the week before I came up on stage and I couldn't

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.520
and I thought it was a different time. So I was just but when I was listening, I heard you and

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.960
you never said it, but I was like, you know, I bet if I went there, I might be able to dungeon

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.200
master for Dan Harmon. Like that was literally a thought in my head. It was the stupidest and you

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.800
know, you never entertained those thoughts, but then I show up and then he asked and I was like,

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.320
Oh shit. Yeah. This one hand shut up and we brought him on stage. Like, have you ever been

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.040
a dungeon master? He's like, Yeah, today. I was I was making character sheets this afternoon.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.320
It was amazing. It's the kind of connection that white people have with each other.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:53.960
Yeah, you don't know what it's like. Star, NT, Chris, Jason, what is your what is your heritage

01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:02.040
Spencer? What are your ancestors hail from? I'm Viking cleveland. I didn't guard Cleveland.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.480
I'm told I have some Native American in my blood, but I don't I don't qualify for those

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:16.040
scholarships. So who cares? Not enough. So you're part Native American part where like

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:23.960
German, Polish, what are you? German? I don't know. I'm sorry. Is that a thing? Is that a thing

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:29.000
that white people do where they go like I'm part Native American, not enough to qualify for one

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:39.560
of this? Can we not leave going not just strip all the buffalo and rape the earth to exterminate

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:45.560
them. I was just confined them to and then put casinos where they live and take all that money.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:55.640
And then not enough to go on fucking scholars. I'm just trying to pay for laughing, but like

01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:04.760
it's it's so amazing. We are an amazing race. BJ, BJ everybody, BJ. All right, so Spencer,

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.840
let's examine those upstairs. What do we got up there? Can we walk up there? Well, hold up you guys.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.320
Standing at the foot of the staircase ascending upwards into darkness, you decide to take

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.720
quick break to catch your breath. You reflect on all you've been through and everything you've

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:47.800
overcome. Ding, you gain a level. It feels good, doesn't it? God damn it.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:52.920
But now, Spencer, what does that mean? It means you are incrementally stronger

01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.760
with a sense of empowerment and a slight incremental advantage. You decide to head upstairs.

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:07.720
Wait, a sense of entitlement or empowerment? Empowerment and entitlement. I increased my

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:14.680
sense of entitlement. I should kill so many more dragons than I do. I'm level two. These stairs

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:25.400
don't mean nothing. All right, so I walk up the stairs. You head up the stairs. Do you guys

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:35.880
follow her? Wait for me. Oh, Morris Goldbright. I follow. You head up the stairs for what seems

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:43.160
to be five minutes. Are there a lot of stairs? Are we just taking our time? You don't even know.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:52.920
You can't even tell. Is it dark? The stairway is dark. Way to go, Morris. Hey. The steps might

01:16:52.920 --> 01:17:00.600
be large or something. You approach the second floor. The floor of this room is black flagstone,

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:06.200
clean and shining from the light of several iron candlesticks about four feet high. A large altar

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.920
form of bones and silver stands in the middle of the room with a pile of corpses changed to it.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.120
Underneath the corpses, you can see the struggles of an arm and a leg and the terrified shrieks

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.480
of a human female. Someone's trapped in there. Underneath, there's trapped underneath what?

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:28.360
A pile of corpses on a silver and bone altar. That's how you guys found me, remember? Yeah,

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:36.520
you're under some corpses. Yeah, as you had hidden there. Yeah, right. This is involuntarily under

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:43.240
some corpses. Can we speak to her? Can you call out for her? I call out to the woman under the

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:59.080
thing. What do you say? I say, uh, Denzel, what gives? Under a bunch of dead bodies. How? I run

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:05.320
over to her aid and remove the dead bodies from her. You remove, the dead body pile is quite heavy.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:11.560
You might be able to shift it over, but it may be easier to tug her out. I tug her out. You tug

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:21.960
her out. If you know what I mean. She enjoys your tugging. Successfully extricating the damsel

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:27.160
from the pile of corpses. She retches on the floor before straightening herself out and thanking you

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:40.440
properly. Thanks. Fine, sir. I just, I just vomited. I'm not too eloquent. Uh, come on, Sharpie.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:51.000
You're our leader. What do you got? What's the haps? I was captured by a dark warlord. He sought

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:58.360
to sacrifice me to his dark gods. How'd you end up under those bodies? Well, I was knocked out,

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.880
and the next thing I knew, I was under bodies. It smelled dark and terrible. It smelled dark.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:10.600
It smelled like darkness. What's your name? Karen Broadleaf of the Butts Plains.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.040
Sharpie realizes that these are the very planes that his father owns.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:25.240
Oh my god. What? Are you a, are you a, are you a, are you a surf from, from, from my family's

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:33.560
domain? Not a surf, am I, but a great warrior in the Buttsalot tribe. I am of the Buttsalot tribe.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:46.440
Are you the lost one? Yes. That is crazy. You are, you are foretold of in prophecy,

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.520
the one who is tossed out by his father shall come to reclaim his father's throne.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.360
If I had known that, I wouldn't have left, but then that would be ironic.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:04.440
So what brings the four of you here? Fortune and glory. No offense to Jason. Uh, that's an

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:13.160
Indiana Jones reference. Okay, never mind. Wait, was that a short round reference? Yeah, yeah,

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:18.680
yeah. Forget it. It's a, you have to do Rubik's cube of racism. I was trying to keep the racial

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:27.800
theme going. What was your name again? Karen Broadleaf. Karen? Hello, Karen. Hi. How do your

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:38.840
parents feel about black people? Are you speaking of the drow? They hate me and call that.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:47.400
Okay, can I look around the room? You look around the room and you see a dark figure who's been

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:53.720
eyeing you this whole time waiting for a chance to strike. Is this Admiral Darkstar? You don't know.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:21:01.400
I call out, I call out to him. Are you Admiral Darkstar? There he stands holding a black long

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:09.080
sword and wearing full black plate mail. In his fist he has clutched a metal stone. It, it, uh,

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:13.720
it appears to be like your fragment of power that you found at the trove, but this is dark and

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:23.400
emanating vicious pulses of dark energy. Dark. You fools have played right into my hands!

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:37.880
He unleashes a wave of energy. You feel numb. No! Now you're taking will saves according

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:44.760
to the rules to see if you actually are affected by his dark magics. Fuck. Sharpie and

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:54.520
quark manage to shake it off, but Morris is stricken and paralyzed. Help me, help me, help me. I knew

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:59.960
that your star medal had revealed itself, but I didn't think you'd simply deliver it to me.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:10.600
Deliver it? Telekinesis! You feel a tug at your pocket and you feel the fragment of power leave.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:18.520
It is flying towards him. I, well, do I, I can't, can I attempt to hang on to it? You attempt to

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:26.680
grasp it from the magical clutches of Admiral Darkstar. But are you fast enough? You were fast

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:41.080
enough. Clutching the stone out of midair, you seem to hulk Darkstar's spell. Oh, Admiral, you're

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:49.800
right about one thing. A delivery's been made. You just forgot to write down the address.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:23:03.480
Rea Frost! As he is charging up with anger and energy, you cast a Rea Frost directly into his

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:12.760
face. The Rea Flock Frost whizzes past his head and freezes a wall behind him. Berserker Rage!

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:22.520
You fly into a berserker rage. Would you like to attack now? Yeah, I'm not gonna like wallpaper

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:33.720
the room. Raging like a maniac. You wallpaper the room. I, I, I struggle to stand up.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:43.480
You pull yourself to the feet. Did someone get the number of that truck that hit me?

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:51.160
I have the power to heal light wounds if I'm not mistaken, right? Does, does he need that? Does,

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:56.520
does Morris need that? He, he does not. Okay, well, fuck it. You, you are raging. I want,

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.680
I want to attack him in a berserker rage. Pulling your flaming sword from its sheath,

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:09.560
you activate its powers. It is reeded in flames. You charge at the enemy, Admiral Darkstar. He

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:17.640
blasts a mighty dark beam of energy at you. It flies past you and blows a hole in the one,

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:25.480
but the wall behind you. Wait, how's the wallpaper? I, I, I repair the wallpaper.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:32.360
Remember, you quickly repair the wallpaper. I, I attack him with my mace, rushing towards

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:37.160
Admiral Darkstar. My heavy mace. You fling your heavy mace into his chest.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:49.160
You strike him squarely in the chest. He steps back in pain. Suck it. Suck it. He takes eight

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:55.400
damage. Ooh. Is that good? How many does he need? I don't know. You don't know. I will find out.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:03.800
Reduce person. Before you cast reduce person. He strikes his sword towards Morris Goldbright.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:14.040
Uh-oh. Oh, fuck. My sword will cut you in two. It, it does not. It, it hits painful, painfully,

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:22.520
but not deadly on your armor. You are fine. Reduce person. Reduce person. He is entitled to

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:30.920
a fortitude save, I believe. What? What? He fails his, his save. He shrinks from six foot two to a

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:37.320
good three foot eight. Nice. Can I do, can I do my berserker rage with my sword right now? You're

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.000
already in your berserker rage. I attack. Swing your sword at the shorter target. Let's see if

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:51.800
you can adjust to his new height. Your sword rings true against the foe's arm. He drops his

01:25:51.800 --> 01:26:04.600
fist-sized crystal in anguish. No! I don't know who made this guy an admiral. He takes 11 damage.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:14.840
Oh, I'm sorry. And five fire damage. Yeah. I don't know that means, but it sounds pretty fucking

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:21.640
cool. I pick up his crystal. You pick up the crystal. You feel the dark taint surging through you.

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:32.360
Negative energy. Taint. Yeah. Taint is a word. Look it up. We might have a new title for the

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:41.800
episode. Feel the dark taint. Admiral Doxt, the lord of all that is taint. You feel the power of

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:47.560
many demons surging through you, threatening to throw you off your alignment. Only by focusing on

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:53.880
the power of your gods can you maintain your sanity. I focus on the power of my gods.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:07.400
Stay neutral. It's the spot that's not right between the good and the evil right on the spot.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:16.680
It's taint good. What are you talking about? He emanates a dark wave of energy. You feel yourself

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:26.840
knocked back five feet. Oh, shit. Quark, you take a nasty blast of energy to the face.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.120
I was just wallpapering over here. And thus we're not a prepared for the assault.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.240
Six dark damage. That's not a type of damage. It's damage.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:48.280
Burning hands and word. Holding your hands together and summoning the power of fire.

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:53.000
A thin stream of flames jets out between your hands in a cone shaped pattern.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.480
His armor heats up and becomes bright red.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:12.920
He takes three fire damage. Level one spells you guys. I hit him again with my heavy mace.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:19.800
You hold the powers of darkness at bay long enough to summon the strength to swing your mace.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:26.680
You get a critical hit. You smash him right in the face.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:35.160
Suck my taint. He takes two damage. Is it his turn or our turn?

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:41.960
He knows. I think it's your turn now. My turn? Yeah. I'm just reading here a post-it note you

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:48.200
gave me. I have high charisma and I'm actually good at convincing people or scaring people.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:53.880
I convince him to stop being an asshole. Okay. Phrase your arguments.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:01.320
You Admiral Darkstar. Your reign of terror has gone on. Eons too long.

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:10.520
And I think it would be best that you lay down your admiralty and join us in the quest for

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:18.040
a fortune and glory and so forth. A compelling argument.

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:29.080
You rolled a two. Dazed from the mace strike to the face. Admiral Darkstar fails to hear

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:35.320
your voice over the sound of blood rushing to his head. I wasn't proud of it. I'm sorry, man.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.760
You just roll low sometimes. It's sad. I want to help you out and do cool stuff like that.

01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:49.720
That's cool, man. The dice don't lie, man. You fools! Telekinesis!

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:58.280
He summons the fist-size crystal away from Morris. Do you attempt to grab it out of his hand? Hell,

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:06.440
yes. You fail to grab it out of his hand. No! It flies back into his grasp. Son of a bitch.

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:11.960
He grabs it and starts floating in the air. You hear a rumbling as if the ziggurat is beginning

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:18.600
to crumble. Dark lightning bolts shoot out of his body and fingers. Does my mysterious

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:24.200
emerald dagger do anything? It might. I produce my emerald dagger and attack.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:29.800
Just attack with a dagger? You tell me, Jack. Pulling the emerald dagger from your sack.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:40.760
You charge head toward you. You attack! The emerald dagger groans with green energy from

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:52.600
the forest soul. You strike. You miss. A glimmering arc of green energy trails the blade as you slice

01:30:52.600 --> 01:31:02.440
cleanly above his head. This is not my day. Summon monster! I used to have a list of...

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:09.800
You can summon like a celestial porpoise. Let's see, a celestial monkey dog.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.320
I can create water. You're fucking porpoise in here.

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:19.080
A giant spider or scorpion? Perhaps a centipede?

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:26.440
Celestial porpoise, baby. I would go with the scorpion. A scorpion springs into existence

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:38.280
before you. Akira! The scorpion waits for you to tell it it's bidding. Sting!

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:47.400
Scuttling towards Admiral Darkstar, it raises its sting wickedly. A glittering arc flies through

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:54.520
the air as the blade penetrates, does not penetrate. Darkstar's armor.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:32:00.280
I can command targets with one word. Say a word and they'll do it like...

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:07.000
Sleep. I tell them to sleep. Sleep? Okay.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.480
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:17.400
Is he asleep? He's sleeping. Grab the stone. Grab the glowing stone.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.640
The demonic energy swirls through you again. You feel it corrupting you.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:27.320
Admiral Darkstar lays sleeping. But there's two stones, right?

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.720
Yeah, give it to me. I've been able to handle this other one.

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:36.760
Combine the stones together. Touching the stones together, the golden brilliance of

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:43.880
your stone turns the dark purple of the dark corrupted stone to pure and silver for some

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:49.000
reason. Yeah! Nice! You feel the anger of the demon's subside.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:54.920
Karen Broadleaf takes the opportunity to jump on the unconscious Darkstar and starts wailing on her.

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.560
I say we don't kill him. Let's just write in lipstick on the wall,

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:07.240
welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS. Just to fuck with him.

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:10.040
He'll spend the rest of his life wondering what that is.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:18.360
There's magic to cure that stuff. So where are we at?

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.920
He's on the floor. There's a pile of corpses on an altar.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.360
Karen's kicking his ass over there.

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.480
She's beating him up, yeah.

01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.240
The wallpaper's looking pretty good.

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:37.240
It's lovely, right? I say we consult with this episode's exclusive chorus

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:46.040
of multiracial ghosts to determine the fate of Admiral Darkstar who lays powerless before us.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:52.840
I cast Summon Multiracial Ghost Chorus. The ancestral spirits of the forest fly through

01:33:52.840 --> 01:34:02.120
the ziggurat. Their swirling spiritual forms coalesce. Come, tall black drug user, English teacher

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:11.320
of Peru. His name is Chris. Come, Asian guy. Jason. Jason. Come, Puerto Rican possibly lady.

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.400
Piper. Come, black girl, a star with a star in the hair.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:28.280
Enti. I cast Enti. And I summon Adam Goldberg. From the realm of Aspergia.

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.800
Your powers combined.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:43.800
Their fists unite. All right. From left to right, say what your spirits command.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:59.240
Mercy. Um, I think he could kick him. I forgive him for his hate crimes.

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:11.640
I just, what can I do? You're a spirit. You can haunt things. You can do all sorts of stuff.

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.880
Okay, so can I like just send him into space or something? No, that's not a ghost power.

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:23.480
Um, I mean, that's NASA. He's a bad guy. Should we give him mercy or kill him?

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.800
Let's just kill him. Let's like burn him or something.

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:39.400
I cut him with a switch blade. The swiftest. Turn him into Chevy Chase.

01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:49.400
All right. Well, it seems like it's kind of even Steven. Thank you, oh, multi-ethnic ghosts for

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:58.840
your diverse wisdom. You've heard the voices of the spirits. I think that the way to, to

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:05.480
collate all of that guidance is to strip him of his dark armor, right? And, and, and bend him over

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:11.800
like a, like a, like a, like a, just a rail or something and put a sign on his back that says,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.560
uh, uh, uh, free, free ass.

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:25.160
So he'll be sodomized for all eternity? No, no, I don't know. I was just, I was just, uh,

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.520
being 13 years old. I don't know. We should definitely make, he should definitely be naked.

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.080
Is there, is there a way to turn him into good? Is there a way to redeem him in some way though

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.040
that we can bring out the, the good in him? You are not aware. Like Captain EO. Is there anything?

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:45.320
Is there anything else in this room with us? The room is bare other than the, the candlesticks,

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:52.040
the altar, and the guys. What happened to Karen? Is she gone? She's still beating him up. He might be

01:36:52.040 --> 01:37:01.880
dead. Does she, I, as I understand it in the realm of butts, uh, uh, the, the, the, the lower

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:08.520
downs in that realm, uh, are, are often, uh, uh, uh, tutelaged in the art of tattooing.

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:15.640
The butts lower downs are, that's true. Are you going to go dragon tattoo on this guy?

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:22.040
Yeah. Let us, let us put a dragon tattoo on him that says, uh, dickhead. Just put it on his

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:27.400
forehead. Right on the forehead. How will you divest his armor? Uh, uh, just, uh, uh, seductively.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:35.080
With a lawn? I would, I would. A plumb. What do you mean? How do we, uh, boots first? What,

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:44.120
what do you, you tug on his boot? It seems stuck. Do we need to get the armor off? Well,

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:49.160
you were the ones that were talking about it. I mean, I didn't say do that. Well, let's just do

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:55.240
the forehead. Just do the forehead. Just write dick on the forehead of the, of the, of the helmet.

01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:02.840
Oh, he can't, we can't even get his helmet off. Do you haven't tried yet? I removed the helmet.

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:10.680
Pulling the helmet loose, you hear a almighty hiss as the helmet slides off a sludgy pool of

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:15.400
black ooze and smoke emits from the, the, the helmet hole.

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:24.520
Swirling and coalescing into a bipedal, piece deal form about seven feet tall.

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:31.640
It hisses foul demonic curses at you. You're more powerful than I'd expected. No matter.

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:38.040
The dark stars dawn will come and all will fall victim to its light. Plane our gate.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:46.680
A portal opens up to a demonic plane. You see rows of what look like black ships that he's an admiral

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:55.240
of. He disappears into the gate and it winks out of existence. We had our chance. We had our chance

01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:01.880
to kill him. We didn't take it. Only as dark armor remains. Maurice, maybe I wouldn't mind wearing this.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:10.520
I could probably take it in a little bit. Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll put on the armor.

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.080
You take the armor. Karen thanks you again. Thank you again.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:24.200
Thank you, Karen. And thank all of us. Everyone. I think, I think we've learned a lot today.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:31.080
What, what did we learn, Sharpie? Like what? Well, we've learned to, to stay good and be less

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:39.640
evil. Because inevitably it seems to not pay off. I learned that if you get a multi ethnic

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:46.920
ghost chorus, not a lot gets accomplished. It was gimmick driven. You know, you, you,

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.400
you made that promise and I was just trying to pay it off.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:40:00.040
Let me give you the treasure of our people says Karen. Oh, she gives you a masterwork loot.

01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:05.320
50 merciful arrows inside of the magic quiver. Are these sexual positions? I wish.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:13.320
That's just true. I give her a masterful loot right back. I'd put it into her magic quiver.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.920
I cast Swedish reach around.

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:25.720
A wand of magic missile and a hat of disguises. Whoa. That's a magic hat, fellas.

01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:31.320
All right. Well, you don't beat a magic hat. Thank you, Spencer.

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:45.880
Wow. My goodness. The clock says 10 o'clock. Yeah, we really, I don't lie. I wish it did.

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:49.640
I'm really sorry, everybody. Every, you keep coming and I keep punishing you.

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:53.240
I said I had nothing and then I had two hours of everything.

01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.120
Yeah. All right. Let's just bring in the station. Steve,

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:59.960
age everybody. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Dan. Thank you, Jeff.

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:02.760
Steve, do you want to close it up with your famous standup set?

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.960
Jeff, do I? Let me get some music up for you. Steve has the funniest five minute standup set.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.600
Hold up. Hold up. I don't know if we can about

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.600
everything about online dating that no.

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:23.800
All right. We're going to do it. We're going to do a scene about I heard a plumber.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:34.920
Oh, boy. You again. Yeah. I'd like a plumber, please. You got one. That's not going to work

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:39.000
either. Is it? All right. We're running out of ways to close these shows.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.040
We can't just keep bringing Adam Goldberg up. I mean, that's the

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:51.240
Oh, yeah. Well, the problem is we can, but I don't think he's like Beetlejuice.

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:58.840
Except you say his name once. Adam, come on the stage. I want to try something out again.

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:02.360
Let's see what it's like when Adam has nothing. Yeah. That's interesting.

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:06.600
Adam, I want you and Dan and A.G. to kind of like just

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:15.160
kind of give us like a doo-wop. You know, kind of like you want me to do the backbeat and

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:19.640
whatever you like, baby. Fucking follow your heart. All right. That was excellent, by the way.

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:25.640
I'm done jelly. Jelly. I'm not peanut butter at all. I'm very jelly. Thank you. All right.

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:34.200
Talk show doo-wop to close up the show. Talk show doo-wop. I'm trying to please Jeff's

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:40.280
innocuous request to turn this into who's lying again. All right. What's the hottest button,

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:47.560
hottest button topical topic that hasn't, what's that race? Well, we kind of trounced that.

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:54.680
The debate doo-wop. But that's not really hot button. That's kind of like cupcakes.

01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.440
Like you're supposed to be talking about that. Cupcake doo-wop. Cup, cup. All right.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:06.680
I'm just going to backbeat this. This is about you two guys. It's about gray. I'm wearing red.

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:18.440
I go back to the chorus.

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:32.200
I do what I do, gotta have you, girlie, please. You give me frosting on top of my cake, girl.

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:45.400
You got a pink color, but you're brown down there. I got a multi-racial cupcake in my oven

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:57.160
for you tonight. You bake me at 350, girl. You make me toasty and warm.

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:07.880
I'm all confused about race, girl. Teach me. Make me part of your ant swarm.

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:14.200
Thank you everybody for coming to Harmontown. Thank you. Oh, we fucking did it. Sometimes the

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:19.800
closer is a lack of closer. I think you'd all agree. That's what's best. 10-05.

01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:26.120
One more time. Adam Goldberg. We're guessing. Adam, shut the fuck up. Steve Aze, everybody.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:36.360
Shows over. All our very brave volunteers. Chris and Piper and Star and Jason. Piper.

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:42.360
We're missing anybody. Also, Katie Levine, Zac McKeever, Emily Gordon, Daniel Cramer,

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:46.440
Dustin Marshall, Mo Fathelbab, Jenny Fine, and Shahruz Shaukat, all of our beautiful people

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:58.280
that help us out of Harmontown. One more time for your mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harlan.

01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:14.520
It's time to do. It's time to do. Now you can go. It's time to do. Sorry it was long.

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:20.120
It's 10-06. Thank you everybody for coming. We love you so much.

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:30.360
Very fast to take chances.
