Everything's great.\n\n02:15.560 --> 02:19.560\nYou gave my girlfriend a dressing down at the drawing room.\n\n02:19.560 --> 02:23.560\nI was pleasant about it.\n\n02:23.560 --> 02:27.560\nIt seemed from her reaction that you were pretty mean.\n\n02:27.560 --> 02:29.560\nShe has a high value on your opinion.\n\n02:29.560 --> 02:32.560\nThat's wrong. I told her how I felt.\n\n02:32.560 --> 02:35.560\nI didn't beat her up about it.\n\n02:35.560 --> 02:39.560\nYou said how you felt was her behavior in the last show\n\n02:39.560 --> 02:42.560\nwhere she called on her cell phone.\n\n02:42.560 --> 02:45.560\nYou said that was the last straw.\n\n02:45.560 --> 02:47.560\nLike you have a last straw.\n\n02:47.560 --> 02:54.560\nNo, the words was the limit of my endurance.\n\n02:54.560 --> 02:58.560\nI'm not cliche.\n\n02:58.560 --> 03:01.560\nShe's not here tonight because she killed herself.\n\n03:01.560 --> 03:03.560\nYou'll be happy to know.\n\n03:03.560 --> 03:08.560\nShe's doing a show or something.\n\n03:08.560 --> 03:14.560\nShe could have killed herself.\n\n03:14.560 --> 03:19.560\nMaybe you would have apologized.\n\n03:19.560 --> 03:22.560\nHe called you in the middle of the show.\n\n03:22.560 --> 03:26.560\nAdam Goldberg wanders up here.\n\n03:26.560 --> 03:28.560\nThis show has no format.\n\n03:28.560 --> 03:30.560\nThere's nothing to protect.\n\n03:30.560 --> 03:32.560\nIt's not a diamond mine.\n\n03:32.560 --> 03:38.560\nIt's a tree house full of empty popcorn bags.\n\n03:38.560 --> 03:43.560\nI'm Tori Amos all of a sudden.\n\n03:43.560 --> 03:48.560\nIt's a turtle racing a grapefruit.\n\n03:48.560 --> 03:51.560\nI thought I favored some of the questions.\n\n03:51.560 --> 03:52.560\nI'm sorry for the live people.\n\n03:52.560 --> 03:54.560\nThey're looking at a guy looking at his phone.\n\n03:54.560 --> 03:56.560\nIt's like sending a signal to you\n\n03:56.560 --> 03:58.560\nthat I'm not interested in what you're saying.\n\n03:58.560 --> 04:00.560\nI am. I'm looking at my phone.\n\n04:00.560 --> 04:02.560\nThis is a new jacket you're wearing tonight, Dan.\n\n04:02.560 --> 04:06.560\nYou kind of have an Alan Alda mash field jacket.\n\n04:06.560 --> 04:08.560\nWe've got a break in the weather.\n\n04:08.560 --> 04:10.560\nI know what I did wrong.\n\n04:10.560 --> 04:13.560\nI pressed the at Dan Harmon button,\n\n04:13.560 --> 04:16.560\nwhich is my favorite button.\n\n04:16.560 --> 04:19.560\nWhat I have to do is search for Harmontown.\n\n04:19.560 --> 04:22.560\nThen I should see some of these doodads.\n\n04:22.560 --> 04:25.560\nI don't know. Did I fuck it up somehow?\n\n04:25.560 --> 04:27.560\nWelcome to Hollywood, California, everybody.\n\n04:27.560 --> 04:30.560\nThe entertainment capital of the world.\n\n04:30.560 --> 04:32.560\nHere's an example.\n\n04:32.560 --> 04:35.560\nDopamine, at Dopamine, says,\n\n04:35.560 --> 04:37.560\nif you were born 200 years ago,\n\n04:37.560 --> 04:39.560\nwhat would you do for a living?\n\n04:39.560 --> 04:41.560\nThat's a really good question.\n\n04:41.560 --> 04:45.560\nThat's just an example of a great question.\n\n04:45.560 --> 04:47.560\nIf I had some passion tonight,\n\n04:47.560 --> 04:49.560\nI would have an amazing answer for that.\n\n04:49.560 --> 04:51.560\nI think that would be very intriguing.\n\n04:51.560 --> 04:53.560\nYou were born in the year 1870.\n\n04:53.560 --> 04:55.560\nWhat are you, two? 73?\n\n04:55.560 --> 04:56.560\nI guess, yeah.\n\n04:56.560 --> 04:58.560\nOkay, so 1873.\n\n04:58.560 --> 05:01.560\nLet's make it 1820.\n\n05:01.560 --> 05:03.560\nNo, 1830. You're 17 years old.\n\n05:03.560 --> 05:05.560\nWhat are you doing in 1830?\n\n05:05.560 --> 05:07.560\nObviously, I would be a writer.\n\n05:07.560 --> 05:09.560\nI'm a timeless genius.\n\n05:09.560 --> 05:12.560\nI'd love to be able to say,\n\n05:12.560 --> 05:14.560\nI'd be an elephant trainer\n\n05:14.560 --> 05:17.560\nbecause the World's Fair would be coming up,\n\n05:17.560 --> 05:20.560\nand Mr. Edison would need a new elephant.\n\n05:20.560 --> 05:22.560\nNo, no, I'd transcend.\n\n05:22.560 --> 05:25.560\nI'm like a time lord.\n\n05:25.560 --> 05:29.560\nMy talent is, if I was born in the year 3000 BC,\n\n05:29.560 --> 05:33.560\nI'd invent writing.\n\n05:33.560 --> 05:36.560\nI'm a god.\n\n05:36.560 --> 05:38.560\nWhat do you think you would write about\n\n05:38.560 --> 05:40.560\nif you were in the year 3000 BC?\n\n05:40.560 --> 05:45.560\nWhatever got me about a nice piece of cave.\n\n05:45.560 --> 05:47.560\nRemember in ABC's Caveman,\n\n05:47.560 --> 05:51.560\nthey used to say stuff like that.\n\n05:51.560 --> 05:54.560\nThey used to cave like the Smurfs you'd Smurfy.\n\n05:54.560 --> 05:57.560\nYeah, they were looking at a female cavewoman\n\n05:57.560 --> 05:59.560\nthat was working at Pinkberry,\n\n05:59.560 --> 06:02.560\nand Nick Krull's character was looking at her butt\n\n06:02.560 --> 06:05.560\nand said, I'd like to carve me off a nice piece of that cave.\n\n06:05.560 --> 06:09.560\nWhat?\n\n06:09.560 --> 06:11.560\nFirst of all, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n06:11.560 --> 06:13.560\nSecond of all, to the extent that I forced my brain\n\n06:13.560 --> 06:15.560\nto make it make sense, gross,\n\n06:15.560 --> 06:17.560\nbecause caves are holes,\n\n06:17.560 --> 06:19.560\nand then I start to think of vaginas,\n\n06:19.560 --> 06:21.560\nand now I'm thinking of carving off vaginas,\n\n06:21.560 --> 06:26.560\nand you made me do that, Geico.\n\n06:26.560 --> 06:28.560\nAnyways, here's another great one.\n\n06:28.560 --> 06:31.560\nIs there a plan to take Harmontown on tour anytime soon?\n\n06:31.560 --> 06:34.560\nI'm going to have to say yes, yes.\n\n06:34.560 --> 06:36.560\nI thought that would get a bigger response,\n\n06:36.560 --> 06:38.560\nbut then I realized you guys are...\n\n06:38.560 --> 06:40.560\nWhy would you...\n\n06:40.560 --> 06:41.560\nYou don't care?\n\n06:41.560 --> 06:43.560\nHey, you're leaving!\n\n06:43.560 --> 06:45.560\nGet the hell out of here!\n\n06:45.560 --> 06:49.560\nIt's the applause from a little iPhone that I'm hearing\n\n06:49.560 --> 06:53.560\nfrom the people in New York and Chicago and things.\n\n06:53.560 --> 06:55.560\nYeah, I think in January,\n\n06:55.560 --> 06:57.560\nwe're having preliminary conversations about this,\n\n06:57.560 --> 07:00.560\nI think what I'm going to do, because I'm turning 40,\n\n07:00.560 --> 07:04.560\nmaybe get 50 people or so to show up in little cities\n\n07:04.560 --> 07:07.560\nacross the country, so I think in January,\n\n07:07.560 --> 07:10.560\nwe'll take a little bus and we'll go around\n\n07:10.560 --> 07:15.560\nand we'll do this to people in different cities.\n\n07:15.560 --> 07:18.560\nAnd I want to record it.\n\n07:18.560 --> 07:20.560\nTake some Channel 101 kids with us.\n\n07:20.560 --> 07:23.560\nThey're not kids anymore, they're 48 years old.\n\n07:23.560 --> 07:26.560\nBut take them with us, do some nice recordings\n\n07:26.560 --> 07:29.560\nin the little black boxes and cabarets\n\n07:29.560 --> 07:31.560\nthroughout the country.\n\n07:31.560 --> 07:33.560\nAnd then come home with hundreds of hours of footage\n\n07:33.560 --> 07:36.560\nand then just throw it on some other Channel 101 kid\n\n07:36.560 --> 07:38.560\nand go, edit this.\n\n07:38.560 --> 07:42.560\nAnd I'll just sit at home snorting coke off of a piranha.\n\n07:42.560 --> 07:47.560\nThat's the only way I get high anymore.\n\n07:47.560 --> 07:48.560\nYeah.\n\n07:48.560 --> 07:52.560\nSpeaking of addictions, I think this might be part of\n\n07:52.560 --> 07:54.560\nwhy I'm all like, I got nothing tonight.\n\n07:54.560 --> 07:56.560\nI'm addicted to five-hour energies.\n\n07:56.560 --> 08:00.560\nI call them 5HEs now.\n\n08:00.560 --> 08:03.560\nIt barely takes less time to say.\n\n08:03.560 --> 08:05.560\nIt's basically the same amount of energy,\n\n08:05.560 --> 08:08.560\nbut I'm obsessed with energy, I gotta say.\n\n08:08.560 --> 08:09.560\nIt's fucking up my throat.\n\n08:09.560 --> 08:10.560\nI got bad acid reflux.\n\n08:10.560 --> 08:13.560\nI'm taking like Zantac on top of Prilosec\n\n08:13.560 --> 08:15.560\nto counteract the effects of these five-hour energies\n\n08:15.560 --> 08:17.560\nand I'm taking one or two a day.\n\n08:17.560 --> 08:19.560\nI mean, if you need 10 hours of energy,\n\n08:19.560 --> 08:22.560\nthat's another way of saying, just take a nap.\n\n08:22.560 --> 08:24.560\n10 hours of energy is your deficit,\n\n08:24.560 --> 08:27.560\nthen just take the day off and go to sleep.\n\n08:27.560 --> 08:32.560\n10 hours of energy, that's not good, Jeff.\n\n08:32.560 --> 08:34.560\nI've been addicted to worse things,\n\n08:34.560 --> 08:37.560\nbut this is making barf on my throat.\n\n08:37.560 --> 08:38.560\nYeah.\n\n08:38.560 --> 08:40.560\nThose things taste like poop, too.\n\n08:40.560 --> 08:41.560\nIt doesn't taste good.\n\n08:41.560 --> 08:43.560\nTastes like energy, you know?\n\n08:43.560 --> 08:45.560\nI don't think they want it to taste too good\n\n08:45.560 --> 08:47.560\nbecause then you wouldn't believe that it was giving you energy,\n\n08:47.560 --> 08:49.560\nwhich I don't think it is.\n\n08:49.560 --> 08:52.560\nTo be quite honest, I've never felt energized by those things.\n\n08:52.560 --> 08:54.560\nI think it's a bunch of things.\n\n08:54.560 --> 08:58.560\nWell, I accidentally took two on top of each other once.\n\n08:58.560 --> 09:05.560\nFor God, I took one and I think an hour into one,\n\n09:05.560 --> 09:09.560\nI took another and there is something in them\n\n09:09.560 --> 09:12.560\nbecause there is such a thing as too much.\n\n09:12.560 --> 09:17.560\nI remember right before I took the second one,\n\n09:17.560 --> 09:19.560\nI picked a fight with Erin\n\n09:19.560 --> 09:23.560\nand then she heard a totally justified response\n\n09:23.560 --> 09:26.560\nabout what a piece of shit I was that night.\n\n09:26.560 --> 09:28.560\nIt was like coming back on me socially\n\n09:28.560 --> 09:30.560\nas I was starting to freak out.\n\n09:30.560 --> 09:35.560\nI was laying in the bed that I made with my girlfriend\n\n09:35.560 --> 09:38.560\nand also going like, baby, please, please, come on.\n\n09:38.560 --> 09:40.560\nCome on, take it easy.\n\n09:40.560 --> 09:42.560\nI took two five-hour energy.\n\n09:42.560 --> 09:43.560\nI can't handle this.\n\n09:43.560 --> 09:44.560\nYeah, but what did you mean before?\n\n09:44.560 --> 09:45.560\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n09:45.560 --> 09:47.560\nIt was pretty weird.\n\n09:47.560 --> 09:49.560\nIt was like the scene in the fifth element\n\n09:49.560 --> 09:52.560\nwhen the guy is choking on the strawberry or whatever the fuck.\n\n09:52.560 --> 09:57.560\nYes, this is Rob Schrab clapping.\n\n09:57.560 --> 10:00.560\nRob Schrab is in the house, is that right?\n\n10:00.560 --> 10:01.560\nHello, Rob.\n\n10:05.560 --> 10:06.560\nLet's see.\n\n10:06.560 --> 10:08.560\nMan, I really thought...\n\n10:08.560 --> 10:11.560\nI sat in the green room and I favorited things\n\n10:11.560 --> 10:12.560\nthat I wanted to respond to,\n\n10:12.560 --> 10:18.560\nbut I guess you guys did such a good job of tweeting stuff at me\n\n10:18.560 --> 10:19.560\nthat I...\n\n10:19.560 --> 10:20.560\nAre you playing Sparkle right now?\n\n10:20.560 --> 10:22.560\nEric Mesquivel says,\n\n10:22.560 --> 10:25.560\nI know you're a Joe Campbell guy.\n\n10:25.560 --> 10:27.560\nWho else influences your writing?\n\n10:27.560 --> 10:28.560\nAre you a McKee fan?\n\n10:28.560 --> 10:30.560\nGoldman?\n\n10:30.560 --> 10:32.560\nNo, I don't know.\n\n10:32.560 --> 10:33.560\nI don't know why I favorited that,\n\n10:33.560 --> 10:35.560\nif that's all I was going to say.\n\n10:37.560 --> 10:40.560\nI don't know what I was thinking.\n\n10:40.560 --> 10:43.560\nNot really a question, but if you ever find your way to Colorado,\n\n10:43.560 --> 10:44.560\nlet me buy you a drink.\n\n10:44.560 --> 10:45.560\nOkay.\n\n10:45.560 --> 10:48.560\nIt's no problem.\n\n10:48.560 --> 10:49.560\nMaybe this is hurting things,\n\n10:49.560 --> 10:51.560\nme holding this phone and scrolling through the things.\n\n10:51.560 --> 10:53.560\nMaybe I need to cut myself loose.\n\n10:53.560 --> 10:54.560\nIt's not Circus Hill Layout.\n\n10:54.560 --> 10:56.560\nI'll tell you that much.\n\n10:56.560 --> 10:57.560\nRight.\n\n10:57.560 --> 10:58.560\nI mean, I don't know if it's going to be\n\n10:58.560 --> 10:59.560\nbecause I put the phone down,\n\n10:59.560 --> 11:01.560\nbut I don't think that...\n\n11:01.560 --> 11:02.560\nI don't know if the phone's helping.\n\n11:02.560 --> 11:03.560\nAre you preoccupied?\n\n11:03.560 --> 11:07.560\nAre you just one of those weird kind of...\n\n11:07.560 --> 11:09.560\nWell, I'm mad at you for being mean to my girlfriend.\n\n11:09.560 --> 11:10.560\nI wasn't mean to her.\n\n11:10.560 --> 11:11.560\nYou were there when it happened.\n\n11:11.560 --> 11:12.560\nIt was very brief.\n\n11:12.560 --> 11:13.560\nI said it very succinctly.\n\n11:13.560 --> 11:15.560\nI didn't hear what you said, but...\n\n11:15.560 --> 11:16.560\nExactly.\n\n11:16.560 --> 11:17.560\nIt took a couple seconds,\n\n11:17.560 --> 11:19.560\nand I just told her she was bumming me the fuck out.\n\n11:19.560 --> 11:21.560\nWell, I mean...\n\n11:21.560 --> 11:23.560\nBut, yeah.\n\n11:23.560 --> 11:29.560\nI mean, you told her that she...\n\n11:29.560 --> 11:30.560\nI'm curious to know...\n\n11:30.560 --> 11:32.560\nDid a bad thing to the show,\n\n11:32.560 --> 11:34.560\nand that the audience didn't like what she was doing.\n\n11:34.560 --> 11:35.560\nThat's not what I said.\n\n11:35.560 --> 11:36.560\nThat's not what I said.\n\n11:36.560 --> 11:37.560\nI really wanted to know what the...\n\n11:37.560 --> 11:39.560\nI would love to have heard the journalism\n\n11:39.560 --> 11:40.560\nthat she reported to you.\n\n11:40.560 --> 11:41.560\nI didn't know that you guys were going...\n\n11:41.560 --> 11:42.560\nI didn't know.\n\n11:42.560 --> 11:43.560\nWe were at the drawing room,\n\n11:43.560 --> 11:45.560\nand I told Erin,\n\n11:45.560 --> 11:46.560\nand I was like, ugh.\n\n11:46.560 --> 11:49.560\nI gave her a little couple of minutes,\n\n11:49.560 --> 11:51.560\nget some shit off my chest,\n\n11:51.560 --> 11:53.560\nand then I didn't know that right after that\n\n11:53.560 --> 11:55.560\nyou guys were going to go have a romantic dinner together,\n\n11:55.560 --> 11:57.560\nwhich I apparently must have poisoned\n\n11:57.560 --> 11:58.560\nby having a conversation,\n\n11:58.560 --> 11:59.560\nso I'm sorry for that.\n\n11:59.560 --> 12:00.560\nWow.\n\n12:00.560 --> 12:01.560\nNo.\n\n12:01.560 --> 12:02.560\nIt was fascinating.\n\n12:02.560 --> 12:08.560\nSo there's that.\n\n12:08.560 --> 12:10.560\nThere's that putting a ding in my energy.\n\n12:10.560 --> 12:16.560\nI'm not going to blame you for anything, though.\n\n12:16.560 --> 12:18.560\nLet's blame Erin.\n\n12:18.560 --> 12:22.560\nI'm not going to blame anybody for anything.\n\n12:22.560 --> 12:25.560\nLet's blame everything on NT.\n\n12:25.560 --> 12:31.560\nHow are you, NT?\n\n12:31.560 --> 12:37.560\nNT, what's it like?\n\n12:37.560 --> 12:38.560\nCome on.\n\n12:38.560 --> 12:41.560\nYou know we all want to know\n\n12:41.560 --> 12:43.560\nto be a student.\n\n12:43.560 --> 12:44.560\nOh, you're not a student.\n\n12:44.560 --> 12:48.560\nOkay.\n\n12:48.560 --> 12:51.560\nIs NT literally the only black...\n\n12:51.560 --> 12:52.560\nNo, no, okay.\n\n12:52.560 --> 12:54.560\nAll right.\n\n12:54.560 --> 12:55.560\nMy search lines went,\n\n12:55.560 --> 12:56.560\nbang.\n\n12:56.560 --> 12:57.560\nI was scared about it.\n\n12:57.560 --> 12:59.560\nSometimes NT is literally the only\n\n12:59.560 --> 13:02.560\nAfrican-American Armenian here.\n\n13:02.560 --> 13:04.560\nWhat's that like?\n\n13:04.560 --> 13:05.560\nThat's what I'm really curious about,\n\n13:05.560 --> 13:06.560\nalthough I know words.\n\n13:06.560 --> 13:08.560\nThe words don't matter.\n\n13:08.560 --> 13:09.560\nIt's not like anything.\n\n13:09.560 --> 13:13.560\nIt's like, I think I have five black friends, maybe,\n\n13:13.560 --> 13:18.560\nand I think if you got them all in a room together,\n\n13:18.560 --> 13:20.560\nI think the one thing they would all agree on\n\n13:20.560 --> 13:21.560\nis that they're pretty sick and tired\n\n13:21.560 --> 13:25.560\nof being reminded by me that they're black.\n\n13:25.560 --> 13:29.560\nAnd probably a microcosm for white America.\n\n13:29.560 --> 13:32.560\nThey probably wish that they could get through a day\n\n13:32.560 --> 13:35.560\nand just forget about it.\n\n13:35.560 --> 13:39.560\nThat's a luxury that white people have.\n\n13:39.560 --> 13:40.560\nWhen's the last time you stopped\n\n13:40.560 --> 13:41.560\nin the middle of the sidewalk?\n\n13:41.560 --> 13:43.560\nI'm like, oh, shit, I'm white.\n\n13:43.560 --> 13:45.560\nIt probably had something to do\n\n13:45.560 --> 13:47.560\nwith a black person being involved.\n\n13:47.560 --> 13:51.560\nYou didn't just do it in a vacuum.\n\n13:51.560 --> 13:56.560\nIt's not a homogenous society yet.\n\n13:56.560 --> 13:58.560\nIt's not happening.\n\n13:58.560 --> 13:59.560\nThere's black people out there.\n\n13:59.560 --> 14:00.560\nThey're in pain.\n\n14:00.560 --> 14:04.560\nThe next time you see one, don't give them money.\n\n14:04.560 --> 14:07.560\nThat's not what they want.\n\n14:07.560 --> 14:09.560\nThat's racist.\n\n14:09.560 --> 14:12.560\nDon't give them five.\n\n14:12.560 --> 14:15.560\nEven more racist.\n\n14:15.560 --> 14:17.560\nGive them a hug.\n\n14:17.560 --> 14:19.560\nWhat if the five was really high?\n\n14:19.560 --> 14:22.560\nI don't know, because if it's high enough,\n\n14:22.560 --> 14:25.560\nthen the next one's got to be way down low.\n\n14:25.560 --> 14:30.560\nAnd then you were at the risk of being too slow.\n\n14:30.560 --> 14:32.560\nBy the time you finish with that one thing,\n\n14:32.560 --> 14:37.560\nyou're the most racist person in the world.\n\n14:37.560 --> 14:40.560\nLet's talk about race.\n\n14:40.560 --> 14:43.560\nFinally.\n\n14:43.560 --> 14:45.560\nWhat's your favorite race?\n\n14:45.560 --> 14:47.560\nThat's a good question.\n\n14:47.560 --> 14:51.560\nBy that I mean, which is more fascinating to you?\n\n14:51.560 --> 14:53.560\nBlack people or Asian people?\n\n14:53.560 --> 14:54.560\nWho's more fascinating?\n\n14:54.560 --> 14:56.560\nEasily black people.\n\n14:56.560 --> 14:58.560\nBlack people hands down.\n\n14:58.560 --> 15:01.560\nFavorite race to think about.\n\n15:01.560 --> 15:05.560\nWhat race would I want to be?\n\n15:05.560 --> 15:07.560\nNo offense to our Asian friends.\n\n15:07.560 --> 15:10.560\nYou're doing fine.\n\n15:10.560 --> 15:13.560\nBillions of you.\n\n15:13.560 --> 15:20.560\nAmerica was literally built on this practice\n\n15:20.560 --> 15:23.560\nthat we then were the first country to say,\n\n15:23.560 --> 15:25.560\nokay, now this is illegal.\n\n15:25.560 --> 15:27.560\nIt's just a fascinating, the national psyche,\n\n15:27.560 --> 15:30.560\nthe social implications,\n\n15:30.560 --> 15:35.560\nthe swirling meta like racism within non-racism,\n\n15:35.560 --> 15:37.560\nwithin racism within non-racism,\n\n15:37.560 --> 15:39.560\nwhat the definition of it is.\n\n15:39.560 --> 15:44.560\nThere's no better way to examine it\n\n15:44.560 --> 15:46.560\nthan with white people and black people.\n\n15:46.560 --> 15:50.560\nNo offense to our beautiful beige friends.\n\n15:50.560 --> 15:52.560\nBut fuck you.\n\n15:52.560 --> 15:54.560\nIt's Bush League stuff.\n\n15:54.560 --> 15:55.560\nWho cares?\n\n15:55.560 --> 15:58.560\nWhite and black is where it's at.\n\n15:58.560 --> 16:00.560\nWhen it comes to race obsession.\n\n16:00.560 --> 16:05.560\nHow racist would 1830s writer Dan Harmon have been?\n\n16:05.560 --> 16:07.560\nYou gotta be kidding me.\n\n16:07.560 --> 16:10.560\nThat was kind of a sweet spot for American racism.\n\n16:10.560 --> 16:12.560\nIt's an uncomfortable thing to think about.\n\n16:12.560 --> 16:14.560\nThink about the world.\n\n16:14.560 --> 16:16.560\nI was thinking about this just recently,\n\n16:16.560 --> 16:18.560\nand I can't remember why.\n\n16:18.560 --> 16:21.560\nSomebody was getting kind of high-handed\n\n16:21.560 --> 16:23.560\nin some conversation,\n\n16:23.560 --> 16:26.560\nand I didn't want to be like a David Cross character\n\n16:26.560 --> 16:29.560\nand kind of call him out on it and have a big argument.\n\n16:29.560 --> 16:31.560\nI was talking to somebody,\n\n16:31.560 --> 16:35.560\nand they said something that made me realize\n\n16:35.560 --> 16:38.560\nthat they very much take it for granted the fact\n\n16:38.560 --> 16:43.560\nthat as a nation, we were very, very wrong\n\n16:43.560 --> 16:45.560\nfor a very long time,\n\n16:45.560 --> 16:47.560\nand that we haven't changed that much.\n\n16:47.560 --> 16:49.560\nIt's only been a certain amount of time,\n\n16:49.560 --> 16:53.560\nand that we all kind of inherit this world.\n\n16:53.560 --> 16:55.560\nWe act like, oh, those aren't my sins.\n\n16:55.560 --> 16:58.560\nSome of us are kind of nasty about it.\n\n16:58.560 --> 17:04.560\nI didn't have slaves, so excuse me.\n\n17:04.560 --> 17:08.560\nYou're making quite a bit of noise in the popcorn line,\n\n17:08.560 --> 17:10.560\nand it's not my fault.\n\n17:10.560 --> 17:11.560\nYou know what?\n\n17:11.560 --> 17:13.560\nI saw that movie that you guys made,\n\n17:13.560 --> 17:16.560\nand if a white person made that movie, it would not be fair.\n\n17:16.560 --> 17:19.560\nYou'd get all mad about it.\n\n17:19.560 --> 17:25.560\nI think that there's a naivete there,\n\n17:25.560 --> 17:30.560\nbecause really, as recently as the 1930s,\n\n17:30.560 --> 17:32.560\nthere was this whole thing in Europe\n\n17:32.560 --> 17:37.560\nthat was really on a hand.\n\n17:37.560 --> 17:39.560\nI know none of us were there,\n\n17:39.560 --> 17:44.560\nbut I also know that it wasn't an entire generation of monsters.\n\n17:44.560 --> 17:49.560\nThey weren't like vampires from a cereal box that all decided.\n\n17:49.560 --> 17:53.560\nIt's like humanity has it in it to be very cruel, very evil,\n\n17:53.560 --> 17:56.560\nand if the person to the left of you\n\n17:56.560 --> 18:00.560\nand the person to the right of you is doing something wrong,\n\n18:00.560 --> 18:04.560\nwe have the capacity in us to not look at it as wrong.\n\n18:04.560 --> 18:09.560\nThe reason that's important isn't to make ourselves feel guilty\n\n18:09.560 --> 18:12.560\nor to pat ourselves on the back for knowing it.\n\n18:12.560 --> 18:15.560\nThe reason why it's important to know that is relativity\n\n18:15.560 --> 18:18.560\nso that you can actually extrapolate from that and go,\n\n18:18.560 --> 18:22.560\nokay, so what's going on right now that everyone accepts\n\n18:22.560 --> 18:25.560\nis completely right that 100 years from now\n\n18:25.560 --> 18:28.560\nmight be absolutely fucking ridiculously wrong.\n\n18:28.560 --> 18:31.560\nThere could be a million things, like that ghost hanging there.\n\n18:31.560 --> 18:33.560\nWhat's that?\n\n18:33.560 --> 18:35.560\nMaybe that's offensive, I don't know.\n\n18:35.560 --> 18:40.560\nI think we'll certainly look back on not letting gay people get married.\n\n18:40.560 --> 18:42.560\nWe'll look at that and go, come on.\n\n18:42.560 --> 18:45.560\nYeah, we're doing that with the gay people now.\n\n18:45.560 --> 18:48.560\nWe're finally giving them some props,\n\n18:48.560 --> 18:50.560\nsaying sorry about that.\n\n18:50.560 --> 18:56.560\nBy the way, last show I talked about that gay and lesbian thing,\n\n18:56.560 --> 19:01.560\nand I know why I know about that gay and lesbian shelter in Los Angeles.\n\n19:01.560 --> 19:06.560\nA guy tweeted me in the wake of this big brouhaha,\n\n19:06.560 --> 19:09.560\nthere was a small brouhaha, it was like three in the morning,\n\n19:09.560 --> 19:11.560\nit was between me and three gay guys,\n\n19:11.560 --> 19:16.560\nbecause my brother tweeted, God, I love my daughter,\n\n19:16.560 --> 19:20.560\nand I tweeted at my brother, fag.\n\n19:20.560 --> 19:25.560\nBecause it's funny, I thought it was funny,\n\n19:25.560 --> 19:27.560\nI'm not defending it as funny,\n\n19:27.560 --> 19:29.560\nit was a spur of the moment thing,\n\n19:29.560 --> 19:31.560\nmy brother tweeted, I love my daughter,\n\n19:31.560 --> 19:34.560\nand I raised in the 70s, my big brother,\n\n19:34.560 --> 19:37.560\nI'm from Wisconsin, without thinking,\n\n19:37.560 --> 19:42.560\nwithout remembering that I'm the Colonel Sanders of NBC sitcom.\n\n19:42.560 --> 19:45.560\nI just kind of lost myself.\n\n19:45.560 --> 19:48.560\nWe're on Twitter, I'm not representing anybody,\n\n19:48.560 --> 19:50.560\nI'm just like fag.\n\n19:50.560 --> 19:53.560\nAnd then three guys who happen to be awake,\n\n19:53.560 --> 19:56.560\nwe're like, one guy said,\n\n19:56.560 --> 19:59.560\nyou call your brother a fag for loving his daughter?\n\n19:59.560 --> 20:00.560\nWhat kind of monster are you?\n\n20:00.560 --> 20:02.560\nI was like, well, that guy's just explaining the joke.\n\n20:02.560 --> 20:06.560\nI'm not apologizing to that guy,\n\n20:06.560 --> 20:09.560\nyou just don't, that's funny, that's ironic, it's funny.\n\n20:09.560 --> 20:11.560\nBut then other people were like,\n\n20:11.560 --> 20:13.560\nyou know that word is really hurtful,\n\n20:13.560 --> 20:15.560\nkind of like bringing me back down to earth,\n\n20:15.560 --> 20:19.560\nand it's really true, like, do you know,\n\n20:19.560 --> 20:24.560\nwhen I was eight years old, nine years old, ten years old,\n\n20:24.560 --> 20:27.560\nN.T., I'm so glad you're here so you can forgive me for this.\n\n20:27.560 --> 20:36.560\nJust like, we're gonna give N.T. a black people wand,\n\n20:36.560 --> 20:42.560\nand he's gonna touch me with it after this.\n\n20:42.560 --> 20:43.560\nMaybe he won't.\n\n20:43.560 --> 20:45.560\nI don't know.\n\n20:45.560 --> 20:47.560\nWell, let's just be clear, at one point,\n\n20:47.560 --> 20:51.560\nhe represents all black people.\n\n20:51.560 --> 20:52.560\nThat seems fair.\n\n20:52.560 --> 20:57.560\nWhen I was a kid, N.T.,\n\n20:57.560 --> 21:01.560\nwhen we would play like tag, flashlight tag,\n\n21:01.560 --> 21:04.560\nkick the can, whatever, when somebody had to be it,\n\n21:04.560 --> 21:07.560\nand the kids would gather in a circle,\n\n21:07.560 --> 21:08.560\nand we would go,\n\n21:08.560 --> 21:13.560\nI got caught in a new sexy minie, Mow,\n\n21:13.560 --> 21:17.560\nand it wasn't Catch a Tiger by the toe.\n\n21:17.560 --> 21:18.560\nIt wasn't Tiger.\n\n21:18.560 --> 21:19.560\nAw?\n\n21:19.560 --> 21:20.560\nCatch a Chevy by the toe.\n\n21:20.560 --> 21:23.560\nAbout half the time it was Catch a Tiger,\n\n21:23.560 --> 21:25.560\nand about the other half of the time,\n\n21:25.560 --> 21:27.560\nthis is the late 70s early 80s,\n\n21:27.560 --> 21:31.560\nin the middle of the Midwest in someone's back yard,\n\n21:31.560 --> 21:35.560\nand there were, you know,\n\n21:35.560 --> 21:39.400\nwas playing or not. I can't remember if it was related to that. But it's like, I didn't\n\n21:39.400 --> 21:49.200\neven know. I never pictured anything. It was just like a word. I'm bringing that up because\n\n21:49.200 --> 21:56.920\nalso as late as my late 20s, early 30s. No, fuck that. I was editing community with Stephen\n\n21:56.920 --> 22:03.360\nSprung, my very gay editor for a community. I didn't know he was gay. I didn't bother.\n\n22:03.360 --> 22:08.120\nI wasn't processing that. I kept going. I had this habit. I would go. I would see an\n\n22:08.120 --> 22:16.480\nedit. I didn't like it. I'd go, that's fucking gay. Fix that. I just saw it like, gay. Just\n\n22:16.480 --> 22:26.440\nmeaning dumb, retarded, stupid, bad. Then it was weeks before. This is just gay, right?\n\n22:26.440 --> 22:34.680\nI wonder if, I wish, I wish. She's just retarded. I wish she was gay. If she wasn't so retarded,\n\n22:34.680 --> 22:38.560\nmaybe there's a way we could put her on some dates and make her gay so that I could also\n\n22:38.560 --> 22:51.040\nuse her as an out for everything. She'd be like, my sister could be a Swiss army knife.\n\n22:51.040 --> 23:01.240\nBut I was out of line. I'm a writer, so it's like the idea of people telling you that something's\n\n23:01.240 --> 23:06.240\nnot funny or something's off limits or you have to censor yourself. That's the more important\n\n23:06.240 --> 23:13.400\nenemy all the time. Because then you're in the den of what evil. You have to guard against\n\n23:13.400 --> 23:23.440\nthose people. Those are the real people that, I'm still convinced of that, but at the same\n\n23:23.440 --> 23:28.800\ntime, maybe this is just getting older. Maybe you just get old and then you get bored and\n\n23:28.800 --> 23:33.800\nthen you start getting sensitive or something. I don't know what my point is. I don't say\n\n23:33.800 --> 23:45.720\nfag or gay anymore. I was just saying, maybe there's a new thing. What do we say now? Awesome.\n\n23:45.720 --> 23:51.920\nAre there any awesome people in the audience? I don't know. Is gay people the last frontier?\n\n23:51.920 --> 23:59.280\nIs there anything left? Are we going to be homogenized after this? Are we going to be\n\n23:59.280 --> 24:07.280\nstar trek? I think it's a human impulse to marginalize certain people to point out differences.\n\n24:07.280 --> 24:14.360\nI think we're fascinated by, we're all insecure. We all have our own kind of needy hang-ups.\n\n24:14.360 --> 24:22.080\nWe have a desire to point out anybody that's different. Even the best among us, I think.\n\n24:22.080 --> 24:25.920\nPeople worry the slippery slope argument is, okay, so we're all going to get along and\n\n24:25.920 --> 24:29.560\nthen the next thing will be tall people, redheads, people with freckles.\n\n24:29.560 --> 24:35.920\nWell, I think the big one, I think that humanity has a better chance of overcoming racism before\n\n24:35.920 --> 24:42.040\nsexism. I think that men are going to hate women longer than they'll hate other races.\n\n24:42.040 --> 24:45.920\nI think sexism is maybe the most pervasive and the most ingrained.\n\n24:45.920 --> 24:48.040\nWhat was the order again, didn't it?\n\n24:48.040 --> 24:54.440\nRight, ladies? Come on. I can't remember my history now from 8th grade. Black men could\n\n24:54.440 --> 25:00.600\nvote in America before women, right? It was first, it was like, okay, these people are\n\n25:00.600 --> 25:07.240\nhuman beings for God's sakes. Let's give them a say in who's president. Yeah, I agree. Shut\n\n25:07.240 --> 25:21.760\nup, Tracy. Get back in the kitchen. I love you. That is kind of amazing. It's noteworthy.\n\n25:21.760 --> 25:30.800\nWomen's hatred of women is just palpable and so justifiable. No. See, it's not funny. It's\n\n25:30.800 --> 25:38.840\nnot even funny to say it. It sounds so real. Women walk down the street. They have to deal\n\n25:38.840 --> 25:46.880\nwith that all the time. They feel like that's something that nobody, the shit that I hear\n\n25:46.880 --> 25:54.080\nfrom women, you want to reject it. Come on. It's not that bad, is it? You ever hear women\n\n25:54.080 --> 25:58.760\ntalk about when they walk down the sidewalk by themselves and somebody drives the car\n\n25:58.760 --> 26:02.800\nby and they say something about the window. They make a noise or a face or something.\n\n26:02.800 --> 26:08.480\nYou want it to not be true. Come on. Life isn't a cartoon, but I've heard it enough from enough\n\n26:08.480 --> 26:15.000\ndifferent sources. First three women that told me that, I was like, fuck you, you're lying.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:21.080\nBut now I realize they were heroes. I should write them a letter. No, it sounds like men\n\n26:21.080 --> 26:31.880\nare pretty frightening. They are frightening. Sorry. If only there was an N.T. of women\n\n26:31.880 --> 26:42.320\nhere that could somehow, but no. You mean a black woman? No. What's an N.T. of women?\n\n26:42.320 --> 26:48.440\nWhy? I was making the joke. Who's here to represent the women in the audience? Because\n\n26:48.440 --> 26:54.360\nit's a bunch of women is the answer. Adam Goldberg, ladies and gentlemen. Adam Goldberg\n\n26:54.360 --> 27:01.760\nstarts the stage. How's it going? Hi, Adam Goldberg. Those ladies can't live with them.\n\n27:01.760 --> 27:07.200\nGotta live with the fear of never living with them. Am I right? Yeah. Let's hear it for\n\n27:07.200 --> 27:14.000\nAdam Goldberg, everybody. Thank you, Adam. Thank you. He's still here. That was called\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:21.320\nan outro. Man, you're treating me like Aaron up here. I think it's amazing for Jeff to\n\n27:21.320 --> 27:25.920\ncome out and say, you know, women are just unfairly hated. Your girlfriend's bad at D&D.\n\n27:25.920 --> 27:30.360\nI know I've only played it three times, but she's played it twice and she's not good at\n\n27:30.360 --> 27:34.080\nit. I'm not making Aaron the N.T. of women. I just don't like the thing that she did\n\n27:34.080 --> 27:39.200\nthat last night. The irony is that the thing that she does that upsets you is calling you\n\n27:39.200 --> 27:45.680\ngay. So we've got into the spiral in cat's asshole of prejudice about prejudice. We need\n\n27:45.680 --> 27:52.200\nthe prejudice about fantasy prejudice. This is interesting. It's literally fantastic racism.\n\n27:52.200 --> 28:06.960\nI just want to absolve the show of this aura of, you know, it's hard to be me and to feel\n\n28:06.960 --> 28:11.120\nfor other people who have different circumstances because, you know, it's hard to, because I\n\n28:11.120 --> 28:15.760\ndon't want to believe it, but I guess I do. I'm a heroine savior. This is my fucking\n\n28:15.760 --> 28:23.840\nface, Dan Harmon. That clearly worked in this side of the room, but it's too mean of me.\n\n28:23.840 --> 28:34.200\nWhat else is going on? I don't know. I made a YouTube video that might be big. I'm not\n\n28:34.200 --> 28:39.000\ngoing to mention it because it's not about promotion, but, you know, I had a job in the\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:46.380\ncity that's good. Promotion would be tacky and crass. We want to maintain a baseline of integrity here.\n\n28:46.380 --> 28:53.480\nI'm the product and I'm unsellable. God, I'm his heroine so much right now.\n\n28:53.480 --> 28:55.920\nWhat about race, Adam? What do you think about race?\n\n28:55.920 --> 28:58.920\nI think there are plenty of them and there's just going to be more.\n\n28:58.920 --> 29:07.000\nWait, wait, wait. What do you know that I don't know? They're making new races?\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:14.000\nHave you been to Pinkberry lately? I haven't, no. They'll swirl the flavors for you.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:18.000\nPinkberry's making new races? Pinkberry's making new races.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:24.000\nThey've got a green tea chocolate chip. Green tea chocolate chip Filipino, yeah.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:29.000\nBut wait, Adam, not just to be the devil's advocate, because I got nothing else to talk\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.480\nabout. Don't work for the devil, but go on.\n\n29:31.480 --> 29:34.360\nBut isn't there going to be less races as we go on?\n\n29:34.360 --> 29:41.560\nThat's true, that's another take on it. But it's been highly theorized that humanity\n\n29:41.560 --> 29:46.920\nwill eventually get to the point where once you can get all your brain data backed up,\n\n29:46.920 --> 29:49.920\nyou can have whatever body you like. You can have octopus slippers.\n\n29:49.920 --> 29:51.920\nWell, that's for sure. Yeah, 10 years from now, you're going to...\n\n29:51.920 --> 29:57.640\nTranshumanism. The end of racism won't end until we're not related to the body we're\n\n29:57.640 --> 29:59.640\nborn in. That's going to be the end of everything.\n\n29:59.640 --> 30:04.640\nThat's got to be 15 years from now. You're going to be able to buy the equivalent of\n\n30:04.640 --> 30:10.200\na video game, and you're going to get to just go into your office and close the door and\n\n30:10.200 --> 30:17.280\ntype in some variables, and you could be a female dog getting fucked by an octopus.\n\n30:17.280 --> 30:21.680\nAnd then just experience what that's like, and then end the program and never tell anybody\n\n30:21.680 --> 30:24.680\nabout it.\n\n30:24.680 --> 30:33.800\nSo how is that going to... Then what's marriage? What's the priest supposed to say then?\n\n30:33.800 --> 30:42.120\nI now pronounce you two people who are kind of points of departure. You may kiss whatever\n\n30:42.120 --> 30:43.120\nand whoever.\n\n30:43.120 --> 30:48.360\nI now pronounce you iny and outy. Society will collapse when we can fuck whoever we\n\n30:48.360 --> 30:53.480\nwant whenever we want. Jeff, you know that the future of our society is being the octopus\n\n30:53.480 --> 30:56.920\nor being the dog. That's going to be the Democrats and the Republican.\n\n30:56.920 --> 30:59.480\nYou're preaching to the choir, baby.\n\n30:59.480 --> 31:05.560\nI think we need to answer a few more questions. We being you, this is Harmontown.\n\n31:05.560 --> 31:10.360\nAdam, we got an election coming up, Adam. I don't know if you're aware of this.\n\n31:10.360 --> 31:11.360\nOh boy.\n\n31:11.360 --> 31:15.400\nWe got a big election coming up. It's right around the corner. Who do you like?\n\n31:15.400 --> 31:23.760\nThis is a good one because... I campaigned for John Edwards in 2007, back before the\n\n31:23.760 --> 31:24.760\nwhole...\n\n31:24.760 --> 31:25.760\nHe's not going to get it.\n\n31:25.760 --> 31:26.760\nOh, he's not going to get it.\n\n31:26.760 --> 31:28.600\nWell, usually you campaign for him. That's a long shot.\n\n31:28.600 --> 31:33.960\nHe cheated on a woman with cancer, which is one of the life sublime glories. It's the\n\n31:33.960 --> 31:39.320\nVR experience of the future, as you get to be the kind of person who's down with... So\n\n31:39.320 --> 31:45.640\nI was up in New Hampshire. The thought ends itself. You're a participant in that.\n\n31:45.640 --> 31:51.120\nAnd God, the fact that I had to pay my own train ticket up to New Hampshire, got to rank\n\n31:51.120 --> 31:56.040\non some doors and the thing about New Hampshire, everyone seems to own a dog there. I don't\n\n31:56.040 --> 31:57.040\nknow.\n\n31:57.040 --> 32:02.080\nThat's my experience. That person agrees, but... And as a person of the Jewish persuasion...\n\n32:02.080 --> 32:07.000\nI'm sorry, we don't need to interrupt.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.560\nJewish people are horrified of dogs.\n\n32:09.560 --> 32:10.560\nWe're listening.\n\n32:10.560 --> 32:11.560\nWe're listening.\n\n32:11.560 --> 32:17.320\nThat's fine. I know you have to drink to to get through this. So Jewish people, terrified\n\n32:17.320 --> 32:21.840\nof dogs. Everyone in New Hampshire owns a dog. You can see that this is... I was like,\n\n32:21.840 --> 32:25.920\noh, knock, knock. Oh, God, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.\n\n32:25.920 --> 32:31.160\nSteal yourself out of them. Political activism is its own reward. Every single house.\n\n32:31.160 --> 32:38.040\nThis has become like a Star Search audition video. That might as well be a hairbrush in\n\n32:38.040 --> 32:39.040\nyour hands.\n\n32:39.040 --> 32:40.040\nOh, God.\n\n32:40.040 --> 32:42.360\nBut the point of my story...\n\n32:42.360 --> 32:44.320\nSo, Romney, you're saying.\n\n32:44.320 --> 32:50.880\nOh, of course. Whichever one is against dog ownership. Freedom for... If you love your\n\n32:50.880 --> 32:56.640\ndog, you will let it free. There's nothing... You're not helping it. You're not... That's\n\n32:56.640 --> 33:02.040\ndigging a hole, but I'll gladly dig it. All right. Dig it. Okay, just bring up Steve\n\n33:02.040 --> 33:03.040\nif he's here.\n\n33:03.040 --> 33:10.320\nNot yet. Adam Goldberg, everybody. Let's say goodnight to him and let's keep going with\n\n33:10.320 --> 33:15.000\nthis momentum. Hey, BJ, you want to come up here? It was BJ. BJ's the guy that I armwrestled\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:23.480\nthat one night. You're not as eager as Adam, but I thought I'd pull you up. I like this\n\n33:23.480 --> 33:27.440\nidea that we have a family starting to grow.\n\n33:27.440 --> 33:37.720\nDan, do we owe it to our podcast listeners to describe it? In penetrating detail, exactly.\n\n33:37.720 --> 33:43.360\nBJ, stand up. Would you please so I can get a good look at you? BJ, for those of you don't\n\n33:43.360 --> 33:51.600\nknow him, he won the Great Race, the Amazing Race. What was it called? Amazing Race? Yeah.\n\n33:51.600 --> 33:57.160\nHe won a million clams for a race. He's got a beard. He has a... What is that? Salmon?\n\n33:57.160 --> 34:02.280\nCoral? What's that scarf? What do you call that? Is that kind of a coral? Kind of a coral\n\n34:02.280 --> 34:11.880\nscarf. It's a silk scarf. He's got a red flannel plaid robe on, and then he's got a mixed\n\n34:11.880 --> 34:17.880\nmatched black and white kind of plaid trousers, like pajamas. He's in pajamas. He's in pajamas.\n\n34:17.880 --> 34:27.480\nHe's pouring vodka into a Coke can right now. He's wearing seafoam crux. Seafoam green? Is that\n\n34:27.480 --> 34:36.060\nclose? Powder? Different color. One is green, one is light blue. God forbid you would be a\n\n34:36.060 --> 34:44.520\nconformist in any way. It's Truman Capote after getting hit by a train. But non-lethally, like\n\n34:44.520 --> 34:50.040\nhe got bounced off of, bounced into the train yard and put himself back together. Oh, God,\n\n34:50.040 --> 34:57.400\nwhat happened? He's pulled up one of his trouser legs to reveal a pretty crude bandage. You're\n\n34:57.400 --> 35:08.240\nwounded, BJ. What the hell happened to you? I fell down. Do you care to elaborate? I was\n\n35:08.240 --> 35:20.960\ngoing really fast. Thanks. Thank you. All right. BJ, everybody. BJ, let's keep it going. Let's\n\n35:20.960 --> 35:29.400\nkeep it going. What else do we got? New black guy. Do you want to come up? Welcome. New black guy,\n\n35:29.400 --> 35:38.640\neverybody. New black guy. Chris? This is Chris, everybody. This guy's black. He's got white\n\n35:38.640 --> 35:43.120\njeans on, lots of holes in the legs. Have you been here before, Chris? I'm sorry? Have you been\n\n35:43.120 --> 35:49.720\nhere before? No, I have not. Okay. Don't be offended if you're a third black person and you're\n\n35:49.720 --> 35:53.200\nsomewhere I can't see you and you're like, what am I, chop-liver? I just want to see who the other\n\n35:53.200 --> 35:59.760\nblack guy was. Oh, Enti. Enti always sits in the front row and he's often been the lightning\n\n35:59.760 --> 36:06.680\nrod of my white guilt. Dan, I don't want to send you into a spiral of chaotic mania, but we have a\n\n36:06.680 --> 36:11.920\nblack woman in the audience tonight. Oh, yeah. It's like doubling down. Yeah, it's crazy. How can I\n\n36:11.920 --> 36:18.320\never relate to anything that you ever experienced? We'll have you up in a minute. Let's ease into it\n\n36:18.320 --> 36:23.360\nwith a black gentleman, first of all. Let's also buffer it with like, let's bring up like an Indian\n\n36:23.360 --> 36:27.800\nguy in between, I don't know, or just a carpenter, like not so that it's not like a race. Do you have\n\n36:27.800 --> 36:36.960\nany mini kanju or any Arapaho in here tonight? No? No, go ahead. All right, so Chris, if there's\n\n36:36.960 --> 36:41.160\nanything you want to say or else we can ask you questions, I don't know. I mean, you can ask me\n\n36:41.160 --> 36:48.400\nwhatever. Okay. Well, what are you? Are you a student? No, I'm an assistant at a production company. It's\n\n36:48.400 --> 36:54.040\nnot really stupid. No, it's nothing. There's nothing. I mean, we didn't break, you know, it's not that\n\n36:54.040 --> 37:00.520\nkind of, you don't have to plug anything. Can you tell us what kind of production that you're\n\n37:00.520 --> 37:09.960\nworking on? It's a TV show. I don't really like a reality show or sitcom or leverage on TNT. Is that\n\n37:09.960 --> 37:19.680\nTimothy Hutton from the dark side? What was the show with the crows or the ravens, the Stephen\n\n37:19.680 --> 37:30.280\nKing story? Dark side? No, no, no. No, I wasn't mad at you. The dark half, the dark half. That was\n\n37:30.280 --> 37:40.520\nTimothy Hutton, right? Yes. Okay. And I emerged victorious. Sorry, Chris. Is Timothy Hutton a\n\n37:40.520 --> 37:47.920\nproducer on that show? No, he's just like the main talent. Yeah, he swings a big dick. He comes\n\n37:47.920 --> 37:51.080\nthrough the office and he goes, who the fuck threw this away? Well, I mean, I don't really\n\n37:51.080 --> 38:03.000\nunderstand why, but whatever. He was an ordinary people. What do you do in the show? I work for\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:08.600\nthe COO of the production company. So I don't really like work for the show show. So you're on\n\n38:08.600 --> 38:13.520\npayroll with the, with like the studio? Like the little production pod? Yeah. Dean Devlin's\n\n38:13.520 --> 38:20.320\ncompany. Oh, Dean Devlin. He did Independence Day, no one knows who. I had a meeting with Dean\n\n38:20.320 --> 38:25.640\nDevlin. We met at Shroud back in our, back in our heyday. We had a meeting with him and Roland\n\n38:25.640 --> 38:32.480\nEmmerich. And he said that they were excited about Godzilla because they took this thing that was\n\n38:32.480 --> 38:45.200\ncheesy and they turned it into something awesome. Are you an aspiring filmmaker? No, actually,\n\n38:45.200 --> 38:51.200\nit was, I kind of just moved out LA on a whim. And I just needed something to do. So I worked at a\n\n38:51.200 --> 38:56.960\nproduction company. Fuck it. I'm moving away soon. Oh, really? You've had enough? Yeah, I mean, I've\n\n38:56.960 --> 39:02.480\nbeen here for like three years. So that Timothy Hutton's really getting under your skin. You've\n\n39:02.480 --> 39:09.840\nhad enough of that fucking asshole. I just had sex, whatever. Wait, but this is now, now you've\n\n39:09.840 --> 39:13.920\ngot me curious, because there's people, the young people that come to LA, they're, they're hungry\n\n39:13.920 --> 39:18.040\nand they want something. If you're moving away, you're, what, what's the aspiration? Is there\n\n39:18.040 --> 39:25.400\nsomething? I'm moving to Peru to teach English. Are you just, oh, okay, okay. I was about to say,\n\n39:25.400 --> 39:29.480\nare you just like a trust fun kid? You're very, you're, okay. So you're, you're, you're, but\n\n39:29.480 --> 39:37.440\nyou're, you're like a, you're like a, kind of a hippie, like, I've done a drug or two. And you're\n\n39:37.440 --> 39:42.160\njust kind of, can I ask how old are you? 25. Yeah, okay. Are you going to go to Peru and do\n\n39:42.160 --> 39:48.360\nthat? Was it called ayahuasca or ayahuasca? Oh God, yes. Oh, really? Are you really going to do\n\n39:48.360 --> 39:54.280\nit? Yeah. Like that's my mission to find a shaman in the Amazon forest, like 200 miles away from\n\n39:54.280 --> 40:01.400\ncivilization. Get really fucked up and then go teach English. I'd probably be better at it. The\n\n40:01.400 --> 40:10.040\nfirst English phrase they all, all your students learn is, oh, look at my hand. Jaguar is, is, is\n\n40:10.040 --> 40:16.360\nasking me for a job interview. Ayahuasca is the thing from, but well, this isn't going to help you\n\n40:16.360 --> 40:25.040\nfrom altered states. The William Hurt movie, you guys are whatever. It's, it's Rob. Rob's coming up\n\n40:25.040 --> 40:32.760\nnext. You drink, you drink this like it's made out of like herbs and root and they just crush it up\n\n40:32.760 --> 40:37.640\nand make a drink out of it. You go to the Amazon of this shaman, like, like puts it down your gullet\n\n40:37.640 --> 40:42.640\nand then you freak out. And you barf, you barf for a while, right? You barf and have you done it\n\n40:42.640 --> 40:46.760\nbefore? And just do everything. Have you done it before? No, I know people who have done it. Right.\n\n40:46.760 --> 40:52.160\nLike, yeah. So how primary is that? Is that the primary thing you're going down there for? No, not\n\n40:52.160 --> 40:59.920\neven a little bit. Like that's not my first goal. That's just a side mission. Do you speak\n\n40:59.920 --> 41:05.480\nSpanish well? No, but I speak French and Creole, so it won't be hard to learn it. I'll take your word\n\n41:05.480 --> 41:11.360\nfor it. What? I say I'm going to do it as I learn it. It's not simple. He's 25. He's a millennial.\n\n41:11.360 --> 41:18.400\nThey don't, they don't, they don't care. They're socially conscious and they, they, they, they're\n\n41:18.400 --> 41:24.800\ncomfortable in the world. I don't know. It's a, it's a new thing. They're, they're reacting to\n\n41:24.800 --> 41:31.760\nGeneration X. They're like, why, why did you, why, why, why, why Weezer? Why? Why not? Why not?\n\n41:31.760 --> 41:38.360\nNow, Chris, if it was 1830, what do you think you, what would be a, I mean, let's, I mean, what do\n\n41:38.360 --> 41:54.400\nyou think you'd be up to? Don't ask black people time travel. Just as a rule. Seriously, don't\n\n41:54.400 --> 41:59.640\nlike it because we can't go back. Please let that be the title of the episode. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No,\n\n41:59.640 --> 42:08.880\nthat's great. That's the title of this episode. Don't ask black people time travel. Yeah, yeah,\n\n42:08.880 --> 42:14.000\nstands out of here. I mean, there's just too good. All right. Well, all right. Well, let's, let's,\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:18.480\nlet's, let's, let's, let's, let's end on a high point like Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you for\n\n42:18.480 --> 42:29.520\nbeing a sport. All right, let's, let's, let's go to black female. Do you want to come up? What\n\n42:29.520 --> 42:40.320\nis your name? Char. Char. Star. Oh, star. Oh, she has a star. She's wearing a star hair. Star.\n\n42:40.320 --> 42:48.240\nStar with two Rs. Maybe. No, just, just spelled like the celestial body. That's my, my whole name\n\n42:48.240 --> 42:54.440\nStarlene, but I just go by star. Nice. Short for Starlene. That's awesome. Does that star glow in\n\n42:54.440 --> 42:59.600\nthe dark? What do you have on your head? No, it's just, it's like a Scott Pilgrim thing. Like, I'm\n\n42:59.600 --> 43:06.320\njust a big nerd. Sorry. Are you from LA? No, I'm originally from Miami. But I mean, do you live\n\n43:06.320 --> 43:12.080\nin LA now? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. North Hollywood. How long have you been here? About two and a half\n\n43:12.080 --> 43:19.120\nyears. What are your dreams and ambitions? I would like to be a cartoonist and print books and stuff\n\n43:19.120 --> 43:24.840\nlike that. I just have a webcomic now. So it's, what's it called? Let's plug it. Oh, candy. Candy\n\n43:24.840 --> 43:31.200\ncomics.com with an eye. Candy with an eye. Candy comics with an eye. Yeah. It's short for candy\n\n43:31.200 --> 43:38.560\napia. All right. So you want to be a cartoonist, you're making it happen for yourself. You're not\n\n43:38.560 --> 43:45.240\na quitter like Chris, you're not going to just fling yourself off into the ice fishing. Go get\n\n43:45.240 --> 43:51.600\nhired with a show. That's pretty awesome, though. Like, no, no, he's, he's more activated than us.\n\n43:51.600 --> 43:55.680\nFar more noble to go teach. You're like me. You're going to stay here and you're going to, you're\n\n43:55.680 --> 44:02.000\nproclaimed to God that you'd rather die of starvation while you do what you do. And then 15\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:06.080\nyears from now. Pretty much. Yeah. Well, God help you star. Yeah.\n\n44:06.080 --> 44:17.640\nHow old are you star? 29. 29. He looks like a 22. I moisturize a lot. Just naturally, you know, my\n\n44:17.640 --> 44:23.160\nproducts are just, you're like, she's a great slow. You don't want to look ashy. You have to. You\n\n44:23.160 --> 44:30.920\nhave to. You get ashy. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that. I know, I know about that culture. I know what\n\n44:30.920 --> 44:36.040\nashy means. I went to predominantly black grade schools and middle schools, Jeff. I was surrounded\n\n44:36.040 --> 44:43.960\nby people constantly struggling with ashyness. You're a real hero. Yeah. Boy, I didn't know you'd\n\n44:43.960 --> 44:52.840\nbeen through so much struggle. I dwelt among them, Jeff. I'm sort of like a man called horse. I\n\n44:52.840 --> 44:58.840\nwas 80s references that don't, I'm already out on a limb of being racist, ironically. And then I,\n\n44:58.840 --> 45:05.800\nand then I'm busting out my Tron references. There's no difference between the show and Christmas\n\n45:05.800 --> 45:16.640\nwith your uncle. It's like, oh, I'm sorry. There's a difference. $10. At least your uncle gives you\n\n45:16.640 --> 45:23.360\nsocks. Your uncle gives you $10. I'm so sorry, you guys. There's a pair of socks waiting for each of\n\n45:23.360 --> 45:30.320\nyou by the she-hulk section on your way out. All right, star. Well, let's see. Is there anything\n\n45:30.320 --> 45:36.960\non your mind? You got an open pulpit here. I just like hearing you talk. I don't. Really? I've heard\n\n45:36.960 --> 45:41.560\nthat before. Like people say, you know what? Because sometimes the show's going bad. I go,\n\n45:41.560 --> 45:45.920\nlike, ah, this show sucks. And then people go, yeah, but at a certain point, people just like to\n\n45:45.920 --> 45:51.520\nlisten to you talk. Yeah. Like for whatever reason, all your ramblings end up coming back to some type\n\n45:51.520 --> 45:58.640\nof like life affirming point. Yeah. And I just, I don't know, somehow listening to you worry about\n\n45:58.640 --> 46:04.400\neverything makes me feel like comforted. Like, okay, I'm not the only one that worries. You know\n\n46:04.400 --> 46:09.520\nwhat I think it is, although I'm the least qualified to say it, I feel like if I were not me, the\n\n46:09.520 --> 46:18.360\nthing that would comfort me about listening to me would be like watching me thrash and flail so,\n\n46:18.360 --> 46:26.840\nso hard. Like, and actually, like, it's like, well, if there, if there, if things were that bad,\n\n46:26.840 --> 46:31.520\nhe would have knocked into something by now that would really bum me the fuck out. But really,\n\n46:31.520 --> 46:38.440\nit's, I'm so pathetic. I just kind of like, it's like, it's like, if you, if you, if you take acid,\n\n46:38.440 --> 46:42.560\nlike, I don't know if you're like Chris, if you like, like, you know, like a big drughead. But like,\n\n46:42.560 --> 46:49.200\nwhen I was Chris's age, like, you know, Chris, we're worried about you. You take mushrooms,\n\n46:49.200 --> 46:53.440\nyou take acid, and there's such a thing as a bad trip, you know, people are scared about a bad\n\n46:53.440 --> 47:00.120\ntrip. And then there's this idea that worrying about a bad trip can give you a bad trip. So what\n\n47:00.120 --> 47:05.240\nhappens is this fence goes up, we go like, no, I don't want to talk about it. It's very similar to\n\n47:05.240 --> 47:10.840\nany kind of like, like, like, anything. Like, it just always, that's the human mind at work. We\n\n47:10.840 --> 47:16.240\nbuild these fences up, because it's often very healthy of us to sequester ourselves and limit\n\n47:16.240 --> 47:20.760\nourselves. So like, like humans under duress, like you pay, put this on your tongue, and you're\n\n47:20.760 --> 47:25.440\ngonna see spots, and you're gonna, the owls might talk to you. Also, you may fucking freak out,\n\n47:25.440 --> 47:31.160\nand you think that the earth is opening up and a hand made of logs is dragging you down. But,\n\n47:31.160 --> 47:35.880\nbut, but just keep eating oranges, and that won't happen. And like, don't talk about it, you're\n\n47:35.880 --> 47:41.880\ngonna make it happen, bro, you're gonna make it happen. I try as hard as I can to make it happen,\n\n47:41.880 --> 47:47.600\nand it doesn't happen. And I think that's uplifting. Maybe that's my personal theory, as\n\n47:47.600 --> 47:51.680\nwhy people would possibly be willing to tolerate me talking. Because they go, well, if you can't\n\n47:51.680 --> 47:57.640\ndestroy the earth with your mouth, then maybe it has some sturdiness to it. Maybe things aren't\n\n47:57.640 --> 48:10.240\nthat bad. Do you agree with that, Star? Yes, I do. Star, ladies and gentlemen. I'm starting to feel,\n\n48:10.240 --> 48:18.640\nI think I might be the next Paula Poundstone. We're in Dick Cavett country right now. This is\n\n48:18.640 --> 48:29.800\nnice. Who's your friend? Asian guy, come up. Asian guy! What's your name, sir? Jason. Jason,\n\n48:29.800 --> 48:35.160\neverybody. Welcome, Jason, to the stage. All right, what's going on? Jason, Jason, what's,\n\n48:35.160 --> 48:44.880\nwhat are Asian people thinking? Why are Asian people second best to you? Oh, yeah, you check\n\n48:44.880 --> 48:52.560\nthat to heart. Make a comparison. Well, because Asian, to me, in my mind, Asian is half of the\n\n48:52.560 --> 48:57.360\nearth. And in fact, the half of the earth that is like teaming with people, so more than half of\n\n48:57.360 --> 49:03.320\nthe earth. But it just means eastern, because we've gotten so tied up and like, well, I don't want\n\n49:03.320 --> 49:09.840\nto be racist by ordering a Korean beer in a Chinese restaurant. So we've started to, you know, and the\n\n49:09.840 --> 49:15.600\nmost racist thing you could ever do is confuse a Chinese person for a Vietnamese person, etc. So\n\n49:15.600 --> 49:22.400\nI'm pretty convinced that white people at one point decided, okay, Asian, let's go. You used to be\n\n49:22.400 --> 49:28.240\nOriental, like, and then we rightfully decided, like, well, that sounds a little awkward and weird.\n\n49:28.240 --> 49:34.800\nWhat is your heritage? Korean. Korean. Anyways, that's the answer. It's like, I don't know,\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:42.760\nblack's more specific, man. Asian, come on, dime a dozen. I mean, to the point where, you know,\n\n49:42.760 --> 49:47.920\nthere's some Asian countries that are like, you have to have just one baby. There's too many Asian\n\n49:47.920 --> 49:55.800\npeople. That's what they're saying. The Asian people are saying it. I didn't say it. Jason,\n\n49:55.800 --> 50:02.840\nyou're more than welcome here. Just saying, like, I read the news. I don't read the news. I don't\n\n50:02.840 --> 50:09.640\nread the news. I get the news about Chinese people from my mother in 1983. Where did you grow up,\n\n50:09.640 --> 50:14.560\nJason? What's that? Where did you grow up here? You know, like, yeah, where'd you go to school? In the\n\n50:14.560 --> 50:21.560\nValley, in North Hollywood, and Burbank. Oh, cool. Yeah. Not that exciting. Nobody's that\n\n50:21.560 --> 50:25.200\nexciting. I'm bringing up people because I'm not exciting. Who cares, you know, what's, yeah, who\n\n50:25.200 --> 50:41.040\nknows? What are you doing? What are your dreams, aspirations? I am living them already. Can we\n\n50:41.040 --> 50:48.680\nask? Can we pry? Well, I worked in music, so I wanted to do since I was a kid, so I worked out\n\n50:48.680 --> 50:53.800\nwell enough. What do you do? Are you a musician or do you? No, I work with a lot of musicians and\n\n50:53.800 --> 51:03.320\nalso work for BMG, do a lot of stuff for them. You're an engineer? Right now I'm doing royalty\n\n51:03.320 --> 51:10.440\nstuff. But yeah. You like music that much that just being close to it in that capacity is exciting\n\n51:10.440 --> 51:15.360\nfor you. Yeah, for money thing, I'm just doing. We're the big companies, but also working with\n\n51:15.360 --> 51:20.840\nartists, so I do that on the side. Hmm. Do you feel that Dan Harmon's been fair to the Asians at\n\n51:20.840 --> 51:25.080\nHarmontown? Do you feel represented or do you feel there's a lack of Asian representation? I think\n\n51:25.080 --> 51:34.920\nthere's been favoritism. But to a large extent. But you know, how are Asian people with time\n\n51:34.920 --> 51:50.200\ntravel questions? I think it depends on the country and the time. Okay, it's it's it's Burma. 1822.\n\n51:50.200 --> 52:02.440\nI think. Oh, he's got something. I think Asians are cool with Burma. I don't I haven't read anything\n\n52:02.440 --> 52:08.920\nabout Asians versus Burmese. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't read any problems. Right. You hear that 1822\n\n52:08.920 --> 52:18.160\nBurma? That's a that's a badge you can put on your website. You're gonna get a pass. Your parents\n\n52:18.160 --> 52:25.520\nare there. How many generations deep since we know since you're ethnically Asian that at some point\n\n52:25.520 --> 52:34.520\nin your lineage, someone came over after a Mayflower thing. That's all I know. How many where\n\n52:34.520 --> 52:41.680\nare your parents? America where they born American where your parents moved here. And your parents\n\n52:41.680 --> 52:46.960\nare your grandparents. My parents. Okay, so your second generation Korean. That's America. I don't\n\n52:46.960 --> 52:50.760\nknow how those things work. Yeah. So I think that's what that means second generation because your\n\n52:50.760 --> 52:56.120\nparents were immigrants, right? Am I getting this right? I feel like Archie Bunker. He's first\n\n52:56.120 --> 53:00.560\ngeneration America. Oh, oh, first generation Korean American. There you go. So what so his\n\n53:00.560 --> 53:10.280\nparents are zero. Yeah, because they're they're Korean. Interesting. This is a great night at\n\n53:10.280 --> 53:13.760\nour town. You know, I need to know this stuff. I'm going to start my own town. I need to know\n\n53:13.760 --> 53:22.280\nwhat to say to the Korean people as they join the town. You're zero. Welcome aboard. So this\n\n53:22.280 --> 53:28.120\nbreak. So okay, this is good because I thought like your parents there. So English is a second\n\n53:28.120 --> 53:34.400\nlanguage for them. Yeah. So and they are they proof we call them pretty traditional. I mean,\n\n53:34.400 --> 53:44.480\ncompared to you, Shirley. Yeah. Right. So all right. Your mom and dad's thoughts about black people.\n\n53:44.480 --> 53:50.480\nThis is because this is what I find fascinating. Like, like, what, what's, you know, like, I'm up\n\n53:50.480 --> 53:56.040\non Mount Olympus, you know, I'm drinking my Diet Coke and watching everybody fight it out. Like,\n\n53:56.040 --> 54:00.920\nwhat's what are the like, but you need to get these glimpses of like, oh, Koreans are the Korean\n\n54:00.920 --> 54:04.960\nshop owners, like, like so racist against the black guy, you see it in a movie and you go like,\n\n54:04.960 --> 54:09.440\nwhat's going on? What? Why aren't you guys just burning down the White House? Why aren't you\n\n54:09.440 --> 54:15.720\njust mad because you're all poor? And the answer is fucking hegemony. I'm like, like, like, white\n\n54:15.720 --> 54:22.400\npeople are genius manipulators. So we've taken over the earth. So I want to know what your mom\n\n54:22.400 --> 54:29.920\nand dad will like what the weird racist shit they say in the living room about black people. Also,\n\n54:29.920 --> 54:37.560\nwhat are their names? First of all, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. They don't say anything racist. See,\n\n54:37.560 --> 54:42.000\nwe're just trying to get stuff out based on what happened between Koreans and black people. No,\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:46.320\nno, no, no, I'm fine. I'm doing my thing. I'm flailing around and proving that the world's not\n\n54:46.320 --> 54:53.000\nthat bad. See, see, you just kick every rock over. There's not a scorpion under it. There's\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:57.400\nnothing. Nothing's going wrong. Do you ever go to Korea? Have you been there? Yeah. You enjoyed\n\n54:57.400 --> 55:04.680\nthere? North or south, by the way? That's important. South. Yeah. Okay. Those are good. Good guys. Yeah.\n\n55:04.680 --> 55:17.440\nGood guys. Those are the good guys. Yeah. All right. What else? What else? What's going on?\n\n55:17.440 --> 55:26.680\nGood. What are we? This is your last chance to ask a first generation Korean something. Don't\n\n55:26.680 --> 55:36.640\nwaste it then. Breaking bad? What do you think about breaking bad? Breaking bad? Pretty great.\n\n55:36.640 --> 55:42.400\nAll right. Yeah. See, you're kind of like just like an American person. I am. Yeah, I am more\n\n55:42.400 --> 55:48.440\nAmerican, pretty whitewash. Yeah. It's almost like race is an artificial construct. Yeah.\n\n55:48.440 --> 55:58.640\nBoring. All right. It's Jason, everybody. Jason. I didn't mean you were boring.\n\n55:58.640 --> 56:04.680\nMay I make a suggestion? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep going with the racial census of Harmontown.\n\n56:04.680 --> 56:10.560\nGet a Hispanic up here. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. That's very important, actually. And I'll tell\n\n56:10.560 --> 56:18.320\nyou why. Big failing on community. We had Ken Jong, who's Korean, but who apparently ended up\n\n56:18.320 --> 56:22.760\nplaying a Chinese character. That was always a point of contention. Then Danny Pudi, who was\n\n56:22.760 --> 56:28.000\nIndian, was playing a guy who was scripted as Palestinian. That was a point of contention.\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:35.760\nBut there was basically no Latino people, Latino, Latin people. I thought Starburns was Latino.\n\n56:35.760 --> 56:42.920\nThis is closer. All right. Who's going to represent the Latin America? Here we go.\n\n56:42.920 --> 56:58.800\nWhat's your name, ma'am? Piper. Piper? Aye, aye, aye. We did have Juliet. I remember when she\n\n56:58.800 --> 57:05.080\nwas in town, she came up. She's full blown Mexican. She's actually living in Mexico trying to get a\n\n57:05.080 --> 57:10.920\njob up here. She's also an animator, too, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Piper, what do you do? I work in\n\n57:10.920 --> 57:21.000\nhealthcare. Well, I can be specific and say healthcare finance, but that's a little bit more\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:27.520\nboring than just healthcare. But it really is so boring. It's fascinating to people who are sick\n\n57:27.520 --> 57:33.800\nand tired of hearing about actors and headshots and scripts and stuff. Healthcare is something\n\n57:33.800 --> 57:39.720\nyou hear. To me, it just bounces off of my head. We're doing political debates right now. We're\n\n57:39.720 --> 57:49.320\ntalking about HMOs and hedge nuns and the fucking hedge nuns. I don't know what the hell Medicare,\n\n57:49.320 --> 57:53.320\nwhat I don't know what any of that means. I don't expect you to explain it to me. What is your\n\n57:53.320 --> 58:03.560\nheritage? Where your ancestors from? I'm Puerto Rican. Puerto Rican? Yeah. Are you going to take\n\n58:03.560 --> 58:13.800\nthat? I mean, I'm only a half-blood, so. Right. Wait, did you grow up in a bilingual household?\n\n58:13.800 --> 58:19.320\nYes. How'd you do in English classes in school, like writing essays and stuff?\n\n58:19.320 --> 58:26.920\nPretty well. Yeah. I have an ex-girlfriend of mine was an English teacher in Los Angeles,\n\n58:26.920 --> 58:33.240\nand there's a phenomenon where very, very bright kids who grew up in bilingual households who\n\n58:33.240 --> 58:38.520\nwas just where LA is teeming with that. These genius kids, I mean, how many, I don't speak two\n\n58:38.520 --> 58:44.200\nlanguages, but these kids are like, regardless of their IQ, they grow up in these households\n\n58:44.200 --> 58:52.200\nwhere you're bouncing back and forth between Spanish and English, for instance. Apparently,\n\n58:54.040 --> 58:58.200\nthey suffer in the English grades because they don't actually, they don't get to\n\n58:58.200 --> 59:05.080\nbuckle down and be Frasier at English. They're more acrobatic, which is a talent unto itself\n\n59:05.080 --> 59:09.720\nthat should be more valuable than it is, but anyways, I was just curious about that. Well,\n\n59:09.720 --> 59:17.800\nI mean, my mother grew up in the States, so it's not like, I just mainly got yelled at in Spanish,\n\n59:17.800 --> 59:23.720\nor, you know, like any. Do you speak Spanish? I can read it and write it, but I don't speak it well.\n\n59:23.720 --> 59:29.080\nLook, we asked for, let's say, put that down. You're grounded. Clean your room. You're not good\n\n59:29.080 --> 59:33.560\nenough. You know, average things that every Hispanic mom says. Is there anyone who feels\n\n59:33.560 --> 59:39.400\nthey're more Hispanic than? You probably are. You probably are. Oh, no. I see silence. You\n\n59:39.400 --> 59:43.400\nwin the Thunderdome. You're fine. I thought it'd be interesting if somebody came up and, like,\n\n59:43.400 --> 59:56.120\ntried to knock your hat off. All right. What do we ask? What do we ask Piper? What do you think\n\n59:56.120 --> 01:00:03.400\nof my writing? You know, I think you're a genius, which I'm not just saying to kiss your ass.\n\n01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:10.040\nThat's interesting. I find it interesting. I was told not to respond to any text tonight\n\n01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:16.440\nbecause I'm with my hero and didn't want to get heckled. Oh, do I bug people about getting texts\n\n01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:22.520\nand stuff in the audience? No, just because I was sitting up front. Oh, yeah. It's pretty\n\n01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.720\nlaissez-faire here. It's not rigorously structured. I didn't want to be rude. Okay, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.920\nAlthough Jeff will come down on you pretty hard if you're my girlfriend. As far as I can tell,\n\n01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:38.520\nthat's the only standard that's actually upheld. I mean, the night's not over yet. Are you familiar\n\n01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:45.080\nwith my girlfriend, Erin McGathy? No, you know, I've got to be honest. I really just started\n\n01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:51.240\nwatching Community because I'm in love with Donald Glover. Can I just plug that? Yeah. No, you\n\n01:00:51.240 --> 01:01:05.720\ncan plug that. Yeah. Can I strap that on? Yeah, no, it's good. The kid could use a break. Like,\n\n01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:12.040\nthat's all. Do what you can. Did I spread the word that Donald Glover's out there? He needs your\n\n01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:17.880\nhelp, everybody. He's amazing. I think he's, you know, I hate to play favorites and people always\n\n01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.680\nlike, but I would always say people would go as your favorite and then I would go. Nobody,\n\n01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.840\nI'm not allowed to say that, but then I would always also, supposedly ironically, I would go.\n\n01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.760\nBut Donald's my favorite. But the beauty is, I wasn't being ironic. I mean, he's amazing.\n\n01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:38.680\nAnd he works really hard. And he puts out rap albums and all of his raps are about how hard he\n\n01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:44.680\nworks and how women need to get used to the fact that I'm going to keep working really hard.\n\n01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:51.640\nI'm going to stay up all night. You got a problem with that? I got work to do.\n\n01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:01.400\nIt's funny. And he really means it. And some of his raps get really dark,\n\n01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.280\nlike, because he's like, he's actually like literally talking about like working until he\n\n01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.800\ndropped dead. Kind of like, like it's a, it's poetic. It's disgusting. It's beautiful.\n\n01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.240\nDan, do you think there's a way this might be too high concept? And if it is, we can edit it out\n\n01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.000\nfrom the podcast. Do you think we can bring Spencer up our dungeon master and bring all\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.800\nof the people we have of different ethnicities and put them in some sort of D&D Thunderdome\n\n01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:29.240\ntogether and maybe settle some, some weird racial Thunderdome?\n\n01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.000\nI think the only person that's not, that would have a problem with that is Spencer,\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.880\nbecause you're talking about characters need character sheets. Is that above and beyond\n\n01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:45.080\nthe call of duty? Spencer, come on up. Let's try, let's try it out.\n\n01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.440\nI'm not sure what's on the table here, but I'm just saying it's like\n\n01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:03.240\nwe have Spencer, our dungeon master here. We're going to try to settle some old racial scores\n\n01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:10.440\nhere. You're saying we have all of our ethnic guests. Who feels unrepresented ethnically right\n\n01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:21.400\nnow? Anybody? All right, we're good. Does Adam know that Asperger's is in a race? Or is he going\n\n01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:29.720\nto come bounding up again? We could make him an honorary race. But yeah, I mean what, they're\n\n01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.280\ngoing to have to share a microphone. It might be more trouble than it's worth. It's the kind\n\n01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:40.760\nof idea that makes everyone clap, but then turns out like it doesn't really work. Is there a way\n\n01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.560\nto make that work, Spencer, or no? Well, I mean, I don't know how to teach tons of people how to\n\n01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:50.520\nplay, but if you guys go along with like that, you're just acting in the in the story of what\n\n01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:55.080\nthe hell we're talking about on stage, like it should be kind of okay. I could make a suggestion.\n\n01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.320\nI don't want to put things too much on the rails, but I am a writer by profession and a storyteller.\n\n01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:06.760\nMy suggestion would be that maybe perhaps at some point in the adventure that unfolds, maybe we\n\n01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:15.480\nwould encounter some kind of spiritual situation where there would call for a chorus of spirits\n\n01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:22.520\nfrom beyond a multi and that would be like a green chorus. I'm just trying to reverse engineer\n\n01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.440\nfrom what it's the reality is going to be like eight people standing in front of a microphone\n\n01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.640\ngoing like this. So what would they be playing? Maybe or maybe a hydra.\n\n01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:39.800\nA racial hydra. Should we get Steve up here? Yeah, Steve Agee who was here last week.\n\n01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:46.600\nI know you're you're wondering what you should do, Piper. I wonder too.\n\n01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.680\nWell, well, first of all, let's give Piper her props and we'll let you can have your seat so\n\n01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:58.840\nthat you're a little bit offended. You didn't ask me what my family thinks about black. Well,\n\n01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:05.400\nI didn't ask everybody. I only asked the Korean guy what his family because I didn't I mean,\n\n01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:11.320\nI don't know, somehow it felt funnier to do that. Maybe that's a new I discovered a new form of\n\n01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:17.160\nracism that that I think that's hilarious that Korean people and black people think if they\n\n01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.560\nwouldn't get along. But I didn't I didn't find anything funny about the idea of digging that up\n\n01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:26.920\nwith with with you. That's okay. I was just feeling left out. Well, don't know. It's all because I\n\n01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.080\nam a horrible, weird twisted labyrinth of racism. How do your parents feel about black people? Yeah,\n\n01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:37.000\ntell us now. I mean, I solely date black guys. So they're pretty used to it by now. But it's\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nthe reason you do it is because obviously they hate black people. No, no, I mean, I think they're\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.440\nokay with it. Why Donald Glover and I should get married. But your dad didn't sit on the edge of\n\n01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:54.360\nyour bed at night and go, will you do me one favor? If you could do one thing for me, Piper,\n\n01:05:54.360 --> 01:06:02.040\nplease just like really. I mean, something I mean, like when you have a fetish like that,\n\n01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.920\nmaybe, well, I don't know. My mom didn't like hate redheads. No, I mean, I don't care. I'm from\n\n01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:11.320\nSeattle. My parents are very liberal. What do you think it was? So you're saying you're you're\n\n01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:16.280\nowning a an actual physical fetish. Like if you if you're walking down the street, you see an\n\n01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:23.320\nattractive African American man, you you you're gonna like your senses are heightened. Like my\n\n01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:29.320\nspidey senses. Yeah, probably. Yeah. So what do you think that's childhood experience? Do you think\n\n01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:35.080\nthere was some hot guy that like, you know, I don't even know. Yeah, I don't know. Because I don't\n\n01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:40.280\nknow. I have a thing about redheads. And I don't know, you know, like I had a redhead aunt. That's\n\n01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:47.000\ncreepy. Batgirl was a redhead. I used to watch Batman reruns and Batgirl when she would, Yvonne\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.960\nCraig, when she would become Batgirl, she'd have this beautiful red wig like flowing out from under\n\n01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:57.000\nher bat mask. And she'd be kicking around under tights. And but then there was also Nicole\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.720\nMcHugh in kindergarten. Like she was this beautiful little redhead. Well, you can't say a kindergarteners\n\n01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:10.200\nbeautiful. I was a kindergartener too. I was I wasn't in a van outside the school. This is hot\n\n01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:25.560\nkindergarteners. She had everything, man. Could she finger paint? I remember distinctly remember\n\n01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.800\nher as being a redhead. That's got to be as far back as you can possibly go. That was so but I\n\n01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:35.880\ndon't know. The question is, is my circuit board, does it have a predilection? Do I see the red hair\n\n01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:42.120\nand it's instinctive? Is there something or is it a childhood experience? We go to our graves\n\n01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:47.960\nwondering about that. I mean, maybe it was the lack of growing up. I mean, I grew up with like two\n\n01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:57.080\nblack kids. Maybe. I mean, I, you know, I don't know. Yeah. It's like being in Harmontown. Yeah,\n\n01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:07.160\nexcept for NT is my neighbor. So I get to see him all the time. Sorry, Dan. Any? I mean, I wish.\n\n01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.520\nHey, what's that? There's more. There's more to this thing.\n\n01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:22.520\nOh, yeah, no, you can sit down. Yeah. You know, like that, that spiraled very quickly because I\n\n01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:27.320\nwas like, who's more embarrassed and who like what's what's the backstory? What's going on? I\n\n01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.880\ncould now know it's forever rotating. I don't want to embarrass you guys.\n\n01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:41.240\nWell, because obviously there's some kind of weird platonic. Maybe not. Maybe. No, but I'm saying\n\n01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.880\nlike, we don't, maybe the driver's turned off to the Madonna in after this. I don't, I don't know\n\n01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:51.720\nwho feels what and what's going on. But I know, I know a minefield when I see one. Like, and I've\n\n01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.360\nbeen in them and I've, I've appreciated it if people didn't bother to exacerbate it. Steve,\n\n01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.680\nAG, how do your parents feel about black people? My parents are dead. They were killed by black\n\n01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:09.880\npeople. Why don't you ask me how I feel about black people, Jeff? Because you own everything.\n\n01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.440\nI assume they're fine with them. My parents are all alive, actually.\n\n01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.880\nMy parents were too fine with black people. My parents were so fine with black people that\n\n01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.920\nthey made me racist. They made me the new definition of racist, which is racially obsessed. I've\n\n01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:33.480\ntalked about this a lot of, a lot. Like, it's my, my, my origin story is my mom had, I was playing\n\n01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:40.200\nwith these two Sesame Street figures. One was Gordon and one was Lewis or maybe Mr. Hooper.\n\n01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:47.160\nLet's keep it simple. We're playing with a Mr. Hooper character. That's amazing.\n\n01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:59.400\nHe owned a store. And my mom said, what's the, what's the difference between those two guys\n\n01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:05.080\nthat you're playing with? And I was like, I don't know. She's like, really? You don't know? You\n\n01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.560\ndon't know anything different about them? I said, well, one guy's got an orange shirt. I said,\n\n01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:15.320\nI said something like Trivial. And my mom, if she had stopped their fucking bullseye,\n\n01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:21.560\ngreat 70s liberal mom, instead, she goes like, that is so good because the difference is one\n\n01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:27.880\nis black and one is white. And it's so good that you don't know because a lot of people do know\n\n01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:33.640\nthe difference. And it's a big thing in this country. And you're going to learn, but my mom\n\n01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.640\nhad a well intended like, like, stuff just made a balloon animal out of my brain. And there was\n\n01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:45.640\na mini series about the Holocaust on network TV at some point when I was a kid. And I remember\n\n01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:51.080\nmy mom coming into my bedroom and sitting on the foot of my bed and going, Daniel, wake up. Listen.\n\n01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.640\nIt may not happen tomorrow, but it will happen at some point. There is going to be a time when\n\n01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:04.280\npeople start to deny that something called the Holocaust happened. Whoa, what? And you need to\n\n01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:11.560\nremember that it happened because I might be dead saw a Holocaust deniers. Well, I think they were\n\n01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.200\naround at the time. I think she read a crawl at the end of a fucking movie and took it to the\n\n01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.520\nstreets. I don't think she was that imaginative. This is the same woman who said of everyone\n\n01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.880\nloves Raymond. Are these writers under our floorboards? She's pretty impressionable.\n\n01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:32.040\nThat's why I moved to LA because I like, like, how do I get this woman to love me? The answer was\n\n01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.840\nobvious. Like, like, like make the talking box talk.\n\n01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:46.120\nStill hasn't fucking worked. She's still a bitch. All right. All right. It's holy shit. It's 9 30.\n\n01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:53.160\nYeah. Oh, fuck. Spencer, I love race. Spencer, our denture master, bring us up to date. Where are\n\n01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:59.400\nwe in our journey? When we last met, our heroes had newly resolved to end Admiral Darkstar's\n\n01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:05.240\nblight on the forest. Coming upon the mound of corpses, Sharpian company discovered an unlikely\n\n01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.560\nally in the form of Morris Goldbright, a cleric. Swiftly, they came upon the dark ziggurat,\n\n01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.280\nthinking quickly quark hit himself in among corpses, infiltrating the dark compound.\n\n01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:21.400\nWith a stolen cloak, Sharpie smuggled his compatriots in through the front door.\n\n01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:27.560\nAfter defeating a skeletal abomination, Sharpie, quark, Mulraine and Morris stopped taking a breather\n\n01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:36.200\nbefore the climactic encounter upstairs. Spencer, I love you so much. That was really good.\n\n01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.920\nThat was really good. We should call it quits. But more important, more important than me loving\n\n01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.160\nyou. I want to say because I never get a chance to tell you, everybody, everybody loves you.\n\n01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:50.920\nDon't don't don't don't don't let that affect you. I love you guys too. You're all really great.\n\n01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:55.000\nThanks for the comment that I hear all the time is man, did you hit the fucking jackpot?\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.040\nWas he a plant? What are you? You asked for a dungeon master and he raised his hand and he\n\n01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:02.200\ncame up and the original idea was that we were going to try out different people every week.\n\n01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.520\nWe'd find the best dungeon master, but we found Spencer like everyone else can go.\n\n01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.640\nIs that right? Yeah. Can I tell you guys a weird story about that is like I listened to your podcast\n\n01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.280\na few times and I was going to come like the week before I came up on stage and I couldn't\n\n01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.520\nand I thought it was a different time. So I was just but when I was listening, I heard you and\n\n01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.960\nyou never said it, but I was like, you know, I bet if I went there, I might be able to dungeon\n\n01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.200\nmaster for Dan Harmon. Like that was literally a thought in my head. It was the stupidest and you\n\n01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.800\nknow, you never entertained those thoughts, but then I show up and then he asked and I was like,\n\n01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.320\nOh shit. Yeah. This one hand shut up and we brought him on stage. Like, have you ever been\n\n01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.040\na dungeon master? He's like, Yeah, today. I was I was making character sheets this afternoon.\n\n01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.320\nIt was amazing. It's the kind of connection that white people have with each other.\n\n01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:53.960\nYeah, you don't know what it's like. Star, NT, Chris, Jason, what is your what is your heritage\n\n01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:02.040\nSpencer? What are your ancestors hail from? I'm Viking cleveland. I didn't guard Cleveland.\n\n01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.480\nI'm told I have some Native American in my blood, but I don't I don't qualify for those\n\n01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:16.040\nscholarships. So who cares? Not enough. So you're part Native American part where like\n\n01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:23.960\nGerman, Polish, what are you? German? I don't know. I'm sorry. Is that a thing? Is that a thing\n\n01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:29.000\nthat white people do where they go like I'm part Native American, not enough to qualify for one\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:39.560\nof this? Can we not leave going not just strip all the buffalo and rape the earth to exterminate\n\n01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:45.560\nthem. I was just confined them to and then put casinos where they live and take all that money.\n\n01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:55.640\nAnd then not enough to go on fucking scholars. I'm just trying to pay for laughing, but like\n\n01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:04.760\nit's it's so amazing. We are an amazing race. BJ, BJ everybody, BJ. All right, so Spencer,\n\n01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.840\nlet's examine those upstairs. What do we got up there? Can we walk up there? Well, hold up you guys.\n\n01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.320\nStanding at the foot of the staircase ascending upwards into darkness, you decide to take\n\n01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.720\nquick break to catch your breath. You reflect on all you've been through and everything you've\n\n01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:47.800\novercome. Ding, you gain a level. It feels good, doesn't it? God damn it.\n\n01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:52.920\nBut now, Spencer, what does that mean? It means you are incrementally stronger\n\n01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.760\nwith a sense of empowerment and a slight incremental advantage. You decide to head upstairs.\n\n01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:07.720\nWait, a sense of entitlement or empowerment? Empowerment and entitlement. I increased my\n\n01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:14.680\nsense of entitlement. I should kill so many more dragons than I do. I'm level two. These stairs\n\n01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:25.400\ndon't mean nothing. All right, so I walk up the stairs. You head up the stairs. Do you guys\n\n01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:35.880\nfollow her? Wait for me. Oh, Morris Goldbright. I follow. You head up the stairs for what seems\n\n01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:43.160\nto be five minutes. Are there a lot of stairs? Are we just taking our time? You don't even know.\n\n01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:52.920\nYou can't even tell. Is it dark? The stairway is dark. Way to go, Morris. Hey. The steps might\n\n01:16:52.920 --> 01:17:00.600\nbe large or something. You approach the second floor. The floor of this room is black flagstone,\n\n01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:06.200\nclean and shining from the light of several iron candlesticks about four feet high. A large altar\n\n01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.920\nform of bones and silver stands in the middle of the room with a pile of corpses changed to it.\n\n01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.120\nUnderneath the corpses, you can see the struggles of an arm and a leg and the terrified shrieks\n\n01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.480\nof a human female. Someone's trapped in there. Underneath, there's trapped underneath what?\n\n01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:28.360\nA pile of corpses on a silver and bone altar. That's how you guys found me, remember? Yeah,\n\n01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:36.520\nyou're under some corpses. Yeah, as you had hidden there. Yeah, right. This is involuntarily under\n\n01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:43.240\nsome corpses. Can we speak to her? Can you call out for her? I call out to the woman under the\n\n01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:59.080\nthing. What do you say? I say, uh, Denzel, what gives? Under a bunch of dead bodies. How? I run\n\n01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:05.320\nover to her aid and remove the dead bodies from her. You remove, the dead body pile is quite heavy.\n\n01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:11.560\nYou might be able to shift it over, but it may be easier to tug her out. I tug her out. You tug\n\n01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:21.960\nher out. If you know what I mean. She enjoys your tugging. Successfully extricating the damsel\n\n01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:27.160\nfrom the pile of corpses. She retches on the floor before straightening herself out and thanking you\n\n01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:40.440\nproperly. Thanks. Fine, sir. I just, I just vomited. I'm not too eloquent. Uh, come on, Sharpie.\n\n01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:51.000\nYou're our leader. What do you got? What's the haps? I was captured by a dark warlord. He sought\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:58.360\nto sacrifice me to his dark gods. How'd you end up under those bodies? Well, I was knocked out,\n\n01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.880\nand the next thing I knew, I was under bodies. It smelled dark and terrible. It smelled dark.\n\n01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:10.600\nIt smelled like darkness. What's your name? Karen Broadleaf of the Butts Plains.\n\n01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.040\nSharpie realizes that these are the very planes that his father owns.\n\n01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:25.240\nOh my god. What? Are you a, are you a, are you a, are you a surf from, from, from my family's\n\n01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:33.560\ndomain? Not a surf, am I, but a great warrior in the Buttsalot tribe. I am of the Buttsalot tribe.\n\n01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:46.440\nAre you the lost one? Yes. That is crazy. You are, you are foretold of in prophecy,\n\n01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.520\nthe one who is tossed out by his father shall come to reclaim his father's throne.\n\n01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.360\nIf I had known that, I wouldn't have left, but then that would be ironic.\n\n01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:04.440\nSo what brings the four of you here? Fortune and glory. No offense to Jason. Uh, that's an\n\n01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:13.160\nIndiana Jones reference. Okay, never mind. Wait, was that a short round reference? Yeah, yeah,\n\n01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:18.680\nyeah. Forget it. It's a, you have to do Rubik's cube of racism. I was trying to keep the racial\n\n01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:27.800\ntheme going. What was your name again? Karen Broadleaf. Karen? Hello, Karen. Hi. How do your\n\n01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:38.840\nparents feel about black people? Are you speaking of the drow? They hate me and call that.\n\n01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:47.400\nOkay, can I look around the room? You look around the room and you see a dark figure who's been\n\n01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:53.720\neyeing you this whole time waiting for a chance to strike. Is this Admiral Darkstar? You don't know.\n\n01:20:53.720 --> 01:21:01.400\nI call out, I call out to him. Are you Admiral Darkstar? There he stands holding a black long\n\n01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:09.080\nsword and wearing full black plate mail. In his fist he has clutched a metal stone. It, it, uh,\n\n01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:13.720\nit appears to be like your fragment of power that you found at the trove, but this is dark and\n\n01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:23.400\nemanating vicious pulses of dark energy. Dark. You fools have played right into my hands!\n\n01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:37.880\nHe unleashes a wave of energy. You feel numb. No! Now you're taking will saves according\n\n01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:44.760\nto the rules to see if you actually are affected by his dark magics. Fuck. Sharpie and\n\n01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:54.520\nquark manage to shake it off, but Morris is stricken and paralyzed. Help me, help me, help me. I knew\n\n01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:59.960\nthat your star medal had revealed itself, but I didn't think you'd simply deliver it to me.\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:10.600\nDeliver it? Telekinesis! You feel a tug at your pocket and you feel the fragment of power leave.\n\n01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:18.520\nIt is flying towards him. I, well, do I, I can't, can I attempt to hang on to it? You attempt to\n\n01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:26.680\ngrasp it from the magical clutches of Admiral Darkstar. But are you fast enough? You were fast\n\n01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:41.080\nenough. Clutching the stone out of midair, you seem to hulk Darkstar's spell. Oh, Admiral, you're\n\n01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:49.800\nright about one thing. A delivery's been made. You just forgot to write down the address.\n\n01:22:49.800 --> 01:23:03.480\nRea Frost! As he is charging up with anger and energy, you cast a Rea Frost directly into his\n\n01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:12.760\nface. The Rea Flock Frost whizzes past his head and freezes a wall behind him. Berserker Rage!\n\n01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:22.520\nYou fly into a berserker rage. Would you like to attack now? Yeah, I'm not gonna like wallpaper\n\n01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:33.720\nthe room. Raging like a maniac. You wallpaper the room. I, I, I struggle to stand up.\n\n01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:43.480\nYou pull yourself to the feet. Did someone get the number of that truck that hit me?\n\n01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:51.160\nI have the power to heal light wounds if I'm not mistaken, right? Does, does he need that? Does,\n\n01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:56.520\ndoes Morris need that? He, he does not. Okay, well, fuck it. You, you are raging. I want,\n\n01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.680\nI want to attack him in a berserker rage. Pulling your flaming sword from its sheath,\n\n01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:09.560\nyou activate its powers. It is reeded in flames. You charge at the enemy, Admiral Darkstar. He\n\n01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:17.640\nblasts a mighty dark beam of energy at you. It flies past you and blows a hole in the one,\n\n01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:25.480\nbut the wall behind you. Wait, how's the wallpaper? I, I, I repair the wallpaper.\n\n01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:32.360\nRemember, you quickly repair the wallpaper. I, I attack him with my mace, rushing towards\n\n01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:37.160\nAdmiral Darkstar. My heavy mace. You fling your heavy mace into his chest.\n\n01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:49.160\nYou strike him squarely in the chest. He steps back in pain. Suck it. Suck it. He takes eight\n\n01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:55.400\ndamage. Ooh. Is that good? How many does he need? I don't know. You don't know. I will find out.\n\n01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:03.800\nReduce person. Before you cast reduce person. He strikes his sword towards Morris Goldbright.\n\n01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:14.040\nUh-oh. Oh, fuck. My sword will cut you in two. It, it does not. It, it hits painful, painfully,\n\n01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:22.520\nbut not deadly on your armor. You are fine. Reduce person. Reduce person. He is entitled to\n\n01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:30.920\na fortitude save, I believe. What? What? He fails his, his save. He shrinks from six foot two to a\n\n01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:37.320\ngood three foot eight. Nice. Can I do, can I do my berserker rage with my sword right now? You're\n\n01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.000\nalready in your berserker rage. I attack. Swing your sword at the shorter target. Let's see if\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:51.800\nyou can adjust to his new height. Your sword rings true against the foe's arm. He drops his\n\n01:25:51.800 --> 01:26:04.600\nfist-sized crystal in anguish. No! I don't know who made this guy an admiral. He takes 11 damage.\n\n01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:14.840\nOh, I'm sorry. And five fire damage. Yeah. I don't know that means, but it sounds pretty fucking\n\n01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:21.640\ncool. I pick up his crystal. You pick up the crystal. You feel the dark taint surging through you.\n\n01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:32.360\nNegative energy. Taint. Yeah. Taint is a word. Look it up. We might have a new title for the\n\n01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:41.800\nepisode. Feel the dark taint. Admiral Doxt, the lord of all that is taint. You feel the power of\n\n01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:47.560\nmany demons surging through you, threatening to throw you off your alignment. Only by focusing on\n\n01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:53.880\nthe power of your gods can you maintain your sanity. I focus on the power of my gods.\n\n01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:07.400\nStay neutral. It's the spot that's not right between the good and the evil right on the spot.\n\n01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:16.680\nIt's taint good. What are you talking about? He emanates a dark wave of energy. You feel yourself\n\n01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:26.840\nknocked back five feet. Oh, shit. Quark, you take a nasty blast of energy to the face.\n\n01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.120\nI was just wallpapering over here. And thus we're not a prepared for the assault.\n\n01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.240\nSix dark damage. That's not a type of damage. It's damage.\n\n01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:48.280\nBurning hands and word. Holding your hands together and summoning the power of fire.\n\n01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:53.000\nA thin stream of flames jets out between your hands in a cone shaped pattern.\n\n01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.480\nHis armor heats up and becomes bright red.\n\n01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:12.920\nHe takes three fire damage. Level one spells you guys. I hit him again with my heavy mace.\n\n01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:19.800\nYou hold the powers of darkness at bay long enough to summon the strength to swing your mace.\n\n01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:26.680\nYou get a critical hit. You smash him right in the face.\n\n01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:35.160\nSuck my taint. He takes two damage. Is it his turn or our turn?\n\n01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:41.960\nHe knows. I think it's your turn now. My turn? Yeah. I'm just reading here a post-it note you\n\n01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:48.200\ngave me. I have high charisma and I'm actually good at convincing people or scaring people.\n\n01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:53.880\nI convince him to stop being an asshole. Okay. Phrase your arguments.\n\n01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:01.320\nYou Admiral Darkstar. Your reign of terror has gone on. Eons too long.\n\n01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:10.520\nAnd I think it would be best that you lay down your admiralty and join us in the quest for\n\n01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:18.040\na fortune and glory and so forth. A compelling argument.\n\n01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:29.080\nYou rolled a two. Dazed from the mace strike to the face. Admiral Darkstar fails to hear\n\n01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:35.320\nyour voice over the sound of blood rushing to his head. I wasn't proud of it. I'm sorry, man.\n\n01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.760\nYou just roll low sometimes. It's sad. I want to help you out and do cool stuff like that.\n\n01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:49.720\nThat's cool, man. The dice don't lie, man. You fools! Telekinesis!\n\n01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:58.280\nHe summons the fist-size crystal away from Morris. Do you attempt to grab it out of his hand? Hell,\n\n01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:06.440\nyes. You fail to grab it out of his hand. No! It flies back into his grasp. Son of a bitch.\n\n01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:11.960\nHe grabs it and starts floating in the air. You hear a rumbling as if the ziggurat is beginning\n\n01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:18.600\nto crumble. Dark lightning bolts shoot out of his body and fingers. Does my mysterious\n\n01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:24.200\nemerald dagger do anything? It might. I produce my emerald dagger and attack.\n\n01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:29.800\nJust attack with a dagger? You tell me, Jack. Pulling the emerald dagger from your sack.\n\n01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:40.760\nYou charge head toward you. You attack! The emerald dagger groans with green energy from\n\n01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:52.600\nthe forest soul. You strike. You miss. A glimmering arc of green energy trails the blade as you slice\n\n01:30:52.600 --> 01:31:02.440\ncleanly above his head. This is not my day. Summon monster! I used to have a list of...\n\n01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:09.800\nYou can summon like a celestial porpoise. Let's see, a celestial monkey dog.\n\n01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.320\nI can create water. You're fucking porpoise in here.\n\n01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:19.080\nA giant spider or scorpion? Perhaps a centipede?\n\n01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:26.440\nCelestial porpoise, baby. I would go with the scorpion. A scorpion springs into existence\n\n01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:38.280\nbefore you. Akira! The scorpion waits for you to tell it it's bidding. Sting!\n\n01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:47.400\nScuttling towards Admiral Darkstar, it raises its sting wickedly. A glittering arc flies through\n\n01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:54.520\nthe air as the blade penetrates, does not penetrate. Darkstar's armor.\n\n01:31:55.400 --> 01:32:00.280\nI can command targets with one word. Say a word and they'll do it like...\n\n01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:07.000\nSleep. I tell them to sleep. Sleep? Okay.\n\n01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.480\nLet's get the fuck out of here.\n\n01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:17.400\nIs he asleep? He's sleeping. Grab the stone. Grab the glowing stone.\n\n01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.640\nThe demonic energy swirls through you again. You feel it corrupting you.\n\n01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:27.320\nAdmiral Darkstar lays sleeping. But there's two stones, right?\n\n01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.720\nYeah, give it to me. I've been able to handle this other one.\n\n01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:36.760\nCombine the stones together. Touching the stones together, the golden brilliance of\n\n01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:43.880\nyour stone turns the dark purple of the dark corrupted stone to pure and silver for some\n\n01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:49.000\nreason. Yeah! Nice! You feel the anger of the demon's subside.\n\n01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:54.920\nKaren Broadleaf takes the opportunity to jump on the unconscious Darkstar and starts wailing on her.\n\n01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.560\nI say we don't kill him. Let's just write in lipstick on the wall,\n\n01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:07.240\nwelcome to the wonderful world of AIDS. Just to fuck with him.\n\n01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:10.040\nHe'll spend the rest of his life wondering what that is.\n\n01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:18.360\nThere's magic to cure that stuff. So where are we at?\n\n01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.920\nHe's on the floor. There's a pile of corpses on an altar.\n\n01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.360\nKaren's kicking his ass over there.\n\n01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.480\nShe's beating him up, yeah.\n\n01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.240\nThe wallpaper's looking pretty good.\n\n01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:37.240\nIt's lovely, right? I say we consult with this episode's exclusive chorus\n\n01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:46.040\nof multiracial ghosts to determine the fate of Admiral Darkstar who lays powerless before us.\n\n01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:52.840\nI cast Summon Multiracial Ghost Chorus. The ancestral spirits of the forest fly through\n\n01:33:52.840 --> 01:34:02.120\nthe ziggurat. Their swirling spiritual forms coalesce. Come, tall black drug user, English teacher\n\n01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:11.320\nof Peru. His name is Chris. Come, Asian guy. Jason. Jason. Come, Puerto Rican possibly lady.\n\n01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.400\nPiper. Come, black girl, a star with a star in the hair.\n\n01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:28.280\nEnti. I cast Enti. And I summon Adam Goldberg. From the realm of Aspergia.\n\n01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.800\nYour powers combined.\n\n01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:43.800\nTheir fists unite. All right. From left to right, say what your spirits command.\n\n01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:59.240\nMercy. Um, I think he could kick him. I forgive him for his hate crimes.\n\n01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:11.640\nI just, what can I do? You're a spirit. You can haunt things. You can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.880\nOkay, so can I like just send him into space or something? No, that's not a ghost power.\n\n01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:23.480\nUm, I mean, that's NASA. He's a bad guy. Should we give him mercy or kill him?\n\n01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.800\nLet's just kill him. Let's like burn him or something.\n\n01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:39.400\nI cut him with a switch blade. The swiftest. Turn him into Chevy Chase.\n\n01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:49.400\nAll right. Well, it seems like it's kind of even Steven. Thank you, oh, multi-ethnic ghosts for\n\n01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:58.840\nyour diverse wisdom. You've heard the voices of the spirits. I think that the way to, to\n\n01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:05.480\ncollate all of that guidance is to strip him of his dark armor, right? And, and, and bend him over\n\n01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:11.800\nlike a, like a, like a, like a, just a rail or something and put a sign on his back that says,\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.560\nuh, uh, uh, free, free ass.\n\n01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:25.160\nSo he'll be sodomized for all eternity? No, no, I don't know. I was just, I was just, uh,\n\n01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.520\nbeing 13 years old. I don't know. We should definitely make, he should definitely be naked.\n\n01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.080\nIs there, is there a way to turn him into good? Is there a way to redeem him in some way though\n\n01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.040\nthat we can bring out the, the good in him? You are not aware. Like Captain EO. Is there anything?\n\n01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:45.320\nIs there anything else in this room with us? The room is bare other than the, the candlesticks,\n\n01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:52.040\nthe altar, and the guys. What happened to Karen? Is she gone? She's still beating him up. He might be\n\n01:36:52.040 --> 01:37:01.880\ndead. Does she, I, as I understand it in the realm of butts, uh, uh, the, the, the, the lower\n\n01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:08.520\ndowns in that realm, uh, are, are often, uh, uh, uh, tutelaged in the art of tattooing.\n\n01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:15.640\nThe butts lower downs are, that's true. Are you going to go dragon tattoo on this guy?\n\n01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:22.040\nYeah. Let us, let us put a dragon tattoo on him that says, uh, dickhead. Just put it on his\n\n01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:27.400\nforehead. Right on the forehead. How will you divest his armor? Uh, uh, just, uh, uh, seductively.\n\n01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:35.080\nWith a lawn? I would, I would. A plumb. What do you mean? How do we, uh, boots first? What,\n\n01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:44.120\nwhat do you, you tug on his boot? It seems stuck. Do we need to get the armor off? Well,\n\n01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:49.160\nyou were the ones that were talking about it. I mean, I didn't say do that. Well, let's just do\n\n01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:55.240\nthe forehead. Just do the forehead. Just write dick on the forehead of the, of the, of the helmet.\n\n01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:02.840\nOh, he can't, we can't even get his helmet off. Do you haven't tried yet? I removed the helmet.\n\n01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:10.680\nPulling the helmet loose, you hear a almighty hiss as the helmet slides off a sludgy pool of\n\n01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:15.400\nblack ooze and smoke emits from the, the, the helmet hole.\n\n01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:24.520\nSwirling and coalescing into a bipedal, piece deal form about seven feet tall.\n\n01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:31.640\nIt hisses foul demonic curses at you. You're more powerful than I'd expected. No matter.\n\n01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:38.040\nThe dark stars dawn will come and all will fall victim to its light. Plane our gate.\n\n01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:46.680\nA portal opens up to a demonic plane. You see rows of what look like black ships that he's an admiral\n\n01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:55.240\nof. He disappears into the gate and it winks out of existence. We had our chance. We had our chance\n\n01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:01.880\nto kill him. We didn't take it. Only as dark armor remains. Maurice, maybe I wouldn't mind wearing this.\n\n01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:10.520\nI could probably take it in a little bit. Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll put on the armor.\n\n01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.080\nYou take the armor. Karen thanks you again. Thank you again.\n\n01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:24.200\nThank you, Karen. And thank all of us. Everyone. I think, I think we've learned a lot today.\n\n01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:31.080\nWhat, what did we learn, Sharpie? Like what? Well, we've learned to, to stay good and be less\n\n01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:39.640\nevil. Because inevitably it seems to not pay off. I learned that if you get a multi ethnic\n\n01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:46.920\nghost chorus, not a lot gets accomplished. It was gimmick driven. You know, you, you,\n\n01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.400\nyou made that promise and I was just trying to pay it off.\n\n01:39:53.640 --> 01:40:00.040\nLet me give you the treasure of our people says Karen. Oh, she gives you a masterwork loot.\n\n01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:05.320\n50 merciful arrows inside of the magic quiver. Are these sexual positions? I wish.\n\n01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:13.320\nThat's just true. I give her a masterful loot right back. I'd put it into her magic quiver.\n\n01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.920\nI cast Swedish reach around.\n\n01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:25.720\nA wand of magic missile and a hat of disguises. Whoa. That's a magic hat, fellas.\n\n01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:31.320\nAll right. Well, you don't beat a magic hat. Thank you, Spencer.\n\n01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:45.880\nWow. My goodness. The clock says 10 o'clock. Yeah, we really, I don't lie. I wish it did.\n\n01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:49.640\nI'm really sorry, everybody. Every, you keep coming and I keep punishing you.\n\n01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:53.240\nI said I had nothing and then I had two hours of everything.\n\n01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.120\nYeah. All right.

That's not going to work\n\n01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:39.000\neither. Is it? All right. We're running out of ways to close these shows.\n\n01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.040\nWe can't just keep bringing Adam Goldberg up. I mean, that's the\n\n01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:51.240\nOh, yeah. Well, the problem is we can, but I don't think he's like Beetlejuice.\n\n01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:58.840\nExcept you say his name once. Adam, come on the stage. I want to try something out again.\n\n01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:02.360\nLet's see what it's like when Adam has nothing. Yeah.
