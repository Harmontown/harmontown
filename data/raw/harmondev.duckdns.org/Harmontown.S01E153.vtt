don't want to be an asshole,\n\n01:04.960 --> 01:08.120\nbut why not put the mic there?\n\n01:08.120 --> 01:08.960\nOh!\n\n01:14.960 --> 01:17.580\nIt's only for my edification.\n\n01:17.580 --> 01:20.320\nYeah, this is for the cameras as we continue\n\n01:20.320 --> 01:27.160\nto ruin the audio podcast with our horrible cameras\n\n01:27.160 --> 01:31.920\nand our need, you know, video killed the radio star.\n\n01:31.920 --> 01:34.000\nVideo podcasting is killing, but you\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:37.280\nused to just tune in for the soothing sound of my lullaby\n\n01:37.280 --> 01:39.440\nvoice.\n\n01:39.440 --> 01:41.480\nJust focus on the resonating chamber\n\n01:41.480 --> 01:43.360\nof my velociraptor skull.\n\n01:43.360 --> 01:48.440\nUh, uh, uh, anyways.\n\n01:48.440 --> 01:51.640\nSo, God, the earth is changing underneath our feet, Jeff.\n\n01:51.640 --> 01:56.280\nThe imagine telling your 25-year-old self, say,\n\n01:56.280 --> 01:57.720\nhey, I'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:57.720 --> 01:59.800\nIt's the year 2015.\n\n01:59.800 --> 02:02.280\nI'm sending you a message from the future.\n\n02:02.280 --> 02:04.880\nThe Supreme Court has just determined\n\n02:04.880 --> 02:08.160\nthat everyone in the whole country, marriage is just marriage.\n\n02:08.160 --> 02:08.960\nIt's all it is.\n\n02:08.960 --> 02:09.460\nJust.\n\n02:09.460 --> 02:21.400\nAnd Canada did it 10 years before, but that's not the point.\n\n02:21.400 --> 02:23.040\nOh, yeah, well, no, we're America.\n\n02:23.040 --> 02:27.040\nWe're first in war, 21st in marriage, right?\n\n02:27.040 --> 02:30.640\nBut it's just beneath Ireland.\n\n02:30.640 --> 02:33.920\nBut also, oh, yeah, also, so you wouldn't even\n\n02:33.920 --> 02:36.440\nknow what a podcast was then, but you're sending a message\n\n02:36.440 --> 02:38.080\nsaying, the president of the United States\n\n02:38.080 --> 02:42.200\nis going to be a guest at Marc Maron's podcast.\n\n02:42.200 --> 02:43.560\nHe's going to say the n-word.\n\n02:46.800 --> 02:50.120\nAnd he's going to sing Amazing Grace at a funeral.\n\n02:50.120 --> 02:51.160\nThat was fucking, that was rad.\n\n02:51.160 --> 02:52.160\nThat was great.\n\n02:52.160 --> 02:53.400\nI just heard about that.\n\n02:53.400 --> 02:55.400\nHe can sing, too?\n\n02:55.400 --> 02:57.960\nOh, I mean, pretty good for a president,\n\n02:57.960 --> 02:59.720\nbut I feel like with some classes,\n\n02:59.720 --> 03:00.920\nhe could really pull it out.\n\n03:03.840 --> 03:06.280\nI haven't heard.\n\n03:06.280 --> 03:07.560\nI wouldn't say it's perfect, but he\n\n03:07.560 --> 03:09.840\nwas doing an acapella, and he was doing it in a key.\n\n03:09.840 --> 03:13.680\nWhat I love is the organist, I think, on the choir finds him\n\n03:13.680 --> 03:17.720\nand misses just by like a half note, and Obama finds it.\n\n03:17.720 --> 03:22.280\nLike, the organist puts it in a key,\n\n03:22.280 --> 03:24.360\nand then they all start singing along.\n\n03:24.360 --> 03:26.520\nBut there was that moment when he started singing,\n\n03:26.520 --> 03:28.920\nand everyone's like, stand up, the fucking president\n\n03:28.920 --> 03:31.080\nis singing right now.\n\n03:31.080 --> 03:34.920\nWe are going to miss this guy so much.\n\n03:34.920 --> 03:41.240\nThe lame duck Obama is the fucking FDR of the 21st century.\n\n03:41.240 --> 03:43.680\nHe's amazing.\n\n03:43.680 --> 03:46.280\nHe's just like, by the way, here's how I really feel.\n\n03:46.280 --> 03:49.320\nAnd we're like, oh, yeah, that's why I voted for you\n\n03:49.320 --> 03:50.440\na long time ago.\n\n03:50.440 --> 03:53.280\nHe had a very good week, and not just he, but lots of people.\n\n03:53.280 --> 03:56.240\nAnd he didn't spike a lot of footballs\n\n03:56.240 --> 03:58.640\nand do a lot of end zone dancing.\n\n03:58.640 --> 03:59.880\nHe just kept it.\n\n03:59.880 --> 04:00.760\nHe's very classy.\n\n04:00.760 --> 04:01.800\nHe's very charming, I think.\n\n04:01.800 --> 04:02.280\nThat's why.\n\n04:02.280 --> 04:03.760\nI mean, but think about this guy.\n\n04:03.760 --> 04:08.040\nSo OK, so this N-word thing, have we even\n\n04:08.040 --> 04:17.160\nclear on this, do we understand that this notion of he\n\n04:17.160 --> 04:22.280\nof all people, these thoughts that start with he of all people,\n\n04:22.280 --> 04:26.760\nthat that's the same thing as, do we\n\n04:26.760 --> 04:29.880\nunderstand that politically and strategically Obama is less\n\n04:29.880 --> 04:33.640\nallowed to talk about race than any pre-existing president,\n\n04:33.640 --> 04:35.840\nthat he has been targeted by more racism,\n\n04:35.840 --> 04:38.760\nthat his Twitter account can't say, hey,\n\n04:38.760 --> 04:40.120\nsign up for health care without.\n\n04:40.120 --> 04:42.520\nI always click on it because I'm always fascinated.\n\n04:42.520 --> 04:43.720\nIt's always the N-word.\n\n04:43.720 --> 04:47.080\nIt's always somewhere in there, literally just the N-word.\n\n04:47.080 --> 04:50.160\nJust like someone just wants to remind him.\n\n04:50.160 --> 04:53.800\nJust wants to tell him.\n\n04:53.800 --> 05:00.480\nAnd people that want him to speak out and make everything\n\n05:00.480 --> 05:04.880\nright at every time in this changing age when everything\n\n05:04.880 --> 05:07.200\nwe're finding out about racially hot things\n\n05:07.200 --> 05:10.040\nlike the president of the United States is not\n\n05:10.040 --> 05:14.560\nsupposed to necessarily come down to every city\n\n05:14.560 --> 05:17.720\nand make a big speech and raise a big stink about everything\n\n05:17.720 --> 05:23.000\nthat's going wrong, let alone the first black president\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.600\nof the United States.\n\n05:24.600 --> 05:27.760\nEvery time that guy speaks up about anything racial,\n\n05:27.760 --> 05:29.880\npeople just fucking jump.\n\n05:29.880 --> 05:32.200\nAnd so he's been strategic, and he's been practical,\n\n05:32.200 --> 05:33.760\nand now he doesn't have to be.\n\n05:33.760 --> 05:40.160\nAnd he goes into Marc Maron's garage and fucking lays it down.\n\n05:40.160 --> 05:43.520\nAnd rounding out the triumvirate of, holy shit,\n\n05:43.520 --> 05:45.120\nthe dream is coming true.\n\n05:45.120 --> 05:50.160\nThe LAPD is now killing middle-aged white men.\n\n05:50.160 --> 05:54.240\nNo, that's also horrible.\n\n05:54.240 --> 05:58.400\nI hope his family isn't a fan.\n\n05:58.400 --> 06:00.800\nIs there something in the news today that I don't know about?\n\n06:00.800 --> 06:03.200\nNo, not in the way we talked about last week.\n\n06:03.200 --> 06:06.840\nIt's old news, but it's also like, what the fuck is going on?\n\n06:06.840 --> 06:09.480\nThey took these cops, the shot that got.\n\n06:09.480 --> 06:11.240\nI'm going to lay my cards on the table.\n\n06:11.240 --> 06:13.240\nLet's just go to the racist place.\n\n06:13.240 --> 06:15.760\nLike, let me be a white racist.\n\n06:15.760 --> 06:18.640\nLet me, please, let me.\n\n06:18.640 --> 06:20.800\nSo that we don't have to worry about that anymore.\n\n06:20.800 --> 06:22.680\nLike, is Dan being racist?\n\n06:22.680 --> 06:23.800\nIs he being insensitive?\n\n06:23.800 --> 06:26.440\nLet me be insensitive and racist so that we can cut\n\n06:26.440 --> 06:28.840\nstraight through to what's really disturbing\n\n06:28.840 --> 06:33.600\nabout a white 48-year-old guy holding a towel,\n\n06:33.600 --> 06:36.920\ngetting gunned down by cops who, according to their training,\n\n06:36.920 --> 06:40.680\nare supposed to shoot you if you hold a towel up.\n\n06:40.680 --> 06:42.440\nWhy aren't towels illegal?\n\n06:47.440 --> 06:51.080\nWhy aren't cops illegal?\n\n06:51.080 --> 06:54.640\nThis is getting extreme.\n\n06:54.640 --> 06:59.080\nAnd if it takes a white guy to make white people go, oh, OK,\n\n06:59.080 --> 07:06.720\ndeal breaker, it's not because we think that the black people\n\n07:06.720 --> 07:07.560\ndeserve it.\n\n07:07.560 --> 07:11.080\nIt's because secretly white liberals are going,\n\n07:11.080 --> 07:13.600\nI think that the racist part of white liberals\n\n07:13.600 --> 07:19.240\nis the part of us that goes vigilante about race relations.\n\n07:19.240 --> 07:21.800\nThat's what white people do.\n\n07:21.800 --> 07:25.120\nWe're like, I'm racist.\n\n07:25.120 --> 07:28.400\nWe're born racist, as you know.\n\n07:28.400 --> 07:30.320\nThat's the one racist thing I'll accept.\n\n07:30.320 --> 07:33.400\nWhite people are born racist.\n\n07:33.400 --> 07:36.280\nThe racist part of us, like, when\n\n07:36.280 --> 07:39.200\nwe hear about these cop brutality stuff,\n\n07:39.200 --> 07:41.680\nyou know that part of us is going like, yeah,\n\n07:41.680 --> 07:43.000\nbut that's got to be a hard job.\n\n07:46.480 --> 07:50.320\nDressed like Hitler youth, like walking around\n\n07:50.320 --> 07:53.880\na bunch of black people, that's got to be tough.\n\n07:53.880 --> 07:55.520\nYou know that we think that.\n\n07:55.520 --> 07:56.840\nYou know that we think that.\n\n07:56.840 --> 08:04.160\nAnd then we go, naughty white guy, naughty white cop, naughty.\n\n08:04.160 --> 08:05.400\nJust because it's hard.\n\n08:05.400 --> 08:07.640\nYou have to control yourself.\n\n08:07.640 --> 08:13.080\nAnd then the fucking 48-year-old white jogger\n\n08:13.080 --> 08:15.160\nwith the towel gets shot, and you're like, wait a minute.\n\n08:15.160 --> 08:16.560\nHow is my brain functioning?\n\n08:16.560 --> 08:21.280\nThis is all, like, what the fuck?\n\n08:21.280 --> 08:22.120\nThis is insane.\n\n08:22.120 --> 08:24.760\nThe system is, I don't know what to do about it,\n\n08:24.760 --> 08:30.880\nbut if you can't hold a towel and you can't be a white guy.\n\n08:30.880 --> 08:33.520\nAll sympathies.\n\n08:33.520 --> 08:35.880\nI'm not going to let you push my buttons, and I'm not.\n\n08:35.880 --> 08:37.440\nI know that I'm making sense.\n\n08:37.440 --> 08:40.000\nThat's what you're pointing with this, though, right?\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.480\nI guess you can skim that fucking hot button shit\n\n08:42.480 --> 08:46.120\noff the top of what I'm saying, but what I'm really trying to do,\n\n08:46.120 --> 08:50.840\nI think you could take a deep ladle full of that.\n\n08:50.840 --> 08:52.560\nI said at the top of this conversation, I said,\n\n08:52.560 --> 08:53.840\nlet's be racist.\n\n08:53.840 --> 08:55.080\nLet's go to the racist list.\n\n08:55.080 --> 08:56.400\nAnd you said, let me be racist.\n\n08:56.400 --> 08:58.440\nLet's all be racist.\n\n08:58.440 --> 09:01.040\nA fine distinction.\n\n09:01.040 --> 09:03.480\nLet me be racist.\n\n09:03.480 --> 09:04.720\nLet me be racist.\n\n09:04.720 --> 09:05.800\nYes, I said that.\n\n09:05.800 --> 09:07.120\nLet me be racist.\n\n09:07.120 --> 09:10.960\nAnd say, like, why is that the deal breaker,\n\n09:10.960 --> 09:13.160\nand why the fuck, more importantly,\n\n09:13.160 --> 09:16.440\nif, because if we were giving a pass,\n\n09:16.440 --> 09:22.200\nwere we giving a pass to cops in areas where white people felt\n\n09:22.200 --> 09:27.760\nlike maybe, maybe we felt like it was a demilitarized zone,\n\n09:27.760 --> 09:31.240\nor we felt like, oh, you know, I'm liberal politically,\n\n09:31.240 --> 09:33.960\nbut hey, I can't imagine doing that job.\n\n09:33.960 --> 09:35.600\nThat must be real hard.\n\n09:35.600 --> 09:39.000\nBy the way, sanitation workers get killed more often than cops.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:43.040\nLike, it's, I don't deny, they just did a study.\n\n09:43.040 --> 09:44.200\nLike, how many, how many fucking,\n\n09:44.200 --> 09:45.680\nhow dangerous is this fucking job?\n\n09:45.680 --> 09:46.800\nWhat is sanitation?\n\n09:46.800 --> 09:49.720\nPeople murder them, or they get, they, if they fall into it.\n\n09:49.720 --> 09:51.280\nLet's not worry about sanitation workers.\n\n09:51.280 --> 09:52.680\nThe point is that.\n\n09:52.680 --> 09:54.840\nWait, no, wait.\n\n09:54.840 --> 09:57.160\nAre people picking them off with guns from their rooftop,\n\n09:57.160 --> 10:00.920\nor do they get crushed by, like, get out of my garbage.\n\n10:00.920 --> 10:03.600\nIt's being mistaken for raccoons is, like,\n\n10:03.600 --> 10:07.800\nthe highest cause of death in the United States,\n\n10:07.800 --> 10:10.080\nother than experimental aircraft.\n\n10:10.080 --> 10:11.160\nI don't know, I don't know.\n\n10:11.160 --> 10:12.200\nI'm talking out of my ass.\n\n10:12.200 --> 10:14.200\nThat's why I built a cedar wood enclosure\n\n10:14.200 --> 10:16.000\nfrom my trash in front of my head.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:20.880\nAnd now, and now I approve of that.\n\n10:20.880 --> 10:26.360\nNow that I'm seeing the danger causes, that's like,\n\n10:26.360 --> 10:30.680\nthat's Donnie Deepkut is giving you the high clap.\n\n10:30.680 --> 10:35.040\nHe loves, anyways, I, like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n10:35.040 --> 10:37.080\nI'm glad, come on, where was I?\n\n10:37.080 --> 10:37.880\nI was being racist.\n\n10:37.880 --> 10:47.200\nIf, now can we go, like, OK, so if you're a squad car\n\n10:47.200 --> 10:48.920\nand you're stuck in broad daylight traffic\n\n10:48.920 --> 10:51.880\non Las Fuelas Boulevard, where there's six yogurt shops\n\n10:51.880 --> 10:56.440\nwithin a mile radius, and a 48-year-old white jogger\n\n10:56.440 --> 10:59.080\nwith a towel in his hands can also\n\n10:59.080 --> 11:01.320\nprovoke the same response.\n\n11:01.320 --> 11:04.840\nLike, like, is it, I mean, can we definitely, like,\n\n11:04.840 --> 11:05.600\ncall it quits?\n\n11:05.600 --> 11:07.360\nAnd if we use that as the deal breaker,\n\n11:07.360 --> 11:09.520\ncan we just reveal that we've all been racist\n\n11:09.520 --> 11:11.840\nand that maybe that's why this whole fucking problem\n\n11:11.840 --> 11:13.520\nexists in the first place?\n\n11:13.520 --> 11:14.800\nThat's my only point.\n\n11:14.800 --> 11:18.160\nBecause I, and I'm willing to lay it back.\n\n11:18.160 --> 11:20.720\nAre you saying that the deal for you wasn't broken yet?\n\n11:20.720 --> 11:22.480\nThat you still kind of consider, oh,\n\n11:22.480 --> 11:24.680\nthat's a bad neighborhood for the black people?\n\n11:24.680 --> 11:25.560\nI can see that.\n\n11:25.560 --> 11:26.680\nWell.\n\n11:26.680 --> 11:30.440\nA byproduct of that job in that part of town.\n\n11:30.440 --> 11:33.080\nI think the deal was broken a long time ago.\n\n11:33.080 --> 11:34.880\nI think that, as I've always said,\n\n11:34.880 --> 11:36.440\nlike, race is an artificial construct\n\n11:36.440 --> 11:38.680\nand the thing that we're connected is, like,\n\n11:38.680 --> 11:43.480\nit's the idea that people that have phenotypical\n\n11:43.480 --> 11:45.680\ncharacteristics all live on one block.\n\n11:45.680 --> 11:48.440\nThat's where things become, like, what we're identifying\n\n11:48.440 --> 11:52.720\nas race issues are class issues and cultural issues and stuff.\n\n11:52.720 --> 11:56.280\nAnd so I think that within that maelstrom, yes,\n\n11:56.280 --> 11:59.040\nI will say to you, yes, I have always thought\n\n11:59.040 --> 12:02.120\nin the back of my head, always in the back of my head,\n\n12:02.120 --> 12:05.680\nI have always thought, boy, that can't be a good gig.\n\n12:05.680 --> 12:08.640\nBut is it also, does it have to be a race thing?\n\n12:08.640 --> 12:10.040\nOr can it just be a class thing?\n\n12:10.040 --> 12:12.040\nBecause we live in a neighborhood,\n\n12:12.040 --> 12:15.080\nwhere that shooting took place, the rent is very high there.\n\n12:15.080 --> 12:18.160\nIs it possible that for you, because it's so close to where\n\n12:18.160 --> 12:20.080\nyou actually live and you're safe?\n\n12:20.080 --> 12:21.240\nYeah, that's what I'm saying.\n\n12:21.240 --> 12:22.160\nOK, so it's not a race thing.\n\n12:22.160 --> 12:22.760\nIt's a class thing.\n\n12:22.760 --> 12:24.440\nI'm saying there is no such thing as a race thing\n\n12:24.440 --> 12:25.800\nif we were to actually talk about genetics.\n\n12:25.800 --> 12:27.640\nThere's no such thing as a race thing.\n\n12:27.640 --> 12:32.120\nLike, the striation that we call ratio, like, that's not,\n\n12:32.120 --> 12:35.080\nwe know, when I've said 1,000 times on this stage,\n\n12:35.080 --> 12:36.320\nrace is an artificial construct.\n\n12:36.320 --> 12:37.560\nDan, what do you mean by that?\n\n12:37.560 --> 12:40.000\nWhat I mean is that it's a man-made construct.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.880\nLike, the things that we delineate as racial are forced.\n\n12:43.880 --> 12:47.000\nLike, they are, if you lived in a world,\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nif you grew up in a high school where all of the red-headed\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.680\npeople sat at one lunch table, if there\n\n12:52.680 --> 12:55.760\nwere as much attention paid to freckles,\n\n12:55.760 --> 12:59.280\nor the weird continuum of skin shades\n\n12:59.280 --> 13:02.560\nthat exist within what we consider\n\n13:02.560 --> 13:06.000\nAfrican-American skin tones, Middle Eastern skin tones,\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.280\nand white skin tones, like, everybody's skin\n\n13:08.280 --> 13:09.360\nhas a different color to it.\n\n13:09.360 --> 13:12.440\nYes, there's genetic, there's these characteristics\n\n13:12.440 --> 13:15.040\nand things, but compared to the things that actually\n\n13:15.040 --> 13:17.200\nmake a difference, it's an artificial construct.\n\n13:17.200 --> 13:18.280\nIt's man-made.\n\n13:18.280 --> 13:21.440\nSo it's not when we're talking about racial things\n\n13:21.440 --> 13:22.720\nand racial hot buttons, when we're\n\n13:22.720 --> 13:25.440\ntalking about the actual existence of a black community,\n\n13:25.440 --> 13:28.000\nwe don't actually mean a bunch of people\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.080\nwho are united by genetics alone.\n\n13:30.080 --> 13:33.200\nThat gets us into all kinds of trouble,\n\n13:33.200 --> 13:38.960\nbecause that's really, really a huge sleight of hand.\n\n13:38.960 --> 13:40.720\nWe're talking about class, and we're\n\n13:40.720 --> 13:42.800\ntalking about the fact that there's\n\n13:42.800 --> 13:45.560\nbeen these forced impositions.\n\n13:45.560 --> 13:47.760\nWe should have all been fucking each other a long time ago.\n\n13:47.760 --> 13:52.400\nWe should all, and I'm not saying that this is a necessity,\n\n13:52.400 --> 13:56.440\nbut statistically speaking, if there hadn't ever\n\n13:56.440 --> 14:00.360\nany been xenophobia, when anyone landed on the coast of anything,\n\n14:00.360 --> 14:04.080\nif there had never been any imposition of any artificially\n\n14:04.080 --> 14:07.080\nasserted construct, we would all just\n\n14:07.080 --> 14:09.040\nlook like Holly Berry and Tiger Woods by now.\n\n14:09.040 --> 14:13.600\nWe would, and Benjamin Bratt and whatever.\n\n14:13.600 --> 14:15.080\nAnd none of us would give a fuck.\n\n14:15.080 --> 14:17.720\nAnd it's OK that that world hasn't happened yet.\n\n14:17.720 --> 14:19.480\nWe can still exist in that world, because some people\n\n14:19.480 --> 14:21.200\nhave long necks, and some people have big noses,\n\n14:21.200 --> 14:22.920\nand some people have weird toes, and some people\n\n14:22.920 --> 14:25.880\nhave shovel teeth, and some people have like,\n\n14:25.880 --> 14:29.200\nand then some people are so desperate for identity\n\n14:29.200 --> 14:31.480\nthat they fucking carve up their own face.\n\n14:31.480 --> 14:33.720\nSo Jesus Christ, we don't have to be in such a hurry\n\n14:33.720 --> 14:36.600\nto all fuck each other, but some people have tattoos,\n\n14:36.600 --> 14:37.800\nand some people are in wheelchairs,\n\n14:37.800 --> 14:39.600\nand some people eat wood.\n\n14:39.600 --> 14:42.520\nTermites, termites.\n\n14:42.520 --> 14:43.400\nThose are termites.\n\n14:43.400 --> 14:47.240\nWe don't have to include them.\n\n14:47.240 --> 14:49.880\nRace is an artificial construct, is my point.\n\n14:52.880 --> 14:53.520\nOh, thanks, guys.\n\n14:53.520 --> 14:54.120\nThat's been our show.\n\n14:54.120 --> 14:54.600\nGood night.\n\n14:54.600 --> 14:56.520\nGood night, everybody.\n\n14:56.520 --> 14:58.560\nTry safely.\n\n14:58.560 --> 15:00.880\nWould you fuck a termite, then, if you could?\n\n15:00.880 --> 15:04.040\nWhat do you think a human termite may be?\n\n15:04.040 --> 15:08.800\nWhat would be the upside to a human termite crossbreeding?\n\n15:08.800 --> 15:11.040\nWell, definitely the ability to digest wood.\n\n15:14.280 --> 15:15.920\nI imagine all insects are totally\n\n15:15.920 --> 15:18.000\njealous of termites, don't you?\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.560\nThey eat wood.\n\n15:19.560 --> 15:22.800\nLike, imagine flies are like, fuck you.\n\n15:22.800 --> 15:27.200\nLike, they're on top of a turd, and they're like, whoa.\n\n15:27.200 --> 15:29.680\nEnjoy your log cabin, Thoreau.\n\n15:34.160 --> 15:36.120\nThe worst, the termites have got to,\n\n15:36.120 --> 15:38.920\nhow do they even do that?\n\n15:38.920 --> 15:40.800\nIt must be at the expense of something.\n\n15:40.800 --> 15:48.800\nTermites must be terrible golfers, or dumb.\n\n15:48.800 --> 15:50.640\nBy the way, we're recording my comedy album tonight,\n\n15:50.640 --> 15:56.080\nso thank you for laughing at my termite run.\n\n15:56.080 --> 16:01.000\nWhat would the downside be of a human termite hybrid?\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:09.560\nProbably no cardiovascular system, no brain,\n\n16:09.560 --> 16:11.320\njust being a collection of neurons\n\n16:11.320 --> 16:13.920\nthat make a thing go like this.\n\n16:13.920 --> 16:17.840\nSpencer, if you could crossbreed humans\n\n16:17.840 --> 16:21.880\nwith any animal or insect from across the animal kingdom,\n\n16:21.880 --> 16:24.480\nwhat do you think would be the most advantageous?\n\n16:24.480 --> 16:28.640\nOh, definitely an iguana.\n\n16:28.640 --> 16:32.560\nThink about how useful an iguana is.\n\n16:32.560 --> 16:34.680\nNow, think about applying that skill\n\n16:34.680 --> 16:39.440\nset to the mental capacity of a human.\n\n16:39.440 --> 16:49.200\nYou'd get humans that could lie on sticks, or perhaps black rocks.\n\n16:49.200 --> 16:53.360\nLet them talk, let them finish, let them finish, let them finish.\n\n16:53.360 --> 16:57.440\nThey'd even probably be able to eat mealworms.\n\n16:57.440 --> 16:58.440\nI don't know.\n\n16:58.440 --> 17:01.800\nI really love that he left out changing color.\n\n17:01.800 --> 17:03.640\nIguanas, Dan.\n\n17:03.640 --> 17:06.560\nI thought about saying chameleons didn't go there.\n\n17:06.560 --> 17:09.040\nOh, iguanas, I'm sorry.\n\n17:09.040 --> 17:11.400\nHey, look who's race blind.\n\n17:14.240 --> 17:16.680\nFuck you, people.\n\n17:16.680 --> 17:18.520\nI hooked you in by saying I'm racist.\n\n17:21.400 --> 17:24.000\nHow does it feel on the lowest road compared to me,\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:28.160\nwhere even iguanas and chameleons,\n\n17:28.160 --> 17:33.360\nlizards famous for their color, are indistinguishable to me?\n\n17:33.360 --> 17:39.280\nUh, fuck you all.\n\n17:39.280 --> 17:41.800\nThe FBI is waiting at each exit.\n\n17:41.800 --> 17:44.600\nYou're all going on a racism list.\n\n17:44.600 --> 17:46.800\nBecause I'm the decoy.\n\n17:46.800 --> 17:52.800\nI'm the guy, whatever they call him, like in those kitty porn.\n\n17:52.800 --> 17:53.960\nProtochet.\n\n17:53.960 --> 17:56.960\nProtochet?\n\n17:56.960 --> 17:58.640\nAnother callback, another callback.\n\n17:58.640 --> 17:59.840\nIn the movie, what was that?\n\n17:59.840 --> 18:00.640\nThere was a movie.\n\n18:00.640 --> 18:01.960\nWhat was the movie with the?\n\n18:01.960 --> 18:04.160\nGod damn it.\n\n18:04.160 --> 18:06.760\nOh, Honeypot, is that it?\n\n18:06.760 --> 18:10.920\nIt's like, this is a sad thing to get clear.\n\n18:10.920 --> 18:13.920\nThe kid that they used to lure in other kids.\n\n18:13.920 --> 18:16.040\nYou'd ask Deep Cut, Donnie, whatever his name was.\n\n18:16.040 --> 18:18.040\nDeep Cut.\n\n18:18.040 --> 18:22.200\nHoneypot, yeah, OK.\n\n18:22.200 --> 18:25.360\nNone of us feel better about, oh, OK, now I know.\n\n18:25.360 --> 18:28.160\nI got all my pedophile terms down.\n\n18:28.160 --> 18:30.240\nI'm glad I came out here tonight.\n\n18:30.240 --> 18:31.560\nCould have been at the BET Awards.\n\n18:31.560 --> 18:35.400\nBut I'm a pedophile expert.\n\n18:35.400 --> 18:36.840\nOne more thing, a Confederate flag flag.\n\n18:36.840 --> 18:38.720\nI'm going to say one thing about it, and then we're done.\n\n18:38.720 --> 18:42.880\nWe're going to meet some people, we're going to have some fun.\n\n18:42.880 --> 18:45.320\nYes, scrutinize the flag.\n\n18:45.320 --> 18:46.320\nGet it down.\n\n18:46.320 --> 18:46.960\nYou know why?\n\n18:46.960 --> 18:48.480\nIt's a fucking flag.\n\n18:48.480 --> 18:51.280\nHow less racist do you think the United States flag is?\n\n18:51.280 --> 18:51.920\nAll right, that's it.\n\n18:51.920 --> 18:54.240\nThat's all I wanted to say.\n\n18:54.240 --> 18:56.600\nI just fucking get bummed out.\n\n18:56.600 --> 18:57.600\nAre you kidding me?\n\n18:57.600 --> 18:58.480\nLike, oh, really?\n\n18:58.480 --> 19:00.560\nBecause it's the logo for Dukes of Hazard?\n\n19:00.560 --> 19:02.960\nIt's like, it makes such an easy target.\n\n19:02.960 --> 19:05.240\nIt's like, yeah, they lost, and they're like,\n\n19:05.240 --> 19:07.720\nthey should not be flying that over any capital building.\n\n19:07.720 --> 19:11.440\nIt's fucking, it's been like tolerated in fucking sedition.\n\n19:11.440 --> 19:12.760\nAll flags are bummers.\n\n19:12.760 --> 19:14.040\nYeah, they're fucking flags.\n\n19:14.040 --> 19:17.320\nLike, it's like, just like, yeah, fucking let's be.\n\n19:17.320 --> 19:18.760\nAlso, we fold it weird.\n\n19:18.760 --> 19:20.880\nThat's a stupid way to fold anything.\n\n19:20.880 --> 19:22.080\nWe fold it weird.\n\n19:22.080 --> 19:24.080\nWe fold them weird.\n\n19:24.080 --> 19:25.840\nAnd we have like, there's a weird rules about it.\n\n19:25.840 --> 19:27.080\nA fucking triangle?\n\n19:27.080 --> 19:28.480\nThat's a stupid.\n\n19:28.480 --> 19:33.320\nEvery single flag on this entire planet\n\n19:33.320 --> 19:39.320\nis, by its very nature, the whole reason to have a flag\n\n19:39.320 --> 19:44.120\nis to like, fold it in a square or rectangle.\n\n19:44.120 --> 19:44.760\nWe'll get to it.\n\n19:44.760 --> 19:47.600\nBut saying the idea of taking a piece of fabric\n\n19:47.600 --> 19:50.120\nand saying, this is a symbol, and we're waving it,\n\n19:50.120 --> 19:53.520\nthe whole, that's how all dehumanization begins.\n\n19:53.520 --> 19:56.000\nSo yeah, have them, they're fine, they're great.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.120\nScrutinize some of them.\n\n19:57.120 --> 19:58.760\nHey, that one's the Losers flag.\n\n19:58.760 --> 19:59.640\nLet's take it down.\n\n19:59.640 --> 20:02.200\nDidn't they lose a long time ago?\n\n20:02.200 --> 20:04.160\nWe should probably put that in a museum instead\n\n20:04.160 --> 20:06.480\nof over our government building.\n\n20:06.480 --> 20:09.680\nIt's kind of weird that we keep letting them do that.\n\n20:09.680 --> 20:14.880\nIf you put a flag up over a southern city's capital\n\n20:14.880 --> 20:18.240\nbuilding that said, Jeff Davis rules,\n\n20:18.240 --> 20:20.000\npeople would show up at your door.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.320\nWell, first off, they'd be right.\n\n20:21.320 --> 20:27.040\nSecond, my name, Jeff Davis, Jefferson Davis,\n\n20:27.040 --> 20:27.920\nthe president of the Confederacy.\n\n20:27.920 --> 20:28.480\nOh, boy.\n\n20:32.480 --> 20:35.080\nEvery week, somebody sends me a tweet of them being\n\n20:35.080 --> 20:38.280\nin the South in a bumper sticker or a sticker on a lamp post.\n\n20:38.280 --> 20:39.200\nIt says, don't blame me.\n\n20:39.200 --> 20:43.200\nI voted for Jeff Davis across the Confederate Jack.\n\n20:43.200 --> 20:46.080\nLike, there's loads of good old races, Jeff Davis.\n\n20:46.080 --> 20:47.560\nMy name across the Confederate front.\n\n20:47.560 --> 20:52.320\nWe thought you were going to tell the Teen Wolf story again.\n\n20:52.320 --> 20:53.120\nI'm kidding.\n\n20:53.120 --> 20:54.280\nI'm doing it.\n\n20:54.280 --> 20:56.560\nDeep Cut Townie knows what I'm talking about.\n\n20:56.560 --> 20:58.600\nOh, Deep Cut Townie fucking gas-based me.\n\n20:58.600 --> 21:01.400\nI did tell the story about my name profiting me\n\n21:01.400 --> 21:02.440\nin the South, right?\n\n21:02.440 --> 21:03.200\nYes, yes.\n\n21:03.200 --> 21:04.440\nThat's what I thought you were doing.\n\n21:04.440 --> 21:05.440\nThat's why I said, oh, boy, I didn't\n\n21:05.440 --> 21:08.240\nwant you to go on that record truck.\n\n21:08.240 --> 21:11.040\nI'll fucking talk about Teen Wolf, though, man.\n\n21:11.040 --> 21:11.680\nDon't do either.\n\n21:11.680 --> 21:15.360\nLet's freshen things up with a long-awaited guest,\n\n21:15.360 --> 21:17.520\nsomebody who should have been here a long time ago,\n\n21:17.520 --> 21:20.760\npartly because it's basically, well, I mean, not basically.\n\n21:20.760 --> 21:24.120\nLiterally, she's the reason why the podcast exists,\n\n21:24.120 --> 21:30.200\nbecause years ago at the Roost, she was just very like,\n\n21:30.200 --> 21:31.360\nshe wasn't assertive about it.\n\n21:31.360 --> 21:33.240\nShe was just sort of clear about it,\n\n21:33.240 --> 21:34.640\nsaid, like, you should have a podcast.\n\n21:34.640 --> 21:35.560\nYou should do a podcast.\n\n21:35.560 --> 21:40.440\nAnd I was like, oh, yeah, maybe I should.\n\n21:40.440 --> 21:43.840\nHer benefits extend beyond that.\n\n21:43.840 --> 21:46.280\nA lot of you already love her from the indoor kids\n\n21:46.280 --> 21:47.120\nand all kinds of stuff.\n\n21:47.120 --> 21:49.360\nAnd she's got a book that's coming out that we'll plug,\n\n21:49.360 --> 21:50.840\nbut let's get to talking to her.\n\n21:50.840 --> 21:51.840\nEmily Gordon's here.\n\n21:51.840 --> 21:59.840\nYeah!\n\n21:59.840 --> 22:01.840\nOh.\n\n22:01.840 --> 22:02.840\nHello.\n\n22:02.840 --> 22:03.840\nHi.\n\n22:03.840 --> 22:04.840\nFinally.\n\n22:04.840 --> 22:05.840\nHello.\n\n22:05.840 --> 22:06.840\nEmily Vance Gordon.\n\n22:06.840 --> 22:07.840\nVance.\n\n22:07.840 --> 22:08.840\nThat's right.\n\n22:08.840 --> 22:09.840\nYou got a cool middle name.\n\n22:09.840 --> 22:10.840\nI hate that middle name.\n\n22:10.840 --> 22:11.840\nWhy is that?\n\n22:11.840 --> 22:13.840\nIt's my, it was supposed to be my first name\n\n22:13.840 --> 22:16.840\nif I was going to be a boy, and I wasn't.\n\n22:16.840 --> 22:18.840\nSo, because I don't think anybody would have\n\n22:18.840 --> 22:22.840\nsex with someone named Vance, so I'm quite,\n\n22:22.840 --> 22:24.840\nI'm quite happy about that.\n\n22:24.840 --> 22:26.840\nBut middle name status, I'll take it.\n\n22:26.840 --> 22:27.840\nIt's fine.\n\n22:27.840 --> 22:28.840\nYeah.\n\n22:28.840 --> 22:30.840\nSo they love the name so much they couldn't let it go,\n\n22:30.840 --> 22:31.840\neven though you were a woman.\n\n22:31.840 --> 22:33.840\nIt must be in here somewhere.\n\n22:33.840 --> 22:35.840\nI'm lucky I didn't get one of those four name people.\n\n22:35.840 --> 22:36.840\nYou know the four name people?\n\n22:36.840 --> 22:37.840\nIt's not good.\n\n22:37.840 --> 22:38.840\nWhat?\n\n22:38.840 --> 22:40.840\nI have kind of an equally charming story.\n\n22:40.840 --> 22:42.840\nMy parents didn't expect a third child,\n\n22:42.840 --> 22:44.840\nso they made up a name and.\n\n22:44.840 --> 22:45.840\nDan, did they make up Dan?\n\n22:45.840 --> 22:46.840\nYeah.\n\n22:46.840 --> 22:48.840\nYou guys, the creator of Dan.\n\n22:48.840 --> 22:51.840\nThey just grabbed it and rolled me under a porch.\n\n22:51.840 --> 22:54.840\nSo I want to start with one of the most,\n\n22:54.840 --> 22:58.840\nI think this kind of exemplifies you in my mind,\n\n22:58.840 --> 23:01.840\nmy relationship with you, your role in my cosmos.\n\n23:01.840 --> 23:05.840\nI'm constantly retweeting you, things that you just retweet.\n\n23:05.840 --> 23:08.840\nIt's not like you're out there aggressively asserting yourself,\n\n23:08.840 --> 23:12.840\nbut you like Graham Linehan who we had on the show.\n\n23:12.840 --> 23:13.840\nOh, he's so great on Twitter.\n\n23:13.840 --> 23:16.840\nYeah, and particularly through the things he retweets,\n\n23:16.840 --> 23:18.840\nkind of just by looking at his retweets,\n\n23:18.840 --> 23:21.840\nI feel like a smarter person.\n\n23:21.840 --> 23:24.840\nAnd I also feel like a much dumber person.\n\n23:24.840 --> 23:28.840\nBut your stuff, the stuff that you retweet,\n\n23:28.840 --> 23:31.840\nis like the emotional equivalent of that.\n\n23:31.840 --> 23:38.840\nThe most exemplary one was you simply retweeted a Tumblr.\n\n23:38.840 --> 23:40.840\nNo, was this something that you wrote or was this something?\n\n23:40.840 --> 23:42.840\nNo, it's something that somebody else wrote that I just saw\n\n23:42.840 --> 23:44.840\nand retumbled and therefore retweeted.\n\n23:44.840 --> 23:47.840\nGod, I hate myself.\n\n23:47.840 --> 23:49.840\nJust having to say that sentence out loud,\n\n23:49.840 --> 23:51.840\nI'm not fond of myself.\n\n23:51.840 --> 23:52.840\nWe all died a little bit.\n\n23:52.840 --> 23:54.840\nYeah, I know, I'm sorry.\n\n23:54.840 --> 23:59.840\nIt was simply a list of ways to compliment people.\n\n23:59.840 --> 24:01.840\nI don't want to get this wrong.\n\n24:01.840 --> 24:03.840\nList of ways to compliment people\n\n24:03.840 --> 24:05.840\nwithout involving their physical appearance.\n\n24:05.840 --> 24:07.840\nTheir appearance, yeah, that's it.\n\n24:07.840 --> 24:11.840\nNice things you can say to people other than how they look.\n\n24:11.840 --> 24:19.840\nAnd I was like, my brain flipped over\n\n24:19.840 --> 24:21.840\nbecause it's like this is something\n\n24:21.840 --> 24:24.840\nI should have realized a long time ago.\n\n24:24.840 --> 24:27.840\nIt's beyond gender politics, it's beyond,\n\n24:27.840 --> 24:29.840\nbut it certainly afflicts probably,\n\n24:29.840 --> 24:33.840\nif I were to guess, probably afflicts the female self-esteem\n\n24:33.840 --> 24:35.840\na little more than the half of the species\n\n24:35.840 --> 24:38.840\nis allowed to look like this.\n\n24:38.840 --> 24:41.840\nWhat were a couple that you remember, or anything?\n\n24:41.840 --> 24:43.840\nYou know what, fuck it, no, I didn't even read it.\n\n24:43.840 --> 24:49.840\nBased on the title alone, you were like, yes, this speaks to me.\n\n24:49.840 --> 24:53.840\nBut that's an important thing.\n\n24:53.840 --> 24:59.840\nThink about this, this is a piece that made my mind flop.\n\n24:59.840 --> 25:03.840\n180 degrees about some part of my brain\n\n25:03.840 --> 25:05.840\njust reshuffled completely.\n\n25:05.840 --> 25:10.840\nAnd there was no outrage, there was no lynching,\n\n25:10.840 --> 25:13.840\nthere was no anger, there was no shaming,\n\n25:13.840 --> 25:17.840\neven comedically, all those comedy people,\n\n25:17.840 --> 25:20.840\nthat's how we express our progress as we...\n\n25:20.840 --> 25:22.840\nBitch about things.\n\n25:22.840 --> 25:24.840\nYour husband's the best at it.\n\n25:24.840 --> 25:26.840\nHe's so good, you guys.\n\n25:26.840 --> 25:29.840\nHe's like Lancelot, he's out there slashing.\n\n25:29.840 --> 25:31.840\nHe complains on a constant basis.\n\n25:31.840 --> 25:33.840\nThat's what we do, that's as progressive\n\n25:33.840 --> 25:35.840\nas comedy and comedy writers get,\n\n25:35.840 --> 25:41.840\nis we stab and we poke the things that we don't like.\n\n25:41.840 --> 25:44.840\nBut this was a thing that was like, hey,\n\n25:44.840 --> 25:47.840\nhere's a list of things you could say to somebody\n\n25:47.840 --> 25:51.840\nthat have nothing to do with their physical appearance,\n\n25:51.840 --> 25:54.840\nand there was no victimization, there was no nothing.\n\n25:54.840 --> 25:57.840\nI would name a couple of them, things that you could say.\n\n25:57.840 --> 26:00.840\nI don't remember a goddamn one, and I don't have to.\n\n26:00.840 --> 26:03.840\nI enjoy the way your voice sounds.\n\n26:03.840 --> 26:06.840\nWhat do you love hearing that from somebody, you guys?\n\n26:06.840 --> 26:09.840\nI think it was stuff like, I like how your voice sounds,\n\n26:09.840 --> 26:12.840\nI enjoy the work that you did on that thing,\n\n26:12.840 --> 26:14.840\nlike just very kind of random things, but...\n\n26:14.840 --> 26:16.840\nI enjoy spending time with you.\n\n26:16.840 --> 26:18.840\nYou make me feel better about myself.\n\n26:18.840 --> 26:22.840\nJust like a genuine, vulnerable expression of like,\n\n26:22.840 --> 26:24.840\nthis is something you do that I like.\n\n26:24.840 --> 26:27.840\nThat's kind of a rarity, you don't really have a lot of...\n\n26:27.840 --> 26:29.840\nYou scare me less than other people.\n\n26:29.840 --> 26:33.840\nYou make me feel like dancing.\n\n26:33.840 --> 26:35.840\nI'm going to dance tonight away.\n\n26:35.840 --> 26:36.840\nYeah, yeah.\n\n26:36.840 --> 26:40.840\nI want to dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me, obviously.\n\n26:40.840 --> 26:43.840\nI'm your private dancer.\n\n26:43.840 --> 26:44.840\nDancer for money?\n\n26:44.840 --> 26:45.840\nA dancer for money.\n\n26:45.840 --> 26:46.840\nWill you do what I want you to do?\n\n26:46.840 --> 26:47.840\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n26:47.840 --> 26:50.840\nDon't make it about yourself, make it about her.\n\n26:52.840 --> 26:54.840\nThese are our dance hall days.\n\n26:54.840 --> 26:56.840\nYou're just scrambling now.\n\n26:56.840 --> 26:59.840\nEverybody weighing chung tonight?\n\n26:59.840 --> 27:03.840\nI just feel like a lot of times the stuff I see in Tumblr specifically,\n\n27:03.840 --> 27:06.840\nif you spend any time on it, it's just people full of hate and rage,\n\n27:06.840 --> 27:10.840\nlike college rage, which is a very specific rage.\n\n27:10.840 --> 27:12.840\nAnd I was like, when you're telling,\n\n27:12.840 --> 27:15.840\nthis is fucked up when this happens and this should be happening instead,\n\n27:15.840 --> 27:17.840\nthen all people want to talk about is, this is what's fucked up.\n\n27:17.840 --> 27:19.840\nAnd they're like, well, that's not fucked up.\n\n27:19.840 --> 27:21.840\nYou don't understand, you weren't there, you don't know.\n\n27:21.840 --> 27:22.840\nLet me explain it to you, little lady.\n\n27:22.840 --> 27:24.840\nSo I'm like, I would rather just skip to the second part,\n\n27:24.840 --> 27:27.840\nwhich is putting out good stuff and being like, well, then just take this.\n\n27:27.840 --> 27:28.840\nWhat is the goal?\n\n27:28.840 --> 27:30.840\nWhat is the end game that we want?\n\n27:30.840 --> 27:33.840\nWe want to be happy supposedly, right?\n\n27:33.840 --> 27:34.840\nWe want to be satisfied.\n\n27:34.840 --> 27:36.840\nWe want to be supposedly when you're like,\n\n27:36.840 --> 27:41.840\nwhen you're charging at a guy on Twitter and you're like fucking like lancing him.\n\n27:41.840 --> 27:47.840\nIn theory, like in plain sight theory, the theory we all accept,\n\n27:47.840 --> 27:53.840\nwhich I don't know, is it true, is that behind all of that force\n\n27:53.840 --> 27:59.840\nis revolution and the name of the revolution is, can't we all just get along?\n\n27:59.840 --> 28:05.840\nNow, if your flag is, can't we all just get along?\n\n28:05.840 --> 28:07.840\nThat's a fucked up flag too.\n\n28:07.840 --> 28:11.840\nWhy under that flag are you slitting people's throats?\n\n28:11.840 --> 28:14.840\nNo matter how racist they are, no matter how,\n\n28:14.840 --> 28:18.840\nlike when are we going to get to this revolution where we go?\n\n28:18.840 --> 28:23.840\nLike, let's start, it's more boring, but let's start setting the example.\n\n28:23.840 --> 28:24.840\nIt's so much more boring.\n\n28:24.840 --> 28:26.840\nIt's fucking terrible, really.\n\n28:26.840 --> 28:32.840\nAnd it's really hard to think of a positive way to incite subversive thought.\n\n28:32.840 --> 28:38.840\nBut another, I mean, I've referenced it numerous times on this podcast.\n\n28:38.840 --> 28:41.840\nI think you retweeted it was the blog entry,\n\n28:41.840 --> 28:44.840\nthe article that was admit it, your fave is problematic.\n\n28:44.840 --> 28:46.840\nYes, that was a great one.\n\n28:46.840 --> 28:49.840\nI thought there was such a gracious invitation within there.\n\n28:49.840 --> 28:51.840\nIt was like such a beacon of light within a generation\n\n28:51.840 --> 28:54.840\nthat I am so, like, shaking my cane at all the time.\n\n28:54.840 --> 28:57.840\nBut it was like, oh, this is the thing that I'm looking for\n\n28:57.840 --> 29:01.840\nis the idea that, can we acknowledge that humanity is so flawed\n\n29:01.840 --> 29:04.840\nthat if we are going to clean up this porch,\n\n29:04.840 --> 29:06.840\nthat it is going to involve touching dirt.\n\n29:06.840 --> 29:07.840\nSo much dirt.\n\n29:07.840 --> 29:10.840\nAnd if we all go ick every time we touch dirt and pointed it and screamed,\n\n29:10.840 --> 29:13.840\ndirt, dirt, dirt, we're going to be able to fucking clean children\n\n29:13.840 --> 29:15.840\non a dirty porch shrieking at each other.\n\n29:15.840 --> 29:22.840\nWe don't ever get to have conversations about anything\n\n29:22.840 --> 29:25.840\nbecause when you start, if you even start, people are like,\n\n29:25.840 --> 29:27.840\nwell, here's why what you said is problematic.\n\n29:27.840 --> 29:31.840\nAnd then there's no conversations that are going to move anyone anywhere\n\n29:31.840 --> 29:33.840\nbecause it's all like, how fast can I shut you down?\n\n29:33.840 --> 29:35.840\nHow quickly can I shut you down and then shame you\n\n29:35.840 --> 29:38.840\nand then we don't get to move in any direction from there?\n\n29:38.840 --> 29:42.840\nHow much of the shame and the hate or trolling do you get\n\n29:42.840 --> 29:44.840\nthat's simply because you're a woman?\n\n29:44.840 --> 29:48.840\nIt's actually, and me saying this is going to make it happen more.\n\n29:48.840 --> 29:50.840\nSo be aware of that.\n\n29:50.840 --> 29:51.840\nThe gauntlet is starting.\n\n29:51.840 --> 29:53.840\nI actually don't, it's not that bad.\n\n29:53.840 --> 29:55.840\nIt's really not that bad for me.\n\n29:55.840 --> 29:57.840\nAnd it also makes me mad when people are like,\n\n29:57.840 --> 30:00.840\nyou're one of the good ones, like one of the good feminists.\n\n30:00.840 --> 30:04.840\nThe Jimi Hendrix, that's what we call them.\n\n30:04.840 --> 30:07.840\nNow I want to be one of the bad ones, you fucking asshole.\n\n30:07.840 --> 30:09.840\nDon't ever tell me I'm one of the good ones\n\n30:09.840 --> 30:11.840\nbecause you'll see me become the bad one.\n\n30:11.840 --> 30:14.840\nIs that because you project yourself,\n\n30:14.840 --> 30:17.840\nyou seem to have a pretty sane approach to how you do stuff.\n\n30:17.840 --> 30:19.840\nI try to, and when I talk about sex or something,\n\n30:19.840 --> 30:22.840\nI always say something about giving a blow job or something,\n\n30:22.840 --> 30:25.840\nand people will be like, that's so cool that you talk about that\n\n30:25.840 --> 30:27.840\nand you're feminist.\n\n30:27.840 --> 30:29.840\nI'm like, yeah, feminists give all of the blow jobs.\n\n30:29.840 --> 30:31.840\nThey give all of them.\n\n30:31.840 --> 30:32.840\nWe love it.\n\n30:32.840 --> 30:34.840\nIt's so great.\n\n30:34.840 --> 30:37.840\nHow much power do you have when you have a man's genitals\n\n30:37.840 --> 30:39.840\nin your fucking mouth?\n\n30:39.840 --> 30:40.840\nThat is power.\n\n30:40.840 --> 30:42.840\nYou definitely...\n\n30:46.840 --> 30:48.840\nThank you, goodnight.\n\n30:48.840 --> 30:52.840\nYou do not want a blow job from a non-feminist, really.\n\n30:52.840 --> 30:54.840\nIt's the worst.\n\n30:54.840 --> 30:57.840\nIt's probably all teeth.\n\n30:59.840 --> 31:02.840\nBut related to that, there's another anecdotal thing,\n\n31:02.840 --> 31:04.840\nbut we're coming so close to,\n\n31:04.840 --> 31:08.840\nwhich I think is beautiful, is bridging this from societal stuff\n\n31:08.840 --> 31:10.840\nand digital stuff to couple stuff,\n\n31:10.840 --> 31:12.840\nbecause your original wheelhouse is,\n\n31:12.840 --> 31:16.840\nyou actually, you're an ex-patriot from the...\n\n31:16.840 --> 31:18.840\nweren't you a couples therapist?\n\n31:18.840 --> 31:20.840\nYeah, I was a couples and family therapist.\n\n31:20.840 --> 31:21.840\nAnd you fled.\n\n31:21.840 --> 31:23.840\nI ran fast.\n\n31:23.840 --> 31:25.840\nWhich makes you more trustworthy as a therapist\n\n31:25.840 --> 31:28.840\nthan anybody who stayed, but...\n\n31:28.840 --> 31:29.840\nIt's true.\n\n31:29.840 --> 31:32.840\nI was a therapist for, I practiced for about six and a half,\n\n31:32.840 --> 31:34.840\nalmost seven years, and I really loved it,\n\n31:34.840 --> 31:37.840\nbut I chose to work with really tough populations\n\n31:37.840 --> 31:40.840\nand really tough populations will burn you the fuck out.\n\n31:40.840 --> 31:42.840\nSo I was like, I tried to take a job working with people\n\n31:42.840 --> 31:44.840\nwho were just like, I feel stressed out,\n\n31:44.840 --> 31:47.840\nand I was like, fuck you, you have no idea how good you have it.\n\n31:47.840 --> 31:49.840\nAnd then I was like, oh, I got to get out of here.\n\n31:49.840 --> 31:51.840\nThis is my fault now.\n\n31:51.840 --> 31:53.840\nWhat do you mean when you say tough population?\n\n31:53.840 --> 31:55.840\nI worked, my first job was with kids\n\n31:55.840 --> 31:57.840\nwho had been removed from their home,\n\n31:57.840 --> 31:59.840\nand their next step was going to be to put in training school,\n\n31:59.840 --> 32:01.840\nwhich is like bye-bye until you're 18.\n\n32:01.840 --> 32:03.840\nAnd then my next job was with only suicidal people.\n\n32:03.840 --> 32:06.840\nMy next job was with 270 people with schizophrenia\n\n32:06.840 --> 32:08.840\nwho were living in a hotel.\n\n32:08.840 --> 32:10.840\nThat's how Freddy Krueger got born.\n\n32:10.840 --> 32:11.840\nI know, right?\n\n32:11.840 --> 32:13.840\nThe bastard's child of 1,000 maniacs.\n\n32:13.840 --> 32:15.840\n1,000 maniacs.\n\n32:15.840 --> 32:17.840\nThat's how sperm works, right?\n\n32:17.840 --> 32:20.840\nWe all learned in dream warriors.\n\n32:20.840 --> 32:22.840\nWhich, by the way, isn't that...\n\n32:22.840 --> 32:24.840\nThat sperm is like a slushie?\n\n32:24.840 --> 32:27.840\nWhat the fuck?\n\n32:27.840 --> 32:31.840\nLike, if 1,000 crazy people rape one nun,\n\n32:31.840 --> 32:35.840\nit makes Freddy Krueger with their combined sperm?\n\n32:35.840 --> 32:37.840\nThat's irresponsible.\n\n32:37.840 --> 32:39.840\nIt's like a gay couple where they're like,\n\n32:39.840 --> 32:41.840\nwe don't want to know which one it really was.\n\n32:41.840 --> 32:43.840\nWe just want it to be all of our kids together.\n\n32:43.840 --> 32:46.840\nAnd some of them's like, he's got my eyes, though.\n\n32:46.840 --> 32:48.840\nI think it's mine.\n\n32:48.840 --> 32:53.840\nHe has my proclivity for knife fingering.\n\n32:53.840 --> 32:56.840\nYeah, he's got all my burnt flesh.\n\n32:56.840 --> 32:58.840\nI kind of want to...\n\n32:58.840 --> 33:00.840\nPart of me really wants, because I think...\n\n33:00.840 --> 33:02.840\nIf so many people are listening, they could benefit,\n\n33:02.840 --> 33:04.840\nbecause what you just said earlier was that\n\n33:04.840 --> 33:06.840\nyou actually don't...\n\n33:06.840 --> 33:08.840\nYou actually have an easier time,\n\n33:08.840 --> 33:10.840\nand I think it's not an incorrect assumption\n\n33:10.840 --> 33:13.840\nthat that has something to do with inside you,\n\n33:13.840 --> 33:16.840\nthat you know how to handle things better.\n\n33:16.840 --> 33:20.840\nSo, therefore, I'm curious that it's for all of us out there\n\n33:20.840 --> 33:22.840\nwho are living on Twitter,\n\n33:22.840 --> 33:24.840\nliving in social media comment sections,\n\n33:24.840 --> 33:27.840\ngetting into these tangles that jack up our nervous system,\n\n33:27.840 --> 33:29.840\nand all of a sudden we're just...\n\n33:29.840 --> 33:32.840\nI mean, what do you do in these very typical situations\n\n33:32.840 --> 33:35.840\nthat maybe some of us aren't doing?\n\n33:35.840 --> 33:36.840\nOkay, that's a good question.\n\n33:36.840 --> 33:38.840\nI would say, and I'm not always great at it,\n\n33:38.840 --> 33:39.840\nif you catch me on a weird day,\n\n33:39.840 --> 33:40.840\nI'll fucking yell at you for no reason,\n\n33:40.840 --> 33:42.840\nand then apologize later.\n\n33:42.840 --> 33:43.840\nAnd that's the thing I've learned.\n\n33:43.840 --> 33:45.840\nOne is that what I don't want to have to do\n\n33:45.840 --> 33:47.840\nis apologize to someone who is a little shitty to me\n\n33:47.840 --> 33:50.840\nwhen I blow up later, and then I'm like, you're right,\n\n33:50.840 --> 33:52.840\nI'm sorry, I said something shitty.\n\n33:52.840 --> 33:54.840\nI don't want to have to apologize to you, fuck off.\n\n33:54.840 --> 33:56.840\nSo, that's my first line of defense.\n\n33:56.840 --> 33:58.840\nSecond line of defense is going,\n\n33:58.840 --> 34:00.840\nwhat do I really want out of this?\n\n34:00.840 --> 34:02.840\nGenuinely, what is the ideal outcome\n\n34:02.840 --> 34:04.840\nof this situation for me?\n\n34:04.840 --> 34:06.840\nAnd is there any chance in fucking hell\n\n34:06.840 --> 34:07.840\nthat I'm going to get it?\n\n34:07.840 --> 34:09.840\nAnd if there's just not,\n\n34:09.840 --> 34:11.840\nthen I just choose not to engage.\n\n34:11.840 --> 34:14.840\nLike, there's no point to me.\n\n34:14.840 --> 34:17.840\nLike, if what I want is, I want you to stop being racist\n\n34:17.840 --> 34:20.840\nand sexist and understand how I feel about things,\n\n34:20.840 --> 34:22.840\nI'm not going to do that over Twitter.\n\n34:22.840 --> 34:23.840\nThat's never going to happen.\n\n34:23.840 --> 34:25.840\nAnd why would you want that for some dude?\n\n34:25.840 --> 34:27.840\nLike, what a kind of weird,\n\n34:27.840 --> 34:29.840\ndead man walking relationship is that?\n\n34:29.840 --> 34:31.840\nOr you're just going to be Susan Saranda to one guy on Twitter?\n\n34:31.840 --> 34:33.840\nYou're the one, I've decided.\n\n34:33.840 --> 34:35.840\nI will change you.\n\n34:35.840 --> 34:37.840\nAnd for so many, I think women too,\n\n34:37.840 --> 34:40.840\nwe take on project dudes to date.\n\n34:40.840 --> 34:43.840\nAnd so, taking on project dudes on Twitter,\n\n34:43.840 --> 34:45.840\nI feel like it's like a weird extension of that,\n\n34:45.840 --> 34:47.840\nof like taking on like, I will make you better.\n\n34:47.840 --> 34:50.840\nI will be the special one that will understand you\n\n34:50.840 --> 34:52.840\nand make you, it's not my job.\n\n34:52.840 --> 34:54.840\nIt could be, I think we're all afflicted to that,\n\n34:54.840 --> 34:56.840\nby it though, like, because we all want to,\n\n34:56.840 --> 34:59.840\nso what I'm hearing and combining with the tools\n\n34:59.840 --> 35:01.840\nI'm acquiring in therapy right now.\n\n35:01.840 --> 35:03.840\nJust the fact that you said what I'm hearing,\n\n35:03.840 --> 35:05.840\nit's good stuff, good refrain.\n\n35:05.840 --> 35:07.840\nGood communication.\n\n35:07.840 --> 35:09.840\nBy the way, you look fantastic tonight.\n\n35:09.840 --> 35:11.840\nFuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!\n\n35:11.840 --> 35:14.840\nEmily, is Camille a project dude?\n\n35:14.840 --> 35:16.840\nOf course, of course he is.\n\n35:16.840 --> 35:18.840\nAnyway, what are you saying?\n\n35:18.840 --> 35:20.840\nOh, I shouldn't have answered for you.\n\n35:20.840 --> 35:22.840\nIt just seems so obvious.\n\n35:22.840 --> 35:24.840\nNo, he's not.\n\n35:24.840 --> 35:26.840\nNo, not at all.\n\n35:26.840 --> 35:28.840\nI mean, thank God he's not here tonight.\n\n35:28.840 --> 35:30.840\nNo, he's not backstage staring at me right now.\n\n35:30.840 --> 35:32.840\nAh, no, not at all.\n\n35:32.840 --> 35:34.840\nHe was one of the first guys I dated\n\n35:34.840 --> 35:36.840\nthat did not need me to function,\n\n35:36.840 --> 35:38.840\nand so that was why he was terrifying,\n\n35:38.840 --> 35:40.840\nbut also why I fell in love with him.\n\n35:40.840 --> 35:42.840\nWould I, just to, just to link,\n\n35:42.840 --> 35:44.840\nand not to beat this dead horse,\n\n35:44.840 --> 35:46.840\nbut just because I do think that people listening\n\n35:46.840 --> 35:48.840\ncould like benefit from this,\n\n35:48.840 --> 35:50.840\nbecause we're interacting all the time\n\n35:50.840 --> 35:52.840\njust in these little digital bursts.\n\n35:52.840 --> 35:54.840\nSo, I think that's the difference between\n\n35:54.840 --> 35:56.840\nyour type of interaction with trolls,\n\n35:56.840 --> 35:58.840\nlet's call them, like, do you primarily,\n\n35:58.840 --> 36:00.840\ndo you do a lot of just blocking,\n\n36:00.840 --> 36:02.840\nignoring? I do some blocking, yeah.\n\n36:02.840 --> 36:04.840\nI try to think like, what do I want,\n\n36:04.840 --> 36:06.840\nand if what I want is to make this guy feel\n\n36:06.840 --> 36:08.840\nshame or bad,\n\n36:08.840 --> 36:10.840\nthen I'm like, I need to find another way to make,\n\n36:10.840 --> 36:12.840\nthere are other ways to affect someone's\n\n36:12.840 --> 36:14.840\nemotions that don't involve,\n\n36:14.840 --> 36:16.840\nbecause some days you just want to make other people\n\n36:16.840 --> 36:18.840\nfeel bad. You feel bad, you want to fucking spread it around,\n\n36:18.840 --> 36:20.840\nbut just be honest with your own intentions.\n\n36:20.840 --> 36:22.840\nLike, if you're like, no, no, no,\n\n36:22.840 --> 36:24.840\nI want to educate him about fifth-weight feminism.\n\n36:24.840 --> 36:26.840\nNo, you don't, you want to fucking make him feel bad.\n\n36:26.840 --> 36:28.840\nYou want to make him feel bad, because he made you feel bad.\n\n36:28.840 --> 36:30.840\nYou don't want to educate him, you don't give a fuck\n\n36:30.840 --> 36:32.840\nif he's educated. Just be honest with\n\n36:32.840 --> 36:34.840\nthat desire within yourself,\n\n36:34.840 --> 36:36.840\nand then also think about him. What does he want?\n\n36:36.840 --> 36:38.840\nHe wants to make you feel bad.\n\n36:38.840 --> 36:40.840\nAre you going to let him have that? That's a lot of power\n\n36:40.840 --> 36:42.840\nto give somebody a stranger who has an egg\n\n36:42.840 --> 36:44.840\nfor a fucking face. I'm not going to do that.\n\n36:44.840 --> 36:46.840\nYeah.\n\n36:46.840 --> 36:48.840\nI feel like I have,\n\n36:48.840 --> 36:50.840\nlike, incidentally, like, going to\n\n36:50.840 --> 36:52.840\ntherapy and then, as a\n\n36:52.840 --> 36:54.840\ndirect result of therapy, I adopted this new\n\n36:54.840 --> 36:56.840\nthing, which I never would have done before.\n\n36:56.840 --> 36:58.840\nI actually, when I started on Twitter,\n\n36:58.840 --> 37:00.840\nI thought that blocking people was like some kind of\n\n37:00.840 --> 37:02.840\nadmission of defeat. You won? Yeah.\n\n37:02.840 --> 37:04.840\nLike, no, I can fucking\n\n37:04.840 --> 37:06.840\ntake anybody down. Come at me.\n\n37:06.840 --> 37:08.840\nLike, I'm Stephen Segal. And what does that even mean?\n\n37:08.840 --> 37:10.840\nTake them down. What does that even mean?\n\n37:10.840 --> 37:12.840\nI mean, I'll tell you what it means, because\n\n37:12.840 --> 37:14.840\nI'm still part of me, it's like, no, I want you\n\n37:14.840 --> 37:16.840\nto understand how good I am.\n\n37:16.840 --> 37:18.840\nThat means they block me.\n\n37:18.840 --> 37:20.840\nAnd I was fucking good\n\n37:20.840 --> 37:22.840\nat it. Like, I would,\n\n37:22.840 --> 37:24.840\nthat was my zero-sum\n\n37:24.840 --> 37:26.840\ngame. Like, for real, for three years,\n\n37:26.840 --> 37:28.840\nthat was my game. Like, I would, people\n\n37:28.840 --> 37:30.840\nwould come at me and they'd go, like, community sucks.\n\n37:30.840 --> 37:32.840\nAnd I'd be like, all right, let's talk for a while.\n\n37:32.840 --> 37:34.840\nThree weeks later, they're blocking me.\n\n37:34.840 --> 37:36.840\nAnd I'm like, coming out, I'm going, hey, hey,\n\n37:36.840 --> 37:38.840\nI thought you wanted to talk, motherfucker!\n\n37:38.840 --> 37:40.840\nThat's me\n\n37:40.840 --> 37:42.840\nwinning.\n\n37:42.840 --> 37:44.840\nUnhealthy, unhealthy. Unhealthy.\n\n37:44.840 --> 37:46.840\nMeanwhile, community, they're like, hey, where's\n\n37:46.840 --> 37:48.840\nDan? Oh, I don't know, I think he's talking with a guy\n\n37:48.840 --> 37:50.840\nwho's three weeks ago. Because then I fucking into him, I'm like,\n\n37:50.840 --> 37:52.840\nwhy do you draw like an eight-year-old? Is it because you're\n\n37:52.840 --> 37:54.840\ndead left?\n\n37:54.840 --> 37:56.840\nAnd they're just like crying and like, fucking,\n\n37:56.840 --> 37:58.840\nlike, I just fantasize about their suicide.\n\n37:58.840 --> 38:00.840\nI don't, don't commit suicide.\n\n38:00.840 --> 38:02.840\nTalk to somebody. Suicide is not good.\n\n38:02.840 --> 38:04.840\nThere's a number you can call.\n\n38:04.840 --> 38:06.840\nBut, so, in therapy,\n\n38:06.840 --> 38:08.840\nbecause of the stuff I learned, then I just, like,\n\n38:08.840 --> 38:10.840\napplied that. I never talked to my therapist about\n\n38:10.840 --> 38:12.840\nTwitter. Yeah, specifically, yeah.\n\n38:12.840 --> 38:14.840\nBut I applied the tools that I was learning in therapy.\n\n38:14.840 --> 38:16.840\nWhat a good client you are. What's up?\n\n38:16.840 --> 38:18.840\nApplying tools you've learned elsewhere. What a great client\n\n38:18.840 --> 38:20.840\nyou are. Yeah, I'm all over the place.\n\n38:20.840 --> 38:22.840\nAnd I'm assuming you think I look great, but won't tell me\n\n38:22.840 --> 38:24.840\nbecause you're so advanced.\n\n38:24.840 --> 38:26.840\nI'll tell you later. Off mic.\n\n38:26.840 --> 38:28.840\nI feel like if somebody came up to me and said, uh, you know\n\n38:28.840 --> 38:30.840\nwhat, I really like the sound of your talking voice.\n\n38:30.840 --> 38:32.840\nThat's them saying, you look like shit.\n\n38:32.840 --> 38:34.840\nSend the man.\n\n38:34.840 --> 38:36.840\nI can't think of anything to say nice about the way\n\n38:36.840 --> 38:38.840\nyou look. With all due respect to Emily,\n\n38:38.840 --> 38:40.840\nI think that, I think the sound of your voice\n\n38:40.840 --> 38:42.840\nwas the bad first example. That was maybe a bad first\n\n38:42.840 --> 38:44.840\nexample. Because it's kind of as physical.\n\n38:44.840 --> 38:46.840\nThat's true. That is a little physical.\n\n38:46.840 --> 38:48.840\nBecause then someone else is like, what about me?\n\n38:48.840 --> 38:50.840\nYeah.\n\n38:50.840 --> 38:52.840\nAnd really, that's, they just have an ugly throat.\n\n38:52.840 --> 38:54.840\nCould you? That's a great voice.\n\n38:54.840 --> 38:56.840\nBut more importantly, if you're foxy, and all people\n\n38:56.840 --> 38:58.840\ndo is tell you you're foxy, that's actually the more\n\n38:58.840 --> 39:00.840\nimportant battleground. Absolutely.\n\n39:00.840 --> 39:02.840\nYou should be, anyways. So let's get to that later,\n\n39:02.840 --> 39:04.840\nbecause you're writing a book about, you're about\n\n39:04.840 --> 39:06.840\nto come up with a book about self-esteem.\n\n39:06.840 --> 39:08.840\nYeah, we'll talk about that.\n\n39:08.840 --> 39:10.840\nFuck you.\n\n39:10.840 --> 39:12.840\nFuck you all.

It's like, I have\n\n39:52.840 --> 39:54.840\na good time on Twitter now.

About season three.\n\n40:16.840 --> 40:18.840\nDo you feel like Joseph Stalin\n\n40:18.840 --> 40:20.840\nfelt the same way? Like, when he was perfect?\n\n40:20.840 --> 40:22.840\nYes, Jeff.\n\n40:22.840 --> 40:24.840\nAs I've always said.\n\n40:24.840 --> 40:26.840\nWhen he was killing off tens of millions of people.\n\n40:26.840 --> 40:28.840\nIs that how he blocked people? That dissented.\n\n40:28.840 --> 40:30.840\nWell, he blocked them with a bullet.\n\n40:30.840 --> 40:32.840\nThat was the blocking, the breathing passageways.\n\n40:32.840 --> 40:34.840\nI heard that he gave the orders\n\n40:34.840 --> 40:36.840\nto the Gestapo, he would say,\n\n40:36.840 --> 40:38.840\nblock them.\n\n40:38.840 --> 40:40.840\nStalin was dealing with the Gestapo?\n\n40:40.840 --> 40:42.840\nYeah, he was in deep with the Nazis.\n\n40:42.840 --> 40:44.840\nThat is hard.\n\n40:44.840 --> 40:46.840\nNo one knows about that.\n\n40:46.840 --> 40:48.840\nIs it because Gestapo is\n\n40:48.840 --> 40:50.840\nlike, cold soup, and you're like,\n\n40:50.840 --> 40:52.840\nyou taste it, and you're like, this soup is cold,\n\n40:52.840 --> 40:54.840\nand you're like, it's Gestapo, it's supposed to be cold.\n\n40:54.840 --> 40:56.840\nThe...\n\n40:56.840 --> 40:58.840\nI dropped out of college.\n\n40:58.840 --> 41:00.840\nI dropped out of college.\n\n41:00.840 --> 41:02.840\nWe have this beautiful segue here\n\n41:02.840 --> 41:04.840\nbecause we're talking about the\n\n41:04.840 --> 41:06.840\nindividual working with\n\n41:06.840 --> 41:08.840\nthis human biomass\n\n41:08.840 --> 41:10.840\ndigitally.\n\n41:10.840 --> 41:12.840\nAnd we're talking about the same tools\n\n41:12.840 --> 41:14.840\nand your former occupation\n\n41:14.840 --> 41:16.840\nthat we're talking about\n\n41:16.840 --> 41:18.840\ntwo people who join\n\n41:18.840 --> 41:20.840\nin partnership.\n\n41:20.840 --> 41:22.840\nAnd your husband is here, and my wife is here.\n\n41:22.840 --> 41:24.840\nI think we should just bring them both out at the same time.\n\n41:24.840 --> 41:26.840\nOh, interesting.

I was picked to run this theater\n\n41:56.840 --> 42:00.820\nWhen it first opened and I was really needed shows and really needed good things\n\n42:00.820 --> 42:05.340\nAnd we happened to be at the bar one night and I was like you should just come and talk on stage\n\n42:05.540 --> 42:10.260\nFor like an hour that I think it would be amazing and people would come and you were like make it to\n\n42:17.300 --> 42:19.140\nThat really is like\n\n42:19.140 --> 42:23.420\nDan and I what the drawing room and Dan and I were sitting at the bar at the drawing and there's like yeah\n\n42:23.420 --> 42:27.320\nI talked to Emily Gordon who works at meltdown and he\n\n42:28.160 --> 42:29.760\nShe said but we should do a show\n\n42:29.760 --> 42:33.760\nSo maybe we just get up there and we just talk and we talk about going to the moon and that was it\n\n42:33.760 --> 42:38.800\nThat was literally and the first show if you'll remember you wanted to show something on screen and our screen wasn't working\n\n42:38.800 --> 42:42.800\nSo when the show was supposed to be starting I was at the Apple store at the gallery\n\n42:42.800 --> 42:46.960\nI think at the Glendale Galleria. No not Glendale. I was whatever not interesting\n\n42:47.200 --> 42:51.920\nTrying to find a part to go to the screen so that you could show this thing and when I got back\n\n42:51.920 --> 42:54.860\nYou were like, fuck it. We just won't show it. I was like, all right\n\n42:57.360 --> 42:59.360\nWhich which mall was it?\n\n43:03.160 --> 43:05.160\nThe gallery is so close to the\n\n43:05.880 --> 43:08.880\nYeah, I did not call you a project man earlier\n\n43:12.080 --> 43:18.100\nWhat are you talking about I was totally still I'm a project guy you're also a project lady\n\n43:18.100 --> 43:21.580\nWe're all projects on this earth. We're\n\n43:22.860 --> 43:25.020\nWe're on a rock hurtling through space\n\n43:26.020 --> 43:28.020\nThis Camille you are not\n\n43:29.340 --> 43:33.060\nCamille it's so nice to see you. I appreciate what a project you are. Yeah\n\n43:34.940 --> 43:40.620\nThank you Camille you look fantastic tonight. Thank you. I like your voice\n\n43:40.620 --> 43:50.620\nWow, I mean if only the show was an hour, right, that's a fucking closer\n\n43:53.020 --> 43:57.100\nI'll end it right fucking now. I will end this thing, but that's a good segue\n\n43:57.100 --> 44:00.020\nLet's talk about that. So we got to we got two married couples up here\n\n44:00.020 --> 44:03.580\nWhat I've learned in couples therapy and in solo therapy both the same therapist is\n\n44:04.460 --> 44:05.580\nis\n\n44:05.580 --> 44:08.540\nthis this new epiphany that I've gotten is so\n\n44:08.540 --> 44:14.300\nEveryone in the world every experience that you have like like imagine yourself just covered and buttons, you know\n\n44:14.300 --> 44:16.300\nyou just get buttons pushed and\n\n44:16.460 --> 44:23.900\nIt bit there they're your deal and stuff the most important thing about it though is that you marry the person who pushes\n\n44:24.020 --> 44:30.100\nMost of your buttons they push they push like the exciting ones. Okay, so the buttons are good and bad. Yeah\n\n44:33.140 --> 44:35.820\nYou're like you're really pushing my buttons. That's never good\n\n44:35.820 --> 44:38.320\nYeah, okay. Well, maybe I need a different\n\n44:38.820 --> 44:39.860\nSwitches there we go\n\n44:39.860 --> 44:45.060\nBut like the people that the people that you couple with are people it's like it's like not to bring it into a religious place\n\n44:45.060 --> 44:48.340\nBut they're invitations from the cosmos for you to\n\n44:49.180 --> 44:53.860\nEvolve beyond what you would have been because you could have just lived to 30 and then just fucking fell over\n\n44:53.940 --> 44:58.580\nYou know and and and hey, that would have been a fine life better than a caterpillar and fucked your ass\n\n44:58.580 --> 45:05.620\nThe but as human beings who live 70 years or 90 in women's case\n\n45:07.580 --> 45:11.260\nWhoa, I'm sorry, I guess it's fine. You look great\n\n45:13.780 --> 45:18.260\nThe the it's like the second half of an important life is\n\n45:18.860 --> 45:20.540\nMaybe I'm biased because I'm married\n\n45:20.540 --> 45:28.060\nBut it's like it's it's it's joining with the person that affects you way more than strangers on Twitter way more than\n\n45:28.060 --> 45:32.180\nGood reviews or bad reviews of your television show way more than anything\n\n45:32.180 --> 45:37.820\nAnd so you're making an agreement not to wake up every morning and go hubba hubba. What's going on?\n\n45:37.820 --> 45:39.500\nLet's go. Let's go on a roller coaster\n\n45:39.500 --> 45:46.140\nYou're making an agreement to wake up in the in bed with every morning with somebody that's like this fucking person is goddamn fucking like\n\n45:47.020 --> 45:49.020\nJesus powerful\n\n45:50.140 --> 45:54.300\nThis person is what did Greg Proops say about his wife. How does he describe her formidable?\n\n45:54.300 --> 45:59.300\nYeah, this person is formidable, but I think that's true of some marriages\n\n45:59.300 --> 46:02.420\nBut then some marriages aren't like that at all some marriages are just like we're good friends\n\n46:02.420 --> 46:06.380\nAnd we've decided to hang out for the rest of your death those assholes. Yeah, is that you guys?\n\n46:07.500 --> 46:13.860\nNo, you're definitely very formidable. I think I like to say I know you challenge me. I like to think I challenge you\n\n46:13.860 --> 46:19.980\nYes, we sort of like yeah, it's been because that's what it what you were saying was when every relationship\n\n46:19.980 --> 46:23.740\nI've been in I felt like I had the power and same with you\n\n46:23.740 --> 46:27.360\nYes, I was I steamrolled every guy that I was with forever\n\n46:27.360 --> 46:33.260\nYeah, and then you would not allow me to do that. Is that because you as a therapist you have all that she's got all the tracks\n\n46:33.260 --> 46:36.700\nYou have all the jiu-jitsu and like yeah, and she's a blowjob feminist\n\n46:38.820 --> 46:43.380\nI was god damn it. I was gonna say steamer as euphemism for a feminist blood\n\n46:43.380 --> 46:45.380\nYeah, that's not hurt. That's not hurt\n\n46:45.460 --> 46:47.460\nbut\n\n46:47.700 --> 46:50.980\nRight, yeah, I think that in our relationship nobody\n\n46:50.980 --> 46:56.620\nNobody's in charge. I hope after the show. There's just a bunch of feminist blowjobs out in the parking lot tonight\n\n46:58.940 --> 47:00.940\nSwallow it ladies\n\n47:02.140 --> 47:04.140\nMan can be\n\n47:06.420 --> 47:08.420\nDid you say holla or swallow?\n\n47:12.020 --> 47:17.420\nDo you guys do you guys think now that we're moving forward into a world where marriage just means marriage?\n\n47:17.420 --> 47:23.980\nThat you won't have sex with us because the stage picture would imply that we're about to initiate up. No\n\n47:25.980 --> 47:27.980\nWait what\n\n47:29.900 --> 47:32.540\nYou guys think now that gay people can be married we could be swingers\n\n47:36.860 --> 47:39.980\nGay people can be married then we can fuck a million\n\n47:39.980 --> 47:46.300\nYeah, this is purely a visual thing, but because Dan and I are on either side of you. Yeah\n\n47:48.020 --> 47:50.020\nYeah\n\n47:54.060 --> 47:58.860\nNo judgment I think the I think the new rule just fuck whoever you're sitting nearest\n\n48:01.180 --> 48:03.180\nNever tell her she looks good\n\n48:03.180 --> 48:10.620\nThe question to the panel is yes, do you think that like we're famously we keep talking about this divorce rate?\n\n48:10.620 --> 48:15.580\nIt's like it's gotten so high that basically most aridges that that we that we\n\n48:15.980 --> 48:23.660\nThat we basically have become a like two or three marriage culture, which is just like it's like capitalism has absorbed that in my\n\n48:23.660 --> 48:31.180\nPerception, it's like which is why I'm proud to have waited really long to get married because even if it's not going to get married\n\n48:31.180 --> 48:37.420\nBecause even if only because I'll die soon. I promise. I'm not I'm gonna have one wife and fucking die\n\n48:38.060 --> 48:41.100\nI don't want to play into this con, but\n\n48:46.060 --> 48:50.220\nDo you guys think that these kids these these hologram kids these\n\n48:50.780 --> 48:54.060\nThese oculus rifts minecraft AR\n\n48:54.700 --> 48:56.700\nMy dick can be your vagina\n\n48:56.700 --> 49:05.980\nThe supreme court doesn't care. Let's fucking do it. Do you think that their divorce rate will lower?\n\n49:05.980 --> 49:12.540\nDo you think that marriage will now that it has been liberated? No, not necessarily. I I'm on my second marriage\n\n49:12.540 --> 49:16.540\nThis is Camille's my second husband. I got married when I was very damn it. I'm one of these people\n\n49:20.300 --> 49:25.020\nI guess I maybe knew that and totally forgot and put my foot right in it\n\n49:25.020 --> 49:29.900\nI'll tell you I got married when I was like super young to a very lovely guy. Good friend wonderful\n\n49:30.940 --> 49:32.940\nOh, right where everyone can hear this\n\n49:32.940 --> 49:34.940\nWe're getting there\n\n49:35.100 --> 49:37.100\nI'm joking\n\n49:37.340 --> 49:39.340\nHe's a very nice guy very nice guy\n\n49:39.980 --> 49:41.740\nbut who\n\n49:41.740 --> 49:46.700\nDid not push any of a lot of my buttons and didn't challenge me and I kind of just ran the show\n\n49:47.100 --> 49:52.060\nAnd so we got a very amicable divorce, but I feel like I feel like what I expected from him\n\n49:52.060 --> 49:57.420\nI expected him to be everything to me. I expected him to be like my best friend and my confidant and the guy\n\n49:57.980 --> 50:01.500\nLike food with him. I'm like a real fuck guy and like he couldn't\n\n50:02.380 --> 50:06.380\nI've met him. I've met him. You thought he was gonna be a fuck guy\n\n50:09.580 --> 50:11.580\nAll right, all right\n\n50:12.220 --> 50:14.220\nIf that's not fair for women to expect then\n\n50:14.620 --> 50:20.060\nWell, I feel like and I just feel like at some point it used to be that marriages were business arrangements set up by parents to like\n\n50:20.060 --> 50:24.060\nMake more people to work at the family business or like keep money and whatever\n\n50:24.380 --> 50:29.020\nWell, and women went straight from home to husband and at some point it became a thing of like no\n\n50:29.020 --> 50:31.180\nYour spouse has to be literally everything to you\n\n50:31.260 --> 50:36.300\nThey need like you have to be ultimately fulfilled in this one human being and it's not that you're not fantastic\n\n50:36.380 --> 50:38.380\nBut when I got divorced\n\n50:39.020 --> 50:41.020\nI think this is why this was good\n\n50:42.460 --> 50:46.380\nI think it's great that you evolved beyond expecting someone to be a fuck guy you found Camille\n\n50:46.380 --> 50:48.380\nI\n\n50:48.460 --> 50:50.460\nLike a really good friend. Hey\n\n50:50.860 --> 50:52.860\nI'm a fuck guy\n\n50:53.580 --> 51:00.300\nThe world is full of fuck guys that have very few projects. Yeah Camille. I'm good. I'm a cunnilingus meninus\n\n51:03.420 --> 51:06.300\nYou stress me is that what the Wiley Coyote was called?\n\n51:08.780 --> 51:10.780\nI think Camille\n\n51:11.420 --> 51:13.420\nCamille you might be a project fuck guy\n\n51:13.420 --> 51:18.940\nYeah, you're a project fuck guy. Yeah, but when I realized that after I got divorced at like\n\n51:19.020 --> 51:23.580\nI need to have good friends and a good like career that satisfies me and hobbies already\n\n51:23.660 --> 51:29.420\nLike I need to already be a whole person and not expect a dude to be like the thing that makes me whatever\n\n51:29.660 --> 51:33.340\nAnd once I kind of got that in my head. I found a guy that complimented me this guy\n\n51:33.980 --> 51:38.940\nYeah, who knows what's going on there. Yeah, they're just having a night. It's bad bad ecstasy trip\n\n51:38.940 --> 51:44.060\nNo, it's good. I'm flattered that they would choose this place to come and roll\n\n51:46.460 --> 51:49.180\nI would have gone to Bootsy Collins at the Hollywood. I think it's interesting that you\n\n51:49.740 --> 51:52.700\nthat you evoked like the history of marriage because if you look at you know how like like\n\n51:53.580 --> 51:57.580\nIn your biology textbook, remember that empire state building diagram where it was like\n\n51:57.660 --> 52:01.580\nThis is the history of the planet and then at the very top there was like a dime on top of the empire state building\n\n52:01.580 --> 52:03.580\nThis is how long humans have been around ever\n\n52:03.580 --> 52:09.580\nUm in the history of the concept of monogamy the concept of marriage like a vast\n\n52:09.900 --> 52:15.660\nLike what the history that we understand is as you said arranged marriage and the idea of\n\n52:16.380 --> 52:18.540\nOur tradition of marriage is that it's romantic\n\n52:18.620 --> 52:23.020\nIt comes from like the idea of like actually stealing off into the woods the ceremonies that we get married at\n\n52:23.180 --> 52:28.220\nThere are actually imitations of actually like like terrorist weddings, you know, like raping and taking\n\n52:28.220 --> 52:34.220\nLike sneak off into a clearing invite your friends have a have that fuck up fryer that like like, you know\n\n52:34.620 --> 52:38.700\nThe end of the kevin castor, uh, what was the the it's like it's like that was the\n\n52:39.020 --> 52:42.540\nThat was the that was the revolution of marriage very short time ago\n\n52:42.700 --> 52:51.340\nAnd since then the the the what do kids have as a tutorial of what a healthy marriage consists of the answer is\n\n52:51.820 --> 52:54.380\nMovies in which at the end of the movie\n\n52:54.380 --> 52:57.980\nIs when they get together they're about to get married. I have the biggest problem with this\n\n52:58.540 --> 53:01.900\nAnd then they're and I just like fuck it and you're supposed to be once you get married\n\n53:01.900 --> 53:07.100\nYou're happy forever because that was the goal the whole time and just be satisfied and all these women and men\n\n53:07.180 --> 53:11.740\nBut mainly women are like wait. What the fuck? I'm supposed to be happy forever. Why am I not happy?\n\n53:11.820 --> 53:16.540\nThe implication is that if if you are with a guy that you've been with for a year or a girl\n\n53:16.620 --> 53:21.340\nYou've been with for a year and there's somebody across the room that's like, oh, there's so much more interesting\n\n53:21.340 --> 53:26.700\nI wonder why the implication that you walk away from with from 30 years of rom-coms is actually like\n\n53:26.780 --> 53:29.500\nWell, you know why that guy's more interesting because he's gonna\n\n53:30.380 --> 53:32.380\nHe's gonna like make you happy forever\n\n53:33.500 --> 53:39.500\nIt's the opposite. It's like no, it's like filling up on bread. It's like, yeah, of course you want fucking like don't do it\n\n53:40.700 --> 53:46.380\nShakespeare the difference between a comedy and a tragedy is there's a wedding at the end versus a funeral. Yeah, exactly\n\n53:47.340 --> 53:49.340\nYeah, but there's no\n\n53:49.340 --> 53:54.300\nSo it's true. It's a very surprising trip just got just got his brain wrinkled\n\n53:56.300 --> 53:59.340\nWhat you have to do is you have to keep on bumping papers\n\n53:59.740 --> 54:01.740\nYou have to keep on competing on\n\n54:02.460 --> 54:06.220\nWith cases at your law firm. You have to continue to\n\n54:07.260 --> 54:10.460\nGet the ax body spray account. You have to like\n\n54:11.260 --> 54:12.540\nrole play\n\n54:12.540 --> 54:17.980\nThe uh, yeah the happily ever after from all the fairy tales is like where all the stars\n\n54:17.980 --> 54:22.940\nAnd all is there is of course there's because guess what adventure marriage is not an adventure. It's not super\n\n54:23.020 --> 54:28.300\nIt's not super exciting or boring. It just is it's just it can be an incredibly satisfying thing. There's also\n\n54:29.580 --> 54:35.500\nThere's also not a ton of stories about raising children like we yeah, we we skip over we don't we don't regard\n\n54:35.980 --> 54:37.980\nraising children and being married\n\n54:38.060 --> 54:45.580\nAs adventures. Yeah, maybe we shouldn't like like that would be weird, wouldn't it? Like we used to finding creep times when we would like leave\n\n54:45.580 --> 54:51.340\nThey're like finding me. We need to have a child to lose him. He's right finding Nemo. We got it\n\n54:51.820 --> 54:57.340\nWell, edipus was left out on a rock because his feet were too big and or no, his feet were too big because they tied his legs together\n\n54:57.340 --> 54:59.500\nThat's the story to follow. They bound his legs together. That's right\n\n55:01.980 --> 55:03.980\nSome twists and turns\n\n55:04.540 --> 55:06.540\nHe'll be dead and I'll be smoking a cigarette\n\n55:06.700 --> 55:12.620\nLet's let's let's talk about your book that that it's not it's it's probably not an opportune time to plug it because it's\n\n55:12.620 --> 55:17.580\nIt's not it's not being published for a little bit September. I'm finished with it. It's coming out end of September\n\n55:17.580 --> 55:19.580\nBut it's a\n\n55:20.700 --> 55:23.180\nYeah, you can pre-order it. It's about Hitler\n\n55:28.380 --> 55:30.860\nAnd how amazing a cookie was\n\n55:33.660 --> 55:37.340\nI've cultivated a very odd group of sociopaths\n\n55:38.460 --> 55:40.460\nThat's true\n\n55:40.460 --> 55:45.980\nThe title for your book early. Yes, it's called super you super. Yes, and uh, Hannah dance partlow who is here in the audience\n\n55:45.980 --> 55:49.900\nYes, all the illustrations for it. She fucking killed it so hard\n\n55:51.100 --> 55:52.780\nand is amazing\n\n55:52.780 --> 55:54.780\nand yeah, the book is a\n\n55:55.020 --> 55:56.300\nJust a funny\n\n55:56.300 --> 56:00.940\nSelf-esteem guide for young women to like women my age essentially and like a self-improvement guy\n\n56:00.940 --> 56:03.900\nDo you know of any other self-esteem guides for young women?\n\n56:04.380 --> 56:08.140\nHonestly, I I did look and I've read a few that are like adjacent\n\n56:08.140 --> 56:14.460\nBut I didn't see any that weren't I didn't see any that any that were marketed towards like rookie age because I also write for rookie\n\n56:15.260 --> 56:21.660\nLike teen like teenage late early 20s late. Can you talk about just talk about self-esteem and young women while I\n\n56:21.980 --> 56:23.980\nTurn my mic down\n\n56:24.140 --> 56:27.740\nBecause I don't want to mansplain and I don't want to but I think this is so important\n\n56:28.140 --> 56:32.940\nYou're clearly the one to shepherd this flock. Well, I that's a that's a tall order\n\n56:32.940 --> 56:40.140\nWell, you are you are somebody who definitely like make your compassion and you're the combination of your compassion and your\n\n56:40.380 --> 56:42.380\nVulnerability and your wisdom\n\n56:42.380 --> 56:48.060\nMakes me and I'm sure tons of women in this audience feel so good about themselves. Thanks everybody say\n\n56:49.980 --> 56:50.940\nA few weeks ago\n\n56:50.940 --> 56:57.100\nI was leaving like a like a pretty disheartening meeting and I saw that you were on a podcast where you talked about your fears\n\n56:57.500 --> 57:01.580\nAnd I was like, oh, I have to which is called terrified. Yeah, Dave Ross is yeah, that's a good one\n\n57:01.580 --> 57:06.780\nYeah, but I was like, I have to hear Emily talk about what she's afraid of because I feel so terrible and my podcast wasn't\n\n57:06.860 --> 57:09.580\nDownloading fast enough and I was sitting in my car just crying\n\n57:10.460 --> 57:12.620\nBut then I was like, oh, you're fine\n\n57:16.860 --> 57:21.740\nI'll say you can just call me we have each other's numbers. Just call me next time. Really? Yeah, of course\n\n57:21.740 --> 57:29.900\nI'm so I'm so excited about this. Tell me about your book. Well, uh, uh, talk about your book\n\n57:33.260 --> 57:35.260\nYou have 20 seconds, okay\n\n57:36.060 --> 57:41.820\nAbout unicorns and uh, I I just I hated myself a great deal when I was younger\n\n57:41.900 --> 57:44.620\nI had a lot of self-loathing a lot of self-hatred self-hatred\n\n57:44.940 --> 57:51.100\nboth for real reasons and for reasons that I created and then would not stop thinking about and I\n\n57:51.100 --> 57:57.820\nI I tried to think of what would have helped me when I was a teenager and super angry and super goth and not able\n\n57:58.460 --> 58:02.300\nNot that being goth is bad. Not that any of this is bad, but I this is where I was\n\n58:02.940 --> 58:06.380\nHow goth did you get goth as fuck? You have no idea\n\n58:07.100 --> 58:12.300\nYou have no idea her throwback thursday her throwback thursday game is tight\n\n58:12.300 --> 58:24.380\nIt was pretty tight, uh, so I essentially like it kind of goes through like\n\n58:24.940 --> 58:30.460\nJust kind of getting you on your own team and understanding that you have to be on your own fucking team\n\n58:30.540 --> 58:37.100\nBecause nobody else is going to be and they can be but how do you get a team? You are a team. You're already a team\n\n58:37.100 --> 58:42.300\nYou're already there and just like kind of raising your awareness of what you're doing\n\n58:42.700 --> 58:47.500\nSo that for so long I just kind of functioned on autopilot and this autopilot was like, I hate myself. I'm horrible\n\n58:47.500 --> 58:50.620\nI hate myself. I'm horrible and just at some point stopping and being like\n\n58:51.020 --> 58:57.420\nI'm doing this to myself and my life's just going by like either way if I spend my time hating myself or if I spend my time\n\n58:58.140 --> 59:02.700\nLearning to like myself in any capacity. It's happening either way. There's nothing I can do about it\n\n59:02.700 --> 59:09.420\nYeah, deep deep cut down. Hey guys, you guys have to either talk softer or not. Yeah\n\n59:10.460 --> 59:15.180\nHe has a very resonant voice. Yeah, it's not your fault. You're whispering, but I can feel it in my balls\n\n59:17.820 --> 59:19.420\nKind of vibrates in there\n\n59:19.420 --> 59:22.460\nYeah, so tend your own garden manage your own buttons\n\n59:22.860 --> 59:27.420\nYou are in charge of your own experience if no matter how racist misogynist\n\n59:28.140 --> 59:29.340\nhurtful\n\n59:29.340 --> 59:36.380\nVendictive unhealthy unbalanced in need of fixing your opponent is no matter what is happening to you\n\n59:36.620 --> 59:41.180\nIt's fine to have reactions to it. Absolutely, but you are\n\n59:41.900 --> 59:47.020\nYou're driving this boat you even if you decide not to make decisions. That's a fucking decision\n\n59:47.340 --> 59:49.340\nSo like just start\n\n59:49.420 --> 59:56.300\nLike stopping on autopilot start having intentionality behind what you're doing like even if that means that you that doesn't mean that you have to make\n\n59:56.300 --> 01:00:02.140\nLike healthy choices at all, but like the buttons thing know what the fucking buttons are know what your buttons are and know\n\n01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:06.460\nWhat presses them and what doesn't and then if you want to pick someone who pushes all the bad ones\n\n01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.260\nYou're picking them\n\n01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:13.900\nBut acknowledge that you are choosing them because you want those buttons pushed for some reason instead of like the world's just like happening to me\n\n01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:15.580\nIt's not you're making it happen\n\n01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:20.940\nEven if by making it happen you're kind of giving up all control and deciding the universe is just out to get me\n\n01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:26.380\nRight. I mean and and and always always always as an overriding thing\n\n01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:30.460\nIt's like you're always going to fuck up in that regard a thousand times\n\n01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.500\nYou're going to fuck that up in a thousand times. You can you can bring it back\n\n01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:40.220\nBut if to the extent that you are honest about yourself your experience your own shit\n\n01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.540\nYou're feeling including like walking away from somebody that's making you uncomfortable\n\n01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:51.740\nUm not engaging somebody when the only thing at stake is you being right as opposed to being happy. Yep. Um the the\n\n01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.900\nYou that actually in my very very short experience\n\n01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:01.660\nSince bothering to go to therapy and start learning this shit. It's like I feel the world around me changing or maybe\n\n01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:07.020\nYeah, or maybe I'm just as I said before maybe I'm just creating a fucking delusional bubble around me\n\n01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.820\nBut if everyone created that same delusional bubble there would be no room left for fucking\n\n01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:18.060\nLike nomads like everyone would be walking around on this big bubble where they insisted on their own comfort\n\n01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.180\nNot to the herd of anyone else, but just insisting on their own comfort and safety\n\n01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:30.940\nYeah, and I think it's important because it seems like we're in a culture where confidence in women is seen as arrogance a lot\n\n01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:37.820\nI think in guys it's sort of of arrogance and guys it's sort of valued whereas in women it's not like\n\n01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:44.140\nUm that Amy Schumer sketch where she's like everyone they're like these scientists and they're all like apologizing all the time\n\n01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:50.220\nUh that sketch is fucking good. It's so genius and hard work. I didn't even get it until halfway through and it was just goddamn brilliant\n\n01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.460\nYeah, it's because we're dudes\n\n01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:58.380\nYeah, we did better. You're like I'm watching footage from a thing. That's that's how brilliant that sketch is\n\n01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.420\nYeah, like men watch it and they're like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.820\nLet the moderator talk ladies\n\n01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.900\nOh\n\n01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.140\nBy that's a joke. I get it. Anyway\n\n01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.260\nPushed one of the wrong buttons there\n\n01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:22.300\nBut but I think that's why it's it's important and I know you and you you don't talk super you the idea is that\n\n01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:27.740\nIt's like about figuring out what the best version of yourself right now is and then figuring out how to get there\n\n01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:34.220\nIt's just becoming becoming your own superhero. Yeah, it's very vaguely superhero themed but kind of in a it's a very loose\n\n01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:39.260\nUh kind of theme but yeah, that is kind of the theme of it. I think they kind of like like like overarching like\n\n01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.580\nI'm obsessed with like boiling things down to their most simplistic goal. Oh, shit. We totally look how healthy we've become\n\n01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.740\nWe're two minutes past 9 11\n\n01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:52.540\nWe didn't even celebrate it yet the whole front row saw and there was just a general wrestling intention\n\n01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.100\nUm, I think it's it's almost like if there was a if you could try to boil everything down to this overarching thing\n\n01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.100\nIt has something to do with\n\n01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.100\nUh\n\n01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:10.380\nSeeing past like what's right in front of you to like a more distant goal. Yeah, and actually making distant goals\n\n01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.060\nThat's your bat signal the actual that's the thing they're going towards\n\n01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:20.940\nWhat how you use your fork and how you interact with your uncle and how you tweet and how you\n\n01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:26.540\nIf you if you don't view like five feet in front of you is how you should react five feet in front of you\n\n01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:31.340\nIf you if you instead go what I want is 15 feet in front of me. I'm gonna\n\n01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.820\nBase everything five feet in front of me on and then asking yourself\n\n01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:40.300\nIs what I'm doing right now getting me the thing that's 15 feet in front of me that I want and if it is okay\n\n01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:45.020\nIf it's not I gotta change it rather than just like just doing this do us doing this. Hopefully I'll get to that thing\n\n01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.220\nHopefully I'll get to that thing\n\n01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:57.020\nNo set the thing that you need and you want and then which is called being impeccable with your word and you all mocked me\n\n01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.020\nThe four agreements\n\n01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.300\nName all four real fast name the four agreements are\n\n01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.740\nDon't take it personally. Don't take anything personally. Don't take anything personally\n\n01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.100\nBaby come on\n\n01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.420\nI'm trying to tell people about the four agreements\n\n01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.620\nBe impeccable with your word, okay\n\n01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.460\nFuck I know the shitty one is do your best\n\n01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.980\nThat's the dumb one. You're like, okay, whatever the fuck that means. What's the other one? What's the other one god damn it?\n\n01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.700\nNo, we're not all white. That's not one of the agreements\n\n01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:38.460\nThat's not one of the agreements. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Don't make assumptions. That's actually one that needs more like study\n\n01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:42.460\nWhat is this you came up with these?\n\n01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:46.940\nKind of Aaron Aaron Aaron found this book in high school called the four agreements\n\n01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.100\nself-help book\n\n01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.100\nAnd we we and uh\n\n01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:58.220\nTotal tech law Derek waters. We were talking we were we landed on it by talking. We were talking about like fan interaction\n\n01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:03.020\nActually, we were talking about like how like how it always goes great\n\n01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:09.180\nAnd usually and like how sometimes it goes wrong and how it goes wrong. We were talking about ourselves as fans of other people\n\n01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:13.980\nLike if you get into the elevator with somebody you admire like we were talking about like what what what happens in those moments\n\n01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:19.980\nthose supercharged moments of talking to a stranger and uh, you know, but also don't know at all\n\n01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:23.020\nYeah, and you want to make an impression and blah blah blah and all this stuff\n\n01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:29.100\nI somehow from that discussion we landed some Aaron brought up like oh, well, it's one of the four agreements\n\n01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:34.060\nDon't take it personally and it was like holy shit. Oh god. Jesus Christ. That's everything\n\n01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:40.060\nSo it's this it's it's a it's a fun little book from a while ago. It takes two hours\n\n01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.500\nto listen to\n\n01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:47.340\nUh, let's get it up there. But the uh, but then I I tried to introduce these fucking assholes to\n\n01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:52.940\nThey were not having it. They're like they they think the first agreement is that we're all light\n\n01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:57.100\nPaget Brewster made a mockery of it\n\n01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:03.180\nJust because I've only listened to a half hour of it. Apparently. I'm not an authority\n\n01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.500\nBut I I haven't read it since college, but I totally don't remember the light\n\n01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:13.740\nI should have it. That's a neat. It's the first part. He says we're all light and you're all we're all smoke\n\n01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.740\nWait, one of the four agreements is we're all light\n\n01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:25.500\nNo, you wouldn't know that from that from that podcast because Dan talked with 30 minutes about how we're all light\n\n01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.940\nAnd you're smoke and it's all a dream. We all live in a dream\n\n01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:34.540\nIt's the same it's the same as Plato's shadows on the on the smoke. No, it's not the same as Plato's fucking shadows\n\n01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.980\nSo smoke is bad and light is good. Everything that's happening right now\n\n01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.620\nis my dream\n\n01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:43.500\nThat's that's let's bring Padgett Brewster out everybody. That's\n\n01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:48.700\nThat's one of the four agreements. No, that's not one of the you're the genius\n\n01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:55.660\nThat everything that happens is our like it's through a filter of our emotional experiences. That's very true\n\n01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.140\nYes, okay. That makes sense. So there's a technique that makes sense\n\n01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.940\nI would I would be pretty certain that if that author had a could add a fifth agreement\n\n01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.020\nIt would be you should read the whole fucking book\n\n01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.340\nOh\n\n01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:15.660\nBut it's his fault. Don't do all four agreements in the first half hour. That's true. You gotta read that. The first half hour is all about smoke and light and mirrors and shit\n\n01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.460\nSo it's a magic book\n\n01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.780\nWhen did the dragon show? I don't hear any of this. This is all happening in a dream. I don't care\n\n01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:33.980\nEmily, uh, I have I have several teenage family members. Where is is your book cool to is there is there's some sex stuff\n\n01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:38.860\nYeah, but teenagers should know about sex stuff. Well, Judy Bloom took care of that shit\n\n01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:45.020\nAre you there god? Yeah, uh, it's totally appropriate for teenagers. I would say and uh, I do talk about that\n\n01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:51.420\nUh, specifically that you all you view everything through the light of your experiences. I try to like if you back everything out\n\n01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:55.340\nYeah, I'm agreement. I'm in agreement. Just because she said the word light in a sentence\n\n01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.060\nIt sounds like\n\n01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.060\nSounds like she's in agreement\n\n01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.020\nI'm in one of four\n\n01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.020\nPeople that agree with your theories on this\n\n01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:09.180\nUh, yeah, like the idea of like if you back everything out if your life was a reality show\n\n01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.580\nLike a very boring for most of you reality show\n\n01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.540\nOurs are great reality shows mind you\n\n01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:17.340\nI'm just saying everybody's life is ultimately very boring as reality show\n\n01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.740\nBut if you viewed it as a reality show and were divorced from your talking head segments of like\n\n01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.460\nWell, I can't believe he did this and he did this because he's like this this happens because I he should know that\n\n01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.580\nI don't like you just viewed the situation objectively\n\n01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:34.300\nLike that's you kind of you've got to learn to divorce that some of the shit is your shit\n\n01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.620\nAnd you can't bring it anything because the other person you're talking to doesn't have any fucking clue\n\n01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.220\nWhat you're talking head segment is because the only thing you can do is control yourself\n\n01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:49.340\nThat's a kind of cross-stitch a very beautiful thing that hopefully will be an item you can only control yourself\n\n01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.420\nYou have no control over anybody else\n\n01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.460\nwhatsoever\n\n01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.580\nSo you have to like if you're in a confrontation with someone or in a conversation\n\n01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:01.020\nAnd just realize that take yourself out of it and watch as it if it was on television because if it was\n\n01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:05.820\nYou would never you would just see two characters interacting and all you can judge is those interactions\n\n01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.980\nEverybody comes with their own baggage and their own shit\n\n01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:11.660\nAnd you would never judge the dude that was like just hanging out\n\n01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.780\nIf you if you saw if another guy was like\n\n01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.380\nIf there was just a guy going\n\n01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.300\nLike that you'd be like you wouldn't be like what a pussy. What a fucking asshole. What an idiot\n\n01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.900\nYou'd be like, I'm gonna want to learn more about that guy David Hyde Pierce\n\n01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.460\nWell, she created an illustration of a cross-stitch because I was like wouldn't it be cool\n\n01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:39.580\nIf you had like a cross-stitch like old old timey pillow or like a thing of you can only control yourself\n\n01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:43.020\nSo she made this gorgeous thing that looks just like a cross-stitch\n\n01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:46.380\nThat's a page in the book. I'm hoping we can make another thing out of\n\n01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:49.580\nIt's but yeah, we're gonna make posters out of it all these things are like\n\n01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.220\nIt's so hard to like sometimes I'll get into these\n\n01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:58.620\nTwitter things and then you're right. Nobody's gonna change. Nobody's changed their mind about anything since like the fucking 90s\n\n01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.700\nwe all\n\n01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:06.300\nWe all nobody changed so and I'll get into these fights with you. I have a new can I tell you I've adopted a troll strategy\n\n01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.380\nYes with people. I'll tell you what it is. I'm not proud of it. Actually. I love it\n\n01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:17.900\nI have a new strategy because a lot of times you'll be talking to people and they just want to it becomes a semantic argument\n\n01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:22.140\nWhere they like just want to contradict you and it's not about the meaning anymore. It's about defeating the person\n\n01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:22.940\nIt's not about anything\n\n01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.940\nYeah, it's about defeating the person\n\n01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:31.020\nFrom your 140 character tweet, they're picking one word. Yes, and I do that too. It's like, whoa, wait\n\n01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.580\nIf leather is the glue\n\n01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.420\nSo I have this new thing\n\n01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:40.300\nSo if if somebody like because I'll get people, you know, so if somebody ever like calls me indian\n\n01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:44.460\nI'm like that's racist. I'm Pakistani. I know research is hard. So I'll do that\n\n01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.060\nBut then I'll do so then at the other day I tweeted\n\n01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:53.340\nI was like, hey, my people are looking to trade bobby gendle and exchange will take literally anything\n\n01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.220\nI said that he's an indian\n\n01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:03.500\nAnd so then people will be like, um, you're Pakistani. He's indian do some research. I'm like, actually, uh, indian pakistan was the same country\n\n01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.820\nuntil 1947 so\n\n01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.860\nI know research is hard\n\n01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.220\nWhat a piece of shit\n\n01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:15.020\nI'm like, yeah, I got you coming. I got you going\n\n01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.580\nYou cannot win with kumail Nanjiani. Wait kumail\n\n01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:24.540\nAre you saying you said you laid that trap you knew people were going to say that so that you could come?\n\n01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.340\nNo, but I came up with it right then and I was like, this is great\n\n01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:32.220\nIf you call me pakistani, I can be like actually we're all kind of indian\n\n01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:37.020\nAnd if you call me indian you're racist because i'm pakistani. You really can't win. You cannot win\n\n01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:40.220\nHe's saying like the first instinct is to make people laugh to make people happy\n\n01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:43.580\nAnd then the second instinct if somebody comes back and goes like\n\n01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.460\nYou're joke. I'm not laughing at it\n\n01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:52.860\nBut I have a different spot and there's my response. So that guy if you agree to go out in the alley with that guy\n\n01:11:54.140 --> 01:12:00.140\nThe crime has been committed and what goes out on that alley is your business and it's like you're saying like, yeah, you bring out a\n\n01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.020\ncorkscrew and\n\n01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.260\nYeah, I'm not playing fair now\n\n01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:09.820\nNot playing fair because you shouldn't be out there. You shouldn't be out there. You have a water gun. I have a fucking maze\n\n01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:16.460\nDon't because you shouldn't be out there. That's a great, but we should probably talk about I mean just that that one little inkling\n\n01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.020\nthough is like the reason you go out there is\n\n01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.420\nThat's a classic example. You must you must be going connection\n\n01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:31.500\nWell, I mean that person is correcting. Oh, yes. Yes. That's what I that's they want to piece they want to be in a conversation\n\n01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.900\nThat's also no, no, no. I'm saying I'm saying the reason you go out there. I know the reason\n\n01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:40.220\nYeah, the reason the the statler and wall dwarf guys are like calling shit out\n\n01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:44.860\nWhy does kermit start engaging statler and wall dwarf? The reason is because for\n\n01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.620\nSome part of what they're saying kermit's like, you know what the muppet show is full of shit\n\n01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:58.220\nIt's just some part and it doesn't matter if it's true or not, right? But can we all acknowledge that that that's what brings us out\n\n01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:02.620\nThere into that alley. I think sometimes if I engage with the twitter troll. I'm in a bad mood\n\n01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:08.460\nI've got something that has irritated me that day and I don't want to take it out on that person or that or I can't\n\n01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.180\nSo I'm like, here's a person that will take my shit\n\n01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:19.340\nAnd I give them my shit and I fucking I have that same thing if I'm in a shitty mood like I'm never sure of my own opinions\n\n01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.660\nUh, then when I haven't gotten enough sleep\n\n01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.860\nLike he's a real bear you guys. Isn't that saying the same thing?\n\n01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:29.340\nAnd I was like, isn't it just like unconsciously? Isn't it part of you when you\n\n01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:36.140\nTo continue using that metaphor when you go out into that back alley and choose to have that person to person\n\n01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:39.740\nstiletto knife fight, which I just recently did with a dude today\n\n01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:46.940\nWhere I I always what was the meat and potatoes of that thing or is that even worth I retweeted? I'm happy to tell you\n\n01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:57.020\nI I retweeted a very funny joke by some stranger who said I would like to see a reality show where vine stars are executed\n\n01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.340\nI clicked a fucking buttons\n\n01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:06.380\nYou know retweet and and because I clicked that button then in my feed\n\n01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:11.980\nAnd remember how I said I'm so happy because I've started blocking people like twitter has been a positive experience for me\n\n01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.300\nthen this guy this this guy just\n\n01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:20.780\nThis is in my feed it goes like that's a that's a funny thing coming from a guy who let community turn into dog shit\n\n01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:27.580\nAnd and and I was like I was like unrelated, but but there's some part of what do you mean unrelated?\n\n01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.780\nYou're not related. Yes. His thing is unrelated. Yes. I thought you were gonna say unreli- god damn it. Fuck you\n\n01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.620\nYou could have posted a picture of flower and they'd be like that's a pretty flower\n\n01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:42.620\nBut obviously something's drawing me. I'm following some I'm following something. What were you following? Let's talk about it\n\n01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.100\nSo I'm following the fact that I don't think community\n\n01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:49.100\nI don't you want to disagree with him and let him know that you disagree\n\n01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:55.180\nI want to I want to I want to know that the guy who says that is definitely a bad person\n\n01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:01.980\nYou want reassurance that if someone has a bad I want to know it's not morgan freeman like logging in\n\n01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.020\nI've been like not that morgan freeman is not a piece of shit. I'm sure he is but\n\n01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:12.860\nThat guy positive or negative was trying to connect with you in some way whether or not it was good or bad\n\n01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.580\nInto your he wanted whatever's going on in his end. I'm sorry. I'm talking about\n\n01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:24.220\nCan we all acknowledge what's drawing us into these knife fights is a suspicion?\n\n01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.820\nI think\n\n01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:31.180\nMalcolm acts I really really am going into out of my jurisdiction, but I think there's a quote from\n\n01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:34.140\nSo someone just flew across the room\n\n01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.100\nI'm so curious what the next thing you have to say is someone wanted to go\n\n01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.580\nAnd it turned into\n\n01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.140\nAnd they're now they now\n\n01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.980\nAre dead because of me\n\n01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:47.500\nAnd I apologize\n\n01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500\nI'm going to assume that person's black\n\n01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:53.900\nAnd I apologize for that person.

He's got his own shit. Yeah, like you would never none of us on the stage would ever tweeted anybody\n\n01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.300\nI just thought of something horrible that I\n\n01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:55.580\nThat I was telling you about that happens to me when I'm playing Mortal Kombat with strangers online\n\n01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:01.260\nBut I'm not gonna say that reaching out to a creative and saying like well, that's great\n\n01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:06.140\nBut everything you do is terrible like that's that person's that's what do you say in Mortal Kombat?\n\n01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.420\nNo, I turned my mic off, but I think it\n\n01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:15.100\nWell, I kind of it's horrible. It's very very bad. Just say it. No, it's bad\n\n01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:20.140\nNo, come on. It's like can we make this a safe place? Is this a no judgment zone? I don't feel good about it\n\n01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:22.780\nIt's a no judgment. Okay\n\n01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.340\nDon't judge me on this. This is me at my worst\n\n01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:30.620\nAnd I say so I will play Mortal Kombat and it's just because it's one person\n\n01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:36.300\nI get like really into it and I really want to win and then some people I'm not as good as a lot of people are\n\n01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:41.340\nThey'll they'll they'll beat me and then I could tell that they're fucking shitty\n\n01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.140\nI could tell when I'm playing someone. I'm like, oh, you're a bad person\n\n01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:48.860\nNot by their skill, but by like how this spam moves and I think I'm\n\n01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:53.980\nIs there an honorable way to play? Yes. Yeah, you don't you don't spam fireballs\n\n01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:55.980\nYes, you don't spam fireball\n\n01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:00.300\nI'm fire when the fifth and that's that's that's the title\n\n01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:05.820\nMove over and over.

That's it. Scorsese. It's not possible\n\n01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:29.900\nNo, you're right. You're right. You should never scorsese spam anybody on it. It's a there's no way to prove it\n\n01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:37.100\nOh, we should all tell everyone that we're scorsese. It is so gratified never has a question anything felt I've never done that\n\n01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:39.260\nBut I feel it every now and then\n\n01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:41.660\nHe does say it out loud in our house but not on a mic\n\n01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:44.940\nHuh, wait, I thought you no I turned I I\n\n01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:49.900\nI just threw a whole museum you said we're I thought no no no\n\n01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:53.900\nI want to turn the mic on and say it, but I don't I don't do it because they'll know\n\n01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:59.020\nOh, okay, it's that fucking guy if they watch the show and that's me arrogant assuming they watch the show\n\n01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:03.500\nThat's true.

Like I know I'm high-roading though\n\n01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:15.660\nYeah, that's it the knowledge that you're high. So I think I think you have to cross it\n\n01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:18.140\nYeah, you're really going to do that. You have to cross the threshold and go like hey, man\n\n01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:23.820\nLike you have to be actually I don't do it vindictively, but I think that you guys are in a better place\n\n01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:30.860\nI do it out of like like hey like you're right.

We're all the same\n\n01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:10.540\nYou won't be able to tell pakistanis and turks apart in a lineup and if you can't you're racist\n\n01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:16.460\nYou're not gonna win this one jeff. I'm sorry. He's got a lot of practice. I'm sorry. Go ahead. What about so\n\n01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:21.100\nUh turks and portuguese people love the show hate the show hate the world. I think they love it\n\n01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:27.100\nThey love it, but that I keep apparently I not like the other jeff davis keeps killing off characters\n\n01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.300\nThey love or the people that they ship they were jiggies giant. Oh\n\n01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.660\nI'm not shipping the right characters\n\n01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:37.180\nSo it's like we want more of these two characters to fuck on teen wolf\n\n01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:40.060\nAnd if not, I will come to your house and viscerate you\n\n01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:44.780\nI this this is so I had to go on google translate and to find out what i'm fucking being threatened with\n\n01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:50.380\nAnd when I hit when I when I pull off a giant block of text and to put it into translate. I'm like, oh\n\n01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:56.700\nWell in all fairness to the portuguese that's just shipping like\n\n01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:03.100\nThere's a lot of portuguese portuguese people that are just watching teen wolf and being like wow. He's a teen and a wolf\n\n01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:08.300\nI I was recently the portuguese shippers. You're the ones that are finding you now. You're being racist\n\n01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:12.540\nI was recently listening to a podcast that I very very much enjoy that\n\n01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:18.860\nI will not name in this moment that was talking about silicon valley and then brought up Kumail and someone said\n\n01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:23.660\nWell, and yeah, he's pakistani and someone said no, no, no, you're being racist. He's indian\n\n01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.940\nAnd well, they are\n\n01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.740\nNo, or are they? Yeah\n\n01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:35.660\nOnly time we'll tell you it depends on whether they like the show or not. Yeah. Yeah. Did they like the show?\n\n01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.380\nYeah\n\n01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:44.700\nYeah, yeah, yeah, no my no Mary said because they it was in the context of them talking about like feminism on the show\n\n01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.540\nBut they really love the show and they think you're great\n\n01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:50.140\nAnd then someone's like no, no, no, I know him. He's indian and I like\n\n01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:51.980\nI\n\n01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:55.820\nI got really fired up about it for some reason and not out of anger\n\n01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.660\nBut I was like, maybe I'll make a fake account and maybe I'll say oh my god\n\n01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:04.700\nYeah, and maybe I'll say you're wrong and do an egg. There's an emotion\n\n01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:08.940\nMy face started to smush and just like a flat land\n\n01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:11.020\nI think there's an emotion that we haven't named yet\n\n01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:14.860\nWhich is like it's like when you have knowledge that the other person doesn't and you know\n\n01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:19.020\nYou're right and they don't know you're right and you're getting ready to drop the fucking hammer\n\n01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:23.900\nThat is such a good feeling and I don't there's no work for it. And I'm sure the germans have one\n\n01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.300\nBut I love that feeling\n\n01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:34.220\nYeah, but the problem is even that is subjective because you know the germans thought they had good knowledge about something\n\n01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:37.420\nAnd turned out they weren't right about it. They they called that monday\n\n01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:44.620\nWell, did you hear did you hear the this american life that came out a couple weeks ago where they talked about how when people who are\n\n01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:49.740\nFaced with an alternative view about an opinion that might make no sense\n\n01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:55.660\nLike if I say no, the world is flat and someone comes to them and says no, here's here's a satellite picture of the earth\n\n01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:01.340\nThey're more likely to double down on there. It's confirmation bias. It's called confirmation bias then to like\n\n01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:03.500\nThen to believe what you say. So we're all\n\n01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.380\nConfirmation bias is just the idea that once you have an idea and you're like, this is correct\n\n01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.020\nYou'll only seek out information that like\n\n01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:17.180\nReinforces the belief you have and if you get any information that doesn't reinforce it. You're like, well, that's completely wrong\n\n01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:25.660\nAnd I think that's fucking great news. Don't you because no no, I mean for real like that is the\n\n01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:30.460\nGod particle that we've been looking for because that lets us all off the hook\n\n01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.460\nLook, don't you fucking start?\n\n01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:37.260\nYou'll see I don't understand. No, just don't they already found a bad part. I'm about to explain it\n\n01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:44.540\nWe spent hours writing the show it'll come back or if if it is instinctive to primates to do that\n\n01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:50.940\nWhich I would applaud because primates should not automatically just go. Oh, I think I'll do this\n\n01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.940\nOh, you said that I'll do that\n\n01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:57.740\nIf that is a thing that we have to overcome then we all get to just say\n\n01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:02.620\nOkay, okay, that's a thing that happens to me because I experience it every fucking day\n\n01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:09.340\nIt when when I read an essay about the misogyny of pirates of the caribbean 2\n\n01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.900\nBeyond the pearl of the so sexist\n\n01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.460\nIt's like because\n\n01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:17.580\nIt doesn't help that the person is not funny is never funny\n\n01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.740\nAnyone who's going to write that article is like a fucking like like just joyless\n\n01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.980\nThey're not one of the good ones\n\n01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:26.460\nThey're not one of the good ones\n\n01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:30.380\nThey're not one of the good ones, but but overriding that is like my sense of like, you know\n\n01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:36.140\nI always always feel that checkered that hinge that safety valve that goes like\n\n01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:40.380\nOh, are you telling me that now this is going to be that fuck that?\n\n01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.820\nWhere's it end? What is it end? What are we going to do?\n\n01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.940\nWhat does it take for you? Is michael sarah going to play shaft?\n\n01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.980\nUh, that would be great. No one's calling for that. Uh, that would be so great\n\n01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:57.420\nUh, what what what does it take for you to change your mind about something generally?\n\n01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:02.620\nUh, uh to be fucking honest with you the reason for my, uh\n\n01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:10.620\nEnthusiasm for you. It takes it takes acquiescence. It takes it takes positivity. It takes that's why I was so\n\n01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:14.140\nadamant about like what what can we what can we figure out about?\n\n01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:21.580\nLike the way you approach things because I have never in my in the in the years that I have known you I'm\n\n01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:28.780\nI'm positive that if I was ever going to exhibit characteristics or thoughts or ideals or semantic\n\n01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:35.660\nFlurbs that that would possibly trigger you. I've definitely probably threw them toward you at some point\n\n01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.980\nI'm sure they've floated down\n\n01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:44.700\nSo I'm sure you and you've never made it my problem and you've never you've never all never capitulated\n\n01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:48.700\nYou've never we're not we don't we don't we don't drink together every night\n\n01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:55.820\nWe're not like blood brothers and pinky swear brothers and and let's let's agree to to alter each other's reality brothers\n\n01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:58.700\nYou're just you're a virtual stranger to me\n\n01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:03.980\nWith that that just is impeccable with their word\n\n01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.060\nLeave it then\n\n01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:14.460\nAnd and and invites people upward upward like like when you say\n\n01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:20.220\nLike here is a list of ways that you can tell people that they're a good person without telling them how they look\n\n01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:25.500\nAnd you there is nothing in that communicate that suggests to you\n\n01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:31.740\nThat you're a defective unit. We like we like you so much. There is everything in that communicate that suggests to you that you\n\n01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:35.820\nHave an ability to repair yourself and and evolve upward\n\n01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:39.500\nSo you always feel like you're winning in video games\n\n01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:44.060\nWe wouldn't play video games if every like you're doing this wrong you fuck off\n\n01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.060\nYeah, you you fucked up start over\n\n01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:52.620\nWhat happens in video games and the reason people are addicted to them is because that is the effect that video games have on people\n\n01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:58.700\nThey go they go congratulations on running across this log a thousand times. That's a very good analogy\n\n01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:05.900\nThat's actually a really great analogy. Here's a here's a diagram you can use to make a sword that kills ghouls better\n\n01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.220\nYeah\n\n01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:13.740\nThere's nothing no one ever says you're killing ghouls wrong. I'm gonna rape you\n\n01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:17.260\nThat's because I'm playing you use the word rape as a metaphor you\n\n01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.660\nI'm gonna stop listening to your podcast\n\n01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:25.180\nThat's so true because I'm playing Arkham Knight right now and it was so horrible\n\n01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:28.780\nIt's like uh, you're batman and you can't find your way out of this police station\n\n01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.340\nYou're fucking batman\n\n01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:33.740\nWhat are you doing? It's not like that\n\n01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:38.140\nNo, but that's actually what Emily is really good at and what you said earlier is dying\n\n01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.700\nI feel like everybody just probably\n\n01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.340\nWe have some bad news Emily. You died in 9-11\n\n01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.780\nYour chest results just came back\n\n01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:50.780\nYou died in 9-11\n\n01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:54.460\nWhat you're really good at is keeping your eye on and you didn't work in the buildings\n\n01:32:54.460 --> 01:33:01.820\nYeah, why was I there? You were one of the pilots. What do you think the fucking arc is?\n\n01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.540\nI love my dad. Okay, go ahead\n\n01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:11.900\nWell, I think you is always keeping your eye on the prize and getting what you want to get out of an interaction\n\n01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:17.660\nFor instance, like if I'm uh, if we're supposed to fly on a flight like and this really happened and they Emily\n\n01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:22.780\nThey checked Emily and they're like, oh no, we bumped you to the next flight and I'm like that is I'll get like self righteous\n\n01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:25.900\nI'll get like this is wrong. This is immoral\n\n01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.500\nThis is not good\n\n01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:31.500\nFucking fix it and Emily's like Emily will befriend them and talk to them nicely\n\n01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.540\nI dare you to be better\n\n01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:36.860\nShe says and then get them to and her like this was a couple weeks ago\n\n01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:40.620\nEmily was supposed to have some surgery and they called and they were like, oh, we can't do it anymore\n\n01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:44.460\nAnd I taken the week off she taken the week off to do it and I was like give me their number\n\n01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:47.820\nI will talk to them and she's like that's the worst idea\n\n01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.780\nYeah, I have an HBO show\n\n01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.780\nI am pretty good\n\n01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:57.820\nYou're supposed to cut my wife open and fix her insides and I had to meet you do it when you're supposed to do it\n\n01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.180\nAnd I don't care if you're stressed out or angry while you're cutting her open\n\n01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.180\nWhat Emily did was yeah\n\n01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:07.980\nYou don't want waiters to spit in your food and you don't want the doctor angry. You want the performing surgery\n\n01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:10.220\nBut what Emily did was she's like, okay\n\n01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:14.300\nHung up the phone was like angry and sort of dealt with it and then called back\n\n01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:17.820\nBefriended the person on the phone and got the job\n\n01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:24.220\nYeah, it got it. It happened. My technique never works. No not once and you keep doing it\n\n01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:26.780\nIt's calling it a technique is really overstated\n\n01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:29.740\nI have to pull you away from stuff\n\n01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:35.260\nI have to like pull you away from yelling and screaming and raging it. Well, I don't do that all the time\n\n01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:37.260\nCertainly not. I but I don't\n\n01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:39.500\nNo, no, just when things fuck up. Well\n\n01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:43.260\nYou make me sound like a horrible person. No, you're a wonderful person\n\n01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:49.660\nIt's like when something happens that I feel like I have this thing where I want everyone to do their job\n\n01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:55.340\nRight, and if they don't do it, right, then I get like I'm I get a little indignant and I get self-righteous\n\n01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.940\nAnd I'm like, this is your job because that's always what gets you the results\n\n01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:03.980\nBecause you feel like if you don't do something about something people are gonna fuck you\n\n01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:10.140\nYes, I have that thing since the kid because I was you know, bullied as a kid. I'm like this fucking person's bullying me\n\n01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:14.860\nI'm not gonna take it anymore. Yeah, but we don't know that world anymore. Nobody ever\n\n01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:20.140\nThere's there's examples of fucking like dumb archetypes of like, hey, listen, you fucking\n\n01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:23.020\nI'm gonna do\n\n01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.980\nYeah, it's it's primarily fictional the\n\n01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:33.340\nAnd the important thing is if you start to apply this idea of like, oh, actually, I'm just gonna be chill\n\n01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.980\nIt's important to note like\n\n01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.260\nyou're\n\n01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:42.380\nOnce you're chill, you're gonna get you're gonna there's gonna be all kinds of people getting away with all kinds of shit\n\n01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:46.780\nYes, but letting them get away with it and walking around them walking away from them\n\n01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:51.020\nYou're gonna end up getting farther faster so much further than anybody\n\n01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:55.420\nI literally picture it like the sims like have you guys played the sims come on\n\n01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:59.500\nCome on sims people where you at where you have those like gauges over your head\n\n01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:03.100\nThere's little like bars over your head that tell you like this is how hungry you are the cell whatever\n\n01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:09.820\nLike that's how much power you have and for me to like let someone else make me that angry over something that they're\n\n01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:14.860\nThey genuinely can't do anything about that's me giving them my power. I don't want to give them my fucking power\n\n01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:18.940\nThat's mine. You don't get to have that. Do you want to give up your ease is what my therapist gets egg\n\n01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.780\nDo you want to give up your ease?\n\n01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:26.300\nYeah, like you've worked hard to be at ease. Do you want to give that to this fucking guy?\n\n01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.220\nThis person on twitter doesn't deserve it\n\n01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:32.220\nThis like this poor lady who is just giving me bad news that the doctor's office didn't deserve it\n\n01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:34.380\nAnd also if I befriended her she helped me out\n\n01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:39.580\nBut uh, I always think of it like you have a certain amount of cake that you have to give to people\n\n01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.700\nYou have cake you have delicious wonderful cake you can give it out\n\n01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:48.060\nBut if you're not interacting with people that give you eggs and milk and flour and vanilla\n\n01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.700\nYou don't get to make any more\n\n01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.740\nCake analogies\n\n01:36:54.620 --> 01:37:01.580\nEven better. That's a good metaphor. I like that a lot. Yeah, so you can run out of fucking cake if you're not hanging out with me\n\n01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.580\nYou don't want to do that\n\n01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:09.020\nYeah, that's great. That's terrifying actually. I'm I'm afraid now. I have a lot of phone calls to make\n\n01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:15.180\nTwo two egg egg people and flour people first of all Aaron. Sorry\n\n01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:20.380\nGive me more eggs. I don't want to jinx things, but this is not only my favorite episode of the podcast\n\n01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.780\nThis is my been the favorite two hours of my life\n\n01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:25.980\nthe we should also like\n\n01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:32.220\nChristian it with uh, that felt that felt fake just you know, that felt real fake\n\n01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.780\nNo more.
