00:00.000 --> 00:06.300
I like to meet you when I lose all control

00:06.300 --> 00:12.800
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, and the Meltdown, NerdMelt, MeltyMelt, Showroom Meltdown

00:12.800 --> 00:17.300
Parment Town is now in session

00:17.300 --> 00:21.800
I like to meet you when I lose all control

00:21.800 --> 00:24.800
Your Game Master is always a Spencer Quintenden

00:24.800 --> 00:44.100
Ad

00:44.100 --> 00:49.300
K. S.

00:49.300 --> 00:54.040
Chris, can we finish that conversation?

00:54.040 --> 00:56.800
You, should I go like this?

01:00.920 --> 01:02.260
Oh, okay.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.960
And I don't want to be an asshole,

01:04.960 --> 01:08.120
but why not put the mic there?

01:08.120 --> 01:08.960
Oh!

01:14.960 --> 01:17.580
It's only for my edification.

01:17.580 --> 01:20.320
Yeah, this is for the cameras as we continue

01:20.320 --> 01:27.160
to ruin the audio podcast with our horrible cameras

01:27.160 --> 01:31.920
and our need, you know, video killed the radio star.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.000
Video podcasting is killing, but you

01:34.000 --> 01:37.280
used to just tune in for the soothing sound of my lullaby

01:37.280 --> 01:39.440
voice.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.480
Just focus on the resonating chamber

01:41.480 --> 01:43.360
of my velociraptor skull.

01:43.360 --> 01:48.440
Uh, uh, uh, anyways.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.640
So, God, the earth is changing underneath our feet, Jeff.

01:51.640 --> 01:56.280
The imagine telling your 25-year-old self, say,

01:56.280 --> 01:57.720
hey, I'm Jeff Davis.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.800
It's the year 2015.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.280
I'm sending you a message from the future.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.880
The Supreme Court has just determined

02:04.880 --> 02:08.160
that everyone in the whole country, marriage is just marriage.

02:08.160 --> 02:08.960
It's all it is.

02:08.960 --> 02:09.460
Just.

02:09.460 --> 02:21.400
And Canada did it 10 years before, but that's not the point.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.040
Oh, yeah, well, no, we're America.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.040
We're first in war, 21st in marriage, right?

02:27.040 --> 02:30.640
But it's just beneath Ireland.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.920
But also, oh, yeah, also, so you wouldn't even

02:33.920 --> 02:36.440
know what a podcast was then, but you're sending a message

02:36.440 --> 02:38.080
saying, the president of the United States

02:38.080 --> 02:42.200
is going to be a guest at Marc Maron's podcast.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.560
He's going to say the n-word.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.120
And he's going to sing Amazing Grace at a funeral.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.160
That was fucking, that was rad.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.160
That was great.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.400
I just heard about that.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.400
He can sing, too?

02:55.400 --> 02:57.960
Oh, I mean, pretty good for a president,

02:57.960 --> 02:59.720
but I feel like with some classes,

02:59.720 --> 03:00.920
he could really pull it out.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.280
I haven't heard.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.560
I wouldn't say it's perfect, but he

03:07.560 --> 03:09.840
was doing an acapella, and he was doing it in a key.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.680
What I love is the organist, I think, on the choir finds him

03:13.680 --> 03:17.720
and misses just by like a half note, and Obama finds it.

03:17.720 --> 03:22.280
Like, the organist puts it in a key,

03:22.280 --> 03:24.360
and then they all start singing along.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.520
But there was that moment when he started singing,

03:26.520 --> 03:28.920
and everyone's like, stand up, the fucking president

03:28.920 --> 03:31.080
is singing right now.

03:31.080 --> 03:34.920
We are going to miss this guy so much.

03:34.920 --> 03:41.240
The lame duck Obama is the fucking FDR of the 21st century.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.680
He's amazing.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.280
He's just like, by the way, here's how I really feel.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.320
And we're like, oh, yeah, that's why I voted for you

03:49.320 --> 03:50.440
a long time ago.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.280
He had a very good week, and not just he, but lots of people.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.240
And he didn't spike a lot of footballs

03:56.240 --> 03:58.640
and do a lot of end zone dancing.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.880
He just kept it.

03:59.880 --> 04:00.760
He's very classy.

04:00.760 --> 04:01.800
He's very charming, I think.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.280
That's why.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.760
I mean, but think about this guy.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.040
So OK, so this N-word thing, have we even

04:08.040 --> 04:17.160
clear on this, do we understand that this notion of he

04:17.160 --> 04:22.280
of all people, these thoughts that start with he of all people,

04:22.280 --> 04:26.760
that that's the same thing as, do we

04:26.760 --> 04:29.880
understand that politically and strategically Obama is less

04:29.880 --> 04:33.640
allowed to talk about race than any pre-existing president,

04:33.640 --> 04:35.840
that he has been targeted by more racism,

04:35.840 --> 04:38.760
that his Twitter account can't say, hey,

04:38.760 --> 04:40.120
sign up for health care without.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.520
I always click on it because I'm always fascinated.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.720
It's always the N-word.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.080
It's always somewhere in there, literally just the N-word.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.160
Just like someone just wants to remind him.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.800
Just wants to tell him.

04:53.800 --> 05:00.480
And people that want him to speak out and make everything

05:00.480 --> 05:04.880
right at every time in this changing age when everything

05:04.880 --> 05:07.200
we're finding out about racially hot things

05:07.200 --> 05:10.040
like the president of the United States is not

05:10.040 --> 05:14.560
supposed to necessarily come down to every city

05:14.560 --> 05:17.720
and make a big speech and raise a big stink about everything

05:17.720 --> 05:23.000
that's going wrong, let alone the first black president

05:23.000 --> 05:24.600
of the United States.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.760
Every time that guy speaks up about anything racial,

05:27.760 --> 05:29.880
people just fucking jump.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.200
And so he's been strategic, and he's been practical,

05:32.200 --> 05:33.760
and now he doesn't have to be.

05:33.760 --> 05:40.160
And he goes into Marc Maron's garage and fucking lays it down.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.520
And rounding out the triumvirate of, holy shit,

05:43.520 --> 05:45.120
the dream is coming true.

05:45.120 --> 05:50.160
The LAPD is now killing middle-aged white men.

05:50.160 --> 05:54.240
No, that's also horrible.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.400
I hope his family isn't a fan.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.800
Is there something in the news today that I don't know about?

06:00.800 --> 06:03.200
No, not in the way we talked about last week.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.840
It's old news, but it's also like, what the fuck is going on?

06:06.840 --> 06:09.480
They took these cops, the shot that got.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.240
I'm going to lay my cards on the table.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.240
Let's just go to the racist place.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.760
Like, let me be a white racist.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.640
Let me, please, let me.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.800
So that we don't have to worry about that anymore.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.680
Like, is Dan being racist?

06:22.680 --> 06:23.800
Is he being insensitive?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.440
Let me be insensitive and racist so that we can cut

06:26.440 --> 06:28.840
straight through to what's really disturbing

06:28.840 --> 06:33.600
about a white 48-year-old guy holding a towel,

06:33.600 --> 06:36.920
getting gunned down by cops who, according to their training,

06:36.920 --> 06:40.680
are supposed to shoot you if you hold a towel up.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.440
Why aren't towels illegal?

06:47.440 --> 06:51.080
Why aren't cops illegal?

06:51.080 --> 06:54.640
This is getting extreme.

06:54.640 --> 06:59.080
And if it takes a white guy to make white people go, oh, OK,

06:59.080 --> 07:06.720
deal breaker, it's not because we think that the black people

07:06.720 --> 07:07.560
deserve it.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.080
It's because secretly white liberals are going,

07:11.080 --> 07:13.600
I think that the racist part of white liberals

07:13.600 --> 07:19.240
is the part of us that goes vigilante about race relations.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.800
That's what white people do.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.120
We're like, I'm racist.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.400
We're born racist, as you know.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.320
That's the one racist thing I'll accept.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.400
White people are born racist.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.280
The racist part of us, like, when

07:36.280 --> 07:39.200
we hear about these cop brutality stuff,

07:39.200 --> 07:41.680
you know that part of us is going like, yeah,

07:41.680 --> 07:43.000
but that's got to be a hard job.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.320
Dressed like Hitler youth, like walking around

07:50.320 --> 07:53.880
a bunch of black people, that's got to be tough.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.520
You know that we think that.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.840
You know that we think that.

07:56.840 --> 08:04.160
And then we go, naughty white guy, naughty white cop, naughty.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.400
Just because it's hard.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.640
You have to control yourself.

08:07.640 --> 08:13.080
And then the fucking 48-year-old white jogger

08:13.080 --> 08:15.160
with the towel gets shot, and you're like, wait a minute.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.560
How is my brain functioning?

08:16.560 --> 08:21.280
This is all, like, what the fuck?

08:21.280 --> 08:22.120
This is insane.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.760
The system is, I don't know what to do about it,

08:24.760 --> 08:30.880
but if you can't hold a towel and you can't be a white guy.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.520
All sympathies.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.880
I'm not going to let you push my buttons, and I'm not.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.440
I know that I'm making sense.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.000
That's what you're pointing with this, though, right?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.480
I guess you can skim that fucking hot button shit

08:42.480 --> 08:46.120
off the top of what I'm saying, but what I'm really trying to do,

08:46.120 --> 08:50.840
I think you could take a deep ladle full of that.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.560
I said at the top of this conversation, I said,

08:52.560 --> 08:53.840
let's be racist.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.080
Let's go to the racist list.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.400
And you said, let me be racist.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.440
Let's all be racist.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.040
A fine distinction.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.480
Let me be racist.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.720
Let me be racist.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.800
Yes, I said that.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.120
Let me be racist.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.960
And say, like, why is that the deal breaker,

09:10.960 --> 09:13.160
and why the fuck, more importantly,

09:13.160 --> 09:16.440
if, because if we were giving a pass,

09:16.440 --> 09:22.200
were we giving a pass to cops in areas where white people felt

09:22.200 --> 09:27.760
like maybe, maybe we felt like it was a demilitarized zone,

09:27.760 --> 09:31.240
or we felt like, oh, you know, I'm liberal politically,

09:31.240 --> 09:33.960
but hey, I can't imagine doing that job.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.600
That must be real hard.

09:35.600 --> 09:39.000
By the way, sanitation workers get killed more often than cops.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.040
Like, it's, I don't deny, they just did a study.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.200
Like, how many, how many fucking,

09:44.200 --> 09:45.680
how dangerous is this fucking job?

09:45.680 --> 09:46.800
What is sanitation?

09:46.800 --> 09:49.720
People murder them, or they get, they, if they fall into it.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.280
Let's not worry about sanitation workers.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.680
The point is that.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.840
Wait, no, wait.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.160
Are people picking them off with guns from their rooftop,

09:57.160 --> 10:00.920
or do they get crushed by, like, get out of my garbage.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.600
It's being mistaken for raccoons is, like,

10:03.600 --> 10:07.800
the highest cause of death in the United States,

10:07.800 --> 10:10.080
other than experimental aircraft.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.160
I don't know, I don't know.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.200
I'm talking out of my ass.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.200
That's why I built a cedar wood enclosure

10:14.200 --> 10:16.000
from my trash in front of my head.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.880
And now, and now I approve of that.

10:20.880 --> 10:26.360
Now that I'm seeing the danger causes, that's like,

10:26.360 --> 10:30.680
that's Donnie Deepkut is giving you the high clap.

10:30.680 --> 10:35.040
He loves, anyways, I, like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.080
I'm glad, come on, where was I?

10:37.080 --> 10:37.880
I was being racist.

10:37.880 --> 10:47.200
If, now can we go, like, OK, so if you're a squad car

10:47.200 --> 10:48.920
and you're stuck in broad daylight traffic

10:48.920 --> 10:51.880
on Las Fuelas Boulevard, where there's six yogurt shops

10:51.880 --> 10:56.440
within a mile radius, and a 48-year-old white jogger

10:56.440 --> 10:59.080
with a towel in his hands can also

10:59.080 --> 11:01.320
provoke the same response.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.840
Like, like, is it, I mean, can we definitely, like,

11:04.840 --> 11:05.600
call it quits?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.360
And if we use that as the deal breaker,

11:07.360 --> 11:09.520
can we just reveal that we've all been racist

11:09.520 --> 11:11.840
and that maybe that's why this whole fucking problem

11:11.840 --> 11:13.520
exists in the first place?

11:13.520 --> 11:14.800
That's my only point.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.160
Because I, and I'm willing to lay it back.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.720
Are you saying that the deal for you wasn't broken yet?

11:20.720 --> 11:22.480
That you still kind of consider, oh,

11:22.480 --> 11:24.680
that's a bad neighborhood for the black people?

11:24.680 --> 11:25.560
I can see that.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.680
Well.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.440
A byproduct of that job in that part of town.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.080
I think the deal was broken a long time ago.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.880
I think that, as I've always said,

11:34.880 --> 11:36.440
like, race is an artificial construct

11:36.440 --> 11:38.680
and the thing that we're connected is, like,

11:38.680 --> 11:43.480
it's the idea that people that have phenotypical

11:43.480 --> 11:45.680
characteristics all live on one block.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.440
That's where things become, like, what we're identifying

11:48.440 --> 11:52.720
as race issues are class issues and cultural issues and stuff.

11:52.720 --> 11:56.280
And so I think that within that maelstrom, yes,

11:56.280 --> 11:59.040
I will say to you, yes, I have always thought

11:59.040 --> 12:02.120
in the back of my head, always in the back of my head,

12:02.120 --> 12:05.680
I have always thought, boy, that can't be a good gig.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.640
But is it also, does it have to be a race thing?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.040
Or can it just be a class thing?

12:10.040 --> 12:12.040
Because we live in a neighborhood,

12:12.040 --> 12:15.080
where that shooting took place, the rent is very high there.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.160
Is it possible that for you, because it's so close to where

12:18.160 --> 12:20.080
you actually live and you're safe?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.240
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.160
OK, so it's not a race thing.

12:22.160 --> 12:22.760
It's a class thing.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.440
I'm saying there is no such thing as a race thing

12:24.440 --> 12:25.800
if we were to actually talk about genetics.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.640
There's no such thing as a race thing.

12:27.640 --> 12:32.120
Like, the striation that we call ratio, like, that's not,

12:32.120 --> 12:35.080
we know, when I've said 1,000 times on this stage,

12:35.080 --> 12:36.320
race is an artificial construct.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.560
Dan, what do you mean by that?

12:37.560 --> 12:40.000
What I mean is that it's a man-made construct.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.880
Like, the things that we delineate as racial are forced.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.000
Like, they are, if you lived in a world,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
if you grew up in a high school where all of the red-headed

12:50.000 --> 12:52.680
people sat at one lunch table, if there

12:52.680 --> 12:55.760
were as much attention paid to freckles,

12:55.760 --> 12:59.280
or the weird continuum of skin shades

12:59.280 --> 13:02.560
that exist within what we consider

13:02.560 --> 13:06.000
African-American skin tones, Middle Eastern skin tones,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.280
and white skin tones, like, everybody's skin

13:08.280 --> 13:09.360
has a different color to it.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.440
Yes, there's genetic, there's these characteristics

13:12.440 --> 13:15.040
and things, but compared to the things that actually

13:15.040 --> 13:17.200
make a difference, it's an artificial construct.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.280
It's man-made.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.440
So it's not when we're talking about racial things

13:21.440 --> 13:22.720
and racial hot buttons, when we're

13:22.720 --> 13:25.440
talking about the actual existence of a black community,

13:25.440 --> 13:28.000
we don't actually mean a bunch of people

13:28.000 --> 13:30.080
who are united by genetics alone.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.200
That gets us into all kinds of trouble,

13:33.200 --> 13:38.960
because that's really, really a huge sleight of hand.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.720
We're talking about class, and we're

13:40.720 --> 13:42.800
talking about the fact that there's

13:42.800 --> 13:45.560
been these forced impositions.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.760
We should have all been fucking each other a long time ago.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.400
We should all, and I'm not saying that this is a necessity,

13:52.400 --> 13:56.440
but statistically speaking, if there hadn't ever

13:56.440 --> 14:00.360
any been xenophobia, when anyone landed on the coast of anything,

14:00.360 --> 14:04.080
if there had never been any imposition of any artificially

14:04.080 --> 14:07.080
asserted construct, we would all just

14:07.080 --> 14:09.040
look like Holly Berry and Tiger Woods by now.

14:09.040 --> 14:13.600
We would, and Benjamin Bratt and whatever.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.080
And none of us would give a fuck.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.720
And it's OK that that world hasn't happened yet.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.480
We can still exist in that world, because some people

14:19.480 --> 14:21.200
have long necks, and some people have big noses,

14:21.200 --> 14:22.920
and some people have weird toes, and some people

14:22.920 --> 14:25.880
have shovel teeth, and some people have like,

14:25.880 --> 14:29.200
and then some people are so desperate for identity

14:29.200 --> 14:31.480
that they fucking carve up their own face.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.720
So Jesus Christ, we don't have to be in such a hurry

14:33.720 --> 14:36.600
to all fuck each other, but some people have tattoos,

14:36.600 --> 14:37.800
and some people are in wheelchairs,

14:37.800 --> 14:39.600
and some people eat wood.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.520
Termites, termites.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.400
Those are termites.

14:43.400 --> 14:47.240
We don't have to include them.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.880
Race is an artificial construct, is my point.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.520
Oh, thanks, guys.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.120
That's been our show.

14:54.120 --> 14:54.600
Good night.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.520
Good night, everybody.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.560
Try safely.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.880
Would you fuck a termite, then, if you could?

15:00.880 --> 15:04.040
What do you think a human termite may be?

15:04.040 --> 15:08.800
What would be the upside to a human termite crossbreeding?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.040
Well, definitely the ability to digest wood.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.920
I imagine all insects are totally

15:15.920 --> 15:18.000
jealous of termites, don't you?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.560
They eat wood.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.800
Like, imagine flies are like, fuck you.

15:22.800 --> 15:27.200
Like, they're on top of a turd, and they're like, whoa.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.680
Enjoy your log cabin, Thoreau.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.120
The worst, the termites have got to,

15:36.120 --> 15:38.920
how do they even do that?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.800
It must be at the expense of something.

15:40.800 --> 15:48.800
Termites must be terrible golfers, or dumb.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.640
By the way, we're recording my comedy album tonight,

15:50.640 --> 15:56.080
so thank you for laughing at my termite run.

15:56.080 --> 16:01.000
What would the downside be of a human termite hybrid?

16:01.000 --> 16:09.560
Probably no cardiovascular system, no brain,

16:09.560 --> 16:11.320
just being a collection of neurons

16:11.320 --> 16:13.920
that make a thing go like this.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.840
Spencer, if you could crossbreed humans

16:17.840 --> 16:21.880
with any animal or insect from across the animal kingdom,

16:21.880 --> 16:24.480
what do you think would be the most advantageous?

16:24.480 --> 16:28.640
Oh, definitely an iguana.

16:28.640 --> 16:32.560
Think about how useful an iguana is.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.680
Now, think about applying that skill

16:34.680 --> 16:39.440
set to the mental capacity of a human.

16:39.440 --> 16:49.200
You'd get humans that could lie on sticks, or perhaps black rocks.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.360
Let them talk, let them finish, let them finish, let them finish.

16:53.360 --> 16:57.440
They'd even probably be able to eat mealworms.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.440
I don't know.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.800
I really love that he left out changing color.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.640
Iguanas, Dan.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.560
I thought about saying chameleons didn't go there.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.040
Oh, iguanas, I'm sorry.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.400
Hey, look who's race blind.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.680
Fuck you, people.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.520
I hooked you in by saying I'm racist.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.000
How does it feel on the lowest road compared to me,

17:24.000 --> 17:28.160
where even iguanas and chameleons,

17:28.160 --> 17:33.360
lizards famous for their color, are indistinguishable to me?

17:33.360 --> 17:39.280
Uh, fuck you all.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.800
The FBI is waiting at each exit.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.600
You're all going on a racism list.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.800
Because I'm the decoy.

17:46.800 --> 17:52.800
I'm the guy, whatever they call him, like in those kitty porn.

17:52.800 --> 17:53.960
Protochet.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.960
Protochet?

17:56.960 --> 17:58.640
Another callback, another callback.

17:58.640 --> 17:59.840
In the movie, what was that?

17:59.840 --> 18:00.640
There was a movie.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.960
What was the movie with the?

18:01.960 --> 18:04.160
God damn it.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.760
Oh, Honeypot, is that it?

18:06.760 --> 18:10.920
It's like, this is a sad thing to get clear.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.920
The kid that they used to lure in other kids.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.040
You'd ask Deep Cut, Donnie, whatever his name was.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.040
Deep Cut.

18:18.040 --> 18:22.200
Honeypot, yeah, OK.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.360
None of us feel better about, oh, OK, now I know.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.160
I got all my pedophile terms down.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.240
I'm glad I came out here tonight.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.560
Could have been at the BET Awards.

18:31.560 --> 18:35.400
But I'm a pedophile expert.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.840
One more thing, a Confederate flag flag.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.720
I'm going to say one thing about it, and then we're done.

18:38.720 --> 18:42.880
We're going to meet some people, we're going to have some fun.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.320
Yes, scrutinize the flag.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.320
Get it down.

18:46.320 --> 18:46.960
You know why?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.480
It's a fucking flag.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.280
How less racist do you think the United States flag is?

18:51.280 --> 18:51.920
All right, that's it.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.240
That's all I wanted to say.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.600
I just fucking get bummed out.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
Are you kidding me?

18:57.600 --> 18:58.480
Like, oh, really?

18:58.480 --> 19:00.560
Because it's the logo for Dukes of Hazard?

19:00.560 --> 19:02.960
It's like, it makes such an easy target.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.240
It's like, yeah, they lost, and they're like,

19:05.240 --> 19:07.720
they should not be flying that over any capital building.

19:07.720 --> 19:11.440
It's fucking, it's been like tolerated in fucking sedition.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.760
All flags are bummers.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.040
Yeah, they're fucking flags.

19:14.040 --> 19:17.320
Like, it's like, just like, yeah, fucking let's be.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.760
Also, we fold it weird.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.880
That's a stupid way to fold anything.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.080
We fold it weird.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.080
We fold them weird.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.840
And we have like, there's a weird rules about it.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.080
A fucking triangle?

19:27.080 --> 19:28.480
That's a stupid.

19:28.480 --> 19:33.320
Every single flag on this entire planet

19:33.320 --> 19:39.320
is, by its very nature, the whole reason to have a flag

19:39.320 --> 19:44.120
is to like, fold it in a square or rectangle.

19:44.120 --> 19:44.760
We'll get to it.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.600
But saying the idea of taking a piece of fabric

19:47.600 --> 19:50.120
and saying, this is a symbol, and we're waving it,

19:50.120 --> 19:53.520
the whole, that's how all dehumanization begins.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.000
So yeah, have them, they're fine, they're great.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.120
Scrutinize some of them.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.760
Hey, that one's the Losers flag.

19:58.760 --> 19:59.640
Let's take it down.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.200
Didn't they lose a long time ago?

20:02.200 --> 20:04.160
We should probably put that in a museum instead

20:04.160 --> 20:06.480
of over our government building.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.680
It's kind of weird that we keep letting them do that.

20:09.680 --> 20:14.880
If you put a flag up over a southern city's capital

20:14.880 --> 20:18.240
building that said, Jeff Davis rules,

20:18.240 --> 20:20.000
people would show up at your door.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.320
Well, first off, they'd be right.

20:21.320 --> 20:27.040
Second, my name, Jeff Davis, Jefferson Davis,

20:27.040 --> 20:27.920
the president of the Confederacy.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.480
Oh, boy.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.080
Every week, somebody sends me a tweet of them being

20:35.080 --> 20:38.280
in the South in a bumper sticker or a sticker on a lamp post.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.200
It says, don't blame me.

20:39.200 --> 20:43.200
I voted for Jeff Davis across the Confederate Jack.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.080
Like, there's loads of good old races, Jeff Davis.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.560
My name across the Confederate front.

20:47.560 --> 20:52.320
We thought you were going to tell the Teen Wolf story again.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.120
I'm kidding.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.280
I'm doing it.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.560
Deep Cut Townie knows what I'm talking about.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.600
Oh, Deep Cut Townie fucking gas-based me.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.400
I did tell the story about my name profiting me

21:01.400 --> 21:02.440
in the South, right?

21:02.440 --> 21:03.200
Yes, yes.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.440
That's what I thought you were doing.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.440
That's why I said, oh, boy, I didn't

21:05.440 --> 21:08.240
want you to go on that record truck.

21:08.240 --> 21:11.040
I'll fucking talk about Teen Wolf, though, man.

21:11.040 --> 21:11.680
Don't do either.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.360
Let's freshen things up with a long-awaited guest,

21:15.360 --> 21:17.520
somebody who should have been here a long time ago,

21:17.520 --> 21:20.760
partly because it's basically, well, I mean, not basically.

21:20.760 --> 21:24.120
Literally, she's the reason why the podcast exists,

21:24.120 --> 21:30.200
because years ago at the Roost, she was just very like,

21:30.200 --> 21:31.360
she wasn't assertive about it.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.240
She was just sort of clear about it,

21:33.240 --> 21:34.640
said, like, you should have a podcast.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.560
You should do a podcast.

21:35.560 --> 21:40.440
And I was like, oh, yeah, maybe I should.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.840
Her benefits extend beyond that.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.280
A lot of you already love her from the indoor kids

21:46.280 --> 21:47.120
and all kinds of stuff.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.360
And she's got a book that's coming out that we'll plug,

21:49.360 --> 21:50.840
but let's get to talking to her.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.840
Emily Gordon's here.

21:51.840 --> 21:59.840
Yeah!

21:59.840 --> 22:01.840
Oh.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.840
Hello.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.840
Hi.

22:03.840 --> 22:04.840
Finally.

22:04.840 --> 22:05.840
Hello.

22:05.840 --> 22:06.840
Emily Vance Gordon.

22:06.840 --> 22:07.840
Vance.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.840
That's right.

22:08.840 --> 22:09.840
You got a cool middle name.

22:09.840 --> 22:10.840
I hate that middle name.

22:10.840 --> 22:11.840
Why is that?

22:11.840 --> 22:13.840
It's my, it was supposed to be my first name

22:13.840 --> 22:16.840
if I was going to be a boy, and I wasn't.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.840
So, because I don't think anybody would have

22:18.840 --> 22:22.840
sex with someone named Vance, so I'm quite,

22:22.840 --> 22:24.840
I'm quite happy about that.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.840
But middle name status, I'll take it.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
It's fine.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.840
Yeah.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.840
So they love the name so much they couldn't let it go,

22:30.840 --> 22:31.840
even though you were a woman.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.840
It must be in here somewhere.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.840
I'm lucky I didn't get one of those four name people.

22:35.840 --> 22:36.840
You know the four name people?

22:36.840 --> 22:37.840
It's not good.

22:37.840 --> 22:38.840
What?

22:38.840 --> 22:40.840
I have kind of an equally charming story.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.840
My parents didn't expect a third child,

22:42.840 --> 22:44.840
so they made up a name and.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.840
Dan, did they make up Dan?

22:45.840 --> 22:46.840
Yeah.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.840
You guys, the creator of Dan.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.840
They just grabbed it and rolled me under a porch.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.840
So I want to start with one of the most,

22:54.840 --> 22:58.840
I think this kind of exemplifies you in my mind,

22:58.840 --> 23:01.840
my relationship with you, your role in my cosmos.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.840
I'm constantly retweeting you, things that you just retweet.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.840
It's not like you're out there aggressively asserting yourself,

23:08.840 --> 23:12.840
but you like Graham Linehan who we had on the show.

23:12.840 --> 23:13.840
Oh, he's so great on Twitter.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.840
Yeah, and particularly through the things he retweets,

23:16.840 --> 23:18.840
kind of just by looking at his retweets,

23:18.840 --> 23:21.840
I feel like a smarter person.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.840
And I also feel like a much dumber person.

23:24.840 --> 23:28.840
But your stuff, the stuff that you retweet,

23:28.840 --> 23:31.840
is like the emotional equivalent of that.

23:31.840 --> 23:38.840
The most exemplary one was you simply retweeted a Tumblr.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.840
No, was this something that you wrote or was this something?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.840
No, it's something that somebody else wrote that I just saw

23:42.840 --> 23:44.840
and retumbled and therefore retweeted.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.840
God, I hate myself.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.840
Just having to say that sentence out loud,

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
I'm not fond of myself.

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
We all died a little bit.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.840
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

23:54.840 --> 23:59.840
It was simply a list of ways to compliment people.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
I don't want to get this wrong.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.840
List of ways to compliment people

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
without involving their physical appearance.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
Their appearance, yeah, that's it.

24:07.840 --> 24:11.840
Nice things you can say to people other than how they look.

24:11.840 --> 24:19.840
And I was like, my brain flipped over

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
because it's like this is something

24:21.840 --> 24:24.840
I should have realized a long time ago.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.840
It's beyond gender politics, it's beyond,

24:27.840 --> 24:29.840
but it certainly afflicts probably,

24:29.840 --> 24:33.840
if I were to guess, probably afflicts the female self-esteem

24:33.840 --> 24:35.840
a little more than the half of the species

24:35.840 --> 24:38.840
is allowed to look like this.

24:38.840 --> 24:41.840
What were a couple that you remember, or anything?

24:41.840 --> 24:43.840
You know what, fuck it, no, I didn't even read it.

24:43.840 --> 24:49.840
Based on the title alone, you were like, yes, this speaks to me.

24:49.840 --> 24:53.840
But that's an important thing.

24:53.840 --> 24:59.840
Think about this, this is a piece that made my mind flop.

24:59.840 --> 25:03.840
180 degrees about some part of my brain

25:03.840 --> 25:05.840
just reshuffled completely.

25:05.840 --> 25:10.840
And there was no outrage, there was no lynching,

25:10.840 --> 25:13.840
there was no anger, there was no shaming,

25:13.840 --> 25:17.840
even comedically, all those comedy people,

25:17.840 --> 25:20.840
that's how we express our progress as we...

25:20.840 --> 25:22.840
Bitch about things.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.840
Your husband's the best at it.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.840
He's so good, you guys.

25:26.840 --> 25:29.840
He's like Lancelot, he's out there slashing.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.840
He complains on a constant basis.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.840
That's what we do, that's as progressive

25:33.840 --> 25:35.840
as comedy and comedy writers get,

25:35.840 --> 25:41.840
is we stab and we poke the things that we don't like.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.840
But this was a thing that was like, hey,

25:44.840 --> 25:47.840
here's a list of things you could say to somebody

25:47.840 --> 25:51.840
that have nothing to do with their physical appearance,

25:51.840 --> 25:54.840
and there was no victimization, there was no nothing.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.840
I would name a couple of them, things that you could say.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.840
I don't remember a goddamn one, and I don't have to.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.840
I enjoy the way your voice sounds.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.840
What do you love hearing that from somebody, you guys?

26:06.840 --> 26:09.840
I think it was stuff like, I like how your voice sounds,

26:09.840 --> 26:12.840
I enjoy the work that you did on that thing,

26:12.840 --> 26:14.840
like just very kind of random things, but...

26:14.840 --> 26:16.840
I enjoy spending time with you.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.840
You make me feel better about myself.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.840
Just like a genuine, vulnerable expression of like,

26:22.840 --> 26:24.840
this is something you do that I like.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.840
That's kind of a rarity, you don't really have a lot of...

26:27.840 --> 26:29.840
You scare me less than other people.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.840
You make me feel like dancing.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.840
I'm going to dance tonight away.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.840
Yeah, yeah.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.840
I want to dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me, obviously.

26:40.840 --> 26:43.840
I'm your private dancer.

26:43.840 --> 26:44.840
Dancer for money?

26:44.840 --> 26:45.840
A dancer for money.

26:45.840 --> 26:46.840
Will you do what I want you to do?

26:46.840 --> 26:47.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.840
Don't make it about yourself, make it about her.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.840
These are our dance hall days.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.840
You're just scrambling now.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.840
Everybody weighing chung tonight?

26:59.840 --> 27:03.840
I just feel like a lot of times the stuff I see in Tumblr specifically,

27:03.840 --> 27:06.840
if you spend any time on it, it's just people full of hate and rage,

27:06.840 --> 27:10.840
like college rage, which is a very specific rage.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.840
And I was like, when you're telling,

27:12.840 --> 27:15.840
this is fucked up when this happens and this should be happening instead,

27:15.840 --> 27:17.840
then all people want to talk about is, this is what's fucked up.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.840
And they're like, well, that's not fucked up.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.840
You don't understand, you weren't there, you don't know.

27:21.840 --> 27:22.840
Let me explain it to you, little lady.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.840
So I'm like, I would rather just skip to the second part,

27:24.840 --> 27:27.840
which is putting out good stuff and being like, well, then just take this.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.840
What is the goal?

27:28.840 --> 27:30.840
What is the end game that we want?

27:30.840 --> 27:33.840
We want to be happy supposedly, right?

27:33.840 --> 27:34.840
We want to be satisfied.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.840
We want to be supposedly when you're like,

27:36.840 --> 27:41.840
when you're charging at a guy on Twitter and you're like fucking like lancing him.

27:41.840 --> 27:47.840
In theory, like in plain sight theory, the theory we all accept,

27:47.840 --> 27:53.840
which I don't know, is it true, is that behind all of that force

27:53.840 --> 27:59.840
is revolution and the name of the revolution is, can't we all just get along?

27:59.840 --> 28:05.840
Now, if your flag is, can't we all just get along?

28:05.840 --> 28:07.840
That's a fucked up flag too.

28:07.840 --> 28:11.840
Why under that flag are you slitting people's throats?

28:11.840 --> 28:14.840
No matter how racist they are, no matter how,

28:14.840 --> 28:18.840
like when are we going to get to this revolution where we go?

28:18.840 --> 28:23.840
Like, let's start, it's more boring, but let's start setting the example.

28:23.840 --> 28:24.840
It's so much more boring.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.840
It's fucking terrible, really.

28:26.840 --> 28:32.840
And it's really hard to think of a positive way to incite subversive thought.

28:32.840 --> 28:38.840
But another, I mean, I've referenced it numerous times on this podcast.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.840
I think you retweeted it was the blog entry,

28:41.840 --> 28:44.840
the article that was admit it, your fave is problematic.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.840
Yes, that was a great one.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.840
I thought there was such a gracious invitation within there.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.840
It was like such a beacon of light within a generation

28:51.840 --> 28:54.840
that I am so, like, shaking my cane at all the time.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.840
But it was like, oh, this is the thing that I'm looking for

28:57.840 --> 29:01.840
is the idea that, can we acknowledge that humanity is so flawed

29:01.840 --> 29:04.840
that if we are going to clean up this porch,

29:04.840 --> 29:06.840
that it is going to involve touching dirt.

29:06.840 --> 29:07.840
So much dirt.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.840
And if we all go ick every time we touch dirt and pointed it and screamed,

29:10.840 --> 29:13.840
dirt, dirt, dirt, we're going to be able to fucking clean children

29:13.840 --> 29:15.840
on a dirty porch shrieking at each other.

29:15.840 --> 29:22.840
We don't ever get to have conversations about anything

29:22.840 --> 29:25.840
because when you start, if you even start, people are like,

29:25.840 --> 29:27.840
well, here's why what you said is problematic.

29:27.840 --> 29:31.840
And then there's no conversations that are going to move anyone anywhere

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
because it's all like, how fast can I shut you down?

29:33.840 --> 29:35.840
How quickly can I shut you down and then shame you

29:35.840 --> 29:38.840
and then we don't get to move in any direction from there?

29:38.840 --> 29:42.840
How much of the shame and the hate or trolling do you get

29:42.840 --> 29:44.840
that's simply because you're a woman?

29:44.840 --> 29:48.840
It's actually, and me saying this is going to make it happen more.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.840
So be aware of that.

29:50.840 --> 29:51.840
The gauntlet is starting.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.840
I actually don't, it's not that bad.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.840
It's really not that bad for me.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.840
And it also makes me mad when people are like,

29:57.840 --> 30:00.840
you're one of the good ones, like one of the good feminists.

30:00.840 --> 30:04.840
The Jimi Hendrix, that's what we call them.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.840
Now I want to be one of the bad ones, you fucking asshole.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.840
Don't ever tell me I'm one of the good ones

30:09.840 --> 30:11.840
because you'll see me become the bad one.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.840
Is that because you project yourself,

30:14.840 --> 30:17.840
you seem to have a pretty sane approach to how you do stuff.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.840
I try to, and when I talk about sex or something,

30:19.840 --> 30:22.840
I always say something about giving a blow job or something,

30:22.840 --> 30:25.840
and people will be like, that's so cool that you talk about that

30:25.840 --> 30:27.840
and you're feminist.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.840
I'm like, yeah, feminists give all of the blow jobs.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.840
They give all of them.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.840
We love it.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.840
It's so great.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.840
How much power do you have when you have a man's genitals

30:37.840 --> 30:39.840
in your fucking mouth?

30:39.840 --> 30:40.840
That is power.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.840
You definitely...

30:46.840 --> 30:48.840
Thank you, goodnight.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.840
You do not want a blow job from a non-feminist, really.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.840
It's the worst.

30:54.840 --> 30:57.840
It's probably all teeth.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.840
But related to that, there's another anecdotal thing,

31:02.840 --> 31:04.840
but we're coming so close to,

31:04.840 --> 31:08.840
which I think is beautiful, is bridging this from societal stuff

31:08.840 --> 31:10.840
and digital stuff to couple stuff,

31:10.840 --> 31:12.840
because your original wheelhouse is,

31:12.840 --> 31:16.840
you actually, you're an ex-patriot from the...

31:16.840 --> 31:18.840
weren't you a couples therapist?

31:18.840 --> 31:20.840
Yeah, I was a couples and family therapist.

31:20.840 --> 31:21.840
And you fled.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.840
I ran fast.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.840
Which makes you more trustworthy as a therapist

31:25.840 --> 31:28.840
than anybody who stayed, but...

31:28.840 --> 31:29.840
It's true.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.840
I was a therapist for, I practiced for about six and a half,

31:32.840 --> 31:34.840
almost seven years, and I really loved it,

31:34.840 --> 31:37.840
but I chose to work with really tough populations

31:37.840 --> 31:40.840
and really tough populations will burn you the fuck out.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.840
So I was like, I tried to take a job working with people

31:42.840 --> 31:44.840
who were just like, I feel stressed out,

31:44.840 --> 31:47.840
and I was like, fuck you, you have no idea how good you have it.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.840
And then I was like, oh, I got to get out of here.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.840
This is my fault now.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.840
What do you mean when you say tough population?

31:53.840 --> 31:55.840
I worked, my first job was with kids

31:55.840 --> 31:57.840
who had been removed from their home,

31:57.840 --> 31:59.840
and their next step was going to be to put in training school,

31:59.840 --> 32:01.840
which is like bye-bye until you're 18.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.840
And then my next job was with only suicidal people.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.840
My next job was with 270 people with schizophrenia

32:06.840 --> 32:08.840
who were living in a hotel.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.840
That's how Freddy Krueger got born.

32:10.840 --> 32:11.840
I know, right?

32:11.840 --> 32:13.840
The bastard's child of 1,000 maniacs.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.840
1,000 maniacs.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.840
That's how sperm works, right?

32:17.840 --> 32:20.840
We all learned in dream warriors.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.840
Which, by the way, isn't that...

32:22.840 --> 32:24.840
That sperm is like a slushie?

32:24.840 --> 32:27.840
What the fuck?

32:27.840 --> 32:31.840
Like, if 1,000 crazy people rape one nun,

32:31.840 --> 32:35.840
it makes Freddy Krueger with their combined sperm?

32:35.840 --> 32:37.840
That's irresponsible.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.840
It's like a gay couple where they're like,

32:39.840 --> 32:41.840
we don't want to know which one it really was.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.840
We just want it to be all of our kids together.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.840
And some of them's like, he's got my eyes, though.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.840
I think it's mine.

32:48.840 --> 32:53.840
He has my proclivity for knife fingering.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.840
Yeah, he's got all my burnt flesh.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.840
I kind of want to...

32:58.840 --> 33:00.840
Part of me really wants, because I think...

33:00.840 --> 33:02.840
If so many people are listening, they could benefit,

33:02.840 --> 33:04.840
because what you just said earlier was that

33:04.840 --> 33:06.840
you actually don't...

33:06.840 --> 33:08.840
You actually have an easier time,

33:08.840 --> 33:10.840
and I think it's not an incorrect assumption

33:10.840 --> 33:13.840
that that has something to do with inside you,

33:13.840 --> 33:16.840
that you know how to handle things better.

33:16.840 --> 33:20.840
So, therefore, I'm curious that it's for all of us out there

33:20.840 --> 33:22.840
who are living on Twitter,

33:22.840 --> 33:24.840
living in social media comment sections,

33:24.840 --> 33:27.840
getting into these tangles that jack up our nervous system,

33:27.840 --> 33:29.840
and all of a sudden we're just...

33:29.840 --> 33:32.840
I mean, what do you do in these very typical situations

33:32.840 --> 33:35.840
that maybe some of us aren't doing?

33:35.840 --> 33:36.840
Okay, that's a good question.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.840
I would say, and I'm not always great at it,

33:38.840 --> 33:39.840
if you catch me on a weird day,

33:39.840 --> 33:40.840
I'll fucking yell at you for no reason,

33:40.840 --> 33:42.840
and then apologize later.

33:42.840 --> 33:43.840
And that's the thing I've learned.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.840
One is that what I don't want to have to do

33:45.840 --> 33:47.840
is apologize to someone who is a little shitty to me

33:47.840 --> 33:50.840
when I blow up later, and then I'm like, you're right,

33:50.840 --> 33:52.840
I'm sorry, I said something shitty.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.840
I don't want to have to apologize to you, fuck off.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.840
So, that's my first line of defense.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.840
Second line of defense is going,

33:58.840 --> 34:00.840
what do I really want out of this?

34:00.840 --> 34:02.840
Genuinely, what is the ideal outcome

34:02.840 --> 34:04.840
of this situation for me?

34:04.840 --> 34:06.840
And is there any chance in fucking hell

34:06.840 --> 34:07.840
that I'm going to get it?

34:07.840 --> 34:09.840
And if there's just not,

34:09.840 --> 34:11.840
then I just choose not to engage.

34:11.840 --> 34:14.840
Like, there's no point to me.

34:14.840 --> 34:17.840
Like, if what I want is, I want you to stop being racist

34:17.840 --> 34:20.840
and sexist and understand how I feel about things,

34:20.840 --> 34:22.840
I'm not going to do that over Twitter.

34:22.840 --> 34:23.840
That's never going to happen.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.840
And why would you want that for some dude?

34:25.840 --> 34:27.840
Like, what a kind of weird,

34:27.840 --> 34:29.840
dead man walking relationship is that?

34:29.840 --> 34:31.840
Or you're just going to be Susan Saranda to one guy on Twitter?

34:31.840 --> 34:33.840
You're the one, I've decided.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.840
I will change you.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.840
And for so many, I think women too,

34:37.840 --> 34:40.840
we take on project dudes to date.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.840
And so, taking on project dudes on Twitter,

34:43.840 --> 34:45.840
I feel like it's like a weird extension of that,

34:45.840 --> 34:47.840
of like taking on like, I will make you better.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.840
I will be the special one that will understand you

34:50.840 --> 34:52.840
and make you, it's not my job.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.840
It could be, I think we're all afflicted to that,

34:54.840 --> 34:56.840
by it though, like, because we all want to,

34:56.840 --> 34:59.840
so what I'm hearing and combining with the tools

34:59.840 --> 35:01.840
I'm acquiring in therapy right now.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.840
Just the fact that you said what I'm hearing,

35:03.840 --> 35:05.840
it's good stuff, good refrain.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.840
Good communication.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.840
By the way, you look fantastic tonight.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.840
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

35:11.840 --> 35:14.840
Emily, is Camille a project dude?

35:14.840 --> 35:16.840
Of course, of course he is.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.840
Anyway, what are you saying?

35:18.840 --> 35:20.840
Oh, I shouldn't have answered for you.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.840
It just seems so obvious.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.840
No, he's not.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.840
No, not at all.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.840
I mean, thank God he's not here tonight.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.840
No, he's not backstage staring at me right now.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.840
Ah, no, not at all.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.840
He was one of the first guys I dated

35:34.840 --> 35:36.840
that did not need me to function,

35:36.840 --> 35:38.840
and so that was why he was terrifying,

35:38.840 --> 35:40.840
but also why I fell in love with him.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.840
Would I, just to, just to link,

35:42.840 --> 35:44.840
and not to beat this dead horse,

35:44.840 --> 35:46.840
but just because I do think that people listening

35:46.840 --> 35:48.840
could like benefit from this,

35:48.840 --> 35:50.840
because we're interacting all the time

35:50.840 --> 35:52.840
just in these little digital bursts.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.840
So, I think that's the difference between

35:54.840 --> 35:56.840
your type of interaction with trolls,

35:56.840 --> 35:58.840
let's call them, like, do you primarily,

35:58.840 --> 36:00.840
do you do a lot of just blocking,

36:00.840 --> 36:02.840
ignoring? I do some blocking, yeah.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.840
I try to think like, what do I want,

36:04.840 --> 36:06.840
and if what I want is to make this guy feel

36:06.840 --> 36:08.840
shame or bad,

36:08.840 --> 36:10.840
then I'm like, I need to find another way to make,

36:10.840 --> 36:12.840
there are other ways to affect someone's

36:12.840 --> 36:14.840
emotions that don't involve,

36:14.840 --> 36:16.840
because some days you just want to make other people

36:16.840 --> 36:18.840
feel bad. You feel bad, you want to fucking spread it around,

36:18.840 --> 36:20.840
but just be honest with your own intentions.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.840
Like, if you're like, no, no, no,

36:22.840 --> 36:24.840
I want to educate him about fifth-weight feminism.

36:24.840 --> 36:26.840
No, you don't, you want to fucking make him feel bad.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.840
You want to make him feel bad, because he made you feel bad.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.840
You don't want to educate him, you don't give a fuck

36:30.840 --> 36:32.840
if he's educated. Just be honest with

36:32.840 --> 36:34.840
that desire within yourself,

36:34.840 --> 36:36.840
and then also think about him. What does he want?

36:36.840 --> 36:38.840
He wants to make you feel bad.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.840
Are you going to let him have that? That's a lot of power

36:40.840 --> 36:42.840
to give somebody a stranger who has an egg

36:42.840 --> 36:44.840
for a fucking face. I'm not going to do that.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.840
Yeah.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.840
I feel like I have,

36:48.840 --> 36:50.840
like, incidentally, like, going to

36:50.840 --> 36:52.840
therapy and then, as a

36:52.840 --> 36:54.840
direct result of therapy, I adopted this new

36:54.840 --> 36:56.840
thing, which I never would have done before.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.840
I actually, when I started on Twitter,

36:58.840 --> 37:00.840
I thought that blocking people was like some kind of

37:00.840 --> 37:02.840
admission of defeat. You won? Yeah.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.840
Like, no, I can fucking

37:04.840 --> 37:06.840
take anybody down. Come at me.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.840
Like, I'm Stephen Segal. And what does that even mean?

37:08.840 --> 37:10.840
Take them down. What does that even mean?

37:10.840 --> 37:12.840
I mean, I'll tell you what it means, because

37:12.840 --> 37:14.840
I'm still part of me, it's like, no, I want you

37:14.840 --> 37:16.840
to understand how good I am.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.840
That means they block me.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.840
And I was fucking good

37:20.840 --> 37:22.840
at it. Like, I would,

37:22.840 --> 37:24.840
that was my zero-sum

37:24.840 --> 37:26.840
game. Like, for real, for three years,

37:26.840 --> 37:28.840
that was my game. Like, I would, people

37:28.840 --> 37:30.840
would come at me and they'd go, like, community sucks.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.840
And I'd be like, all right, let's talk for a while.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.840
Three weeks later, they're blocking me.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.840
And I'm like, coming out, I'm going, hey, hey,

37:36.840 --> 37:38.840
I thought you wanted to talk, motherfucker!

37:38.840 --> 37:40.840
That's me

37:40.840 --> 37:42.840
winning.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.840
Unhealthy, unhealthy. Unhealthy.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.840
Meanwhile, community, they're like, hey, where's

37:46.840 --> 37:48.840
Dan? Oh, I don't know, I think he's talking with a guy

37:48.840 --> 37:50.840
who's three weeks ago. Because then I fucking into him, I'm like,

37:50.840 --> 37:52.840
why do you draw like an eight-year-old? Is it because you're

37:52.840 --> 37:54.840
dead left?

37:54.840 --> 37:56.840
And they're just like crying and like, fucking,

37:56.840 --> 37:58.840
like, I just fantasize about their suicide.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.840
I don't, don't commit suicide.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.840
Talk to somebody. Suicide is not good.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.840
There's a number you can call.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.840
But, so, in therapy,

38:06.840 --> 38:08.840
because of the stuff I learned, then I just, like,

38:08.840 --> 38:10.840
applied that. I never talked to my therapist about

38:10.840 --> 38:12.840
Twitter. Yeah, specifically, yeah.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.840
But I applied the tools that I was learning in therapy.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.840
What a good client you are. What's up?

38:16.840 --> 38:18.840
Applying tools you've learned elsewhere. What a great client

38:18.840 --> 38:20.840
you are. Yeah, I'm all over the place.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.840
And I'm assuming you think I look great, but won't tell me

38:22.840 --> 38:24.840
because you're so advanced.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.840
I'll tell you later. Off mic.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.840
I feel like if somebody came up to me and said, uh, you know

38:28.840 --> 38:30.840
what, I really like the sound of your talking voice.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.840
That's them saying, you look like shit.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.840
Send the man.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.840
I can't think of anything to say nice about the way

38:36.840 --> 38:38.840
you look. With all due respect to Emily,

38:38.840 --> 38:40.840
I think that, I think the sound of your voice

38:40.840 --> 38:42.840
was the bad first example. That was maybe a bad first

38:42.840 --> 38:44.840
example. Because it's kind of as physical.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.840
That's true. That is a little physical.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.840
Because then someone else is like, what about me?

38:48.840 --> 38:50.840
Yeah.

38:50.840 --> 38:52.840
And really, that's, they just have an ugly throat.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.840
Could you? That's a great voice.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.840
But more importantly, if you're foxy, and all people

38:56.840 --> 38:58.840
do is tell you you're foxy, that's actually the more

38:58.840 --> 39:00.840
important battleground. Absolutely.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.840
You should be, anyways. So let's get to that later,

39:02.840 --> 39:04.840
because you're writing a book about, you're about

39:04.840 --> 39:06.840
to come up with a book about self-esteem.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.840
Yeah, we'll talk about that.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.840
Fuck you.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.840
Fuck you all. There was one more thing.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.840
I just wanted to brag about how advanced I am.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.840
The bulk you are, yes.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.840
I started blocking people. I started just

39:18.840 --> 39:20.840
fucking blocking people. I started eating it

39:20.840 --> 39:22.840
like Rice Krispies. I was like, I was just like,

39:22.840 --> 39:24.840
once I crossed the threshold, I was like, block the first guy.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.840
Block, block, block, block, block.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.840
Do you know what the result is?

39:28.840 --> 39:30.840
For better or for worse, when I get on Twitter now,

39:30.840 --> 39:32.840
it's like fucking so positive.

39:32.840 --> 39:34.840
Yeah. Because

39:34.840 --> 39:36.840
either people are terrorized.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.840
They're like, dude, don't fucking,

39:38.840 --> 39:40.840
if you ask them about communities lighting

39:40.840 --> 39:42.840
in season six, he'll fucking block you.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.840
Like, and maybe,

39:44.840 --> 39:46.840
hey, fuck it. Maybe I'm,

39:46.840 --> 39:48.840
yeah, maybe I'm Caligula on Twitter,

39:48.840 --> 39:50.840
but more importantly, I'm getting

39:50.840 --> 39:52.840
on Twitter for my own experience. It's like, I have

39:52.840 --> 39:54.840
a good time on Twitter now. I have intelligent,

39:54.840 --> 39:56.840
smart, funny people.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.840
Having interesting conversations. I say, I'm watching

39:58.840 --> 40:00.840
this movie, and people are writing and going,

40:00.840 --> 40:02.840
I watched that movie. If you watch this movie,

40:02.840 --> 40:04.840
and it's like fucking, that's what Twitter's for.

40:04.840 --> 40:06.840
And it's because I just started

40:06.840 --> 40:08.840
like, popping those fucking bubbles.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.840
Like, it is like, lancing those boils.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.840
It's like, this is not what I get on Twitter for.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.840
I don't get on here for constructive criticism.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.840
Right, yeah. About season three.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.840
Do you feel like Joseph Stalin

40:18.840 --> 40:20.840
felt the same way? Like, when he was perfect?

40:20.840 --> 40:22.840
Yes, Jeff.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.840
As I've always said.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.840
When he was killing off tens of millions of people.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.840
Is that how he blocked people? That dissented.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.840
Well, he blocked them with a bullet.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.840
That was the blocking, the breathing passageways.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.840
I heard that he gave the orders

40:34.840 --> 40:36.840
to the Gestapo, he would say,

40:36.840 --> 40:38.840
block them.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.840
Stalin was dealing with the Gestapo?

40:40.840 --> 40:42.840
Yeah, he was in deep with the Nazis.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.840
That is hard.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.840
No one knows about that.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.840
Is it because Gestapo is

40:48.840 --> 40:50.840
like, cold soup, and you're like,

40:50.840 --> 40:52.840
you taste it, and you're like, this soup is cold,

40:52.840 --> 40:54.840
and you're like, it's Gestapo, it's supposed to be cold.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.840
The...

40:56.840 --> 40:58.840
I dropped out of college.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.840
I dropped out of college.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.840
We have this beautiful segue here

41:02.840 --> 41:04.840
because we're talking about the

41:04.840 --> 41:06.840
individual working with

41:06.840 --> 41:08.840
this human biomass

41:08.840 --> 41:10.840
digitally.

41:10.840 --> 41:12.840
And we're talking about the same tools

41:12.840 --> 41:14.840
and your former occupation

41:14.840 --> 41:16.840
that we're talking about

41:16.840 --> 41:18.840
two people who join

41:18.840 --> 41:20.840
in partnership.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.840
And your husband is here, and my wife is here.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.840
I think we should just bring them both out at the same time.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.840
Oh, interesting. Okay.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.840
Let's bring out Camille and Erin McGathy.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.840
Come here, Nandiani, everybody.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.840
And Erin McGathy!

41:40.840 --> 41:42.840
Hi.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.840
Hello. Hi, everybody.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.840
Welcome. Thank you for having me on your show.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.840
You're welcome.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.840
It's my face.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.840
We got to change it to my face up here.

41:52.840 --> 41:54.840
And I will say just quickly, I never...

41:54.840 --> 41:56.840
Here's what I said. I was picked to run this theater

41:56.840 --> 42:00.820
When it first opened and I was really needed shows and really needed good things

42:00.820 --> 42:05.340
And we happened to be at the bar one night and I was like you should just come and talk on stage

42:05.540 --> 42:10.260
For like an hour that I think it would be amazing and people would come and you were like make it to

42:17.300 --> 42:19.140
That really is like

42:19.140 --> 42:23.420
Dan and I what the drawing room and Dan and I were sitting at the bar at the drawing and there's like yeah

42:23.420 --> 42:27.320
I talked to Emily Gordon who works at meltdown and he

42:28.160 --> 42:29.760
She said but we should do a show

42:29.760 --> 42:33.760
So maybe we just get up there and we just talk and we talk about going to the moon and that was it

42:33.760 --> 42:38.800
That was literally and the first show if you'll remember you wanted to show something on screen and our screen wasn't working

42:38.800 --> 42:42.800
So when the show was supposed to be starting I was at the Apple store at the gallery

42:42.800 --> 42:46.960
I think at the Glendale Galleria. No not Glendale. I was whatever not interesting

42:47.200 --> 42:51.920
Trying to find a part to go to the screen so that you could show this thing and when I got back

42:51.920 --> 42:54.860
You were like, fuck it. We just won't show it. I was like, all right

42:57.360 --> 42:59.360
Which which mall was it?

43:03.160 --> 43:05.160
The gallery is so close to the

43:05.880 --> 43:08.880
Yeah, I did not call you a project man earlier

43:12.080 --> 43:18.100
What are you talking about I was totally still I'm a project guy you're also a project lady

43:18.100 --> 43:21.580
We're all projects on this earth. We're

43:22.860 --> 43:25.020
We're on a rock hurtling through space

43:26.020 --> 43:28.020
This Camille you are not

43:29.340 --> 43:33.060
Camille it's so nice to see you. I appreciate what a project you are. Yeah

43:34.940 --> 43:40.620
Thank you Camille you look fantastic tonight. Thank you. I like your voice

43:40.620 --> 43:50.620
Wow, I mean if only the show was an hour, right, that's a fucking closer

43:53.020 --> 43:57.100
I'll end it right fucking now. I will end this thing, but that's a good segue

43:57.100 --> 44:00.020
Let's talk about that. So we got to we got two married couples up here

44:00.020 --> 44:03.580
What I've learned in couples therapy and in solo therapy both the same therapist is

44:04.460 --> 44:05.580
is

44:05.580 --> 44:08.540
this this new epiphany that I've gotten is so

44:08.540 --> 44:14.300
Everyone in the world every experience that you have like like imagine yourself just covered and buttons, you know

44:14.300 --> 44:16.300
you just get buttons pushed and

44:16.460 --> 44:23.900
It bit there they're your deal and stuff the most important thing about it though is that you marry the person who pushes

44:24.020 --> 44:30.100
Most of your buttons they push they push like the exciting ones. Okay, so the buttons are good and bad. Yeah

44:33.140 --> 44:35.820
You're like you're really pushing my buttons. That's never good

44:35.820 --> 44:38.320
Yeah, okay. Well, maybe I need a different

44:38.820 --> 44:39.860
Switches there we go

44:39.860 --> 44:45.060
But like the people that the people that you couple with are people it's like it's like not to bring it into a religious place

44:45.060 --> 44:48.340
But they're invitations from the cosmos for you to

44:49.180 --> 44:53.860
Evolve beyond what you would have been because you could have just lived to 30 and then just fucking fell over

44:53.940 --> 44:58.580
You know and and and hey, that would have been a fine life better than a caterpillar and fucked your ass

44:58.580 --> 45:05.620
The but as human beings who live 70 years or 90 in women's case

45:07.580 --> 45:11.260
Whoa, I'm sorry, I guess it's fine. You look great

45:13.780 --> 45:18.260
The the it's like the second half of an important life is

45:18.860 --> 45:20.540
Maybe I'm biased because I'm married

45:20.540 --> 45:28.060
But it's like it's it's it's joining with the person that affects you way more than strangers on Twitter way more than

45:28.060 --> 45:32.180
Good reviews or bad reviews of your television show way more than anything

45:32.180 --> 45:37.820
And so you're making an agreement not to wake up every morning and go hubba hubba. What's going on?

45:37.820 --> 45:39.500
Let's go. Let's go on a roller coaster

45:39.500 --> 45:46.140
You're making an agreement to wake up in the in bed with every morning with somebody that's like this fucking person is goddamn fucking like

45:47.020 --> 45:49.020
Jesus powerful

45:50.140 --> 45:54.300
This person is what did Greg Proops say about his wife. How does he describe her formidable?

45:54.300 --> 45:59.300
Yeah, this person is formidable, but I think that's true of some marriages

45:59.300 --> 46:02.420
But then some marriages aren't like that at all some marriages are just like we're good friends

46:02.420 --> 46:06.380
And we've decided to hang out for the rest of your death those assholes. Yeah, is that you guys?

46:07.500 --> 46:13.860
No, you're definitely very formidable. I think I like to say I know you challenge me. I like to think I challenge you

46:13.860 --> 46:19.980
Yes, we sort of like yeah, it's been because that's what it what you were saying was when every relationship

46:19.980 --> 46:23.740
I've been in I felt like I had the power and same with you

46:23.740 --> 46:27.360
Yes, I was I steamrolled every guy that I was with forever

46:27.360 --> 46:33.260
Yeah, and then you would not allow me to do that. Is that because you as a therapist you have all that she's got all the tracks

46:33.260 --> 46:36.700
You have all the jiu-jitsu and like yeah, and she's a blowjob feminist

46:38.820 --> 46:43.380
I was god damn it. I was gonna say steamer as euphemism for a feminist blood

46:43.380 --> 46:45.380
Yeah, that's not hurt. That's not hurt

46:45.460 --> 46:47.460
but

46:47.700 --> 46:50.980
Right, yeah, I think that in our relationship nobody

46:50.980 --> 46:56.620
Nobody's in charge. I hope after the show. There's just a bunch of feminist blowjobs out in the parking lot tonight

46:58.940 --> 47:00.940
Swallow it ladies

47:02.140 --> 47:04.140
Man can be

47:06.420 --> 47:08.420
Did you say holla or swallow?

47:12.020 --> 47:17.420
Do you guys do you guys think now that we're moving forward into a world where marriage just means marriage?

47:17.420 --> 47:23.980
That you won't have sex with us because the stage picture would imply that we're about to initiate up. No

47:25.980 --> 47:27.980
Wait what

47:29.900 --> 47:32.540
You guys think now that gay people can be married we could be swingers

47:36.860 --> 47:39.980
Gay people can be married then we can fuck a million

47:39.980 --> 47:46.300
Yeah, this is purely a visual thing, but because Dan and I are on either side of you. Yeah

47:48.020 --> 47:50.020
Yeah

47:54.060 --> 47:58.860
No judgment I think the I think the new rule just fuck whoever you're sitting nearest

48:01.180 --> 48:03.180
Never tell her she looks good

48:03.180 --> 48:10.620
The question to the panel is yes, do you think that like we're famously we keep talking about this divorce rate?

48:10.620 --> 48:15.580
It's like it's gotten so high that basically most aridges that that we that we

48:15.980 --> 48:23.660
That we basically have become a like two or three marriage culture, which is just like it's like capitalism has absorbed that in my

48:23.660 --> 48:31.180
Perception, it's like which is why I'm proud to have waited really long to get married because even if it's not going to get married

48:31.180 --> 48:37.420
Because even if only because I'll die soon. I promise. I'm not I'm gonna have one wife and fucking die

48:38.060 --> 48:41.100
I don't want to play into this con, but

48:46.060 --> 48:50.220
Do you guys think that these kids these these hologram kids these

48:50.780 --> 48:54.060
These oculus rifts minecraft AR

48:54.700 --> 48:56.700
My dick can be your vagina

48:56.700 --> 49:05.980
The supreme court doesn't care. Let's fucking do it. Do you think that their divorce rate will lower?

49:05.980 --> 49:12.540
Do you think that marriage will now that it has been liberated? No, not necessarily. I I'm on my second marriage

49:12.540 --> 49:16.540
This is Camille's my second husband. I got married when I was very damn it. I'm one of these people

49:20.300 --> 49:25.020
I guess I maybe knew that and totally forgot and put my foot right in it

49:25.020 --> 49:29.900
I'll tell you I got married when I was like super young to a very lovely guy. Good friend wonderful

49:30.940 --> 49:32.940
Oh, right where everyone can hear this

49:32.940 --> 49:34.940
We're getting there

49:35.100 --> 49:37.100
I'm joking

49:37.340 --> 49:39.340
He's a very nice guy very nice guy

49:39.980 --> 49:41.740
but who

49:41.740 --> 49:46.700
Did not push any of a lot of my buttons and didn't challenge me and I kind of just ran the show

49:47.100 --> 49:52.060
And so we got a very amicable divorce, but I feel like I feel like what I expected from him

49:52.060 --> 49:57.420
I expected him to be everything to me. I expected him to be like my best friend and my confidant and the guy

49:57.980 --> 50:01.500
Like food with him. I'm like a real fuck guy and like he couldn't

50:02.380 --> 50:06.380
I've met him. I've met him. You thought he was gonna be a fuck guy

50:09.580 --> 50:11.580
All right, all right

50:12.220 --> 50:14.220
If that's not fair for women to expect then

50:14.620 --> 50:20.060
Well, I feel like and I just feel like at some point it used to be that marriages were business arrangements set up by parents to like

50:20.060 --> 50:24.060
Make more people to work at the family business or like keep money and whatever

50:24.380 --> 50:29.020
Well, and women went straight from home to husband and at some point it became a thing of like no

50:29.020 --> 50:31.180
Your spouse has to be literally everything to you

50:31.260 --> 50:36.300
They need like you have to be ultimately fulfilled in this one human being and it's not that you're not fantastic

50:36.380 --> 50:38.380
But when I got divorced

50:39.020 --> 50:41.020
I think this is why this was good

50:42.460 --> 50:46.380
I think it's great that you evolved beyond expecting someone to be a fuck guy you found Camille

50:46.380 --> 50:48.380
I

50:48.460 --> 50:50.460
Like a really good friend. Hey

50:50.860 --> 50:52.860
I'm a fuck guy

50:53.580 --> 51:00.300
The world is full of fuck guys that have very few projects. Yeah Camille. I'm good. I'm a cunnilingus meninus

51:03.420 --> 51:06.300
You stress me is that what the Wiley Coyote was called?

51:08.780 --> 51:10.780
I think Camille

51:11.420 --> 51:13.420
Camille you might be a project fuck guy

51:13.420 --> 51:18.940
Yeah, you're a project fuck guy. Yeah, but when I realized that after I got divorced at like

51:19.020 --> 51:23.580
I need to have good friends and a good like career that satisfies me and hobbies already

51:23.660 --> 51:29.420
Like I need to already be a whole person and not expect a dude to be like the thing that makes me whatever

51:29.660 --> 51:33.340
And once I kind of got that in my head. I found a guy that complimented me this guy

51:33.980 --> 51:38.940
Yeah, who knows what's going on there. Yeah, they're just having a night. It's bad bad ecstasy trip

51:38.940 --> 51:44.060
No, it's good. I'm flattered that they would choose this place to come and roll

51:46.460 --> 51:49.180
I would have gone to Bootsy Collins at the Hollywood. I think it's interesting that you

51:49.740 --> 51:52.700
that you evoked like the history of marriage because if you look at you know how like like

51:53.580 --> 51:57.580
In your biology textbook, remember that empire state building diagram where it was like

51:57.660 --> 52:01.580
This is the history of the planet and then at the very top there was like a dime on top of the empire state building

52:01.580 --> 52:03.580
This is how long humans have been around ever

52:03.580 --> 52:09.580
Um in the history of the concept of monogamy the concept of marriage like a vast

52:09.900 --> 52:15.660
Like what the history that we understand is as you said arranged marriage and the idea of

52:16.380 --> 52:18.540
Our tradition of marriage is that it's romantic

52:18.620 --> 52:23.020
It comes from like the idea of like actually stealing off into the woods the ceremonies that we get married at

52:23.180 --> 52:28.220
There are actually imitations of actually like like terrorist weddings, you know, like raping and taking

52:28.220 --> 52:34.220
Like sneak off into a clearing invite your friends have a have that fuck up fryer that like like, you know

52:34.620 --> 52:38.700
The end of the kevin castor, uh, what was the the it's like it's like that was the

52:39.020 --> 52:42.540
That was the that was the revolution of marriage very short time ago

52:42.700 --> 52:51.340
And since then the the the what do kids have as a tutorial of what a healthy marriage consists of the answer is

52:51.820 --> 52:54.380
Movies in which at the end of the movie

52:54.380 --> 52:57.980
Is when they get together they're about to get married. I have the biggest problem with this

52:58.540 --> 53:01.900
And then they're and I just like fuck it and you're supposed to be once you get married

53:01.900 --> 53:07.100
You're happy forever because that was the goal the whole time and just be satisfied and all these women and men

53:07.180 --> 53:11.740
But mainly women are like wait. What the fuck? I'm supposed to be happy forever. Why am I not happy?

53:11.820 --> 53:16.540
The implication is that if if you are with a guy that you've been with for a year or a girl

53:16.620 --> 53:21.340
You've been with for a year and there's somebody across the room that's like, oh, there's so much more interesting

53:21.340 --> 53:26.700
I wonder why the implication that you walk away from with from 30 years of rom-coms is actually like

53:26.780 --> 53:29.500
Well, you know why that guy's more interesting because he's gonna

53:30.380 --> 53:32.380
He's gonna like make you happy forever

53:33.500 --> 53:39.500
It's the opposite. It's like no, it's like filling up on bread. It's like, yeah, of course you want fucking like don't do it

53:40.700 --> 53:46.380
Shakespeare the difference between a comedy and a tragedy is there's a wedding at the end versus a funeral. Yeah, exactly

53:47.340 --> 53:49.340
Yeah, but there's no

53:49.340 --> 53:54.300
So it's true. It's a very surprising trip just got just got his brain wrinkled

53:56.300 --> 53:59.340
What you have to do is you have to keep on bumping papers

53:59.740 --> 54:01.740
You have to keep on competing on

54:02.460 --> 54:06.220
With cases at your law firm. You have to continue to

54:07.260 --> 54:10.460
Get the ax body spray account. You have to like

54:11.260 --> 54:12.540
role play

54:12.540 --> 54:17.980
The uh, yeah the happily ever after from all the fairy tales is like where all the stars

54:17.980 --> 54:22.940
And all is there is of course there's because guess what adventure marriage is not an adventure. It's not super

54:23.020 --> 54:28.300
It's not super exciting or boring. It just is it's just it can be an incredibly satisfying thing. There's also

54:29.580 --> 54:35.500
There's also not a ton of stories about raising children like we yeah, we we skip over we don't we don't regard

54:35.980 --> 54:37.980
raising children and being married

54:38.060 --> 54:45.580
As adventures. Yeah, maybe we shouldn't like like that would be weird, wouldn't it? Like we used to finding creep times when we would like leave

54:45.580 --> 54:51.340
They're like finding me. We need to have a child to lose him. He's right finding Nemo. We got it

54:51.820 --> 54:57.340
Well, edipus was left out on a rock because his feet were too big and or no, his feet were too big because they tied his legs together

54:57.340 --> 54:59.500
That's the story to follow. They bound his legs together. That's right

55:01.980 --> 55:03.980
Some twists and turns

55:04.540 --> 55:06.540
He'll be dead and I'll be smoking a cigarette

55:06.700 --> 55:12.620
Let's let's let's talk about your book that that it's not it's it's probably not an opportune time to plug it because it's

55:12.620 --> 55:17.580
It's not it's not being published for a little bit September. I'm finished with it. It's coming out end of September

55:17.580 --> 55:19.580
But it's a

55:20.700 --> 55:23.180
Yeah, you can pre-order it. It's about Hitler

55:28.380 --> 55:30.860
And how amazing a cookie was

55:33.660 --> 55:37.340
I've cultivated a very odd group of sociopaths

55:38.460 --> 55:40.460
That's true

55:40.460 --> 55:45.980
The title for your book early. Yes, it's called super you super. Yes, and uh, Hannah dance partlow who is here in the audience

55:45.980 --> 55:49.900
Yes, all the illustrations for it. She fucking killed it so hard

55:51.100 --> 55:52.780
and is amazing

55:52.780 --> 55:54.780
and yeah, the book is a

55:55.020 --> 55:56.300
Just a funny

55:56.300 --> 56:00.940
Self-esteem guide for young women to like women my age essentially and like a self-improvement guy

56:00.940 --> 56:03.900
Do you know of any other self-esteem guides for young women?

56:04.380 --> 56:08.140
Honestly, I I did look and I've read a few that are like adjacent

56:08.140 --> 56:14.460
But I didn't see any that weren't I didn't see any that any that were marketed towards like rookie age because I also write for rookie

56:15.260 --> 56:21.660
Like teen like teenage late early 20s late. Can you talk about just talk about self-esteem and young women while I

56:21.980 --> 56:23.980
Turn my mic down

56:24.140 --> 56:27.740
Because I don't want to mansplain and I don't want to but I think this is so important

56:28.140 --> 56:32.940
You're clearly the one to shepherd this flock. Well, I that's a that's a tall order

56:32.940 --> 56:40.140
Well, you are you are somebody who definitely like make your compassion and you're the combination of your compassion and your

56:40.380 --> 56:42.380
Vulnerability and your wisdom

56:42.380 --> 56:48.060
Makes me and I'm sure tons of women in this audience feel so good about themselves. Thanks everybody say

56:49.980 --> 56:50.940
A few weeks ago

56:50.940 --> 56:57.100
I was leaving like a like a pretty disheartening meeting and I saw that you were on a podcast where you talked about your fears

56:57.500 --> 57:01.580
And I was like, oh, I have to which is called terrified. Yeah, Dave Ross is yeah, that's a good one

57:01.580 --> 57:06.780
Yeah, but I was like, I have to hear Emily talk about what she's afraid of because I feel so terrible and my podcast wasn't

57:06.860 --> 57:09.580
Downloading fast enough and I was sitting in my car just crying

57:10.460 --> 57:12.620
But then I was like, oh, you're fine

57:16.860 --> 57:21.740
I'll say you can just call me we have each other's numbers. Just call me next time. Really? Yeah, of course

57:21.740 --> 57:29.900
I'm so I'm so excited about this. Tell me about your book. Well, uh, uh, talk about your book

57:33.260 --> 57:35.260
You have 20 seconds, okay

57:36.060 --> 57:41.820
About unicorns and uh, I I just I hated myself a great deal when I was younger

57:41.900 --> 57:44.620
I had a lot of self-loathing a lot of self-hatred self-hatred

57:44.940 --> 57:51.100
both for real reasons and for reasons that I created and then would not stop thinking about and I

57:51.100 --> 57:57.820
I I tried to think of what would have helped me when I was a teenager and super angry and super goth and not able

57:58.460 --> 58:02.300
Not that being goth is bad. Not that any of this is bad, but I this is where I was

58:02.940 --> 58:06.380
How goth did you get goth as fuck? You have no idea

58:07.100 --> 58:12.300
You have no idea her throwback thursday her throwback thursday game is tight

58:12.300 --> 58:24.380
It was pretty tight, uh, so I essentially like it kind of goes through like

58:24.940 --> 58:30.460
Just kind of getting you on your own team and understanding that you have to be on your own fucking team

58:30.540 --> 58:37.100
Because nobody else is going to be and they can be but how do you get a team? You are a team. You're already a team

58:37.100 --> 58:42.300
You're already there and just like kind of raising your awareness of what you're doing

58:42.700 --> 58:47.500
So that for so long I just kind of functioned on autopilot and this autopilot was like, I hate myself. I'm horrible

58:47.500 --> 58:50.620
I hate myself. I'm horrible and just at some point stopping and being like

58:51.020 --> 58:57.420
I'm doing this to myself and my life's just going by like either way if I spend my time hating myself or if I spend my time

58:58.140 --> 59:02.700
Learning to like myself in any capacity. It's happening either way. There's nothing I can do about it

59:02.700 --> 59:09.420
Yeah, deep deep cut down. Hey guys, you guys have to either talk softer or not. Yeah

59:10.460 --> 59:15.180
He has a very resonant voice. Yeah, it's not your fault. You're whispering, but I can feel it in my balls

59:17.820 --> 59:19.420
Kind of vibrates in there

59:19.420 --> 59:22.460
Yeah, so tend your own garden manage your own buttons

59:22.860 --> 59:27.420
You are in charge of your own experience if no matter how racist misogynist

59:28.140 --> 59:29.340
hurtful

59:29.340 --> 59:36.380
Vendictive unhealthy unbalanced in need of fixing your opponent is no matter what is happening to you

59:36.620 --> 59:41.180
It's fine to have reactions to it. Absolutely, but you are

59:41.900 --> 59:47.020
You're driving this boat you even if you decide not to make decisions. That's a fucking decision

59:47.340 --> 59:49.340
So like just start

59:49.420 --> 59:56.300
Like stopping on autopilot start having intentionality behind what you're doing like even if that means that you that doesn't mean that you have to make

59:56.300 --> 01:00:02.140
Like healthy choices at all, but like the buttons thing know what the fucking buttons are know what your buttons are and know

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:06.460
What presses them and what doesn't and then if you want to pick someone who pushes all the bad ones

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.260
You're picking them

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:13.900
But acknowledge that you are choosing them because you want those buttons pushed for some reason instead of like the world's just like happening to me

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:15.580
It's not you're making it happen

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:20.940
Even if by making it happen you're kind of giving up all control and deciding the universe is just out to get me

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:26.380
Right. I mean and and and always always always as an overriding thing

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:30.460
It's like you're always going to fuck up in that regard a thousand times

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.500
You're going to fuck that up in a thousand times. You can you can bring it back

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:40.220
But if to the extent that you are honest about yourself your experience your own shit

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.540
You're feeling including like walking away from somebody that's making you uncomfortable

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:51.740
Um not engaging somebody when the only thing at stake is you being right as opposed to being happy. Yep. Um the the

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.900
You that actually in my very very short experience

01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:01.660
Since bothering to go to therapy and start learning this shit. It's like I feel the world around me changing or maybe

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:07.020
Yeah, or maybe I'm just as I said before maybe I'm just creating a fucking delusional bubble around me

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.820
But if everyone created that same delusional bubble there would be no room left for fucking

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:18.060
Like nomads like everyone would be walking around on this big bubble where they insisted on their own comfort

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.180
Not to the herd of anyone else, but just insisting on their own comfort and safety

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:30.940
Yeah, and I think it's important because it seems like we're in a culture where confidence in women is seen as arrogance a lot

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:37.820
I think in guys it's sort of of arrogance and guys it's sort of valued whereas in women it's not like

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:44.140
Um that Amy Schumer sketch where she's like everyone they're like these scientists and they're all like apologizing all the time

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:50.220
Uh that sketch is fucking good. It's so genius and hard work. I didn't even get it until halfway through and it was just goddamn brilliant

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.460
Yeah, it's because we're dudes

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:58.380
Yeah, we did better. You're like I'm watching footage from a thing. That's that's how brilliant that sketch is

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.420
Yeah, like men watch it and they're like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.820
Let the moderator talk ladies

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.900
Oh

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.140
By that's a joke. I get it. Anyway

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.260
Pushed one of the wrong buttons there

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:22.300
But but I think that's why it's it's important and I know you and you you don't talk super you the idea is that

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:27.740
It's like about figuring out what the best version of yourself right now is and then figuring out how to get there

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:34.220
It's just becoming becoming your own superhero. Yeah, it's very vaguely superhero themed but kind of in a it's a very loose

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:39.260
Uh kind of theme but yeah, that is kind of the theme of it. I think they kind of like like like overarching like

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.580
I'm obsessed with like boiling things down to their most simplistic goal. Oh, shit. We totally look how healthy we've become

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.740
We're two minutes past 9 11

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:52.540
We didn't even celebrate it yet the whole front row saw and there was just a general wrestling intention

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.100
Um, I think it's it's almost like if there was a if you could try to boil everything down to this overarching thing

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.100
It has something to do with

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.100
Uh

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:10.380
Seeing past like what's right in front of you to like a more distant goal. Yeah, and actually making distant goals

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.060
That's your bat signal the actual that's the thing they're going towards

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:20.940
What how you use your fork and how you interact with your uncle and how you tweet and how you

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:26.540
If you if you don't view like five feet in front of you is how you should react five feet in front of you

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:31.340
If you if you instead go what I want is 15 feet in front of me. I'm gonna

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.820
Base everything five feet in front of me on and then asking yourself

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:40.300
Is what I'm doing right now getting me the thing that's 15 feet in front of me that I want and if it is okay

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:45.020
If it's not I gotta change it rather than just like just doing this do us doing this. Hopefully I'll get to that thing

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.220
Hopefully I'll get to that thing

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:57.020
No set the thing that you need and you want and then which is called being impeccable with your word and you all mocked me

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.020
The four agreements

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.300
Name all four real fast name the four agreements are

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.740
Don't take it personally. Don't take anything personally. Don't take anything personally

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.100
Baby come on

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.420
I'm trying to tell people about the four agreements

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.620
Be impeccable with your word, okay

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.460
Fuck I know the shitty one is do your best

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.980
That's the dumb one. You're like, okay, whatever the fuck that means. What's the other one? What's the other one god damn it?

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.700
No, we're not all white. That's not one of the agreements

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:38.460
That's not one of the agreements. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Don't make assumptions. That's actually one that needs more like study

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:42.460
What is this you came up with these?

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:46.940
Kind of Aaron Aaron Aaron found this book in high school called the four agreements

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.100
self-help book

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.100
And we we and uh

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:58.220
Total tech law Derek waters. We were talking we were we landed on it by talking. We were talking about like fan interaction

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:03.020
Actually, we were talking about like how like how it always goes great

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:09.180
And usually and like how sometimes it goes wrong and how it goes wrong. We were talking about ourselves as fans of other people

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:13.980
Like if you get into the elevator with somebody you admire like we were talking about like what what what happens in those moments

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:19.980
those supercharged moments of talking to a stranger and uh, you know, but also don't know at all

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:23.020
Yeah, and you want to make an impression and blah blah blah and all this stuff

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:29.100
I somehow from that discussion we landed some Aaron brought up like oh, well, it's one of the four agreements

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:34.060
Don't take it personally and it was like holy shit. Oh god. Jesus Christ. That's everything

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:40.060
So it's this it's it's a it's a fun little book from a while ago. It takes two hours

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.500
to listen to

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:47.340
Uh, let's get it up there. But the uh, but then I I tried to introduce these fucking assholes to

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:52.940
They were not having it. They're like they they think the first agreement is that we're all light

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:57.100
Paget Brewster made a mockery of it

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:03.180
Just because I've only listened to a half hour of it. Apparently. I'm not an authority

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.500
But I I haven't read it since college, but I totally don't remember the light

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:13.740
I should have it. That's a neat. It's the first part. He says we're all light and you're all we're all smoke

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.740
Wait, one of the four agreements is we're all light

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:25.500
No, you wouldn't know that from that from that podcast because Dan talked with 30 minutes about how we're all light

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.940
And you're smoke and it's all a dream. We all live in a dream

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:34.540
It's the same it's the same as Plato's shadows on the on the smoke. No, it's not the same as Plato's fucking shadows

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.980
So smoke is bad and light is good. Everything that's happening right now

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.620
is my dream

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:43.500
That's that's let's bring Padgett Brewster out everybody. That's

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:48.700
That's one of the four agreements. No, that's not one of the you're the genius

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:55.660
That everything that happens is our like it's through a filter of our emotional experiences. That's very true

01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.140
Yes, okay. That makes sense. So there's a technique that makes sense

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.940
I would I would be pretty certain that if that author had a could add a fifth agreement

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.020
It would be you should read the whole fucking book

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.340
Oh

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:15.660
But it's his fault. Don't do all four agreements in the first half hour. That's true. You gotta read that. The first half hour is all about smoke and light and mirrors and shit

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.460
So it's a magic book

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.780
When did the dragon show? I don't hear any of this. This is all happening in a dream. I don't care

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:33.980
Emily, uh, I have I have several teenage family members. Where is is your book cool to is there is there's some sex stuff

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:38.860
Yeah, but teenagers should know about sex stuff. Well, Judy Bloom took care of that shit

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:45.020
Are you there god? Yeah, uh, it's totally appropriate for teenagers. I would say and uh, I do talk about that

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:51.420
Uh, specifically that you all you view everything through the light of your experiences. I try to like if you back everything out

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:55.340
Yeah, I'm agreement. I'm in agreement. Just because she said the word light in a sentence

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.060
It sounds like

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.060
Sounds like she's in agreement

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.020
I'm in one of four

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.020
People that agree with your theories on this

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:09.180
Uh, yeah, like the idea of like if you back everything out if your life was a reality show

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.580
Like a very boring for most of you reality show

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.540
Ours are great reality shows mind you

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:17.340
I'm just saying everybody's life is ultimately very boring as reality show

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.740
But if you viewed it as a reality show and were divorced from your talking head segments of like

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.460
Well, I can't believe he did this and he did this because he's like this this happens because I he should know that

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.580
I don't like you just viewed the situation objectively

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:34.300
Like that's you kind of you've got to learn to divorce that some of the shit is your shit

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.620
And you can't bring it anything because the other person you're talking to doesn't have any fucking clue

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.220
What you're talking head segment is because the only thing you can do is control yourself

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:49.340
That's a kind of cross-stitch a very beautiful thing that hopefully will be an item you can only control yourself

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.420
You have no control over anybody else

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.460
whatsoever

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.580
So you have to like if you're in a confrontation with someone or in a conversation

01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:01.020
And just realize that take yourself out of it and watch as it if it was on television because if it was

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:05.820
You would never you would just see two characters interacting and all you can judge is those interactions

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.980
Everybody comes with their own baggage and their own shit

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:11.660
And you would never judge the dude that was like just hanging out

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.780
If you if you saw if another guy was like

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.380
If there was just a guy going

01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.300
Like that you'd be like you wouldn't be like what a pussy. What a fucking asshole. What an idiot

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.900
You'd be like, I'm gonna want to learn more about that guy David Hyde Pierce

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.460
Well, she created an illustration of a cross-stitch because I was like wouldn't it be cool

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:39.580
If you had like a cross-stitch like old old timey pillow or like a thing of you can only control yourself

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:43.020
So she made this gorgeous thing that looks just like a cross-stitch

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:46.380
That's a page in the book. I'm hoping we can make another thing out of

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:49.580
It's but yeah, we're gonna make posters out of it all these things are like

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.220
It's so hard to like sometimes I'll get into these

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:58.620
Twitter things and then you're right. Nobody's gonna change. Nobody's changed their mind about anything since like the fucking 90s

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.700
we all

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:06.300
We all nobody changed so and I'll get into these fights with you. I have a new can I tell you I've adopted a troll strategy

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.380
Yes with people. I'll tell you what it is. I'm not proud of it. Actually. I love it

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:17.900
I have a new strategy because a lot of times you'll be talking to people and they just want to it becomes a semantic argument

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:22.140
Where they like just want to contradict you and it's not about the meaning anymore. It's about defeating the person

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:22.940
It's not about anything

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.940
Yeah, it's about defeating the person

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:31.020
From your 140 character tweet, they're picking one word. Yes, and I do that too. It's like, whoa, wait

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.580
If leather is the glue

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.420
So I have this new thing

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:40.300
So if if somebody like because I'll get people, you know, so if somebody ever like calls me indian

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:44.460
I'm like that's racist. I'm Pakistani. I know research is hard. So I'll do that

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.060
But then I'll do so then at the other day I tweeted

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:53.340
I was like, hey, my people are looking to trade bobby gendle and exchange will take literally anything

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.220
I said that he's an indian

01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:03.500
And so then people will be like, um, you're Pakistani. He's indian do some research. I'm like, actually, uh, indian pakistan was the same country

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.820
until 1947 so

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.860
I know research is hard

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.220
What a piece of shit

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:15.020
I'm like, yeah, I got you coming. I got you going

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.580
You cannot win with kumail Nanjiani. Wait kumail

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:24.540
Are you saying you said you laid that trap you knew people were going to say that so that you could come?

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.340
No, but I came up with it right then and I was like, this is great

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:32.220
If you call me pakistani, I can be like actually we're all kind of indian

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:37.020
And if you call me indian you're racist because i'm pakistani. You really can't win. You cannot win

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:40.220
He's saying like the first instinct is to make people laugh to make people happy

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:43.580
And then the second instinct if somebody comes back and goes like

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.460
You're joke. I'm not laughing at it

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:52.860
But I have a different spot and there's my response. So that guy if you agree to go out in the alley with that guy

01:11:54.140 --> 01:12:00.140
The crime has been committed and what goes out on that alley is your business and it's like you're saying like, yeah, you bring out a

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.020
corkscrew and

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.260
Yeah, I'm not playing fair now

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:09.820
Not playing fair because you shouldn't be out there. You shouldn't be out there. You have a water gun. I have a fucking maze

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:16.460
Don't because you shouldn't be out there. That's a great, but we should probably talk about I mean just that that one little inkling

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.020
though is like the reason you go out there is

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.420
That's a classic example. You must you must be going connection

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:31.500
Well, I mean that person is correcting. Oh, yes. Yes. That's what I that's they want to piece they want to be in a conversation

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.900
That's also no, no, no. I'm saying I'm saying the reason you go out there. I know the reason

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:40.220
Yeah, the reason the the statler and wall dwarf guys are like calling shit out

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:44.860
Why does kermit start engaging statler and wall dwarf? The reason is because for

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.620
Some part of what they're saying kermit's like, you know what the muppet show is full of shit

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:58.220
It's just some part and it doesn't matter if it's true or not, right? But can we all acknowledge that that that's what brings us out

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:02.620
There into that alley. I think sometimes if I engage with the twitter troll. I'm in a bad mood

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:08.460
I've got something that has irritated me that day and I don't want to take it out on that person or that or I can't

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.180
So I'm like, here's a person that will take my shit

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:19.340
And I give them my shit and I fucking I have that same thing if I'm in a shitty mood like I'm never sure of my own opinions

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.660
Uh, then when I haven't gotten enough sleep

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.860
Like he's a real bear you guys. Isn't that saying the same thing?

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:29.340
And I was like, isn't it just like unconsciously? Isn't it part of you when you

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:36.140
To continue using that metaphor when you go out into that back alley and choose to have that person to person

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:39.740
stiletto knife fight, which I just recently did with a dude today

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:46.940
Where I I always what was the meat and potatoes of that thing or is that even worth I retweeted? I'm happy to tell you

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:57.020
I I retweeted a very funny joke by some stranger who said I would like to see a reality show where vine stars are executed

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.340
I clicked a fucking buttons

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:06.380
You know retweet and and because I clicked that button then in my feed

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:11.980
And remember how I said I'm so happy because I've started blocking people like twitter has been a positive experience for me

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.300
then this guy this this guy just

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:20.780
This is in my feed it goes like that's a that's a funny thing coming from a guy who let community turn into dog shit

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:27.580
And and and I was like I was like unrelated, but but there's some part of what do you mean unrelated?

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.780
You're not related. Yes. His thing is unrelated. Yes. I thought you were gonna say unreli- god damn it. Fuck you

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.620
You could have posted a picture of flower and they'd be like that's a pretty flower

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:42.620
But obviously something's drawing me. I'm following some I'm following something. What were you following? Let's talk about it

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.100
So I'm following the fact that I don't think community

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:49.100
I don't you want to disagree with him and let him know that you disagree

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:55.180
I want to I want to I want to know that the guy who says that is definitely a bad person

01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:01.980
You want reassurance that if someone has a bad I want to know it's not morgan freeman like logging in

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.020
I've been like not that morgan freeman is not a piece of shit. I'm sure he is but

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:12.860
That guy positive or negative was trying to connect with you in some way whether or not it was good or bad

01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.580
Into your he wanted whatever's going on in his end. I'm sorry. I'm talking about

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:24.220
Can we all acknowledge what's drawing us into these knife fights is a suspicion?

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.820
I think

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:31.180
Malcolm acts I really really am going into out of my jurisdiction, but I think there's a quote from

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:34.140
So someone just flew across the room

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.100
I'm so curious what the next thing you have to say is someone wanted to go

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.580
And it turned into

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.140
And they're now they now

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.980
Are dead because of me

01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:47.500
And I apologize

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500
I'm going to assume that person's black

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:53.900
And I apologize for that person. Um, I saw him not black. Okay

01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:58.460
You know what now that you say that fucking makes sense fucking white people. They're pieces of shit

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.900
Oh, see black people are sitting hanging out. Yeah

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.100
No, there's no one here

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.300
You just called morgan freeman a piece of shit

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.540
fuck him

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.140
uh, the

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:17.340
What I think it could have been Malcolm acts it could have been it could have been let's just say let's just say it was

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:25.580
Be and I'm gonna paraphrase it and fuck it up behind all of the stripe

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:31.500
This the the the racial like tension all of these things is the is the suspicion

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.380
We have to let go of that anything we're talking about is true

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.620
It's the on both sides

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:43.340
It's like what like white racists thinking that something they're saying has any founding and also on the victim side

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.340
Like the idea that that that you can victimize somebody to the point where they actually believe

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:53.580
So you're concerned that the suspicion you have a suspicion that this person on twitter might be right that you did like community

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:58.940
Go to shit. Is that what you're saying? That's what he's saying, but I don't know. I don't know if that's for me

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.500
It's not like if I say bobby gentle is a piece of shit

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:04.940
There is no doubt in my mind that got that guy is harmful

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:09.420
And I'm not fighting him because I'm like maybe he is a good guy. No, I see the talk to his children

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.300
He's a horrible monster. That's you putting fruit out by a

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:19.420
Wayside that's your you grew that you that's not you respond. I'm talking about somebody coming up to your fruit

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:21.820
Yes

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.820
You

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.020
You made the perfect example

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:31.100
You went out into the alley with the guy we're like you said the opposite of the other thing

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:37.980
You're like, yeah, well pakistan was part of india because you're is there there's a suspicion there when the guy called you out

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.140
You're what you were reacting to what drew you out into the alley

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:50.300
The the way that someone agrees to try weird shit in 50 shades of gray is some white rabbit that says to you

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:53.260
I have parts of me that I haven't fucking like

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:59.260
Like the guy is calling you out and going like you're and you're going fucking call me out

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:05.100
Like and you're going out into that alley because not because you you've got all your shit sealed up

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.740
You're going out of that alley because you're like, oh wait

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:10.620
right

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.060
Um

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:18.060
I don't know about that specific example, but I know what you're saying and I agree with you

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:23.100
When somebody says like hey, you're if somebody says like hey, you're not good in this thing

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:27.740
I probably fight back because part of me is afraid that i'm not good in that thing

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.980
I think that's I think that is part of it

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:36.460
But the most important part of that making no assumptions and taking nothing personally is is visualizing that that other person

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:48.220
Has their own like that guy who tweeted it. He's got his own shit. Yeah, like you would never none of us on the stage would ever tweeted anybody

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.300
I just thought of something horrible that I

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:55.580
That I was telling you about that happens to me when I'm playing Mortal Kombat with strangers online

01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:01.260
But I'm not gonna say that reaching out to a creative and saying like well, that's great

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:06.140
But everything you do is terrible like that's that person's that's what do you say in Mortal Kombat?

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.420
No, I turned my mic off, but I think it

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:15.100
Well, I kind of it's horrible. It's very very bad. Just say it. No, it's bad

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:20.140
No, come on. It's like can we make this a safe place? Is this a no judgment zone? I don't feel good about it

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:22.780
It's a no judgment. Okay

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.340
Don't judge me on this. This is me at my worst

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:30.620
And I say so I will play Mortal Kombat and it's just because it's one person

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:36.300
I get like really into it and I really want to win and then some people I'm not as good as a lot of people are

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:41.340
They'll they'll they'll beat me and then I could tell that they're fucking shitty

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.140
I could tell when I'm playing someone. I'm like, oh, you're a bad person

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:48.860
Not by their skill, but by like how this spam moves and I think I'm

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:53.980
Is there an honorable way to play? Yes. Yeah, you don't you don't spam fireballs

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:55.980
Yes, you don't spam fireball

01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:00.300
I'm fire when the fifth and that's that's that's the title

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:05.820
Move over and over. Yes. You I and I'm on pretty solid footing. I think yeah

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:11.900
It's a personality test and and also Spencer. Yes when they beat me because they're fucking the fireballs

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:15.100
They like come and they like um teabag me, right?

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:21.580
And now I'm like, you're a bad person. Yeah, and I want to turn my mic on and be like, I'm gonna show an HBO

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:23.580
This is all you have. You're not

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:28.140
No shame no shame

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:33.260
He's tell and I still horrible because it's fucking true. I still watch how you feel

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.820
And I want to be like

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:43.340
And every and everyone playing a fucking mortal karmic fuck these kids. They should always know that I have talked to academy award

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.580
winning not nominated

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.340
winning actors

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:52.940
Who go through the same thing and I tell they they have come to me. We've talked about like online video games

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:59.900
Fucking people who have Oscars multiple Oscars. Amis are like, they're like, man this fucking kid look fucking

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:06.940
Call me a bag and I said, did you tell him Scorsese? He loves you

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:15.020
But by the way, and then they go no no because I don't like why not he's bringing out everything teach that fucking piece of

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:20.060
Shit, but here's what would happen if he said that the kid would go fucking hate that show is fucking stupid

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:23.180
That's what would happen. That's it. Scorsese. It's not possible

01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:29.900
No, you're right. You're right. You should never scorsese spam anybody on it. It's a there's no way to prove it

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:37.100
Oh, we should all tell everyone that we're scorsese. It is so gratified never has a question anything felt I've never done that

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:39.260
But I feel it every now and then

01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:41.660
He does say it out loud in our house but not on a mic

01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:44.940
Huh, wait, I thought you no I turned I I

01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:49.900
I just threw a whole museum you said we're I thought no no no

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:53.900
I want to turn the mic on and say it, but I don't I don't do it because they'll know

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:59.020
Oh, okay, it's that fucking guy if they watch the show and that's me arrogant assuming they watch the show

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:03.500
That's true. I would know they would know I I have I guess I should what I should say is

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:06.380
I'm not gonna say

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:12.860
You said it watches it you fucking say it. I'm on a very popular CBS show. What have you this is all you have

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.740
Just change the network

01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:20.460
I have the opposite impulse to like tell the person how much they hurt me

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:24.540
But see but you're doing that because you want them to feel bad you want to shame them

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:30.060
I yeah, I think what do you spread? You're not like spreading like oh, let me explain to you emotions

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.140
You're like, no, I want to make you feel bad. I think that's right

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.660
I want to I want to like reckon with them and be like we're in the same room and I'm another human being and you just like

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:43.980
Spewed this really shitty thing at me and I want you to like look in my my bloodshot crying eyes

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.300
Which is why I send those gifts

01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:53.580
Just one I've I've done that a lot and I think I think that's I think that on the scale of things that are

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:58.460
effective ineffective a good way to live your life and then that's definitely way closer

01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:04.460
The the irony is but but but however like I usually do it vindictively

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.740
Don't you kind of like are you kind of like I would do it

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:11.420
I would go like hey, man, that really hurts my feelings. Like I know I'm high-roading though

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:15.660
Yeah, that's it the knowledge that you're high. So I think I think you have to cross it

01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:18.140
Yeah, you're really going to do that. You have to cross the threshold and go like hey, man

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:23.820
Like you have to be actually I don't do it vindictively, but I think that you guys are in a better place

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:30.860
I do it out of like like hey like you're right. I am a dirty piece of shit

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.220
Um, I am a feminist BJ Giver

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:41.100
And that hurts me you saying that because I I mean it's just this is just going to continue to be depressing

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:43.180
I'm going to start saying that I am Camille

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.380
Tell everyone you're Camille

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:51.740
Just tell everyone you're I have the only really problem I have on twitter is that people threaten in portuguese to bathe

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:55.740
To bathe in my blood because they think I'm the guy that created fucking Teen Wolf on MTV

01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:00.540
Wait, is that a threat or is that the sexiest thing ever?

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:03.500
Does Teen Wolf

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:10.780
Chill a portuguese no no no the creator of MTV's Teen Wolf is Jeff Davis who's not on twitter for fucking good reason because

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.980
But why is it portuguese people loads of uh,

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:18.700
Portuguese like like Brazilians and turkish people are constantly you don't want the turk sangria

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:26.300
No, shit. No, I get I get I get threatened with like decapitation and bloodbaths and like really like like that's racist

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:27.660
So they're fans

01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:29.180
I just did that

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:31.180
I bated you into something that I was like come on

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:36.940
You're not be bigger. You're not turkish be bigger than that. You're not you don't get to have the whole fucking near east man

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:44.380
You don't want the church mad at you and jump said you're right because I'll kill you. Fuck you. You've written

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.820
You would say that

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.820
I could say that because they're my people

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:53.980
My people can expand and contract

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:59.260
Based on my needs the turks have hated the pakistanis for fucking centuries. We're all the same

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:10.540
You won't be able to tell pakistanis and turks apart in a lineup and if you can't you're racist

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:16.460
You're not gonna win this one jeff. I'm sorry. He's got a lot of practice. I'm sorry. Go ahead. What about so

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:21.100
Uh turks and portuguese people love the show hate the show hate the world. I think they love it

01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:27.100
They love it, but that I keep apparently I not like the other jeff davis keeps killing off characters

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.300
They love or the people that they ship they were jiggies giant. Oh

01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.660
I'm not shipping the right characters

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:37.180
So it's like we want more of these two characters to fuck on teen wolf

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:40.060
And if not, I will come to your house and viscerate you

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:44.780
I this this is so I had to go on google translate and to find out what i'm fucking being threatened with

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:50.380
And when I hit when I when I pull off a giant block of text and to put it into translate. I'm like, oh

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:56.700
Well in all fairness to the portuguese that's just shipping like

01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:03.100
There's a lot of portuguese portuguese people that are just watching teen wolf and being like wow. He's a teen and a wolf

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:08.300
I I was recently the portuguese shippers. You're the ones that are finding you now. You're being racist

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:12.540
I was recently listening to a podcast that I very very much enjoy that

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:18.860
I will not name in this moment that was talking about silicon valley and then brought up Kumail and someone said

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:23.660
Well, and yeah, he's pakistani and someone said no, no, no, you're being racist. He's indian

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.940
And well, they are

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.740
No, or are they? Yeah

01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:35.660
Only time we'll tell you it depends on whether they like the show or not. Yeah. Yeah. Did they like the show?

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.380
Yeah

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:44.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no my no Mary said because they it was in the context of them talking about like feminism on the show

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.540
But they really love the show and they think you're great

01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:50.140
And then someone's like no, no, no, I know him. He's indian and I like

01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:51.980
I

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:55.820
I got really fired up about it for some reason and not out of anger

01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.660
But I was like, maybe I'll make a fake account and maybe I'll say oh my god

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:04.700
Yeah, and maybe I'll say you're wrong and do an egg. There's an emotion

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:08.940
My face started to smush and just like a flat land

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:11.020
I think there's an emotion that we haven't named yet

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:14.860
Which is like it's like when you have knowledge that the other person doesn't and you know

01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:19.020
You're right and they don't know you're right and you're getting ready to drop the fucking hammer

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:23.900
That is such a good feeling and I don't there's no work for it. And I'm sure the germans have one

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.300
But I love that feeling

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:34.220
Yeah, but the problem is even that is subjective because you know the germans thought they had good knowledge about something

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:37.420
And turned out they weren't right about it. They they called that monday

01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:44.620
Well, did you hear did you hear the this american life that came out a couple weeks ago where they talked about how when people who are

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:49.740
Faced with an alternative view about an opinion that might make no sense

01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:55.660
Like if I say no, the world is flat and someone comes to them and says no, here's here's a satellite picture of the earth

01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:01.340
They're more likely to double down on there. It's confirmation bias. It's called confirmation bias then to like

01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:03.500
Then to believe what you say. So we're all

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.380
Confirmation bias is just the idea that once you have an idea and you're like, this is correct

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.020
You'll only seek out information that like

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:17.180
Reinforces the belief you have and if you get any information that doesn't reinforce it. You're like, well, that's completely wrong

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:25.660
And I think that's fucking great news. Don't you because no no, I mean for real like that is the

01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:30.460
God particle that we've been looking for because that lets us all off the hook

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.460
Look, don't you fucking start?

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:37.260
You'll see I don't understand. No, just don't they already found a bad part. I'm about to explain it

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:44.540
We spent hours writing the show it'll come back or if if it is instinctive to primates to do that

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:50.940
Which I would applaud because primates should not automatically just go. Oh, I think I'll do this

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.940
Oh, you said that I'll do that

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:57.740
If that is a thing that we have to overcome then we all get to just say

01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:02.620
Okay, okay, that's a thing that happens to me because I experience it every fucking day

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:09.340
It when when I read an essay about the misogyny of pirates of the caribbean 2

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.900
Beyond the pearl of the so sexist

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.460
It's like because

01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:17.580
It doesn't help that the person is not funny is never funny

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.740
Anyone who's going to write that article is like a fucking like like just joyless

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.980
They're not one of the good ones

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:26.460
They're not one of the good ones

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:30.380
They're not one of the good ones, but but overriding that is like my sense of like, you know

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:36.140
I always always feel that checkered that hinge that safety valve that goes like

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:40.380
Oh, are you telling me that now this is going to be that fuck that?

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.820
Where's it end? What is it end? What are we going to do?

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.940
What does it take for you? Is michael sarah going to play shaft?

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.980
Uh, that would be great. No one's calling for that. Uh, that would be so great

01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:57.420
Uh, what what what does it take for you to change your mind about something generally?

01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:02.620
Uh, uh to be fucking honest with you the reason for my, uh

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:10.620
Enthusiasm for you. It takes it takes acquiescence. It takes it takes positivity. It takes that's why I was so

01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:14.140
adamant about like what what can we what can we figure out about?

01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:21.580
Like the way you approach things because I have never in my in the in the years that I have known you I'm

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:28.780
I'm positive that if I was ever going to exhibit characteristics or thoughts or ideals or semantic

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:35.660
Flurbs that that would possibly trigger you. I've definitely probably threw them toward you at some point

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.980
I'm sure they've floated down

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:44.700
So I'm sure you and you've never made it my problem and you've never you've never all never capitulated

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:48.700
You've never we're not we don't we don't we don't drink together every night

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:55.820
We're not like blood brothers and pinky swear brothers and and let's let's agree to to alter each other's reality brothers

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:58.700
You're just you're a virtual stranger to me

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:03.980
With that that just is impeccable with their word

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.060
Leave it then

01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:14.460
And and and invites people upward upward like like when you say

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:20.220
Like here is a list of ways that you can tell people that they're a good person without telling them how they look

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:25.500
And you there is nothing in that communicate that suggests to you

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:31.740
That you're a defective unit. We like we like you so much. There is everything in that communicate that suggests to you that you

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:35.820
Have an ability to repair yourself and and evolve upward

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:39.500
So you always feel like you're winning in video games

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:44.060
We wouldn't play video games if every like you're doing this wrong you fuck off

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.060
Yeah, you you fucked up start over

01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:52.620
What happens in video games and the reason people are addicted to them is because that is the effect that video games have on people

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:58.700
They go they go congratulations on running across this log a thousand times. That's a very good analogy

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:05.900
That's actually a really great analogy. Here's a here's a diagram you can use to make a sword that kills ghouls better

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.220
Yeah

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:13.740
There's nothing no one ever says you're killing ghouls wrong. I'm gonna rape you

01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:17.260
That's because I'm playing you use the word rape as a metaphor you

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.660
I'm gonna stop listening to your podcast

01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:25.180
That's so true because I'm playing Arkham Knight right now and it was so horrible

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:28.780
It's like uh, you're batman and you can't find your way out of this police station

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.340
You're fucking batman

01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:33.740
What are you doing? It's not like that

01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:38.140
No, but that's actually what Emily is really good at and what you said earlier is dying

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.700
I feel like everybody just probably

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.340
We have some bad news Emily. You died in 9-11

01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.780
Your chest results just came back

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:50.780
You died in 9-11

01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:54.460
What you're really good at is keeping your eye on and you didn't work in the buildings

01:32:54.460 --> 01:33:01.820
Yeah, why was I there? You were one of the pilots. What do you think the fucking arc is?

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.540
I love my dad. Okay, go ahead

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:11.900
Well, I think you is always keeping your eye on the prize and getting what you want to get out of an interaction

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:17.660
For instance, like if I'm uh, if we're supposed to fly on a flight like and this really happened and they Emily

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:22.780
They checked Emily and they're like, oh no, we bumped you to the next flight and I'm like that is I'll get like self righteous

01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:25.900
I'll get like this is wrong. This is immoral

01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.500
This is not good

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:31.500
Fucking fix it and Emily's like Emily will befriend them and talk to them nicely

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.540
I dare you to be better

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:36.860
She says and then get them to and her like this was a couple weeks ago

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:40.620
Emily was supposed to have some surgery and they called and they were like, oh, we can't do it anymore

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:44.460
And I taken the week off she taken the week off to do it and I was like give me their number

01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:47.820
I will talk to them and she's like that's the worst idea

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.780
Yeah, I have an HBO show

01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.780
I am pretty good

01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:57.820
You're supposed to cut my wife open and fix her insides and I had to meet you do it when you're supposed to do it

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.180
And I don't care if you're stressed out or angry while you're cutting her open

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.180
What Emily did was yeah

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:07.980
You don't want waiters to spit in your food and you don't want the doctor angry. You want the performing surgery

01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:10.220
But what Emily did was she's like, okay

01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:14.300
Hung up the phone was like angry and sort of dealt with it and then called back

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:17.820
Befriended the person on the phone and got the job

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:24.220
Yeah, it got it. It happened. My technique never works. No not once and you keep doing it

01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:26.780
It's calling it a technique is really overstated

01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:29.740
I have to pull you away from stuff

01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:35.260
I have to like pull you away from yelling and screaming and raging it. Well, I don't do that all the time

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:37.260
Certainly not. I but I don't

01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:39.500
No, no, just when things fuck up. Well

01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:43.260
You make me sound like a horrible person. No, you're a wonderful person

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:49.660
It's like when something happens that I feel like I have this thing where I want everyone to do their job

01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:55.340
Right, and if they don't do it, right, then I get like I'm I get a little indignant and I get self-righteous

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.940
And I'm like, this is your job because that's always what gets you the results

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:03.980
Because you feel like if you don't do something about something people are gonna fuck you

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:10.140
Yes, I have that thing since the kid because I was you know, bullied as a kid. I'm like this fucking person's bullying me

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:14.860
I'm not gonna take it anymore. Yeah, but we don't know that world anymore. Nobody ever

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:20.140
There's there's examples of fucking like dumb archetypes of like, hey, listen, you fucking

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:23.020
I'm gonna do

01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.980
Yeah, it's it's primarily fictional the

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:33.340
And the important thing is if you start to apply this idea of like, oh, actually, I'm just gonna be chill

01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.980
It's important to note like

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.260
you're

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:42.380
Once you're chill, you're gonna get you're gonna there's gonna be all kinds of people getting away with all kinds of shit

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:46.780
Yes, but letting them get away with it and walking around them walking away from them

01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:51.020
You're gonna end up getting farther faster so much further than anybody

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:55.420
I literally picture it like the sims like have you guys played the sims come on

01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:59.500
Come on sims people where you at where you have those like gauges over your head

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:03.100
There's little like bars over your head that tell you like this is how hungry you are the cell whatever

01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:09.820
Like that's how much power you have and for me to like let someone else make me that angry over something that they're

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:14.860
They genuinely can't do anything about that's me giving them my power. I don't want to give them my fucking power

01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:18.940
That's mine. You don't get to have that. Do you want to give up your ease is what my therapist gets egg

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.780
Do you want to give up your ease?

01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:26.300
Yeah, like you've worked hard to be at ease. Do you want to give that to this fucking guy?

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.220
This person on twitter doesn't deserve it

01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:32.220
This like this poor lady who is just giving me bad news that the doctor's office didn't deserve it

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:34.380
And also if I befriended her she helped me out

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:39.580
But uh, I always think of it like you have a certain amount of cake that you have to give to people

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.700
You have cake you have delicious wonderful cake you can give it out

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:48.060
But if you're not interacting with people that give you eggs and milk and flour and vanilla

01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.700
You don't get to make any more

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.740
Cake analogies

01:36:54.620 --> 01:37:01.580
Even better. That's a good metaphor. I like that a lot. Yeah, so you can run out of fucking cake if you're not hanging out with me

01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.580
You don't want to do that

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:09.020
Yeah, that's great. That's terrifying actually. I'm I'm afraid now. I have a lot of phone calls to make

01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:15.180
Two two egg egg people and flour people first of all Aaron. Sorry

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:20.380
Give me more eggs. I don't want to jinx things, but this is not only my favorite episode of the podcast

01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.780
This is my been the favorite two hours of my life

01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:25.980
the we should also like

01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:32.220
Christian it with uh, that felt that felt fake just you know, that felt real fake

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.780
No more. No more. It's his favorite

01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:38.380
Yeah, and it now now it sucks. You took the cake and you kept the eggs. You're all

01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:43.980
You're a bunch of dirty egg people. They wanted to be part of the favorite episode. That's racist

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:47.180
Well, I mean we got we got we got yeah

01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:49.740
We got a little so god i'm crossing my fingers

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:53.580
Are we do we have the right combination? Do we have the right number of people to just play shadow run?

01:37:53.580 --> 01:38:00.540
Do we have to fucking like get complicated? Let's just fucking roll the bones, baby. Uh, I think we um, we we have

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:05.580
We got de morge back there and uh, yeah, let's bring de morge brown out right now

01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.620
We can put these together you sit in the middle

01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:22.620
Yeah

01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.620
Who's gonna fuck de morge if he sits right there?

01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.900
I think we're yeah, we're getting a mic right zack

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:32.940
I have a uh, I have a revolutionary idea if we're assuming that we that

01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:36.700
Like I would have somebody else play

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:42.220
Jim nightblade and I I could play like mpc characters. Uh, who does it good bruce willis?

01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:45.180
No one. I don't think anyone does

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.460
Can you do a good bruce willis bit?

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:51.660
No, it'd be it'd definitely be de morge. I would assume but uh

01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:56.380
Come here. How long has it been? Jim nightblade. Come here. How long has it been since you played dr

01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:58.380

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.740
Yeah

01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:06.140
You know that Curtis. I'm strong has played your character with great aplomb and alacrity. Yeah, I heard

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:10.060
He's okay

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:25.340
You know what all right, so who's who's familiar with my character? I I would like like I will I want to like

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:30.380
Play npcs and have somebody somebody played jim. Yeah, you play jim nightblade de morge

01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:33.180

01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:35.980
I Spencer calm down. It just usually they're

01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:38.860

All hell's broken loose here at meltdown comics. He doesn't need to be on camera. That's that's um

Best cookies in the biz. That's an amazing name. There's a good name. All right. Is that an actual guy from shadowrun?

01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:54.860
Yeah

01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:58.220
He's a shadowrun reference

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.420
Last time on Harmontown

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:07.180
Tiptoeing past piles of dead bodies with brow bald when brown btl chip research in hand

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:12.700
The posse exited the hospital joined by their controversial new frenemy jesse yellowman

01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:18.540
From the safety of dr. Friends force shield or force five shimmering force energy wall

01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:24.860
Nightblade took the time to taunt the remaining guards with rude gestures before joining the party in their escape

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:29.180
They're among piles of broken and suspiciously used room buzz

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:37.900
Rehydrated pizza crust an empty empty aluminium sputnik one cans the party listened to brown and yellowman's turncoat proposal

01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:43.180
However, the reward of owing the party free in exchange for the betrayal of their employers

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:49.820
Created a rift hordegarde and nightblade heatedly argued with mercy and dr. Friend over remuneration

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:56.300
Reputation and the code of ethics of shadowrunners as the argument reached its fever pitch

01:41:56.700 --> 01:42:03.340
Nightblade seized the chance to surprise and turn the tables on yellowman only to be sent to the ground by his top

01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:06.620
Notch evasive jubu robo judo moves

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:13.340
Who's on the side of cause and who's on the side of cash will jim and the gang have to dance before yellowman's

01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:17.500
non laser razor blades or where cooler heads prevail

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:22.540
Let's find out now on shadowrun Harmontown time

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:29.020
ebb and gooberman ebb and gooberman

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:35.660
I have one question. Okay. I have a thousand but you go first million. Did you say aluminium?

01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.140
It was it was hyphenated. It was very clear which

01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:45.740
Syllables were meant to be stressed the British minimum. Um, I think dan you should play your character

01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:49.500
How many and I should split this but there's someone who knows what's going on. I think so

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.580
No backing for it. Just yes he ended come on

01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:57.500
I'm doing Emily you're you're you're playing a uh

01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.740
This you wrote a book about self-esteem for women

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:07.260
So i'm uniquely qualified you're playing a character that just failed to stun baton a guy that now has

01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:09.980
Compromise you you're a bounty hunter and you talk like bruce willis

01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:14.460
So so we we had we had said no to jesse yellowman's uh proposal. Oh, yeah

01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:21.100
Nightblade jumped the gun and stun batoned him. Well, he tried to we didn't succeed. Are we all in the same room right now?

01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:25.420
Yeah, you're all in uh nightblades apartment. Okay. I I approached jesse

01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:28.460
Uh, he's got a stun baton. He's holding it towards you

01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:30.380
menacingly

01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:34.540
Hortiga draws his alpha assault rifle and points it in his direction. All right

01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:39.660
All right, uh using using my charisma

01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:42.460
My exceptional charisma

01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:48.140
Hey, jesse. Sorry jim's going through some stuff. Can we can we talk?

01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:50.860
Uh

01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:56.140
I don't know. Why don't you all put your weapons down? Maybe we could talk with weapons not out

01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:01.900
All right, I like that guys. Can we put our can we put our weapons kind of down? He puts the baton down first

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:07.580
May I ask you a question? Am I stunned? What's my situation right now? You are not stunned. You're just disarmed right now

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:11.420
You're just done. You went for do not compliment my looks

01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:15.900
You may you may hey, I would love to

Very sorry. Take that out. Can we

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:29.180
He's not he's not a fuck guy. He's not a fuck guy. He's reading it right off the sheet though. That's

01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:32.380
Yeah, that's my character

01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:38.220
So I have been disarmed. I've I've been disarmed. Uh jim nightblade. That's nightblade

01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:43.020
Yeah, so basically what happened is like two seconds before we started you're like, huh?

01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:47.900
And then failed utterly and then he grabbed the stub baton out of your hand. So let's everyone

01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:53.980
Let's put our weapons down. Let's put our weapons on three minds already down. I'll count. All right. Is everyone on one?

01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:55.740
two

01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:57.740
three

01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:08.780
All right, I just take a moment to say this this world is crazy

01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:15.020
It's like in any other situation we'd be best friends and here we are fighting so

01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:16.940
No

01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:23.340
But wasn't wasn't uh, jim nightblade wasn't your whole point about not agreeing with uh, jesse ellum

01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:29.740
And that we have to obey our own code of ethics. We should follow through on the original plan, right? Everybody's got a code

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:31.740
I

01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:49.580
I'm gonna fire my grapple gun. No and try to escape it. I'm trying to escape. Are you hot?

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:55.020

Okay, I I tried to I tried to fire my grapple gun to get to escape merely to escape. It's your apartment

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:09.260
Yeah, I'm trying to escape firing the grapple gun out your window

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:14.940
It hits a nearby rooftop and

01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:19.100
Holds fast

And I I play along that was funny dude. That was funny

01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:27.500
Hortegaard hortegaard with your innate reflexes and combat senses you feel

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.500
Some shit's gonna go down

01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:37.020
You're the only person with the reflexes fast enough to react before he uses his crazy reflexes to do fast things

01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:39.100
I've got crazy reflexes

01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.140
Yep

01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:42.620
Well, you did that's why you went earlier. Okay, good

01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:49.740
Uh, I draw uh again the alpha salt rifle which is loaded also with shock rounds and shoot him with shock rounds

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.900
Or shoot them in his direction. All right

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:55.900
All right, that one you get him

01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:01.020
Yeah

01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:05.580
Okay, what is it? Uh, no regions would say hiya

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:11.340
You hit him square in the chest and you see electricity ripple through his body

01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:20.140
You hit him strongly in his chest and he's knocked back a couple feet just by the impact of the blow and as the

01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:27.660
Electricity flows through him. He crumples to the floor as if in cardiac arrest. I released the grapple from the roof next door

01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:29.660
I'm back. I'll stay

01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:34.700
Hortegaard would like to

01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:36.620
That was a perfect sound

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:41.020
Uh, hortegaard consulting the group quickly people. Is there anything that we need to derive from this person?

01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:46.380
Is there any reason to keep him around? Dr. Friend would wait. Are we talking about killing him? Is that what you mean?

01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:52.540
Is Baldwin Brown in the room too? No, we just have Jesse. Yep. Um, well

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.420
Prior to the tease

01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.500

01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:07.260
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't want to medicate, but who's Jesse's just a guy we ran into. Yeah

01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:13.580
He was working for someone who is trying to dissuade you from your mission. How about this? I have a pitch you guys

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:15.980
We kill him. No, no, no, hold up

01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:19.340
Uh, two pizza guys four hours one girl

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:25.900
I prefer the non-lethal if I can because we've chosen not to betray our original employer

01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:31.820
Let's take this guy bound and gagged take him back to our original employer and show show of faith

01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:35.740
How badass we are and show him that this guy that wanted to uh to underdo us

01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:38.140
I like that. So all you want to do is

01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:40.300
dissuade us and so we

01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:45.260
He wanted to talk he was trying to give us this whole play that like it would be more moral to to

01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:49.420
Okay, so then we we shocked him and now we're gonna tie him up. Yes

01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:52.700
