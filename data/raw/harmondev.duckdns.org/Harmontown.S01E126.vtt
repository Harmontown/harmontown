WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.200
From Chicago, my home town.

00:29.200 --> 00:37.800
The home of the greatest football team in the world, the Chicago Fuckheads.

00:37.800 --> 00:45.400
Look, you know, you got cocky, you know.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.160
I would have said something nice if you didn't, but you know, you were fooling yourselves,

00:49.160 --> 00:52.560
so fuck you.

00:52.560 --> 01:04.600
It's Harmontown!

01:04.600 --> 01:09.280
I am the ugly Jeff Davis.

01:09.280 --> 01:26.640
And now, for your listening pleasure, Daniel Harmon!

01:26.640 --> 01:56.480
I am the ugly Jeff Davis.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.240
The gayest nerd ever.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.240
Hi.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.640
So, did you notice something special about the show's format tonight?

02:05.640 --> 02:08.160
Yeah, we got a fucking real organist.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.160
Yeah!

02:09.160 --> 02:14.160
No, this guy.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.320
No, you've been here for years, right?

02:18.320 --> 02:20.320
Like how many years?

02:20.320 --> 02:21.320
92.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.520
And what's the name again?

02:23.520 --> 02:24.520
Sorry.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.520
Dennis Scott.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.800
It's kind of like a fake name.

02:27.800 --> 02:35.120
Dennis Scott previously a real name, wanted in three states, but now creating a new life

02:35.120 --> 02:39.520
as of 92 as an organist in a theater.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.520
Dennis Scott.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.640
No such lineage ever.

02:46.640 --> 02:51.440
Pick up first name and then give us a last name for God's sake.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.440
Dennis Scott.

02:52.440 --> 03:01.440
Yeah, he's an icon here at this 1929, this theater.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.560
I used to come here and watch movies.

03:03.560 --> 03:08.920
I came here, I invited a bunch of friends over one Christmas Eve, it was December 23rd

03:08.920 --> 03:13.440
and I invited all my friends to come and watch it, it's a wonderful life here.

03:13.440 --> 03:17.400
And no one came.

03:17.400 --> 03:26.040
And I, it was me looking at the screen and at the end when it said, no man is a failure

03:26.040 --> 03:40.640
who has friends, worst night of my life.

03:40.640 --> 03:45.800
Dennis Scott's shift usually ends an hour ago.

03:45.800 --> 03:50.840
I kicked some money in, I thought it would be fun to have him here for a Harmontown

03:50.840 --> 03:51.840
show.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.840
It is?

03:52.840 --> 03:53.840
Yeah.

03:53.840 --> 04:03.240
So, for instance, if we were to say, oh, it's time for Dino to tell us about the craziest

04:03.240 --> 04:08.160
sexual thing he's ever done.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.360
My mom's in the audience, my mom's in the audience.

04:12.360 --> 04:18.160
Oh, that's true, I do have a couple rules because my mom's in the audience.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.960
I have a few things.

04:19.960 --> 04:25.840
It's time for Dino's rules segment.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.360
Yeah.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.320
The saddest segment ever.

04:30.320 --> 04:35.680
So, there's a few things that we can't say on this show.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.760
First thing, cunt.

04:38.760 --> 04:39.760
Can't say cunt.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.400
Like, just in general?

04:41.400 --> 04:44.000
Don't say cunt at all.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.440
Not just, we can't say your mom's a cunt.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.760
I don't know about that.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.760
Mostly cunt.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.600
I mean, there's certain variables involved.

04:56.600 --> 05:06.920
You know, she probably doesn't like cuntiness or cunt load or cunt organ.

05:06.920 --> 05:14.760
We were at dinner at a fine Greek restaurant today.

05:14.760 --> 05:24.040
I went and joined Dino and his family, including his mother, who is wonderful, 80 years old.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.040
81.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.960
She'll make you remember.

05:27.960 --> 05:32.760
You wouldn't know it from talking to her, she's got all the pluck of Christian Slater

05:32.760 --> 05:36.760
from Heather's.

05:36.760 --> 05:39.640
That's what I actually picture when I'm talking to her.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.760
Guess the one person who doesn't understand that joke here.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.760
Exactly.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.760
I love it.

05:44.760 --> 05:48.680
But she loves me and I love her.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.080
You call her MamaTopoulos.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.240
I call her MamaTopoulos.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.680
Because I can never remember her first name.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.680
Tula.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.680
Tula.

05:56.680 --> 06:01.440
Oh, he doesn't give a shit about her first name.

06:01.440 --> 06:06.280
But tonight, Dino's like a thousand years old.

06:06.280 --> 06:09.800
I'm turning 50 this year.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.960
It's the new 30.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.480
It's the new sexy.

06:13.480 --> 06:20.600
Tonight, for the first time in his 50 year life, sitting next to his mom in a Greek restaurant

06:20.600 --> 06:21.600
in Chicago.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.720
She screamed this.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.280
Dino was razing his mom as he often does.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.560
Oh, mom, you're a piece of shit.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.560
Whatever.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.400
Like, oh, mom.

06:34.400 --> 06:40.040
And tonight, for the first time ever, ever, I swear to God, your mom spun toward you and

06:40.040 --> 06:53.520
pointed a finger at you and said, you were a mistake.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.520
Which is amazing.

06:54.520 --> 07:00.000
The thing that was amazing to me is that it took her that long to tell you that.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.760
Because my mom told me that as soon as I learned the words you, were, and mistake.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.680
No, she was winding up for the big one.

07:10.680 --> 07:16.800
She knew she had a fucking moment where I was going to give her shit a lot.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.800
And it was tonight.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.320
And I love that there was also some fracas there.

07:21.320 --> 07:25.720
And then your brother was also at the table, and he's older than you, right?

07:25.720 --> 07:27.480
No, he's two years younger.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
Oh, OK.

07:28.480 --> 07:31.720
Well, his ponytail's gray hair.

07:31.720 --> 07:35.240
But he was, and then at a certain point, she wheeled at him and said, you were a mistake

07:35.240 --> 07:36.240
too.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.240
I know.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.520
She's really, I think she screamed, you were a mistake.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.120
You are all mistakes here to my mom.

07:43.120 --> 07:48.840
I love that that's like, if you live long enough as a woman, that is actually, you're

07:48.840 --> 07:49.840
right.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.360
Like, no way, you get to go.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.400
You're all a fucking mistake.

07:53.400 --> 08:04.560
Because it occurred to me when she said that, that Yahweh was saying that to Adam and Eve.

08:04.560 --> 08:11.960
And that humankind, whether you believe Darwin's version of the species development or in fundamentalist

08:11.960 --> 08:15.360
principle, both agree on one thing.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.360
We are a mistake.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.360
Yeah.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.440
And that's a profound thing.

08:21.440 --> 08:26.080
Like, who wants, who here wants to be the result of a divine plan?

08:26.080 --> 08:27.080
That's dumb.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.080
Stupid.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
No.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.760
Here are some things that are the result of a lot of planning.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.760
Aftermash.

08:34.760 --> 08:35.760
Good organ.

08:35.760 --> 08:47.520
They had all the time of the world to think of that one.

08:47.520 --> 08:55.520
The organ guy here, the hangover, yeah, yeah, what is his name, Dick Wolf, Dick, Dick Wolf

08:55.520 --> 08:56.520
on organ.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.520
Dick Wolf is fine.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.440
Second thing we can't say part.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.440
Let's just try.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.440
I just want to get out of my system.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.440
All right.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.440
I want to, I want to wrap.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.440
I guess this bit's over.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.440
I want to wrap.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.440
We got to try it.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.960
Can you just like, let's take anything with a steady tempo.

09:11.960 --> 09:12.960
Okay.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.960
Yeah.

09:13.960 --> 09:14.960
Yeah.

09:14.960 --> 09:15.960
Yeah.

09:15.960 --> 09:16.960
Yeah.

09:16.960 --> 09:17.960
Yeah.

09:17.960 --> 09:18.960
Yeah.

09:18.960 --> 09:19.960
Yeah.

09:19.960 --> 09:20.960
Yeah.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.960
Yeah.

09:21.960 --> 09:22.960
Yeah.

09:22.960 --> 09:23.960
Yeah.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.960
Yeah.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
Yeah.

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
Yeah.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.520
Wrapping to the organ because the beat is my own.

09:29.520 --> 09:33.760
I fucked your mama so hard she tried to call me on the phone.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.400
I said, I can't talk to you.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.000
I'm calling you back.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.240
I fucked your mama so hard that her heart got a crack.

09:42.240 --> 09:47.120
I put my dick in the crack and I made it extra wide.

09:47.120 --> 09:56.640
I fucked your mama so hard she said, bye, oh, my, oh, my.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.640
Yeah.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.640
Yeah.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.640
I fucked your mama.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.640
I fucked your mama.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.640
1929.

10:05.640 --> 10:10.080
It's raining pennies.

10:10.080 --> 10:15.680
I fucked your mama, the depression fucked your mama.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.360
I fucked your mama.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.360
All right.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.360
All right.

10:19.360 --> 10:28.600
I think, I, I, I, I, thanks kids, thanks.

10:28.600 --> 10:33.280
I hate to bring this up now, but number three is fucked your mama.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.240
We can't say that at all.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.680
Number four, don't say Jesus sucked a cock.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.680
He's very religious.

10:40.680 --> 10:41.680
He's Gregor the dox.

10:41.680 --> 10:47.160
I get, I get weirded out when I hear that and I hate Jesus.

10:47.160 --> 10:53.400
So I heard a story, okay, we'll, we'll, we'll get back to the list later.

10:53.400 --> 10:57.680
It's my only written bit.

10:57.680 --> 11:04.240
Oh, are we going to watch Nasperatu?

11:04.240 --> 11:13.280
I, I, there was somebody that told me a story in the community writer's room that, that

11:13.280 --> 11:18.880
there was a person who, like, I guess this must happen all the time and I'm worried because

11:18.880 --> 11:23.960
there's probably 800 people here that this happened to one of them.

11:23.960 --> 11:35.360
And every once in a while, a grandparent kills a kid.

11:35.360 --> 11:41.840
I don't know how much you paid him, but money well spent.

11:41.840 --> 11:51.960
Every once in a while in America, somewhere, a father of 35 who has a two year old child

11:51.960 --> 11:55.320
leaves his child in the care of his 70 year old mother.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.680
Oh, so it's my mistake.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.840
It's not, it's not premeditated.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.320
It's not underworld.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.320
Yeah.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.040
The, I don't know.

12:03.040 --> 12:07.840
Can you, can you imagine, I just want to imagine like, like everyone here in this room is like

12:07.840 --> 12:14.200
in some state of either hating their parents or hope or having their own kids.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.680
There is never any in between.

12:15.680 --> 12:21.400
Can you imagine like if you were like, okay, I fucking hate my parents, but I have my own

12:21.400 --> 12:22.400
kid.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.400
Mom, will you babysit the kid?

12:24.400 --> 12:25.400
Yeah.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.240
I got to go to work and then you come home and your mom is like, I killed your kid.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.240
Yeah.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.240
No, I, I agree.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.720
I'd be the worst grandparent.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.680
Once I got drunk, I'd be time to hold the baby.

12:38.680 --> 12:44.360
But I'm saying, I'm thinking, they were talking about that in a writer's room and I said,

12:44.360 --> 12:55.600
I actually got excited because I was like, did you, did you give them $5,000?

12:55.600 --> 12:56.600
Really?

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
Yeah.

12:57.600 --> 13:03.440
This guy's working overtime.

13:03.440 --> 13:10.680
I actually picture if my mom killed my kid, I, there was a little bit of excitement because

13:10.680 --> 13:15.320
I was like, I could kill my mom.

13:15.320 --> 13:22.240
And while I was killing her, I could be like, you, I'm not going to hell for this.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.600
You love Greek tragedies.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.640
It was worth it.

13:26.640 --> 13:31.240
I'll have another kid, but this one's not on me.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.600
I don't know.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
You wouldn't feel that way.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
You'd love your kid.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.600
Sorry to bring everything down.

13:36.600 --> 13:42.920
I love my kid and I tashed that love in for an opportunity to kill my mother and have

13:42.920 --> 13:46.760
another kid free of her influence.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.760
You're better than me.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.600
I would, I would, I would be, I would just be sad.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.080
Your mom mentioned something tonight at the dinner table.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.600
Oh, I have another word we can't say.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.600
Cunt.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.040
Did I say that already?

14:04.040 --> 14:13.120
She doesn't mind cunt face for some reason, but yeah, that was a little, uh, yeah.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.320
Wait until you hear the next one.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.200
It's a biggie.

14:17.200 --> 14:23.920
Uh, your mom said she had the gout at one point and I wanted to bring her up and ask

14:23.920 --> 14:24.920
her about the gout.

14:24.920 --> 14:25.920
She doesn't want to come up.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.560
I know she doesn't want to come up, but I want to know about the gout.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.880
I'll tell you all about it.

14:29.880 --> 14:30.880
What's the gout?

14:30.880 --> 14:34.600
The gout is when you eat rich food, your, your, your foot swells up and you can't, you

14:34.600 --> 14:36.040
can't even put a little sheet.

14:36.040 --> 14:39.440
You can't put like a, like a tissue on it because it hurts so much.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.440
Jesus.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.440
It hurts so bad, right?

14:41.440 --> 14:42.760
Do you have the gout?

14:42.760 --> 14:43.760
Come up here.

14:43.760 --> 14:48.280
Can you come up and talk about your gout?

14:48.280 --> 14:49.280
He's got the gout.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.280
He's got the gout.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.280
He's got the gout.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.280
He's got the gout.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.280
He's got the gout.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.280
He's got the gout.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.280
He's got the gout.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.280
He's got the gout.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.280
He's got the gout.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.280
When it rains out gout, he's going to the downtown.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.280
Can you, can you?

14:59.280 --> 15:03.080
Get out, hat and my tail coats and my ring stone monocle.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.400
I'm going to see King Kong till photographers.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
Hey.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.520
Deftly, deftly, deft.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
Deft.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.520
Poneys from heaven.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.520
Yes.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.520
Hi.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.520
Hello.

15:14.520 --> 15:15.520
What's your name, sir?

15:15.520 --> 15:16.520
I'm Jordan Brown.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.520
Jordan Brown.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.520
Jordan?

15:18.520 --> 15:24.080
Can you pretend you're my mom for the next four years?

15:24.080 --> 15:25.920
And also pretend like you wanted me?

15:25.920 --> 15:27.600
Oh, no, I can't do that.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.600
Just have the gout and talk to us about it.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.600
Do you need to sit down, first of all? Is that part of the gout?

15:33.600 --> 15:36.600
Hey, where's the vodka, by the way? What the fuck is going on with this?

15:36.600 --> 15:38.600
It was too much to ask.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.600
Too much for Chicago. This is my home goddamn town.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.600
Where's the kettle on?

15:48.600 --> 15:53.600
I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with the microphones to make them stop doing that.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.600
I feel like I'm just learning the force.

15:59.600 --> 16:03.600
No, Luke, don't put the red one near the blue one.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.600
That's complicated. I thought I was supposed to open my mind.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
Alright, what's the gout? What is it?

16:09.600 --> 16:12.600
So it's, I mean, do you know what I was right?

16:12.600 --> 16:16.600
It starts with rich foods, like a beef chicken.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.600
What's rich mean?

16:17.600 --> 16:22.600
Rich means anything. Well, gout was originally like a rich person back in ancient Greece and stuff.

16:22.600 --> 16:27.600
It was like a rich person. The people who would get it were people who could afford to be fat.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.600
So like, you know, I got the gout.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.600
That's pretty much us.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.600
Yeah.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.600
So like saturated fats?

16:35.600 --> 16:38.600
Yeah, it's all healthy fats.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.600
Yeah, uric acid builds up in your...

16:43.600 --> 16:46.600
Everyone who has an opinion, get up here.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.600
We have a gout support group.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.600
So the gout, then it collects in your foot.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.600
Yeah, so you can have it, a lot of people get it in their elbow, but mine happens to be in both my feet.

16:56.600 --> 17:02.600
I think, my theory is that if you don't walk around a lot of your truck driver, you get gout in your ass.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.600
Like you get hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids is the same as gout.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.600
Is that the same?

17:07.600 --> 17:08.600
Is that idiotic?

17:08.600 --> 17:11.600
Your theory, we have a guy with gout.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.600
He's not a doctor either.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.600
But he's the next best thing to a doctor.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
He's the guy who had gout.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.600
He's the guy with gout.

17:18.600 --> 17:19.600
All right.

17:19.600 --> 17:20.600
I'm a guy with gout.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.600
The only way you learn is by bouncing it off me.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.600
I can say, no, Dino, that's not how it works.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.600
So really, it's not...

17:26.600 --> 17:31.600
Well, first of all, the terrible thing is you go to the doctor and you're like, my foot hurts.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.600
And I have a micro fracture and he's like, no, you have gout.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.600
And I was like, okay, so what can I take to get rid of you?

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
He's like, no, no, it's with you for life.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.600
No, but you take pills, right?

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
No.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.600
Yeah, my mom takes pills.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.600
They don't do that until it's like really...

17:42.600 --> 17:43.600
My mom takes pills.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
Okay, Jesus Christ.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.600
I ease the pain. Stop arguing with him.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.600
I wish she had the fucking courage to get up here.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.600
Your foot hurt.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.600
And so the doctor says, you have gout.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.600
You have it for life.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.600
Yeah, and you get flare-ups like herpes.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
But what is it?

18:00.600 --> 18:02.600
Now you want to put...

18:02.600 --> 18:03.600
It's not even...

18:03.600 --> 18:05.600
It doesn't swell like really bad.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
It's not noticeably red.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
It's just you can't...

18:07.600 --> 18:08.600
Like, it's the worst...

18:08.600 --> 18:10.600
I've broken bone stuff.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.600
It feels as bad as that.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.600
And you just can't...

18:12.600 --> 18:14.600
I can't walk for like a week, two weeks.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.600
Because...

18:15.600 --> 18:16.600
Because what's happening?

18:16.600 --> 18:21.600
Youric acid builds up and it crystallizes in your bones and in your muscles.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.600
And so it just makes it like sharp shooting pain.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.600
Can you just drink some water, walk it off or something?

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
I do.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.600
Well, I sit on my couch with like an ice pack and play FIFA for like a week.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.600
White people problems.

18:32.600 --> 18:33.600
I know.

18:35.600 --> 18:36.600
All right.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.600
Well...

18:38.600 --> 18:39.600
Get up here.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.600
No, don't tell him to get up here.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
No, no, no, sorry.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.600
Now he's coming up.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
I'm not in control.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.600
No, no, no, no, no, come on.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.600
You already stood up.

18:47.600 --> 18:48.600
Come on.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.600
We got a lot of people coming up.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.600
I'll step down.

18:53.600 --> 18:58.600
If you talk, you get to come on up, Cameron.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.600
If you speak, you get to come on up.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.600
Do you have a mouth?

19:04.600 --> 19:08.600
Then come on up, Cameron.

19:08.600 --> 19:13.600
This has to do with German politics.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.600
I do not know the meaning.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.600
Cameron!

19:17.600 --> 19:18.600
Cameron!

19:18.600 --> 19:21.600
If you speak, you get to come on up.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.600
Oh, okay.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.600
I hate Tim Burton more than anyone.

Tiny daggers

All right, I like Tim Burton now

That kid was probably like a pre-med student. He probably had the most answers. Yeah, he go fuck himself

20:25.940 --> 20:27.940
How long did your mom head go?

20:27.940 --> 20:36.020
How she how long yeah, I don't know. How long have you had gout?

20:36.820 --> 20:42.660
Forget it. Yeah, I was worried it killed her. She didn't answer. Can you can you look at her after the show?

20:43.140 --> 20:45.140
You're a doctor, right? No

20:45.820 --> 20:50.180
What are you doing here? I'm a fundraiser. All right, let's have a hand for gout man

20:50.180 --> 20:52.180
And

20:56.860 --> 20:58.860
Now we understand

21:00.940 --> 21:05.060
Everybody understands gout better now

21:07.420 --> 21:11.980
The n-bomb my mom hates the n-bomb. Oh, yeah, what's the hate it?

21:12.780 --> 21:16.140
Hates the n-bomb or who doesn't what?

21:16.140 --> 21:21.500
Who doesn't I agree she doesn't mind the word nigger though, but she hates n-bomb

21:24.580 --> 21:28.100
It's a silly joke you made a silly you made a silly joke

21:28.100 --> 21:32.420
I wrote one joke and you knew you knew you could get away with it because we're in Chicago

21:39.980 --> 21:41.580
All right

21:41.580 --> 21:46.220
Society corner. Oh, okay. I don't know what this is when you're flying on a plane

21:47.460 --> 21:53.420
What what I understand that I've done it too sometimes you take off your shoes because

21:54.180 --> 21:56.900
the shoes the shoes cover the

21:57.980 --> 21:59.980
sock covered feet and

22:00.380 --> 22:02.380
This and the sock covered feet are

22:02.940 --> 22:08.180
They're you know your shoes. They oh boy. I've had these shoes on for so long and you're on a plane

22:08.180 --> 22:12.300
It's you're right like like Jesus Christ. I'm on the plane for six hours take off your shoes

22:12.300 --> 22:15.140
You get a little sock feet tucked under the seat in front of you

22:15.820 --> 22:19.740
Who are these people with that then to take off the socks?

22:22.460 --> 22:29.420
And everyone in this room has been on a plane with somebody you've all been there you've all seen bare feet on a plane

22:30.820 --> 22:32.820
Right

22:32.820 --> 22:40.060
Oh, what's going on? Is there is there anyone here who when they get you okay, kid

22:40.060 --> 22:46.100
You take you take off your shoes and socks on a plane. Well, then get up here. Do you want to come up here?

22:46.620 --> 22:48.620
Okay, all right

22:52.620 --> 22:57.540
People I I definitely expected

22:57.540 --> 23:04.300
If look, I mean he doesn't have socks on now. Well, okay, so don't do it

23:06.780 --> 23:13.940
Okay, so yeah, what so so when you're on a plane you take off your shoes and this really is a show about nothing

23:16.700 --> 23:18.700
What's it supposed to be about

23:18.700 --> 23:25.380
I've never listened so you take off your shoes in your socks

23:25.580 --> 23:29.640
Yeah, well usually I don't wear socks at all. So I just take off my shoes. All right, that's not fair

23:30.700 --> 23:32.780
Thank you. I yeah

23:32.780 --> 23:37.540
Because that's not I mean I used to wear socks with my vans, but now it's yeah, but why don't you wear socks?

23:37.540 --> 23:48.860
It's a little tight, isn't it? Yeah, I don't know. I

23:50.980 --> 23:52.980
Got two of the words in

23:55.860 --> 24:00.260
Wait, I got cunt too. I think I got all of them. Yeah, what's left?

24:02.660 --> 24:04.660
Nothing really I don't know

24:04.660 --> 24:06.660
Your mother's balls

24:08.820 --> 24:10.820
Harmless that was like sons of anarchy

24:14.100 --> 24:20.300
So really okay, you're yeah, I mean so you don't wear socks so you're 14 and when you take off your shoes

24:21.700 --> 24:28.460
You're a beer feeder. I you know what it is. It's young feet young feet are fine. Yeah, they're fine. It's okay

24:28.460 --> 24:30.460
Well, now we're learning something about me. I

24:30.460 --> 24:35.460
I like like like because if there was a 25 year old woman with beautiful feet and she was like

24:35.460 --> 24:40.660
I don't have any socks on yeah, but nobody would be like. Oh, right. Oh, so what is this coach?

24:42.860 --> 24:48.740
But it's the it's the fucking yeah, it's the it's the it's you it's the 70 year old man

24:48.740 --> 25:01.540
Like baby feet like I would rather like swim in like a billion gallons of baby shit than walk past an old man. Yeah, yeah

25:01.540 --> 25:08.980
Yeah, there was a guy on the plane to Chicago today. I looked over I did a double take I

25:08.980 --> 25:17.340
Would I full disclosure? I only fly first class. So that's already working against this guy. What is he doing?

25:17.980 --> 25:18.820
I

25:18.820 --> 25:22.620
There was it. Did you ever see that Tom Hanks Jackie Gleason movie about dads?

25:23.700 --> 25:28.620
Where and then Tom Hanks like looks under the table and he like notices his dad as diabetes

25:33.100 --> 25:35.100
These are the things that happen

25:35.100 --> 25:42.100
For those of you listening, the audience doesn't have a particular emotional attachment to Jackie Gleason. No

25:44.100 --> 25:47.180
A bunch of a bunch of beer fell on electricity

25:48.540 --> 25:53.220
It's Chicago and and we're gonna all run out of here in two seconds. Yeah

25:54.420 --> 25:59.980
Fine, I don't get there was a guy with like fucking black toenails and and and white flaky feet

25:59.980 --> 26:05.420
And I don't understand why he felt permission to put them up on the wall of the plane

26:05.540 --> 26:13.460
Like he was like like he was John Draper and madmen but without shoes and it's just his gross big foot feet were

26:13.740 --> 26:18.700
Everywhere and they were the first signs of him dying and no one wants to look at that. Right. Yeah

26:19.500 --> 26:24.860
Maybe that's what he wanted everyone to see me. I mean, maybe I'll get there. Maybe I'm like, okay. Yeah, I'm dying

26:24.860 --> 26:32.060
Yeah, deal with death. All right, so your mom the gout you were a mistake. Okay, and then your brother said

31:38.460 --> 31:42.580

Holy shit, he's a civic treasure

32:55.020 --> 33:01.420
He's been enhancing my enjoyment all evening 7 30 p.m. I dropped a pin for you as Lena

33:01.420 --> 33:05.060
Dunham Dunham would say what you followed up with the with the words

33:06.140 --> 33:13.340
Start start reading. This is where we'll be. I said this is where we'll be when should we be at the venue?

33:13.820 --> 33:15.820
Just had a run-in with the cops

33:16.900 --> 33:19.140
Tell Friedel thanks for the weed

33:20.340 --> 33:21.900
That's him

33:21.900 --> 33:25.180
So I said a run-in with the cops

33:26.300 --> 33:28.300
What's going on?

33:28.300 --> 33:31.620
Haha, well, do you need help?

33:33.820 --> 33:40.420
Lol no, sorry, I realized the timing of those is odd. I'm smoking weed at the hotel

33:40.740 --> 33:45.500
I'll tell you about the cops later, but they were just protecting corporate interests

33:48.540 --> 33:52.420
They didn't harm me they didn't harm me I

33:52.420 --> 33:58.820
Don't want to jinx it, but I'm getting the distinct feeling this is going to be a satisfying show. I

34:01.020 --> 34:06.580
Love Dino's family. Oh my god. I love Dino's mom

34:08.300 --> 34:11.420
What's the drill I'll do except for me? We're not done with this

34:11.420 --> 34:15.180
Well, I mean is it it's not getting better is it well, let's keep it going

34:15.180 --> 34:21.460
What's the driver's name max gay thanks I?

34:23.620 --> 34:29.300
Might be wrong. Are you getting a ride to the venue? Yeah from max

34:30.420 --> 34:32.420
Is it far?

34:32.460 --> 34:37.220
We are five minute drive from venue long room on Irving Park

34:37.860 --> 34:39.860
When are you leaving?

34:39.860 --> 34:45.820
15 minutes fuck. I'm at here

34:45.820 --> 34:47.020
Where?

34:47.020 --> 34:53.380
Where do you meet and then time passes? Where do you mean by here? Can we help you in some way?

34:54.020 --> 34:56.020
End of end of conversation

34:56.620 --> 34:58.620
This is the first time I've seen him

35:02.300 --> 35:05.620
The last thing he said to me was fuck I'm at here

35:05.620 --> 35:09.420
That's pretty good because every city we go to

35:10.260 --> 35:12.260
Because of his clever manipulations

35:13.260 --> 35:14.580
Hey

35:14.580 --> 35:16.580
He's not clever. He's just him

35:17.100 --> 35:25.180
Like he is greeted at the airport by people throwing trash bags of marijuana at him. It's not it's not like that quite to that level

35:25.740 --> 35:27.740
How come I don't get cocaine?

35:27.820 --> 35:33.740
It's just a lot more expensive. Oh, that's true. Also. I don't know that there's the community around cocaine

35:33.740 --> 35:36.420
There is around weed, right? It's more selfish. Yeah

35:37.740 --> 35:40.220
So we have a lovely dinner

35:44.740 --> 35:47.260
The walls are bleeding you guys I

35:48.300 --> 35:49.620
Mean we're gonna be fine

35:49.620 --> 35:55.060
But no I had a lovely dinner with Dino and his family and I came back to the hotel

35:55.060 --> 36:00.900
I really really had to pee so bad and I was like holy shit. I'll I have my family does that

36:00.900 --> 36:04.020
They make you have to inject fluids

36:06.100 --> 36:11.060
But yeah, so I got back to the hotel and I'm like fuck I need to smoke weed and I

36:11.860 --> 36:18.740
Ask I asked this the bell desk lady. Where can I buy some produce perhaps an apple or a banana and

36:19.940 --> 36:21.500
7-eleven so I

36:21.500 --> 36:27.820
Sprint to 7-eleven because I had to pee so bad and right as I'm going in homeless guy rolls up

36:27.820 --> 36:33.180
He's like hey, man, you want to be my friend whatever, you know asking me he wants me to buy him cigarettes and I

36:33.660 --> 36:39.780
When I'm hassled I'll give homeless people stuff that I have but fucking I don't want to buy cigarettes for a homeless guy

36:39.780 --> 36:41.780
That seems kind of a lot of

36:43.180 --> 36:45.700
Effort so I'm telling this guy

36:45.700 --> 36:49.460
I can't give money and then the cops roll up and they're like hey, man

36:49.460 --> 36:55.780
You can't be doing that here and I'm like that's not illegal is it and he's like actually walking up to me sternly

36:55.780 --> 36:59.660
It is actually illegal and I'm like oh, you're the it's your job, man

36:59.660 --> 37:04.060
I you'd be right because I have two grams of weed in my pocket

37:06.860 --> 37:08.860
And I can't

37:12.460 --> 37:18.940
And and I can't I can't I can't get it into an altercation because I mean

37:18.940 --> 37:21.060
I'm the guy that's being harmed here

37:21.060 --> 37:26.060
But I could quickly turn into a weird suspect all of a sudden, you know with weed on his purse

37:26.060 --> 37:27.700
I hate to get all gnome Chomsky on you

37:27.700 --> 37:33.380
But even if you don't have two grams of weed in your pocket, you're not allowed to get an altercation with someone who has a

37:33.380 --> 37:40.220
Gun in a badge. Yeah, it's also they're allowed to pull you over on the street and ask to see your proof of a relationship with a

37:40.420 --> 37:44.900
Corporation that ensures you against collision with another poor person. It's insane

37:44.900 --> 37:49.380
Yeah, I couldn't talk to that. I legally could not talk to that man

37:49.380 --> 37:54.260
He was being accosted by police for speaking with me. It's fucking insane

37:54.260 --> 37:59.420
I think but so I have weed so I have to run and I run into the store. I buy a lighter. I buy an apple

37:59.420 --> 38:04.340
I I run I run out. I literally sprint away. Why did you buy an apple?

38:04.340 --> 38:09.060
We just had like fucking Greek food because Dino. Let me tell you something about apples

38:09.860 --> 38:15.220
Dino if you take you didn't make a nice pipe out of some spina colpita. I

38:15.220 --> 38:19.620
Couldn't I ate that all I ate all of it

38:20.180 --> 38:26.700
But this beer sucks by the way, what happened to fucking old Milwaukee get a daisy cutter son like this is like Chicago

38:26.700 --> 38:28.700
favorite sale half-acre

38:30.660 --> 38:34.740
But so that I'm back at the hotel smoking weed after I sprint past the police

38:34.740 --> 38:36.620
Which has to be the most suspicious thing I've done

38:36.740 --> 38:42.340
But I get back to the doll sir smoking weed and I'm so full of these rich gout inducing foods

38:43.140 --> 38:44.340
that

38:44.340 --> 38:46.340
I barf into the toilet

38:46.980 --> 38:52.940
It's really it was tough man. I was sorry my people. Let me tell you something about feta cheese

38:54.820 --> 38:57.140
Out of all the foods you can vomit up

38:58.420 --> 39:01.340
Feta cheese tastes by far the best

39:03.420 --> 39:05.420
It tastes just like feta

39:05.420 --> 39:12.900
I don't know if that's a compliment, but I'll take it and that's when I realized this is gonna be a good show

39:19.220 --> 39:24.060
All right, how much time do we have left we had to make this a tight one because they got Rocky horror picture show coming up here

39:24.060 --> 39:27.620
Yeah, it's 1055 we got about 40 40 Jesus

39:28.220 --> 39:33.500
I'm out of jokes and what do you you you you you don't want to play D&D with us

39:33.500 --> 39:38.060
I want to do anything that anyone wants me to do. I want to play D&D. All right, can you?

39:41.700 --> 39:46.620
You weren't very cooperative. I know I'm not I'm not a one-trick pony. I'm gonna do it

39:46.620 --> 39:50.620
Okay, all right. Well, I want to bring up somebody I ran into on the sidewalk out there

39:51.180 --> 39:53.180
If she's willing to come up

39:53.180 --> 40:06.020
Does she have short hair? Oh, come on. I'm the guy who hits on people. Hey, I'm drunk now. It's a new Spencer. Yeah, I gotta tell you

40:06.020 --> 40:12.820
I'm sharing a room with Dustin. Seriously just date Spencer for a while. Yeah, all you Chicago people come on

40:13.900 --> 40:16.620
Seriously, I'm a good guy. I love them

40:18.540 --> 40:21.020
Not you Spencer got a story

40:21.020 --> 40:29.380
I'm a bad person when I'm drunk. I'm sorry. You're very sweet. You're very sweet. You're a wonderful young man

40:29.380 --> 40:34.780
It's so embarrassing two beers. You're fine. You're fine. We love you. We all have them, right?

40:40.900 --> 40:43.060
Oh, can I tell you about the Uber driver I

40:44.060 --> 40:50.500
Got the driver to pick me up. You're starting to wear thin. I know I know this is the last anecdote. I'm joking

40:50.500 --> 40:55.380
I just said we love him. I got the Uber driver to pick me up and he was like, which way do you want to go?

40:55.380 --> 40:58.500
Do you want to take the expressway? Do you want to take services? I'm like, oh, man

40:59.100 --> 41:03.540
I'm not from around here. What do you whatever works?

41:04.300 --> 41:06.300
Because I'm high as fuck

41:06.460 --> 41:13.140
And the guy's like I'll take the fastest way, you know us taxi cab drivers make more money

41:13.500 --> 41:19.220
If we get more people so I'll take you the fastest way. I'm like, what the fuck dude

41:19.220 --> 41:25.140
I'm deferring to you and you're trying to get all high and mighty over. What ways the best and

41:25.820 --> 41:29.440
Then I realized he was just being really helpful. He was just like

41:30.260 --> 41:36.420
This is what you need to know about cab drivers is this is how they make their money. He was trying to help

41:36.420 --> 41:40.260
I thought he was being all high and mighty to me being like, here's how it works, man

41:40.260 --> 41:43.700
We get people to where they're going. That's how we make money

41:43.700 --> 41:49.140
But he was like, no, we actually this is our business. And so we had a lovely talk

41:50.260 --> 41:56.060
So so Spencer, do you do you feel better now that you you've let this out? No, I feel really hurt

41:57.140 --> 42:02.860
Betrayed even I feel like Spencer. You're a young man. You're a young man. There's a

42:07.060 --> 42:09.060
Go ahead say something else

42:09.060 --> 42:14.860
Yeah, there is a storm raging beneath you. There's a storm raging beneath you

42:18.380 --> 42:20.380
He gets it

42:22.940 --> 42:31.060
When Spencer, I want to tell everybody here in Chicago when we've gone to how many 45,000 cities together

42:31.060 --> 42:34.420
Yeah, no 47,000 Spencer

42:35.020 --> 42:37.020
Nothing I look forward to more

42:37.020 --> 42:41.620
Like the idea of oh, we're going to this and that city

42:41.620 --> 42:46.540
Oh, what it let's all meet at my house and get into a car together. Yeah, how's he gonna react?

42:46.940 --> 42:53.940
Spencer is always like, I'll go by myself. So and I was like, okay. All right, fine that over time

42:53.940 --> 43:00.260
It's like Spencer. Why are you always going by yourself? And then Spencer slowly reveals. He says I

43:01.660 --> 43:03.660
It's not I don't

43:03.660 --> 43:08.820
Want to not go to the airport with you guys, but when I like to have my car at the airport

43:09.420 --> 43:14.660
Because when the plane lands, I want to get to my car as quickly as possible and we'll have control over

43:16.220 --> 43:22.380
Where I'm going as quickly as possible and and that's something that's taken away from me when the airports

43:22.740 --> 43:29.180
Take a car driver. Look at him. He looks like a hermit. I can't believe so cares about control. So today

43:29.900 --> 43:31.900
I got new insight into this

43:31.900 --> 43:35.300
Because you said this is a second time

43:35.300 --> 43:42.060
I've been in a car with you where we've been driving and I pop up on my laptop and I start playing Minecraft and

43:42.500 --> 43:46.980
Spencer, this is the second time Spencer goes. It says to the driver. Hey

43:47.900 --> 43:49.900
How how long?

43:50.500 --> 43:52.500
Do you what's the

43:52.500 --> 43:57.140
How long do you think I'm making you sound stupid? How long do you think it'll take to get there?

43:57.140 --> 44:02.980
Yeah, how long do you think it'll take to get there about? What's the estimated time estimate and the driver will go like oh

44:03.980 --> 44:05.980
I

44:05.980 --> 44:12.260
I guess a bunch of bullshit if there's wind I've got 27 minutes and there's a go. Okay, cool. Cool. Yeah

44:12.260 --> 44:17.540
But isn't that me texting you asking you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, thank you though

44:17.540 --> 44:23.820
I appreciate that Spencer in a vacuum cannot handle being contained in a metal cocoon

44:23.820 --> 44:29.900
Right with no control over wind or knowledge. I just feel like I'll become a metal butterfly

44:31.460 --> 44:34.940
So so today he did that he did it again. He goes like we're

44:35.460 --> 44:41.620
How long to the thing and the and the and the driver who's adorable goes like with traffic 20 minutes

44:41.620 --> 44:48.340
And then and then the driver the driver kept going the driver kept going like oh just because Spencer said that he's like

44:48.460 --> 44:52.140
Just 15 more minutes of the thing and it's Spencer said

44:52.140 --> 44:54.860
Paraphrasing Spencer said

44:55.740 --> 45:00.860
Look, I I wasn't asking earlier because I am on a schedule

45:00.860 --> 45:06.820
It's just that normally when I drive to places. I know when I'm going to get there

45:07.100 --> 45:12.220
It's true. And when someone else is driving me, I don't know when I'm going to get there

45:12.380 --> 45:13.220
It's true

45:13.220 --> 45:19.380
So I need to ask them when I'm going to get there and I was like this is fascinating

45:19.380 --> 45:20.820
Yeah

45:20.820 --> 45:22.820
This is incredible

45:23.260 --> 45:29.980
Because I've never I would get I mean, and I'm not a good person for saying this I would get out of an airport

45:30.940 --> 45:32.780
Jump into a car

45:32.780 --> 45:34.940
Six hours like I would be like whoa

45:35.460 --> 45:37.460
Thanks a lot. Here's $50. I

45:38.300 --> 45:44.500
Spencer's like he needs to know where he's going and what's going on. You don't trust anybody. It's

45:44.500 --> 45:49.860
Oh, yeah, I don't you trust me. Don't you? Yeah, totally

45:51.180 --> 45:53.500
It's I mean, this is not humorous

45:53.500 --> 45:59.140
But it's just like my whole life is about getting to know situations before I enter them

45:59.140 --> 46:05.500
Like I'm all about research and putting in legwork and figuring out how things are gonna be and then easing myself into a situation

46:06.140 --> 46:13.180
When I'm traveling it's really weird not knowing exactly where we're going or how long it'll take and it's just like if I'm in LA

46:13.180 --> 46:16.220
I'll be like it'll take 10 minutes to get here and 10 minutes to get it's just

46:16.900 --> 46:24.460
Interesting not having not being that person designed to get me places and not knowing like if I'm gonna be in the car for 15 minutes

46:24.460 --> 46:32.900
Or 70 minutes. It's weird describe to me the worst-case scenario like when you think of when you go like I don't want to be this guy

46:32.900 --> 46:34.900
Oh, well, I have to shit

46:35.620 --> 46:41.620
Like I really have to go to the bathroom or do something or I'm thinking about like masturbating or you

46:41.620 --> 46:43.620
You would hate being a dog

46:44.500 --> 46:50.220
But you could say to anybody I have to pull over. I have to take a shit. I'm saying like what's your word? Hey, what?

46:50.740 --> 46:53.220
Let's unpack that. Well if somebody

46:54.420 --> 46:59.420
If somebody's driving you for so long that you have to oh, yeah, no, no

46:59.420 --> 47:02.060
I would in that very same Uber driver

47:02.060 --> 47:08.020
I was in I almost didn't reroute the car to the direction we were supposed to be going because I didn't want to bother the guy

47:08.460 --> 47:10.460
like that's just my

47:10.460 --> 47:12.220
damage

47:12.220 --> 47:19.260
But so are you are you polite or are you a control freak because you don't want to not know how soon you can get somewhere?

47:19.260 --> 47:21.980
Yeah, I mean, that's literally the first time I've asked that question

47:21.980 --> 47:30.100
And we've been on the road several times where I haven't had this is fucking boring. I'm I don't I I'm a I'm a bad person

47:30.100 --> 47:39.460
I you're right. No, I fix myself. You're a bad person. No, I know I know like I just want to spice the things up. Ah

47:41.060 --> 47:44.100
That's like it's amazing that you can't house my Greek

47:44.260 --> 47:47.520
You can't put him in a car if you if you I don't like change

47:48.540 --> 47:53.900
And you don't tell him where you're where he's going and how soon he's gonna get there. He will yeah

47:54.340 --> 47:57.420
And look at him now. Yeah, look at me now

47:57.420 --> 48:00.620
Damn, look at me now

48:02.140 --> 48:07.420
All right, so time for D&D. All right. Yeah, we got we're in a tight schedule here

48:08.740 --> 48:11.980
We're gonna need a woman to play some of the womanly characters. I

48:12.740 --> 48:15.580
Hold it. I met a woman on the sidewalk

48:16.540 --> 48:19.260
And she pushed all the right buttons because she's

48:20.420 --> 48:22.940
She's a professor at the University of

48:23.900 --> 48:25.620
Chicago

48:25.620 --> 48:27.620
She's

48:28.020 --> 48:32.420
Studies neurology and and it's and it's relationship with racism

48:34.140 --> 48:36.140
Jenny are you here? Oh

48:42.380 --> 48:45.260
Shit, this is the updo

48:46.740 --> 48:51.860
I'm sorry to reduce you to haircut. That's not what you deserve at all. Hi. I don't know

48:51.860 --> 48:59.220
Really think about that Spencer. She studies neurology and it's relationship with racism. Yeah

48:59.820 --> 49:02.060
Yes, you can you can have all kinds of beers

49:03.540 --> 49:11.820
They're shitty non-Chicago beers. Oh shit. You need maybe we're like an old style that work old Milwaukee or something

49:11.820 --> 49:13.660
This is good

49:13.660 --> 49:15.620
All right, so

49:15.620 --> 49:17.980
Neurology as I understand is about the

49:17.980 --> 49:24.780
Neuro I'm aware of the human mind. It's not the hardware shit. We cannot change true. So

49:25.420 --> 49:30.660
I'm assuming you're gonna say some uncomfortable things if you're a neurologist and you're studying racism

49:31.900 --> 49:33.900
Well, I'm a neuroscientist

49:34.220 --> 49:39.660
Slightly different because I don't have a medical degree. You study racism. What? Yeah, so I study

49:40.300 --> 49:42.500
I said the n-word today. What did you think about that?

49:44.220 --> 49:46.220
Did it turn you on?

49:46.220 --> 49:48.220
I

49:51.540 --> 49:54.200
Love that or interpretation that was

49:58.220 --> 50:00.220
Anytime Dino enters a room

50:04.420 --> 50:07.340
Yeah, so I started stereotyping and prejudice in the brain

50:07.340 --> 50:23.620
So what what does that mean? Okay, so I study. I don't think Asians could do that

50:25.460 --> 50:27.460
Awesome

50:28.220 --> 50:32.740
Can we please tell the podcast people at home? Oh, yeah guys, so that she's slightly Asian

50:32.740 --> 50:39.620
Slightly I'm I'm mixed race. I'm mixed race. So I'm mixed race. Yeah. Yeah. Well, who's dominant, baby

50:41.780 --> 50:49.780
I'm quarter. I'm perfect quarter. I'll quarter. I got a quarter in my pocket. Yeah, that says you're a full Asian. What? I don't know

50:52.380 --> 50:55.420
That's from a radio play called Hitler hits on women

50:56.740 --> 50:58.740
Hey

50:58.740 --> 51:02.740
You got a little Nazi in you. Oh

51:06.140 --> 51:10.740
Sorry, yeah, so I'm Japanese French Mexican and Native American

51:11.740 --> 51:13.740
Man, yeah, French

51:14.620 --> 51:16.820
French is the only thing that is an Asian in you

51:17.580 --> 51:20.900
Native American well, three of those are not Asian. No

51:20.900 --> 51:28.260
No, no, well, didn't the Native Americans come over on the very straight. Yeah, didn't they like definition by the word

51:29.380 --> 51:33.380
Native American that means Asian didn't they come over on the

51:35.700 --> 51:37.700
Ice bridge

51:37.740 --> 51:44.140
What else are you wait? What else did you say? I said French Japanese Japanese. Yeah, Native American

51:44.220 --> 51:47.060
Mexican. Yeah, Mexican. That's as Asian as you can get

51:47.060 --> 51:57.180
We're getting sidetracked here. I think her studies are the important thing. Oh, are they I don't know or are they

52:01.180 --> 52:03.180
So I

52:03.180 --> 52:10.740
Yeah, I show people pictures of you know different races and see how their brains respond. So what does it mean how their brains respond?

52:10.740 --> 52:16.500
What are you measuring? So I typically measure I put people in FMRIs MRIs

52:16.500 --> 52:23.460
And then I look at how their brains respond differently to typically white and black people and how it's

52:23.660 --> 52:27.260
Coopted for the same systems that we respond to for emotions

52:27.260 --> 52:32.140
So how we respond to basic things like snakes and spiders and how that's

52:32.820 --> 52:39.300
Coopted for things like race. So you're putting you're putting people in a tube and scanning their brain and like seeing which parts of their

52:39.300 --> 52:46.940
Brains light up and they're showing them images of snakes spiders black people and white people

52:46.980 --> 52:50.780
Typically not snakes and spiders typically black people white people

52:52.140 --> 52:58.020
Asians I mean don't be afraid and then sometimes. Yeah, so sometimes we like put people in tubes

52:58.780 --> 53:04.980
Showed them pictures of different races had them shoot people of different races wait like video

53:04.980 --> 53:08.540
See how well you finally got my attention

53:09.300 --> 53:14.540
Yeah, I was like for a while. I was like dee dee dee dee dee dee boring, but now

53:15.620 --> 53:17.620
Here we go

53:18.740 --> 53:26.060
We don't have an FMRI machine, but can you test Dan can you test Dan right now? I could yeah, oh shit

53:26.060 --> 53:35.620
Wait, you can test me. I mean I could stick you in a tube. Yeah, just point at it and say he's racist. I

53:35.620 --> 53:40.100
Know he protests too much. I'm I'm the only non-racist here in this fucking room

53:41.940 --> 53:43.940
705

53:44.260 --> 53:49.500
But what are you I'm asking sincerely like what is your?

53:49.500 --> 53:56.180
Branch like what are you guys seeking to discover so my specific branches is not necessarily

53:56.740 --> 53:59.740
everyone's who studies the same thing that I do is about how to

54:01.340 --> 54:05.900
Mitigate discrimination, so I study like ways to make people not racist

54:07.020 --> 54:09.020
Make me not racist

54:14.340 --> 54:16.820
Can I ask you an honest question is it about

54:16.820 --> 54:23.500
Being aware and trying to actively combat your inherent biases. Yeah, actually, that's absolutely what it is

54:23.500 --> 54:25.500
So it's mostly about I

54:27.340 --> 54:32.380
Keep this is terrible. I keep telling that to people and then they keep calling me racist

54:34.100 --> 54:38.660
It's like well, I can admit my inherent biases. It's mostly that people are

54:39.220 --> 54:42.540
In the culture they grow up in the same culture. They know the same shit

54:42.540 --> 54:47.940
Everyone has access to the same knowledge and that knowledge like influences your split-second decisions

54:47.940 --> 54:53.060
Whether you actually really wanted to or not so people who explicitly really don't want to be

54:53.420 --> 54:56.020
Racists and fucks who wouldn't who had never heard

54:58.020 --> 55:00.020
For a second in a split-second decision

55:00.380 --> 55:08.100
We'll do it because they're because of their circumstances, which is why the solution to

55:08.700 --> 55:10.700
racism would be

55:10.700 --> 55:14.620
increasing exposure to an environment in which those

55:16.500 --> 55:24.020
Neurological pathways were no longer formed. Yeah, in other words, just people getting bored with the idea that we come in different colors

55:25.100 --> 55:32.860
Yeah, so I think ultimately the idea is to make people not discriminate based on race in terms of their

55:32.860 --> 55:40.220
Neurological responses and their split-second decisions, but right now noticing race is important because there's a lot of

55:41.780 --> 55:45.380
Socio-economical status shit that goes on based on race

55:45.380 --> 55:51.220
So if you deny someone their race you're kind of denying a whole history of shit that they went through

55:51.580 --> 55:53.580
That's a really interesting thing

55:53.580 --> 56:00.500
Yeah, big a drink the modern idea that that

56:01.540 --> 56:03.540
invisibility of race is

56:03.780 --> 56:08.260
The definition of non-racism has this weird cloaked like

56:08.860 --> 56:13.780
Aggression to it where it which comes from big brother, which is like

56:13.780 --> 56:17.620
Oh who wants more than George W. Bush?

56:17.620 --> 56:24.700
For instance or the Pentagon for all of us to not see anything other than another human being when we look at it

56:24.700 --> 56:27.200
But wait, okay. This is a serious thing

56:28.100 --> 56:29.780
finally

56:29.780 --> 56:37.860
my daughter when she was you know in preschool and kindergarten she had a friend who was black she was and

56:37.860 --> 56:46.700
And my that's not a bad thing. No, it's a good. Well, we'll get to that. Just hold on buckle up

56:48.660 --> 56:53.180
Well, I'm gonna turn her around. I'm gonna make her the biggest races here. No

56:54.020 --> 57:00.060
But she was asked to describe her friend who she was talking about and she described her

57:00.060 --> 57:06.540
She's only very long beautiful hair and and and brown eyes and she didn't mention her skin or anything. She didn't see

57:06.540 --> 57:08.420
the

57:08.420 --> 57:09.900
defining

57:09.900 --> 57:15.740
characteristics of race in that when do we when do we first start seeing that actually it happens around

57:16.740 --> 57:22.700
Three and four years old, but it gets stronger the older we get so because I think we're conditioned

57:22.700 --> 57:30.380
It's because of exposure. So you are exposed to cultural attitudes and associations through TV and

57:30.380 --> 57:37.660
And media and all kinds of in your parents mostly your parents, right? It's people coming out and saying that person's black

57:37.660 --> 57:43.580
And also also you're like you notice novelty and things in your environment that are different and you get rewarded for

57:43.660 --> 57:46.780
If somebody were to come up to me after the show and they were to say

57:48.340 --> 57:52.660
Hey, my name is Glenn Glenn Johnson. I saw you at the

57:53.300 --> 57:54.940
such-and-such show

57:54.940 --> 57:58.980
Remember me with the pink hat and if I were to go pink hat

57:58.980 --> 58:04.060
Um you and you're all you guys with the pink hats and you guys were there at the bachelor party

58:04.380 --> 58:09.260
You the dopamine spikes you get rewarded as a primate for noticing patterns

58:09.260 --> 58:18.020
Yeah, absolutely you you excel as a primate because you remember things you remember patterns and connections our brains formed

58:18.460 --> 58:20.460
to notice to to

58:20.980 --> 58:22.980
systematically process things and regulate and

58:22.980 --> 58:29.340
Condense all this shit that we process and the simplest way to do that is to put a label on someone like the definition of

58:29.500 --> 58:36.060
Charming is James Bond walking into a casino and smelling someone's perfume and saying oh, that's that kind of perfume

58:36.060 --> 58:41.500
And the woman says oh my god, you're so amazing. You're so much more amazing than other men

58:44.300 --> 58:46.300
The audience isn't a plaza

58:46.300 --> 58:52.620
It's better got a beer everyone spends we got a beer. I'm sorry describe the derailed the good work

58:53.140 --> 58:55.140
Just let's talk about racism

58:59.620 --> 59:03.100
Connections like people remembering what color your eyes are

59:03.900 --> 59:09.460
When's our anniversary all these things like like seemingly superficial connections

59:10.340 --> 59:13.420
They become when they're politicized there

59:13.420 --> 59:17.700
They're when they're attached to an inherently classic society

59:18.260 --> 59:24.700
That's when they become problematic in all other areas. We reward them. We go. Oh that guy's so awesome

59:24.700 --> 59:26.700
He remembered my birthday

59:27.780 --> 59:29.300
true

59:29.300 --> 59:30.980
but I

59:30.980 --> 59:33.380
Thought you'd back me up more on this than that

59:33.980 --> 59:35.980
No, she's a contrarian

59:35.980 --> 59:43.700
Well, I feel like you know like we get rewarded for processing things in that manner, but that can get us into

59:44.500 --> 59:51.620
Trouble right like if you're a police officer and you make a split-second decision to shoot an unarmed black man because you have these

59:52.100 --> 59:54.100
associations

59:54.100 --> 59:56.100
That's not fucking okay

59:56.100 --> 01:00:06.180
Oh, you killed your mind. No, we're being censored, but you're right. You're right. No, I any other circumstance

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.860
We are rewarded. Yeah, I certainly wasn't saying oh god racism is great

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:16.700
All right, what I'm saying is what I'm saying is that re like racism is a thing that we fucking struggle with

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:23.740
Necessarily because we wake up in the morning ago. I'm gonna go hate a bunch of people today. It's often because

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.420
We're

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.780

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:49.540
You're damn right what you're saying is right. I mean that's how we developed evolved as humans

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:54.460
It's how we not got eaten, but it's also how he decided racism was a cool thing

The universal music for boring

Like kind of yeah middle-earth middle-earth. Yeah dick wolf is here

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:10.520
Oh, the eye of Sauron sees everything but she doesn't see my lady

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.200
Oh when a penny falls from heaven

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:24.600
I got an orc for a nickel. Can I I got a gold-plated sword, but I'm going to practice black magic

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.600
But I can't keep the black magic in my mind

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.440
Got a lady on my quarter

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.760
With a nickel in my border

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.880
Look at these things they're tax forms

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:45.840
I mean, you don't have to understand them. That's the view why you give them to me because it's my job

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.240
Thank you. That's very kind

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:56.560
You're really by the books. I fucking hippie deal on the job guy fuck. All right. I guess I can't do this D&D

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:02.280
Here we go music me. Give me something really dark and

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.960
Fantasy like Lord of the Wings

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.440
Yeah, all right, I haven't prepared anything so this is just off the top

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:20.320
When we last met our heroes were on the ghost way a perilous path forged by ghosts

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:26.600
Wrought completely in darkness and without vision our heroes

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.120
Accomplished the feat of getting across a pit trap without having eyes

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:38.400
But then Christopher realized he had goggles of night and the gang found their way to vision

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:46.320
Using their vision they got to the end of the ghost way where their path was barred by a ghostly portcullis

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:52.080
The portcullis was made quick work of by Chris de Burgh's roguery skills

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.640
And the gang was out

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:05.600
Following the cave little Baskins let them know that they would get quite cold and chilly and they would need some warm skin

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:13.600
So they thought to get themselves some leather off the backs of rhinoceri and the gang with great gusto

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.880
Attacked rhinoceri and murdered them for their flesh skins

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.560
After leaving the cave our heroes found themselves in yet another graveyard

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:33.120
But the graveyard was not alone for they were encountered by double hand the fighter and

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.600
Onius the skullborn

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.840
Two gnolls claiming revenge for the murder of their blood mate

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.240
Yerch the gnoll

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:50.600
But as our foes drew up their powerful magics would our heroes be able to truly win the day

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.160
fight others or

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.440
kill shit

01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:12.960
Find out next time on a Harmontown episode the end. Yeah, the end. How much time do we have?

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.240
Nine minutes or nine minutes. All right

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:23.680
Yes, thank you. Yeah, I do need those for reference. I

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.360
Examine my surroundings. You were in a small graveyard

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:35.320
Occupied by two gnolls as well as several members of the undead

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:45.800
The undead sure what do you want to do everybody go? I use diplomacy on on who I?

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.000
Baffle them with a 1080 form

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.560
Who are you?

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.560
Diploma sizing who are you?

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.120
Diploma sizing one of the gnolls

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.960
What

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.960
What do you say to them?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.160
Don't fuck with us a little bit your words are convincing

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.240
It's a great game

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:23.340
It's a great game. I I want to like it. I just don't know how well

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.120
Just try harder. I mean it looks like the whole you threw your papers like homework

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:35.040
Well, don't don't look at it like that. Well, give make it colorful next time

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:41.600
It's all black and white and it's got grids and it's boring as an easy problem to solve my

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:48.520
Exactly, you knew I was gonna be here tonight. I didn't I did not. Oh, you didn't I did not

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:56.000
Diplomacy successful talk to anyone around here the gnolls the gnolls

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.640
They start speaking they're like holy shit. That's a really convincing argument

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:11.560
Well, I guess you got to tell us why you killed our fucking packmate because he was a great a great friend to us

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.240
And you murdered him

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.240
I'll answer that will you who are you? I'm

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:32.360
I'm Sharpie Buttsalot. He sure is and I've been through a great deal with this group and I've remembered 40% of it

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:37.120
That's generous and I say to you that your friend as

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.360
Much as he was an ally to you

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:48.000
