00:45.400\nLook, you know, you got cocky, you know.\n\n00:45.400 --> 00:49.160\nI would have said something nice if you didn't, but you know, you were fooling yourselves,\n\n00:49.160 --> 00:52.560\nso fuck you.\n\n00:52.560 --> 01:04.600\nIt's Harmontown!\n\n01:04.600 --> 01:09.280\nI am the ugly Jeff Davis.\n\n01:09.280 --> 01:26.640\nAnd now, for your listening pleasure, Daniel Harmon!\n\n01:26.640 --> 01:56.480\nI am the ugly Jeff Davis.\n\n01:56.480 --> 02:01.240\nThe gayest nerd ever.\n\n02:01.240 --> 02:02.240\nHi.\n\n02:02.240 --> 02:05.640\nSo, did you notice something special about the show's format tonight?\n\n02:05.640 --> 02:08.160\nYeah, we got a fucking real organist.\n\n02:08.160 --> 02:09.160\nYeah!\n\n02:09.160 --> 02:14.160\nNo, this guy.\n\n02:14.160 --> 02:18.320\nNo, you've been here for years, right?\n\n02:18.320 --> 02:20.320\nLike how many years?\n\n02:20.320 --> 02:21.320\n92.\n\n02:21.320 --> 02:23.520\nAnd what's the name again?\n\n02:23.520 --> 02:24.520\nSorry.\n\n02:24.520 --> 02:25.520\nDennis Scott.\n\n02:25.520 --> 02:27.800\nIt's kind of like a fake name.\n\n02:27.800 --> 02:35.120\nDennis Scott previously a real name, wanted in three states, but now creating a new life\n\n02:35.120 --> 02:39.520\nas of 92 as an organist in a theater.\n\n02:39.520 --> 02:43.520\nDennis Scott.\n\n02:43.520 --> 02:46.640\nNo such lineage ever.\n\n02:46.640 --> 02:51.440\nPick up first name and then give us a last name for God's sake.\n\n02:51.440 --> 02:52.440\nDennis Scott.\n\n02:52.440 --> 03:01.440\nYeah, he's an icon here at this 1929, this theater.\n\n03:01.440 --> 03:03.560\nI used to come here and watch movies.\n\n03:03.560 --> 03:08.920\nI came here, I invited a bunch of friends over one Christmas Eve, it was December 23rd\n\n03:08.920 --> 03:13.440\nand I invited all my friends to come and watch it, it's a wonderful life here.\n\n03:13.440 --> 03:17.400\nAnd no one came.\n\n03:17.400 --> 03:26.040\nAnd I, it was me looking at the screen and at the end when it said, no man is a failure\n\n03:26.040 --> 03:40.640\nwho has friends, worst night of my life.\n\n03:40.640 --> 03:45.800\nDennis Scott's shift usually ends an hour ago.\n\n03:45.800 --> 03:50.840\nI kicked some money in, I thought it would be fun to have him here for a Harmontown\n\n03:50.840 --> 03:51.840\nshow.\n\n03:51.840 --> 03:52.840\nIt is?\n\n03:52.840 --> 03:53.840\nYeah.\n\n03:53.840 --> 04:03.240\nSo, for instance, if we were to say, oh, it's time for Dino to tell us about the craziest\n\n04:03.240 --> 04:08.160\nsexual thing he's ever done.\n\n04:08.160 --> 04:12.360\nMy mom's in the audience, my mom's in the audience.\n\n04:12.360 --> 04:18.160\nOh, that's true, I do have a couple rules because my mom's in the audience.\n\n04:18.160 --> 04:19.960\nI have a few things.\n\n04:19.960 --> 04:25.840\nIt's time for Dino's rules segment.\n\n04:25.840 --> 04:28.360\nYeah.\n\n04:28.360 --> 04:30.320\nThe saddest segment ever.\n\n04:30.320 --> 04:35.680\nSo, there's a few things that we can't say on this show.\n\n04:35.680 --> 04:38.760\nFirst thing, cunt.\n\n04:38.760 --> 04:39.760\nCan't say cunt.\n\n04:39.760 --> 04:41.400\nLike, just in general?\n\n04:41.400 --> 04:44.000\nDon't say cunt at all.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.440\nNot just, we can't say your mom's a cunt.\n\n04:47.440 --> 04:52.760\nI don't know about that.\n\n04:52.760 --> 04:53.760\nMostly cunt.\n\n04:53.760 --> 04:56.600\nI mean, there's certain variables involved.\n\n04:56.600 --> 05:06.920\nYou know, she probably doesn't like cuntiness or cunt load or cunt organ.\n\n05:06.920 --> 05:14.760\nWe were at dinner at a fine Greek restaurant today.\n\n05:14.760 --> 05:24.040\nI went and joined Dino and his family, including his mother, who is wonderful, 80 years old.\n\n05:24.040 --> 05:25.040\n81.\n\n05:25.040 --> 05:27.960\nShe'll make you remember.\n\n05:27.960 --> 05:32.760\nYou wouldn't know it from talking to her, she's got all the pluck of Christian Slater\n\n05:32.760 --> 05:36.760\nfrom Heather's.\n\n05:36.760 --> 05:39.640\nThat's what I actually picture when I'm talking to her.\n\n05:39.640 --> 05:42.760\nGuess the one person who doesn't understand that joke here.\n\n05:42.760 --> 05:43.760\nExactly.\n\n05:43.760 --> 05:44.760\nI love it.\n\n05:44.760 --> 05:48.680\nBut she loves me and I love her.\n\n05:48.680 --> 05:50.080\nYou call her MamaTopoulos.\n\n05:50.080 --> 05:51.240\nI call her MamaTopoulos.\n\n05:51.240 --> 05:54.680\nBecause I can never remember her first name.\n\n05:54.680 --> 05:55.680\nTula.\n\n05:55.680 --> 05:56.680\nTula.\n\n05:56.680 --> 06:01.440\nOh, he doesn't give a shit about her first name.\n\n06:01.440 --> 06:06.280\nBut tonight, Dino's like a thousand years old.\n\n06:06.280 --> 06:09.800\nI'm turning 50 this year.\n\n06:09.800 --> 06:11.960\nIt's the new 30.\n\n06:11.960 --> 06:13.480\nIt's the new sexy.\n\n06:13.480 --> 06:20.600\nTonight, for the first time in his 50 year life, sitting next to his mom in a Greek restaurant\n\n06:20.600 --> 06:21.600\nin Chicago.\n\n06:21.600 --> 06:23.720\nShe screamed this.\n\n06:23.720 --> 06:27.280\nDino was razing his mom as he often does.\n\n06:27.280 --> 06:30.560\nOh, mom, you're a piece of shit.\n\n06:30.560 --> 06:31.560\nWhatever.\n\n06:31.560 --> 06:34.400\nLike, oh, mom.\n\n06:34.400 --> 06:40.040\nAnd tonight, for the first time ever, ever, I swear to God, your mom spun toward you and\n\n06:40.040 --> 06:53.520\npointed a finger at you and said, you were a mistake.\n\n06:53.520 --> 06:54.520\nWhich is amazing.\n\n06:54.520 --> 07:00.000\nThe thing that was amazing to me is that it took her that long to tell you that.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:06.760\nBecause my mom told me that as soon as I learned the words you, were, and mistake.\n\n07:06.760 --> 07:10.680\nNo, she was winding up for the big one.\n\n07:10.680 --> 07:16.800\nShe knew she had a fucking moment where I was going to give her shit a lot.\n\n07:16.800 --> 07:17.800\nAnd it was tonight.\n\n07:17.800 --> 07:21.320\nAnd I love that there was also some fracas there.\n\n07:21.320 --> 07:25.720\nAnd then your brother was also at the table, and he's older than you, right?\n\n07:25.720 --> 07:27.480\nNo, he's two years younger.\n\n07:27.480 --> 07:28.480\nOh, OK.\n\n07:28.480 --> 07:31.720\nWell, his ponytail's gray hair.\n\n07:31.720 --> 07:35.240\nBut he was, and then at a certain point, she wheeled at him and said, you were a mistake\n\n07:35.240 --> 07:36.240\ntoo.\n\n07:36.240 --> 07:37.240\nI know.\n\n07:37.240 --> 07:40.520\nShe's really, I think she screamed, you were a mistake.\n\n07:40.520 --> 07:43.120\nYou are all mistakes here to my mom.\n\n07:43.120 --> 07:48.840\nI love that that's like, if you live long enough as a woman, that is actually, you're\n\n07:48.840 --> 07:49.840\nright.\n\n07:49.840 --> 07:51.360\nLike, no way, you get to go.\n\n07:51.360 --> 07:53.400\nYou're all a fucking mistake.\n\n07:53.400 --> 08:04.560\nBecause it occurred to me when she said that, that Yahweh was saying that to Adam and Eve.\n\n08:04.560 --> 08:11.960\nAnd that humankind, whether you believe Darwin's version of the species development or in fundamentalist\n\n08:11.960 --> 08:15.360\nprinciple, both agree on one thing.\n\n08:15.360 --> 08:16.360\nWe are a mistake.\n\n08:16.360 --> 08:17.360\nYeah.\n\n08:17.360 --> 08:21.440\nAnd that's a profound thing.\n\n08:21.440 --> 08:26.080\nLike, who wants, who here wants to be the result of a divine plan?\n\n08:26.080 --> 08:27.080\nThat's dumb.\n\n08:27.080 --> 08:28.080\nStupid.\n\n08:28.080 --> 08:29.080\nNo.\n\n08:29.080 --> 08:33.760\nHere are some things that are the result of a lot of planning.\n\n08:33.760 --> 08:34.760\nAftermash.\n\n08:34.760 --> 08:35.760\nGood organ.\n\n08:35.760 --> 08:47.520\nThey had all the time of the world to think of that one.\n\n08:47.520 --> 08:55.520\nThe organ guy here, the hangover, yeah, yeah, what is his name, Dick Wolf, Dick, Dick Wolf\n\n08:55.520 --> 08:56.520\non organ.\n\n08:56.520 --> 08:58.520\nDick Wolf is fine.\n\n08:58.520 --> 09:01.440\nSecond thing we can't say part.\n\n09:01.440 --> 09:02.440\nLet's just try.\n\n09:02.440 --> 09:03.440\nI just want to get out of my system.\n\n09:03.440 --> 09:04.440\nAll right.\n\n09:04.440 --> 09:05.440\nI want to, I want to wrap.\n\n09:05.440 --> 09:06.440\nI guess this bit's over.\n\n09:06.440 --> 09:07.440\nI want to wrap.\n\n09:07.440 --> 09:08.440\nWe got to try it.\n\n09:08.440 --> 09:11.960\nCan you just like, let's take anything with a steady tempo.\n\n09:11.960 --> 09:12.960\nOkay.\n\n09:12.960 --> 09:13.960\nYeah.\n\n09:13.960 --> 09:14.960\nYeah.\n\n09:14.960 --> 09:15.960\nYeah.\n\n09:15.960 --> 09:16.960\nYeah.\n\n09:16.960 --> 09:17.960\nYeah.\n\n09:17.960 --> 09:18.960\nYeah.\n\n09:18.960 --> 09:19.960\nYeah.\n\n09:19.960 --> 09:20.960\nYeah.\n\n09:20.960 --> 09:21.960\nYeah.\n\n09:21.960 --> 09:22.960\nYeah.\n\n09:22.960 --> 09:23.960\nYeah.\n\n09:23.960 --> 09:24.960\nYeah.\n\n09:24.960 --> 09:25.960\nYeah.\n\n09:25.960 --> 09:26.960\nYeah.\n\n09:26.960 --> 09:29.520\nWrapping to the organ because the beat is my own.\n\n09:29.520 --> 09:33.760\nI fucked your mama so hard she tried to call me on the phone.\n\n09:33.760 --> 09:36.400\nI said, I can't talk to you.\n\n09:36.400 --> 09:38.000\nI'm calling you back.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:42.240\nI fucked your mama so hard that her heart got a crack.\n\n09:42.240 --> 09:47.120\nI put my dick in the crack and I made it extra wide.\n\n09:47.120 --> 09:56.640\nI fucked your mama so hard she said, bye, oh, my, oh, my.\n\n09:56.640 --> 09:57.640\nYeah.\n\n09:57.640 --> 09:58.640\nYeah.\n\n09:58.640 --> 10:00.640\nI fucked your mama.\n\n10:00.640 --> 10:03.640\nI fucked your mama.\n\n10:03.640 --> 10:05.640\n1929.\n\n10:05.640 --> 10:10.080\nIt's raining pennies.\n\n10:10.080 --> 10:15.680\nI fucked your mama, the depression fucked your mama.\n\n10:15.680 --> 10:17.360\nI fucked your mama.\n\n10:17.360 --> 10:18.360\nAll right.\n\n10:18.360 --> 10:19.360\nAll right.\n\n10:19.360 --> 10:28.600\nI think, I, I, I, I, thanks kids, thanks.\n\n10:28.600 --> 10:33.280\nI hate to bring this up now, but number three is fucked your mama.\n\n10:33.280 --> 10:36.240\nWe can't say that at all.\n\n10:36.240 --> 10:39.680\nNumber four, don't say Jesus sucked a cock.\n\n10:39.680 --> 10:40.680\nHe's very religious.\n\n10:40.680 --> 10:41.680\nHe's Gregor the dox.\n\n10:41.680 --> 10:47.160\nI get, I get weirded out when I hear that and I hate Jesus.\n\n10:47.160 --> 10:53.400\nSo I heard a story, okay, we'll, we'll, we'll get back to the list later.\n\n10:53.400 --> 10:57.680\nIt's my only written bit.\n\n10:57.680 --> 11:04.240\nOh, are we going to watch Nasperatu?\n\n11:04.240 --> 11:13.280\nI, I, there was somebody that told me a story in the community writer's room that, that\n\n11:13.280 --> 11:18.880\nthere was a person who, like, I guess this must happen all the time and I'm worried because\n\n11:18.880 --> 11:23.960\nthere's probably 800 people here that this happened to one of them.\n\n11:23.960 --> 11:35.360\nAnd every once in a while, a grandparent kills a kid.\n\n11:35.360 --> 11:41.840\nI don't know how much you paid him, but money well spent.\n\n11:41.840 --> 11:51.960\nEvery once in a while in America, somewhere, a father of 35 who has a two year old child\n\n11:51.960 --> 11:55.320\nleaves his child in the care of his 70 year old mother.\n\n11:55.320 --> 11:56.680\nOh, so it's my mistake.\n\n11:56.680 --> 11:58.840\nIt's not, it's not premeditated.\n\n11:58.840 --> 12:00.320\nIt's not underworld.\n\n12:00.320 --> 12:01.320\nYeah.\n\n12:01.320 --> 12:03.040\nThe, I don't know.\n\n12:03.040 --> 12:07.840\nCan you, can you imagine, I just want to imagine like, like everyone here in this room is like\n\n12:07.840 --> 12:14.200\nin some state of either hating their parents or hope or having their own kids.\n\n12:14.200 --> 12:15.680\nThere is never any in between.\n\n12:15.680 --> 12:21.400\nCan you imagine like if you were like, okay, I fucking hate my parents, but I have my own\n\n12:21.400 --> 12:22.400\nkid.\n\n12:22.400 --> 12:24.400\nMom, will you babysit the kid?\n\n12:24.400 --> 12:25.400\nYeah.\n\n12:25.400 --> 12:29.240\nI got to go to work and then you come home and your mom is like, I killed your kid.\n\n12:29.240 --> 12:30.240\nYeah.\n\n12:30.240 --> 12:32.240\nNo, I, I agree.\n\n12:32.240 --> 12:34.720\nI'd be the worst grandparent.\n\n12:34.720 --> 12:38.680\nOnce I got drunk, I'd be time to hold the baby.\n\n12:38.680 --> 12:44.360\nBut I'm saying, I'm thinking, they were talking about that in a writer's room and I said,\n\n12:44.360 --> 12:55.600\nI actually got excited because I was like, did you, did you give them $5,000?\n\n12:55.600 --> 12:56.600\nReally?\n\n12:56.600 --> 12:57.600\nYeah.\n\n12:57.600 --> 13:03.440\nThis guy's working overtime.\n\n13:03.440 --> 13:10.680\nI actually picture if my mom killed my kid, I, there was a little bit of excitement because\n\n13:10.680 --> 13:15.320\nI was like, I could kill my mom.\n\n13:15.320 --> 13:22.240\nAnd while I was killing her, I could be like, you, I'm not going to hell for this.\n\n13:22.240 --> 13:24.600\nYou love Greek tragedies.\n\n13:24.600 --> 13:26.640\nIt was worth it.\n\n13:26.640 --> 13:31.240\nI'll have another kid, but this one's not on me.\n\n13:31.240 --> 13:33.600\nI don't know.\n\n13:33.600 --> 13:34.600\nYou wouldn't feel that way.\n\n13:34.600 --> 13:35.600\nYou'd love your kid.\n\n13:35.600 --> 13:36.600\nSorry to bring everything down.\n\n13:36.600 --> 13:42.920\nI love my kid and I tashed that love in for an opportunity to kill my mother and have\n\n13:42.920 --> 13:46.760\nanother kid free of her influence.\n\n13:46.760 --> 13:47.760\nYou're better than me.\n\n13:47.760 --> 13:52.600\nI would, I would, I would be, I would just be sad.\n\n13:52.600 --> 13:56.080\nYour mom mentioned something tonight at the dinner table.\n\n13:56.080 --> 13:59.600\nOh, I have another word we can't say.\n\n13:59.600 --> 14:00.600\nCunt.\n\n14:00.600 --> 14:04.040\nDid I say that

I thought I was supposed to open my mind.\n\n16:07.600 --> 16:09.600\nAlright, what's the gout? What is it?\n\n16:09.600 --> 16:12.600\nSo it's, I mean, do you know what I was right?\n\n16:12.600 --> 16:16.600\nIt starts with rich foods, like a beef chicken.\n\n16:16.600 --> 16:17.600\nWhat's rich mean?\n\n16:17.600 --> 16:22.600\nRich means anything. Well, gout was originally like a rich person back in ancient Greece and stuff.\n\n16:22.600 --> 16:27.600\nIt was like a rich person. The people who would get it were people who could afford to be fat.\n\n16:27.600 --> 16:30.600\nSo like, you know, I got the gout.\n\n16:30.600 --> 16:32.600\nThat's pretty much us.\n\n16:32.600 --> 16:33.600\nYeah.\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:35.600\nSo like saturated fats?\n\n16:35.600 --> 16:38.600\nYeah, it's all healthy fats.\n\n16:39.600 --> 16:42.600\nYeah, uric acid builds up in your...\n\n16:43.600 --> 16:46.600\nEveryone who has an opinion, get up here.\n\n16:47.600 --> 16:49.600\nWe have a gout support group.\n\n16:49.600 --> 16:52.600\nSo the gout, then it collects in your foot.\n\n16:52.600 --> 16:56.600\nYeah, so you can have it, a lot of people get it in their elbow, but mine happens to be in both my feet.\n\n16:56.600 --> 17:02.600\nI think, my theory is that if you don't walk around a lot of your truck driver, you get gout in your ass.\n\n17:02.600 --> 17:05.600\nLike you get hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids is the same as gout.\n\n17:05.600 --> 17:07.600\nIs that the same?\n\n17:07.600 --> 17:08.600\nIs that idiotic?\n\n17:08.600 --> 17:11.600\nYour theory, we have a guy with gout.\n\n17:11.600 --> 17:13.600\nHe's not a doctor either.\n\n17:13.600 --> 17:15.600\nBut he's the next best thing to a doctor.\n\n17:15.600 --> 17:16.600\nHe's the guy who had gout.\n\n17:16.600 --> 17:18.600\nHe's the guy with gout.\n\n17:18.600 --> 17:19.600\nAll right.\n\n17:19.600 --> 17:20.600\nI'm a guy with gout.\n\n17:20.600 --> 17:22.600\nThe only way you learn is by bouncing it off me.\n\n17:22.600 --> 17:24.600\nI can say, no, Dino, that's not how it works.\n\n17:24.600 --> 17:26.600\nSo really, it's not...\n\n17:26.600 --> 17:31.600\nWell, first of all, the terrible thing is you go to the doctor and you're like, my foot hurts.\n\n17:31.600 --> 17:34.600\nAnd I have a micro fracture and he's like, no, you have gout.\n\n17:34.600 --> 17:36.600\nAnd I was like, okay, so what can I take to get rid of you?\n\n17:36.600 --> 17:37.600\nHe's like, no, no, it's with you for life.\n\n17:37.600 --> 17:39.600\nNo, but you take pills, right?\n\n17:39.600 --> 17:40.600\nNo.\n\n17:40.600 --> 17:41.600\nYeah, my mom takes pills.\n\n17:41.600 --> 17:42.600\nThey don't do that until it's like really...\n\n17:42.600 --> 17:43.600\nMy mom takes pills.\n\n17:43.600 --> 17:44.600\nOkay, Jesus Christ.\n\n17:44.600 --> 17:47.600\nI ease the pain.

We all have them, right?\n\n40:40.900 --> 40:43.060\nOh, can I tell you about the Uber driver I\n\n40:44.060 --> 40:50.500\nGot the driver to pick me up. You're starting to wear thin. I know I know this is the last anecdote. I'm joking\n\n40:50.500 --> 40:55.380\nI just said we love him. I got the Uber driver to pick me up and he was like, which way do you want to go?\n\n40:55.380 --> 40:58.500\nDo you want to take the expressway? Do you want to take services? I'm like, oh, man\n\n40:59.100 --> 41:03.540\nI'm not from around here. What do you whatever works?\n\n41:04.300 --> 41:06.300\nBecause I'm high as fuck\n\n41:06.460 --> 41:13.140\nAnd the guy's like I'll take the fastest way, you know us taxi cab drivers make more money\n\n41:13.500 --> 41:19.220\nIf we get more people so I'll take you the fastest way. I'm like, what the fuck dude\n\n41:19.220 --> 41:25.140\nI'm deferring to you and you're trying to get all high and mighty over. What ways the best and\n\n41:25.820 --> 41:29.440\nThen I realized he was just being really helpful. He was just like\n\n41:30.260 --> 41:36.420\nThis is what you need to know about cab drivers is this is how they make their money. He was trying to help\n\n41:36.420 --> 41:40.260\nI thought he was being all high and mighty to me being like, here's how it works, man\n\n41:40.260 --> 41:43.700\nWe get people to where they're going. That's how we make money\n\n41:43.700 --> 41:49.140\nBut he was like, no, we actually this is our business. And so we had a lovely talk\n\n41:50.260 --> 41:56.060\nSo so Spencer, do you do you feel better now that you you've let this out? No, I feel really hurt\n\n41:57.140 --> 42:02.860\nBetrayed even I feel like Spencer. You're a young man. You're a young man. There's a\n\n42:07.060 --> 42:09.060\nGo ahead say something else\n\n42:09.060 --> 42:14.860\nYeah, there is a storm raging beneath you. There's a storm raging beneath you\n\n42:18.380 --> 42:20.380\nHe gets it\n\n42:22.940 --> 42:31.060\nWhen Spencer, I want to tell everybody here in Chicago when we've gone to how many 45,000 cities together\n\n42:31.060 --> 42:34.420\nYeah, no 47,000 Spencer\n\n42:35.020 --> 42:37.020\nNothing I look forward to more\n\n42:37.020 --> 42:41.620\nLike the idea of oh, we're going to this and that city\n\n42:41.620 --> 42:46.540\nOh, what it let's all meet at my house and get into a car together. Yeah, how's he gonna react?\n\n42:46.940 --> 42:53.940\nSpencer is always like, I'll go by myself. So and I was like, okay. All right, fine that over time\n\n42:53.940 --> 43:00.260\nIt's like Spencer. Why are you always going by yourself? And then Spencer slowly reveals. He says I\n\n43:01.660 --> 43:03.660\nIt's not I don't\n\n43:03.660 --> 43:08.820\nWant to not go to the airport with you guys, but when I like to have my car at the airport\n\n43:09.420 --> 43:14.660\nBecause when the plane lands, I want to get to my car as quickly as possible and we'll have control over\n\n43:16.220 --> 43:22.380\nWhere I'm going as quickly as possible and and that's something that's taken away from me when the airports\n\n43:22.740 --> 43:29.180\nTake a car driver. Look at him. He looks like a hermit. I can't believe so cares about control. So today\n\n43:29.900 --> 43:31.900\nI got new insight into this\n\n43:31.900 --> 43:35.300\nBecause you said this is a second time\n\n43:35.300 --> 43:42.060\nI've been in a car with you where we've been driving and I pop up on my laptop and I start playing Minecraft and\n\n43:42.500 --> 43:46.980\nSpencer, this is the second time Spencer goes. It says to the driver. Hey\n\n43:47.900 --> 43:49.900\nHow how long?\n\n43:50.500 --> 43:52.500\nDo you what's the\n\n43:52.500 --> 43:57.140\nHow long do you think I'm making you sound stupid? How long do you think it'll take to get there?\n\n43:57.140 --> 44:02.980\nYeah, how long do you think it'll take to get there about? What's the estimated time estimate and the driver will go like oh\n\n44:03.980 --> 44:05.980\nI\n\n44:05.980 --> 44:12.260\nI guess a bunch of bullshit if there's wind I've got 27 minutes and there's a go. Okay, cool. Cool. Yeah\n\n44:12.260 --> 44:17.540\nBut isn't that me texting you asking you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, thank you though\n\n44:17.540 --> 44:23.820\nI appreciate that Spencer in a vacuum cannot handle being contained in a metal cocoon\n\n44:23.820 --> 44:29.900\nRight with no control over wind or knowledge. I just feel like I'll become a metal butterfly\n\n44:31.460 --> 44:34.940\nSo so today he did that he did it again. He goes like we're\n\n44:35.460 --> 44:41.620\nHow long to the thing and the and the and the driver who's adorable goes like with traffic 20 minutes\n\n44:41.620 --> 44:48.340\nAnd then and then the driver the driver kept going the driver kept going like oh just because Spencer said that he's like\n\n44:48.460 --> 44:52.140\nJust 15 more minutes of the thing and it's Spencer said\n\n44:52.140 --> 44:54.860\nParaphrasing Spencer said\n\n44:55.740 --> 45:00.860\nLook, I I wasn't asking earlier because I am on a schedule\n\n45:00.860 --> 45:06.820\nIt's just that normally when I drive to places. I know when I'm going to get there\n\n45:07.100 --> 45:12.220\nIt's true. And when someone else is driving me, I don't know when I'm going to get there\n\n45:12.380 --> 45:13.220\nIt's true\n\n45:13.220 --> 45:19.380\nSo I need to ask them when I'm going to get there and I was like this is fascinating\n\n45:19.380 --> 45:20.820\nYeah\n\n45:20.820 --> 45:22.820\nThis is incredible\n\n45:23.260 --> 45:29.980\nBecause I've never I would get I mean, and I'm not a good person for saying this I would get out of an airport\n\n45:30.940 --> 45:32.780\nJump into a car\n\n45:32.780 --> 45:34.940\nSix hours like I would be like whoa\n\n45:35.460 --> 45:37.460\nThanks a lot. Here's $50. I\n\n45:38.300 --> 45:44.500\nSpencer's like he needs to know where he's going and what's going on. You don't trust anybody. It's\n\n45:44.500 --> 45:49.860\nOh, yeah, I don't you trust me. Don't you? Yeah, totally\n\n45:51.180 --> 45:53.500\nIt's I mean, this is not humorous\n\n45:53.500 --> 45:59.140\nBut it's just like my whole life is about getting to know situations before I enter them\n\n45:59.140 --> 46:05.500\nLike I'm all about research and putting in legwork and figuring out how things are gonna be and then easing myself into a situation\n\n46:06.140 --> 46:13.180\nWhen I'm traveling it's really weird not knowing exactly where we're going or how long it'll take and it's just like if I'm in LA\n\n46:13.180 --> 46:16.220\nI'll be like it'll take 10 minutes to get here and 10 minutes to get it's just\n\n46:16.900 --> 46:24.460\nInteresting not having not being that person designed to get me places and not knowing like if I'm gonna be in the car for 15 minutes\n\n46:24.460 --> 46:32.900\nOr 70 minutes. It's weird describe to me the worst-case scenario like when you think of when you go like I don't want to be this guy\n\n46:32.900 --> 46:34.900\nOh, well, I have to shit\n\n46:35.620 --> 46:41.620\nLike I really have to go to the bathroom or do something or I'm thinking about like masturbating or you\n\n46:41.620 --> 46:43.620\nYou would hate being a dog\n\n46:44.500 --> 46:50.220\nBut you could say to anybody I have to pull over. I have to take a shit. I'm saying like what's your word? Hey, what?\n\n46:50.740 --> 46:53.220\nLet's unpack that. Well if somebody\n\n46:54.420 --> 46:59.420\nIf somebody's driving you for so long that you have to oh, yeah, no, no\n\n46:59.420 --> 47:02.060\nI would in that very same Uber driver\n\n47:02.060 --> 47:08.020\nI was in I almost didn't reroute the car to the direction we were supposed to be going because I didn't want to bother the guy\n\n47:08.460 --> 47:10.460\nlike that's just my\n\n47:10.460 --> 47:12.220\ndamage\n\n47:12.220 --> 47:19.260\nBut so are you are you polite or are you a control freak because you don't want to not know how soon you can get somewhere?\n\n47:19.260 --> 47:21.980\nYeah, I mean, that's literally the first time I've asked that question\n\n47:21.980 --> 47:30.100\nAnd we've been on the road several times where I haven't had this is fucking boring. I'm I don't I I'm a I'm a bad person\n\n47:30.100 --> 47:39.460\nI you're right. No, I fix myself. You're a bad person. No, I know I know like I just want to spice the things up. Ah\n\n47:41.060 --> 47:44.100\nThat's like it's amazing that you can't house my Greek\n\n47:44.260 --> 47:47.520\nYou can't put him in a car if you if you I don't like change\n\n47:48.540 --> 47:53.900\nAnd you don't tell him where you're where he's going and how soon he's gonna get there. He will yeah\n\n47:54.340 --> 47:57.420\nAnd look at him now. Yeah, look at me now\n\n47:57.420 --> 48:00.620\nDamn, look at me now\n\n48:02.140 --> 48:07.420\nAll right, so time for D&D. All right. Yeah, we got we're in a tight schedule here\n\n48:08.740 --> 48:11.980\nWe're gonna need a woman to play some of the womanly characters. I\n\n48:12.740 --> 48:15.580\nHold it. I met a woman on the sidewalk\n\n48:16.540 --> 48:19.260\nAnd she pushed all the right buttons because she's\n\n48:20.420 --> 48:22.940\nShe's a professor at the University of\n\n48:23.900 --> 48:25.620\nChicago\n\n48:25.620 --> 48:27.620\nShe's\n\n48:28.020 --> 48:32.420\nStudies neurology and and it's and it's relationship with racism\n\n48:34.140 --> 48:36.140\nJenny are you here? Oh\n\n48:42.380 --> 48:45.260\nShit, this is the updo\n\n48:46.740 --> 48:51.860\nI'm sorry to reduce you to haircut. That's not what you deserve at all. Hi. I don't know\n\n48:51.860 --> 48:59.220\nReally think about that Spencer. She studies neurology and it's relationship with racism. Yeah\n\n48:59.820 --> 49:02.060\nYes, you can you can have all kinds of beers\n\n49:03.540 --> 49:11.820\nThey're shitty non-Chicago beers. Oh shit. You need maybe we're like an old style that work old Milwaukee or something\n\n49:11.820 --> 49:13.660\nThis is good\n\n49:13.660 --> 49:15.620\nAll right, so\n\n49:15.620 --> 49:17.980\nNeurology as I understand is about the\n\n49:17.980 --> 49:24.780\nNeuro I'm aware of the human mind. It's not the hardware shit. We cannot change true. So\n\n49:25.420 --> 49:30.660\nI'm assuming you're gonna say some uncomfortable things if you're a neurologist and you're studying racism\n\n49:31.900 --> 49:33.900\nWell, I'm a neuroscientist\n\n49:34.220 --> 49:39.660\nSlightly different because I don't have a medical degree. You study racism. What? Yeah, so I study\n\n49:40.300 --> 49:42.500\nI said the n-word today. What did you think about that?\n\n49:44.220 --> 49:46.220\nDid it turn you on?\n\n49:46.220 --> 49:48.220\nI\n\n49:51.540 --> 49:54.200\nLove that or interpretation that was\n\n49:58.220 --> 50:00.220\nAnytime Dino enters a room\n\n50:04.420 --> 50:07.340\nYeah, so I started stereotyping and prejudice in the brain\n\n50:07.340 --> 50:23.620\nSo what what does that mean? Okay, so I study. I don't think Asians could do that\n\n50:25.460 --> 50:27.460\nAwesome\n\n50:28.220 --> 50:32.740\nCan we please tell the podcast people at home? Oh, yeah guys, so that she's slightly Asian\n\n50:32.740 --> 50:39.620\nSlightly I'm I'm mixed race. I'm mixed race. So I'm mixed race. Yeah. Yeah. Well, who's dominant, baby\n\n50:41.780 --> 50:49.780\nI'm quarter. I'm perfect quarter. I'll quarter. I got a quarter in my pocket. Yeah, that says you're a full Asian. What? I don't know\n\n50:52.380 --> 50:55.420\nThat's from a radio play called Hitler hits on women\n\n50:56.740 --> 50:58.740\nHey\n\n50:58.740 --> 51:02.740\nYou got a little Nazi in you. Oh\n\n51:06.140 --> 51:10.740\nSorry, yeah, so I'm Japanese French Mexican and Native American\n\n51:11.740 --> 51:13.740\nMan, yeah, French\n\n51:14.620 --> 51:16.820\nFrench is the only thing that is an Asian in you\n\n51:17.580 --> 51:20.900\nNative American well, three of those are not Asian. No\n\n51:20.900 --> 51:28.260\nNo, no, well, didn't the Native Americans come over on the very straight. Yeah, didn't they like definition by the word\n\n51:29.380 --> 51:33.380\nNative American that means Asian didn't they come over on the\n\n51:35.700 --> 51:37.700\nIce bridge\n\n51:37.740 --> 51:44.140\nWhat else are you wait? What else did you say? I said French Japanese Japanese. Yeah, Native American\n\n51:44.220 --> 51:47.060\nMexican. Yeah, Mexican. That's as Asian as you can get\n\n51:47.060 --> 51:57.180\nWe're getting sidetracked here. I think her studies are the important thing. Oh, are they I don't know or are they\n\n52:01.180 --> 52:03.180\nSo I\n\n52:03.180 --> 52:10.740\nYeah, I show people pictures of you know different races and see how their brains respond. So what does it mean how their brains respond?\n\n52:10.740 --> 52:16.500\nWhat are you measuring? So I typically measure I put people in FMRIs MRIs\n\n52:16.500 --> 52:23.460\nAnd then I look at how their brains respond differently to typically white and black people and how it's\n\n52:23.660 --> 52:27.260\nCoopted for the same systems that we respond to for emotions\n\n52:27.260 --> 52:32.140\nSo how we respond to basic things like snakes and spiders and how that's\n\n52:32.820 --> 52:39.300\nCoopted for things like race. So you're putting you're putting people in a tube and scanning their brain and like seeing which parts of their\n\n52:39.300 --> 52:46.940\nBrains light up and they're showing them images of snakes spiders black people and white people\n\n52:46.980 --> 52:50.780\nTypically not snakes and spiders typically black people white people\n\n52:52.140 --> 52:58.020\nAsians I mean don't be afraid and then sometimes. Yeah, so sometimes we like put people in tubes\n\n52:58.780 --> 53:04.980\nShowed them pictures of different races had them shoot people of different races wait like video\n\n53:04.980 --> 53:08.540\nSee how well you finally got my attention\n\n53:09.300 --> 53:14.540\nYeah, I was like for a while. I was like dee dee dee dee dee dee boring, but now\n\n53:15.620 --> 53:17.620\nHere we go\n\n53:18.740 --> 53:26.060\nWe don't have an FMRI machine, but can you test Dan can you test Dan right now? I could yeah, oh shit\n\n53:26.060 --> 53:35.620\nWait, you can test me. I mean I could stick you in a tube. Yeah, just point at it and say he's racist. I\n\n53:35.620 --> 53:40.100\nKnow he protests too much. I'm I'm the only non-racist here in this fucking room\n\n53:41.940 --> 53:43.940\n705\n\n53:44.260 --> 53:49.500\nBut what are you I'm asking sincerely like what is your?\n\n53:49.500 --> 53:56.180\nBranch like what are you guys seeking to discover so my specific branches is not necessarily\n\n53:56.740 --> 53:59.740\neveryone's who studies the same thing that I do is about how to\n\n54:01.340 --> 54:05.900\nMitigate discrimination, so I study like ways to make people not racist\n\n54:07.020 --> 54:09.020\nMake me not racist\n\n54:14.340 --> 54:16.820\nCan I ask you an honest question is it about\n\n54:16.820 --> 54:23.500\nBeing aware and trying to actively combat your inherent biases. Yeah, actually, that's absolutely what it is\n\n54:23.500 --> 54:25.500\nSo it's mostly about I\n\n54:27.340 --> 54:32.380\nKeep this is terrible. I keep telling that to people and then they keep calling me racist\n\n54:34.100 --> 54:38.660\nIt's like well, I can admit my inherent biases. It's mostly that people are\n\n54:39.220 --> 54:42.540\nIn the culture they grow up in the same culture. They know the same shit\n\n54:42.540 --> 54:47.940\nEveryone has access to the same knowledge and that knowledge like influences your split-second decisions\n\n54:47.940 --> 54:53.060\nWhether you actually really wanted to or not so people who explicitly really don't want to be\n\n54:53.420 --> 54:56.020\nRacists and fucks who wouldn't who had never heard\n\n54:58.020 --> 55:00.020\nFor a second in a split-second decision\n\n55:00.380 --> 55:08.100\nWe'll do it because they're because of their circumstances, which is why the solution to\n\n55:08.700 --> 55:10.700\nracism would be\n\n55:10.700 --> 55:14.620\nincreasing exposure to an environment in which those\n\n55:16.500 --> 55:24.020\nNeurological pathways were no longer formed. Yeah, in other words, just people getting bored with the idea that we come in different colors\n\n55:25.100 --> 55:32.860\nYeah, so I think ultimately the idea is to make people not discriminate based on race in terms of their\n\n55:32.860 --> 55:40.220\nNeurological responses and their split-second decisions, but right now noticing race is important because there's a lot of\n\n55:41.780 --> 55:45.380\nSocio-economical status shit that goes on based on race\n\n55:45.380 --> 55:51.220\nSo if you deny someone their race you're kind of denying a whole history of shit that they went through\n\n55:51.580 --> 55:53.580\nThat's a really interesting thing\n\n55:53.580 --> 56:00.500\nYeah, big a drink the modern idea that that\n\n56:01.540 --> 56:03.540\ninvisibility of race is\n\n56:03.780 --> 56:08.260\nThe definition of non-racism has this weird cloaked like\n\n56:08.860 --> 56:13.780\nAggression to it where it which comes from big brother, which is like\n\n56:13.780 --> 56:17.620\nOh who wants more than George W. Bush?\n\n56:17.620 --> 56:24.700\nFor instance or the Pentagon for all of us to not see anything other than another human being when we look at it\n\n56:24.700 --> 56:27.200\nBut wait, okay. This is a serious thing\n\n56:28.100 --> 56:29.780\nfinally\n\n56:29.780 --> 56:37.860\nmy daughter when she was you know in preschool and kindergarten she had a friend who was black she was and\n\n56:37.860 --> 56:46.700\nAnd my that's not a bad thing. No, it's a good. Well, we'll get to that. Just hold on buckle up\n\n56:48.660 --> 56:53.180\nWell, I'm gonna turn her around. I'm gonna make her the biggest races here. No\n\n56:54.020 --> 57:00.060\nBut she was asked to describe her friend who she was talking about and she described her\n\n57:00.060 --> 57:06.540\nShe's only very long beautiful hair and and and brown eyes and she didn't mention her skin or anything. She didn't see\n\n57:06.540 --> 57:08.420\nthe\n\n57:08.420 --> 57:09.900\ndefining\n\n57:09.900 --> 57:15.740\ncharacteristics of race in that when do we when do we first start seeing that actually it happens around\n\n57:16.740 --> 57:22.700\nThree and four years old, but it gets stronger the older we get so because I think we're conditioned\n\n57:22.700 --> 57:30.380\nIt's because of exposure. So you are exposed to cultural attitudes and associations through TV and\n\n57:30.380 --> 57:37.660\nAnd media and all kinds of in your parents mostly your parents, right? It's people coming out and saying that person's black\n\n57:37.660 --> 57:43.580\nAnd also also you're like you notice novelty and things in your environment that are different and you get rewarded for\n\n57:43.660 --> 57:46.780\nIf somebody were to come up to me after the show and they were to say\n\n57:48.340 --> 57:52.660\nHey, my name is Glenn Glenn Johnson. I saw you at the\n\n57:53.300 --> 57:54.940\nsuch-and-such show\n\n57:54.940 --> 57:58.980\nRemember me with the pink hat and if I were to go pink hat\n\n57:58.980 --> 58:04.060\nUm you and you're all you guys with the pink hats and you guys were there at the bachelor party\n\n58:04.380 --> 58:09.260\nYou the dopamine spikes you get rewarded as a primate for noticing patterns\n\n58:09.260 --> 58:18.020\nYeah, absolutely you you excel as a primate because you remember things you remember patterns and connections our brains formed\n\n58:18.460 --> 58:20.460\nto notice to to\n\n58:20.980 --> 58:22.980\nsystematically process things and regulate and\n\n58:22.980 --> 58:29.340\nCondense all this shit that we process and the simplest way to do that is to put a label on someone like the definition of\n\n58:29.500 --> 58:36.060\nCharming is James Bond walking into a casino and smelling someone's perfume and saying oh, that's that kind of perfume\n\n58:36.060 --> 58:41.500\nAnd the woman says oh my god, you're so amazing. You're so much more amazing than other men\n\n58:44.300 --> 58:46.300\nThe audience isn't a plaza\n\n58:46.300 --> 58:52.620\nIt's better got a beer everyone spends we got a beer. I'm sorry describe the derailed the good work\n\n58:53.140 --> 58:55.140\nJust let's talk about racism\n\n58:59.620 --> 59:03.100\nConnections like people remembering what color your eyes are\n\n59:03.900 --> 59:09.460\nWhen's our anniversary all these things like like seemingly superficial connections\n\n59:10.340 --> 59:13.420\nThey become when they're politicized there\n\n59:13.420 --> 59:17.700\nThey're when they're attached to an inherently classic society\n\n59:18.260 --> 59:24.700\nThat's when they become problematic in all other areas. We reward them. We go. Oh that guy's so awesome\n\n59:24.700 --> 59:26.700\nHe remembered my birthday\n\n59:27.780 --> 59:29.300\ntrue\n\n59:29.300 --> 59:30.980\nbut I\n\n59:30.980 --> 59:33.380\nThought you'd back me up more on this than that\n\n59:33.980 --> 59:35.980\nNo, she's a contrarian\n\n59:35.980 --> 59:43.700\nWell, I feel like you know like we get rewarded for processing things in that manner, but that can get us into\n\n59:44.500 --> 59:51.620\nTrouble right like if you're a police officer and you make a split-second decision to shoot an unarmed black man because you have these\n\n59:52.100 --> 59:54.100\nassociations\n\n59:54.100 --> 59:56.100\nThat's not fucking okay\n\n59:56.100 --> 01:00:06.180\nOh, you killed your mind. No, we're being censored, but you're right. You're right. No, I any other circumstance\n\n01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.860\nWe are rewarded. Yeah, I certainly wasn't saying oh god racism is great\n\n01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:16.700\nAll right, what I'm saying is what I'm saying is that re like racism is a thing that we fucking struggle with\n\n01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:23.740\nNecessarily because we wake up in the morning ago. I'm gonna go hate a bunch of people today. It's often because\n\n01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.420\nWe're\n\n01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.780\nWhat's going on? No, nothing's going on. We're just having a great discussion\n\n01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.260\nHow many beers have you had just let's race\n\n01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.300\nNo, I've had these three or five five. I don't know I\n\n01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.020\nCan't get anything done with this guy\n\n01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:49.540\nYou're damn right what you're saying is right. I mean that's how we developed evolved as humans\n\n01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:54.460\nIt's how we not got eaten, but it's also how he decided racism was a cool thing\n\n01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:01.420\nAll right, okay, I'm sorry listening. I do my thing. I've read the reviews of my podcast\n\n01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:05.380\nI know that I talk about people love your podcast damn shut up Spencer\n\n01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:16.500\nShe's a neurologist that's studying racism, I thought it would be interesting it was it is interesting still\n\n01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:23.580\nIs I would like to talk to her for six hours.
