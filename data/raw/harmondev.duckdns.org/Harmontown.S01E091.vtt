00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Feral Audio

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Oh, yeah.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Hello.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
Welcome to Meltdown Comics. The NerdMelt Theater and the epicenter of Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
Buckle up, motherfuckers. Welcome to the stage. The mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:44.000 --> 00:54.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, fuck you, mama, fuck your daddy in the mouth.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
I fucked your daddy from the north to the south. Predictable rhymes, I don't care, I'm still rapping.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Rapping like I was a butt, that's crappin'. Crappin' in the toilet that is your ears.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
Dominatin' your desires and fears. Freestyle rappin' like I've never done before.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Fuck your mama on the ceiling, fuck your mama on the floor. I'm rappin'. Freestyle rappin'.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Sounds like it's written, but I'm freestyle rappin'. Didn't think about it in the green room at all.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Now I'm gonna fuck your mama in the summer and fall. Fuck your mama, fuck your daddy on the street.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Fuck your mama in her mouth, fuck your daddy on his feet.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
Come on his toes, put on his shoes, take him downtown and show him the blues.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Teach him how to roll with the blacks. Teach him how to feel his slacks.

01:35.000 --> 01:45.000
Take him choppin', take him choppin'. Lumberjacks. Yo, yo, yo, what? Yo, yo, rapping.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Fuckin' intense. I don't know if you've ever spit fire before, but it comes through you.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
The term spit implies that it starts inside you. It's not true. It comes through the back of your head.

02:06.000 --> 02:16.000
It goes back to mythology. There's a, the band-aid on the back of Marcellus Wallace's neck in Pulp Fiction.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
And in the Coen Brothers movie, that's an old, something Jewish about the thing on the back of the neck.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Now, do you feel that was a one-time thing for tonight, or do you feel that that's gonna stay true throughout the entire show tonight?

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm on fire tonight. God is above me, right above me. High noon.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
Like, it's a harmonic convergence. I felt it when I was walking through. They were playing some, what do you call that, R&B, hip-hop?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yes.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
Hip-hop. I just felt like, let's give them, let's not talk about it. It was phenomenal.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
What you don't want to do is look at it and try to capture that same lightning bug in the same jar.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
No, no.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
My biggest challenge, Jeff, my biggest challenge when I'm freestyle rapping is when I hear, like you do, it's too good.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
It sounds written. And you heard me address it in the thing. I was panicking.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
I was like, oh shit, they're gonna think this is written. I'm not Eminem.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Dan, right it.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Dan, was that?

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't have it. I'm like him, except fuck your hand. Fuck your marker on your hands.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Was that your guilty conscience saying, this sounds written because I did prepare something?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
No!

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
It was my...

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm Shakespeare, right?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Sounds written because it's fucking God is writing it.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
And so I'm like, guys, I'm sorry. It's like how a magician stops halfway through and he goes, I'm sorry, I have to remind you again.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Nothing up my sleeve.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Because this rabbit's actually just flying out of hats.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
Now, I mean, what I'm not gonna do, Dan, and I'm saying I'm not going to do this because I don't want to ruin the experiment.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
I could play that same beat again and I think you're in such a zone that you could even go further than that.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm not going to. We're gonna save it for later at any point though.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
I feel like you need to be in that free fall state.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I'll tell you what, tonight, little favor to you.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Okay.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Catch me off guard.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Alright.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Sneak up on me. Be like Kato and Pink Panther.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Am I mixing my references?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
You're close enough.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Alright.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
The guy that Clusso pays to keep him on his toes.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah, attack me.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Come up behind me.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Try and catch me. You can't.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Because you opened up with it with a real normal pitfall of saying in the mouth.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
And then it has to be.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Exactly.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Because it's just like rum, rum, rum in the parking lot.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Okay.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
We're not, we're porn... we're pornifying it.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Pornographizing?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Pornographizing it.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Alright, we got a lot of stuff to do.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Here's my new segment.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
It's called Controversial Thoughts.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Woo!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Woo!

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Woo!

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
No!

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
No!

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
No!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
No!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
No!

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
No!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
No.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Okay.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I know.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
That was not the time for it.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
But I like that you're on your toes.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Alright.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Because you're fucking nimble as a mountain goat tonight.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
What's going on?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
You know how cockroaches?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
You probably don't know this.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I provide knowledge.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I drop it.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I drop science.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I spit fire.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
I provide knowledge.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Have you ever spit knowledge?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Times on accident.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
The cockroach has a photoreceptor in its legs.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It's running before it knows why.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
When you turn on the lights, the cockroaches start running.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Its brain doesn't even, hasn't even, has yet to say,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
oh shit, I'm a cockroach.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Its legs are going, you have to run.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
There's light.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
We're a cockroach.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
When I hear that beat, Jeff, I start moving and rapping.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
Because the street part of me has its own tiny, urban brain.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm not saying urban people have a tiny brain.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Or that they're cockroaches.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh boy.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Oh boy.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
Well, like cockroaches, we, the urban people, will never die.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
I speak on behalf of us.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
What is it about you that makes you so urban, dad?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Because I'm from the streets.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
That's the only thing that you need.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
I'm 52nd in Calumet, bitch.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Milwaukee.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Look it up.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
526, I think that was my area code.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Look it up.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
You'll see.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
There's a street there.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Controversial, controversial thoughts.

06:33.000 --> 06:42.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Clearly you weren't ready for that one.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
No, I was, you know, alright.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Here's the thing.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I saw monuments, men.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
And I didn't, I don't know anything about this aspect of history.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
But it seemed to me like Hitler was really into art.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
Just like America and Europe and everybody.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
It seemed like poor people just kill each other in wars

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
and rich people just care about paintings.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
So I wasn't that moved by George Clooney's story about fat old men

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
going into war to protect paintings from Hitler

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
who was intent on building a giant Hitler museum

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
to store all the paintings.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Ugh.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, oh, yeah, controversial thoughts.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Okay.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I mean, Aaron and I got in a fight about it.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
She's an artist.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
She's a visual artist.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Wait, no, what was the fight about?

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
What side were you on and what side was she on?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Well, because I was, because I don't know anything.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Who was on Hitler's side?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Me.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Kind of.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Oh, no, no, that's not true.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
That's not true at all.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
She kept accusing me of being a Hitler side.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
The irony was, I'm not on Hitler's side.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I'm not on artist's side.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I'm not on art's side because I kept going like,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
seems like art's kind of a, you know,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
we keep talking about art, how important it is.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Everyone agrees art and support is important.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
There's a scene in the movie where they find,

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
they're looking for all this art.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
We gotta protect the art.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
And then they find a bunch of gold.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
And then like, Eisenhower comes down,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
he's taking his picture with all the gold

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
and like two of the characters go,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
you know, they give a fuck about gold,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
but they don't give a fuck about art.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
It's like, what's the fucking difference?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
There's just less art.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
It's like, the gold is like stacks of shit

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
that everyone agreed was valuable.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
That's all art is.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
And I was just like saying,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Aaron was, Aaron bursted the tears part of it,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
not because she thought the movie was good,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
but because she actually,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
because she thought the movie was profaning

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
something that she cared a lot about.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
She was explaining, by the way, we're both drunk.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
She's explaining the way home.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Like, oh, I just, you know, it's like,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Hitler, like he wanted to, he wanted to destroy

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
all the art that he didn't think was good.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And that was terrible.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
There's a scene where they blow-tarch a bunch of art.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And I was like, well, that was Scorched Earth, though.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
They were, Hitler did a Nero doctrine where he said,

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
if I fall or if Germany falls, start destroying everything.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
So then the art was in trouble.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
So I was just like driving home with Aaron and going,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
like, I feel like all the rich people in the movie

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
all agree that art is valuable

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
and all the poor people were just off camera

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
getting shot and blown up.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And all of them were like, fuck art.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Like, there's a bullet in my brain.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And that's the side I was on.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
But she twisted that into me being pro-Hitler.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Because I was like, he wanted to make a museum.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
He didn't want to make a museum.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
He wanted to make a very big Hitler museum.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
That is not debatable.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
He declared lots of art degenerate art.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
But also, there was just also, it was open season,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
if like Himmler or whoever.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
So I'm really into such and such an artist.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
That was for you.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Like, whether or not that was degenerate or not.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
It was just basically, let's just go pilfer and loot

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
all of Europe.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
They stole all the art.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
But they weren't going to open a museum.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
They weren't earning it.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
They were all going to go keep it and hoard it

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
because you could equate that to gold.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Worth money.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Worth gold.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
And that's different from the Vatican Howe.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Wow, you made a leap there, man.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
That's different from the Louvre Howe.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I mean, why are we all hoard art?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
We hang it on the wall.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
We look at it.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
It's fucking great.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
It's so valuable.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
We all agree it's valuable.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Wow, look at this precious thing.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
It was one of a kind.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Gold is valuable because it's a rare element.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Aluminum is less valuable.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I would say gold is more arbitrary.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
A value of worth just because it doesn't decay

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
or oxidize or whatever.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Art you could at least agree on that it has beauty,

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
has like intrinsic value to whoever.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
But I don't think that's what they were doing.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
There's a bunch of asshole German guys going around there

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
and stealing shit that they wanted to belong to.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I don't think those guys had good taste.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I think the first person that will tell you that

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
is an artist, someone in art school.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
They can't wait to tell you what a mediocre artist Hitler was.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
You know why?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Because otherwise, Hitler's just an artist.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Everyone's going to tell you what a bad artist Hitler was

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
because otherwise you get to go,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
yeah, you artists, you live in boxes

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
and you eat poop for living,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
but give you a little bit of power and oh boy.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
They got to go,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Hitler doesn't count, Hitler doesn't count.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
It's really bad at perspective.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
He was an artist.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I haven't seen the movie, but there are like,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
you see films of like the German museum

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
is like during the Reich and they, you know,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
cleansed Europe or at least Germany of all the degenerate art.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
And so there's all these galleries full of like Germanic,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
just a bunch of like big macho statues

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
and there's no emotion to it.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
It's just really stark and intimidating.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Meanwhile, the Nazis that had taste

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
were scooping up all the Botticelli

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
and all the really good shit,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
and they were all just taking it like,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
like we know that Hitler's not down for this,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
but we want a fucking gigantic basement

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
full of the stuff that we know that will always have value, right?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Yes.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
So, okay, look, I don't,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I probably won't see the movie,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
is there a way to tell me what happens without spoiling

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
or is that the whole story?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Hitler loses all his art.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
He loses all the art.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
And we get it all back.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Do we get it all back?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Or is there a bunch of lost?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Is there a bittersweet code?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
We'll never know what we didn't get back.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
There's points where they're holding up like burnt frames

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
and it says Picasso on the bottom.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It's like we lost a fucking Picasso.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah, but also we lost a bunch of people.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
And also like, you know, like, yeah.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Yeah.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Come on, Colbert and they showed a clip of him and that,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Damon talking about how old they were

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
and they're going to go save art paintings.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
It didn't seem like a good movie.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
It's, yeah, it's not, it's, it's, it's,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
the concept of whether or not a painting

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
is worth more than human life,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I think is a very important one

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
and I think that you need to,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
yeah, I mean, it's just, you need to be cinematic.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Ciscal and Abert wade movies on thumbs

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
and some people wade on stars.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I feel a more accurate way to measure

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
a movie's value is through freestyle rapping.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Okay, look.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It was about to rhyme with Rocket.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I was going to go places.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
All right, new segment, next segment.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Do you want a different beat or do you want to stick with that?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I don't, I'm not in control.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
My new segment is called Ruin It For Me.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Yo, yo, ruin it for me.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I'm happy about something.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
See, you're going to come up and ruin it for me.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Okay, so.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
That was good.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
For real, don't base this at what,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
we can do a segment later called I want to be on stage.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And I will, we will not punish you

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
for wanting to be on stage, but for real,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
like, if you, if you really think

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
you can ruin this for me because you've been thinking

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
about it more than I have, because I heard,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I saw one paragraph on the internet

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and I get excited and then I retweet it

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
and then I feel like my job is done

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
and I live in a better world.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
The gay NFL guy.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
The guy, we have our first openly gay NFL guy.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
That's all I know. That's it.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I know one tweet's worth of information.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
It's very uplifting to me.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I would imagine it's very hard to be

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
an openly gay NFL draft pick

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
or whatever the hell he is.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Sounds like our first gay sports corner.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
No.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Gay sports corner.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Gay sports corner.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I mean, I want to, yes, and you,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
but that's really a derailment.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Because the segment is,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I'm happy about this current event

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
that I know one tweet's worth of information about.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
What I want is for somebody,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
because I, then I go to bed and I go,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
you know, the world's getting better.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Gay rights, it takes a huge leap forward.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Somebody that's in a position

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
to be nothing but punished for it

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
comes out and says,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
hey, I'm gay, which really is more

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
symbolic of the fact that, you know what,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
your neighbor's probably gay.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
There's people who aren't admitting it

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
and it's not weird to be gay

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
and I can throw a football or I can catch it

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
or whatever the hell he does in that dumbass sport.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I'll become open minded about that shit

15:45.000 --> 15:53.000
and I'll die.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Because those guys called me fags

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
for a long time.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
But, so that's it, right?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I go to bed, I sleep like a baby,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
but there's got to be somebody in the room, right,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
who can tell me, because this is how it always works,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
like you mentioned it at a cocktail party

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
and then somebody goes, yeah, but you know that guy's a pedophile.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Or that guy, that guy wasn't going to be,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
he was the number three draft pick

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
because it actually boosted him to number one.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
So is there anybody here that has

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
like mitigating information

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
to dilute this rainbow of joy?

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
He has a room full of Hitler's art.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I'll say this, Dan.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
A guy, believe me,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't know much about it either,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
but there's a guy who's going into the draft, right?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Is a college player going into the NFL draft

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
and before he got drafted,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
he said, also, I'm a homosexual,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
which might make him less marketable

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
because coaches are weird about

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
putting distractions as they call it

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
in their locker room.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
That could be some guys two in the news

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
or two of this or that,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
and I don't want to fuck up my locker room with this or that.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
On ESPN news, there were people

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
who are coaches, who are pundits,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
who come out and talk about all sorts of issues.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
They all, like, they were like,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
would that be distracting for you?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
You were a coach once, or you were a player once,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
and a lot of people came out

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
and say, because there's certainly no market

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
and say, yeah, I wouldn't want to be in a room with that guy.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
They don't say that.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
What they do is say, well, you know,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I do see the side of the locker room.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
You know, locker rooms, there's lots of different kinds

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
of people in there, different whatever,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
and it can be a distraction.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
You're like, you basically just said

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
that would be a problem for you.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
And also, other people have said,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
so somebody was asked, some player was asked,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
what percentage of NFL players

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
currently do you think are gay?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
So anywhere between 5 and 80%,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
like, is that zero?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Well, that's where this don't ask, don't tell thing.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
We went through this with the military.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I think a gay activist,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
a man would tell, would say,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
that was into this, would go,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
you know what, it's a fucking distraction

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
for the parking meter

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
attendant that I'm gay.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
On some level, like, there's not equality yet.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Like, somehow, even though

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I don't have to tell you where I put my dick

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
when I look for pleasure,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
somehow, it's a straight run society

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
and it's blowing back on me.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And somehow, like,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
because straight people

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
can run around high-fiving each other for being straight,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
you can put up billboards that have innuendo,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
like, hey, come get a bagel,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
it's kind of like fucking a pussy, right?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
And on some level,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
like, starburst commercials,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and it's a straight man's world.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
And so there's, like,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
a certain amount of, like,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
if you come out of the closet

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
and you're in a political position,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
you know, it's a risky proposition.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Like, people, like, Kobe got in trouble

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
for calling somebody faggot.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Like, that's something you just, like,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
certain people just say when they get angry.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I don't know that was necessarily homophobic,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
which is something that certain people just say

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
and people drop n-bombs on each other.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
It doesn't necessarily mean they're saying that.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
But I would imagine that any sports locker room,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
when you have a bunch of people who aren't necessarily,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
like, across the board,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
like, PhDs,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
and they're trained to be really good at one,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
like, athletic endeavor,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
there's gonna be lots of, like, visceral bullshit,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
and

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
they're gonna tease you about anything that you're different at.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Let's say you read a lot.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
But using that as a reason to, like,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
not draft people, then we have a problem,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
because we have systemic, that's the thing.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
And the thing is, because if this guy

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
made it to the college level,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
being into football and

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
being gay...

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
The reason why it's good for him is because he's, like,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I think he's, like, a graduate or some good school

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
or something like that. Like, he's got a shit together

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
and he's, you know, like, he's not just

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
some any old knucklehead. Like, would you actually have to be a representative?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I think it's smart, because what you don't want to do,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
which I think a lot of people, the reason why they can't come out,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
if you're in a soccer locker room

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
or a football or baseball locker room,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
and you've been playing with these people for

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
eight years, and you've been

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
in the shower with them for eight years, and you go,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
oh, by the way, the whole time that we've been doing dick jokes

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
and doing all this, like, grab-assing

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
weird male shit that we all do,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I've always been gay the whole time.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Then you open yourself up to a whole other thing.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
He's saying, before you draft... Right.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
If this ruins my career,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I want everyone to know, before I go in,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm gay. Now, currently,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
my favorite fucking thing in the world is,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
and I forget his name, but I love the Winter Olympics

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
and the cat that's gay that calls

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
the figure skating?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
What's his name? Reed? Weir.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Johnny Weir? Yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Yeah, John Weir. And he,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Vladimir Putin's Russia, who has made it

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
very clear that it's not cool to be gay there,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
although he never has a shirt on,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
and he's constantly

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
straddling some sort of beast.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Johnny Weir comes out dressed

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
like the fucking, like the

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Easter Parade every time,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
and he's just like, hello!

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And he's dressed like Peter Pan,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
and it's good, and he's got, like,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
he has the best makeup on, and he couldn't...

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
There's no way to be gayer than Johnny Weir

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
is right now in Russia. And he's basically

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
saying, come arrest me on fucking camera,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
and that's great, because

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
sport has to be full of gay people.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Like, it has to be full of everything,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
and I love the fact that

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Russia was homophobic, or is.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm like, oh, you know, but so is America.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
So is probably every

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
government, like, across the board in some ways.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
But Russia came out and said,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
don't propagandize

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
about your homosexuality.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
John Weir's

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
just presents in Russia as propaganda, which is

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
awesome.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Don't propaganda is homosexuality, because

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
we're all just

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
a tick away from

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
going homo if we see the right poster.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
They made

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
it really ambiguous, like,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
no gay propaganda. What does that mean exactly?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Yeah, you know, don't be gay and be happy.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
And they go, just keep it

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
around. Don't jump around being gay.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Keep it away from the kids.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
So if I walk by a child,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
they left it pretty fucking loose.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
All right. Well, so

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I'm leaving it at that. I'm not going to stretch this out.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Let's say there's 150 people

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
in this room. I said, ruin it for me. It doesn't sound

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
like this guy sounds like

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
he made getting drafted a little more difficult

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
in the 11th hour

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
by doing this amazing thing.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
He certainly did, because there might be some coaches

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
who say, I don't want that quote-unquote

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
distraction. Because why bother? And you could fall

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
back on, I'm not homophobic, but it's a

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
distraction. So he had that

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
horrible

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
empire of mediocrity working against him.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Worse than having

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
active aggression working against him.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
He had actual just status quo

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
stagnation working against him.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Just gravity. Let's say

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
you're a coach of

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
the Patriots.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I'll make up a team, like the

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
flim flammers. And

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
you have a quarterback that is

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
worth all the money in the league. And

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
you, as a coach, happen to know that this guy

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
is a rampant homosexual. Rampant?

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Well, yeah.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Rampant.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
As soon as the lights go down,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
he's just

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
gay bashing.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Wait, is he

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
rampant homophobic or rampant homosexual?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I'm sorry, I meant homophobic. Oh, rampant homophobic.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Okay, that's why.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Rampant homosexual. I'm sorry, I missed

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
going.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I said rampant, I went and hold a different

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
direction. But listen, like you as a coach

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
know that a certain percentage of your

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
team are homophobic. Right. And they're

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
worth a zillion dollars. Like, do you want to

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
bring out like a linebacker in who

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
causes distress? Capitalism,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
mediocrity,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
path of least resistance, people doing

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
what they do, wanting

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
today to be as easy as yesterday.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Those are the things that heroes rise

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
up against. It's not

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
when it's fashionable, not when

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
you can goad people to throw

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
lettuce at you and somehow

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
garner that into like a murder story,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
which is what I often do in my own little

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
world. You know, like somebody that

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
rises up and goes like, you know what, I

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
could have fucking just hung out forever

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
with this toupee on. But I'm bald,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
motherfucker. I got it.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
My scalp itches. And

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
actually, it wasn't even about selfishness.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Like you said, there's a

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
courtesy to that to go like, you know

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
what, so that seven years later when we

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
got our Super Bowl rings, like you, I

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
want you to have gotten it with a gay

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
guy in the locker room. I don't want

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
this to be a story that somehow

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
brings us back down into the gutter

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
about showers and all this shit.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Anyways, that's enough of that.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
But my point wasn't so much

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
about, you know, we're in L.A., we can

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
love gay people all we want. But my point

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
was more like in this age, like you

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
hear these heroic things and like, you

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
know, there's a spin on them. And then so often

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
like you read one more paragraph down

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
and you click on one comment in the comment

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
section, it just starts to fall apart

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
because of relativity and all this stuff. But it

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
sounds like a pure hero story.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Are you hoping that somebody did mitigate

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
that? No, I'm glad nobody did.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
No, no wrong answers.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
If somebody came up and ruined it, that's

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
good too. Like, that's

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
interesting as well. That would show

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
us that there's no such thing as

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
fucking heroes. Like, would Julian Assange

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
like get

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
tangled up in some weird sexual stuff

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
or Martin Luther King, like

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
the first thing they go after is his

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
crotch, you know, because he's causing

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
trouble. Like, maybe what we need

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
to learn is that we're not supposed to be

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
looking for these non-human people.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Just so happens that this guy sounds

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
like inhumanly awesome. Alright,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
enough of that. Whatever his name is, and he plays

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
a dumb sport, so he's a fucking idiot.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
And

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
that is a prejudice I will go to

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
my grave with. And that segment

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
is called Burying the Lead.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
That's why

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I was especially inspired by it because it

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
means that people can do heroic things even

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
if they're so not bright that they play

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
football for their whole lives.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I think that's inspiring that lizard people

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
can also be

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
heroic.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
I'm making, I'm kidding.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I'm sure there's great football players out there.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Come on the show, we'll talk to you.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
We'll have a special microphone that picks up

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
on whatever wavelengths you speak in.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
It won't block

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
the pathway through your mouth so you can breathe.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I'm kidding.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
How good do you think you would be,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
the world's greatest interviewer,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
how good do you think you would be with a

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
famous, highly educated, black, gay,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
NFL draftee?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I don't know.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
That sounds kind of awesome. Is this guy

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
black by the way? Yes. Oh fuck, he's

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
awesome.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I just automatically pictured

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
this honky

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
part fed

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Woody Harrelson guy.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Why is it better than he's black?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Because black people are even more awesome than gay people.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I don't know, that's amazing.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Because he's got even less reason

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
as a black man to come out of the closet.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
That's fucking, are you kidding me?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
There's a horribly entrenched

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
homophobic culture

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
that's accepted because

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
we don't have to explain this.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
The show will be two hours long.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
It will be, but we're going to talk about other stuff.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
No, I says, what?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
My white guilt and my

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
straight guilt make this guy being gay and black

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
fucking amazing. I'm almost willing to forgive him

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
for playing football.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I would

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
love to talk

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
to him about, I mean, how do you...

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
So now that he's black, you want him on the show?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
He's not a lizard man anymore?

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
No, I would have wanted to talk to him no matter

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
what his race was.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And that's on the record.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
No, but come on.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Fuck you. I'm not apologetic about my glee

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
about wanting people

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
who have reasons to be afraid

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
being not afraid.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I think that's

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
fucking amazing.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Anyways, let's

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
speaking of being afraid and being activated

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
and all kinds of stuff, I want to move forward.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
We got

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
a guest tonight

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
that I mentioned last week because I felt like

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
last week I complained about Uber.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I complained about

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I don't know how hard it is for me to scratch my ass

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
and jerk off into a laptop.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
The theme last week was

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
kind of like

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
was sort of like

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
it was first world problems

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
to be sure. And I'm not ashamed

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
of that. I'm in the first world. I have problems.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I'm not going to...

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
But I also kind of came to this epiphany

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
during that as I have often like, yeah, but

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I'm 41.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I don't give a shit. I got to start figuring out

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
the world. But I don't believe in politics.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I don't buy into the liberal versus conservative shit.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I think that

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
the fucking government is an asshole

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
and people who aren't systems aren't assholes.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
And so the thing that really appeals to me at a blush

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
that I know nothing about

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
is this concept of net neutrality.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
And I happen to know through Aaron

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
this net neutrality activist.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
And his name is Eddie Geller and he's here.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Thank you.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Sit anywhere you like.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Thank you. Thank you so much.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
It's my favorite part of the show. I get to sit down.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Perfect.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Alright, so I purposely didn't research

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
because that's my passion is for doing nothing.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I know for sure

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
that the words net neutrality

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
mean that the internet

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
is a perfect place where everybody can do

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
whatever the hell they want.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
And that must mean that there's some FCC

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
types coming and got in for us that are trying

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
to make sure that there's some kind of law

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
going down the road that's going to protect

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
the interests of corporations and things

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
and ultimately marginalize the poor. Do you take it from there?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Yes. You pretty much nailed it.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
So net neutrality is essentially

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
the default way that we think about the internet

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
that you're free to go anywhere

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
and go to any sites

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
and anyone who starts a website

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
can get to you. It's this free flow of information.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
And so the reason

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
net neutrality has been in the news

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
is because the government agency

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
that oversees this, the FCC

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
had these net neutrality rules

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
that they made in 2010. They said

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
alright, if you are a Comcastier or Time Warner

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
you can't fuck with people's internet.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
You have to let them go where they want.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
And those rules just got tossed out

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
in the DC circuit court.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
So now it's like

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
when the internet first started

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
we kind of had some net neutrality rules

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
and then those got

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
deregulated and we were in this

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Wild West for a little bit and then these

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
new net neutrality rules

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
and I apologize that this is a little

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
goes a little in the weeds, but these

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
newer net neutrality rules which were kind of a half

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
measure got thrown out. So we're back in the Wild West.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
So right now it's an open table?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Yeah, it's essentially

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
anything could happen, but these

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
In Deadwood you've got your Hearst

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
moving into town. He's

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
there, he's got his resources

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
but they've also got your

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
swear engines and your other people

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
like whoever shoots who first.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Exactly. Well and the other

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
thing that happened this week is

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Comcast is attempting to buy Time Warner Cable.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
So Comcast is the biggest

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
provider of internet and TV

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
trying to buy the second biggest

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
provider and so

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
we're talking about a giant

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
mega corporation that has

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
enormous control over everyone's communications.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
So everyone, remember

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
when you seem a little younger than me

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
when I was a lad

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
that phrase Time Warner

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
didn't exist. There was a

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
time and there was a Warner Brothers.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Right, right. And now

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Comcast is going to merge with Time Warner.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Yeah, that's what they're going to try and do and so

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
this is and so net neutrality

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
activists such as myself, we see

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
this is a terrible thing.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
We don't need less companies

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
in control of our communications.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
So when we talk about being in control because

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
where now I went I went to

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Europe recently and I was in a hotel

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
room and there was like a way for me to get

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I could get free internet. It was free

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Wi-Fi that seemed to be somehow in

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
the ether almost like a kind of ether

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
internet.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I didn't have to give a credit card number

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
I could get on the internet by putting

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I think I had to put my email address or something like that

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
but it was certainly and I don't know how I

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
found this out but the porn was definitely

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
blocked like it was a it was sort

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
of like a it was sort of like a Disney

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
disneyfied like that of internet

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
that is that

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
the world that was like like when we

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
talk about companies like Comcast

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
and Warner Cable because they offer

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
cable internet is the idea that

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
they're going to offer

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
they think that they see a world

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
where internet is like cable yes and

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
that they're they can offer

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
these sort of packages right and this

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
you know that they that they

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
can make their content go

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
faster and run better

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
for you at home and then other people

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
you know smaller websites or

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
other people making content are going

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
to you know have a second-class internet.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
So you go to the president's website who's telling you

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
hey it's I'm the president I had

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
an Easter egg roll and a car wash and

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I love guns or I hate guns and in either

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
case like fucking pay attention to me and it's like

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
whoosh comes through you at maximum

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
bandwidth and then you go to a GeoCities

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
page where someone's like fuck the president

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
fuck the government they all governments

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
you can't read the first three words

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
it's slowly loading

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
yeah yeah exactly and that actually something

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
like that actually happened in Canada where

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
this telecom had

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
its union was striking against them and

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
so the telecom blocked the

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
the website to the union so it's

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
you know it it's like we see these

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
little things that are that are fucked up and it's

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
not all going to happen tomorrow it's like tomorrow the internet

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
is not going to all be this like dire situation

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
but these are the things they're capable

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
of doing but we might as well be talking about

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
telegraph neutrality

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
or telephone telephonic neutrality

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
which are a lot that you said the

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
FCC is involved the FCC

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
shouldn't even fucking exist anymore

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
because the insane thing is that the

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
reason they existed this is me going back

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
to my freshman year communications

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
class but what I understand

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
about the FCC is that

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
the reason they exist is because

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
there was this thing called radio

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
and we just invented it

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and we thought that it was like a big

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
pie and each

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
slice was a frequency and you could

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
well we need the government's help

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
so that everyone can have radio

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
everyone gets a slice and we got to make

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
sure that nobody gets too big

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
a slice or that there's not enough slices

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
blah blah blah cut to

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
these people telling you that the

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Janet Jackson's titty is offensive

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
during the Super Bowl it makes no sense

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
it has nothing to do with anything because far

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
since the FCC was established we found

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
out that there's no such thing as limitations

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
on frequency

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
it doesn't matter

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
but the thing about government is

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
that God bless them they're only trying

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
to help probably usually but they

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
never fucking go away

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
once they're around they never go away

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and I'm not being a libertarian by saying that

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I'm just being a human being that's saying

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
once you invite these guys into your life

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
and they start telling you

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
like no one's ever

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
going to have a meeting where they go so that's it

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
FCC's finished huh

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
all in favor no more

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
FCC

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
it never happens so they're still around

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
and it doesn't like why are they still around

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
well no and I think like stuff like

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
the you know the Janet Jackson

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
nipple thing is is ridiculous but

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
there is also a school of thought which I

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
you know subscribed to which is like

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
in an ideal world we want

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
someone like the FCC

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
to say that these

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Comcast of the World cannot work

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
but you made it sound like they were protecting us in an ironic twist

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
yeah well I mean

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
on the internet so it's like you know the FCC

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
has sort of a wide

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
purview of things they do and so

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
the hope would be that on the grounds of the internet

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
that they would tell these

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
you know these huge corporations that you cannot

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
fuck with people's access right

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
and that I mean and that's a totally different story

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
than you know Janet Jackson's nipple

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
you know this is you know clearly two different

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
things but I totally get your point

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
right right alright so let's

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
set up the chess board right now and hopefully

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
you can explain it to me like where the pawns are

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
where the kings are etc we've got all of us

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
who don't give a shit about anything

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
who would never impinge on anyone's right to do anything

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
everyone listening to me

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
everyone in this room every human being

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
that was born with a beating heart we've got

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
all those people now

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
now we've got those people all like

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
done deal no one's ever gonna fucking

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
vote for anything or

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
do anything unless they're operating on some kind of weird

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
agenda now so

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
now let's bring in the corporations what

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
what what what is their

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
relationship with the government in all of this

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
they well so if

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
if the FCC

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I'll go back to that for a second if the FCC actually

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
wanted to do something wanted to be really

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
good and go back to regulating the internet

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
the way it had been when it first

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
started and really like put the hammer down

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
then what would happen is these

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
corporations who have enormous lobbying

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
power would actually tell

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
congress to be like cut the funding

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
for the FCC not necessarily destroy it

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
but you know

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
deplete it severely so I mean

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
there's so much power and they have

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
so much influence lobbying not only congress people

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
but going to the FCC and lobbying

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
the people who work over there so I mean

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
it's a gigantic

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I mean there's no two ways now my brain's a

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
because I'm really realizing the extent to which I

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
started babbling about the FCC and how it should go

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
fucking something you're like the biggest

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
fan because it's like the government is

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
like like the only recourse of us being

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
like a European nation where it's like they're

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I know nothing about this what's the

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
danger that they will actually control certain content

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
based on like if Fox

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
controls Comcast or whatever that they

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
want to control certain like political

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
content or well they'll be

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I mean we'll go ahead oh well

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
that well the fears that

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Comcast would you know

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
prioritize their own content

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
and block and slow down content that's not

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
there were you talking about that or the FCC

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I mean I was going to like an Orwellian

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
kind of like well I'm

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I'm all in for Orwellian

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
physically geographically let's

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
look at it like a map of the city and let's pretend

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
that the internet is traffic

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
yeah like it's the streets it's the

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
infrastructure okay so I think that's why you're

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
saying the FCC needs to be involved

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
because the government needs to be involved in which

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
lights turn green at which time right and which

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
whether which streets are widened which are not

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
and if you if you privatize

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
the city streets then

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
the the

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
pinkberry

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
is going to go okay where are you going

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
you're going over to mom

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
pops

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
at rush hour and you know what we got to close

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
that street down anyway it's like you know

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
exactly we're giving

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
privatizing things that everyone uses

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
is never a good idea

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I'll go out on a limb here be

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
in health education so where do we stand right now

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
are we in some sort of crisis right now like

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
is it like is it we in the balance

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
right well yeah we're it's kind of precarious

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
right now so the FCC

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
is you know it is saying actually

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
now that these rules have been thrown out they're

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
considering what they're going to do next they say

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
they still care about net neutrality

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
though the new head of the SEC

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
is a former communications lobbyist

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
which shouldn't surprise anyone that

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
that's pretty much our government works but the hope

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
is that you know I

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
it's we were talking in the back about

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
how you know hopeless this might

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
be and you know that might

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
be true but like it that you know

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
activists you know people I work

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
with you know it's like our only thing it's like

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
well we gotta fucking do something like even if

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
it's a petition and we have to like

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
you know go down to DC and yell at these

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
people you know what we're

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
saying in the green room was

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
like like cuz kumail said like man

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
you guys gotta I mean it's stuff so important

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
and then everyone has such a short attention span

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
you guys got to call it change it from net neutrality

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
to like butt fun or something

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
that's like yeah but like

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
like the real danger the real

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
problem is that like we

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
we're competing with people who work

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
legislatively bureaucratically

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
their joy in life is to

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
hang out push buttons yes no

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
vote on this I believe in this system

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I'm the thing the problem

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
is that the beating heart of humanity the

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
regular person who just wants to

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
hang out and live their life pursue their happiness

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
they don't they

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
you can convince them to get invested in

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
toppling over a statue of a horrible

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
monster you can convince them

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
to like like sign a petition

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
you can convince them to

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
to stand on the on their

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
desk to say captain my captain

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
they we love those moments because we're

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
dramatic people and we love stories what we

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
don't love is long hard fucking slogs

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
against the forces of night because

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
that's called working at a DMV

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
like we don't we don't want to hang out and fucking

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
oh from three to six I guess I got to

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
get on the internet and click this so that

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
we can keep our internet free

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
there's got to be a way for us to

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
because and also it's like like

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
we're talking about like now they've

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
now they've convinced us that like the

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
the it's a fight between the

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
government and corporations Jesus Christ

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
who the fuck wants either of these guys to win though

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
that fight this this this the internet

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
was kind of ours I mean like this is like

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
we have a chance to keep it

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
take it fucking keep it

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Christian Slater supposed to come along

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
and save us from all that like

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
we got by pumping up the volume

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
are you talking about gleaming the

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
cube I don't know which Christian Slater

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
move I mean I'm saying some he's supposed to come

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
along in some some so what we I mean

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
like like I have no that's the

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
beginning of the degree of who owns

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
the internet the like

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
for a long time the answer has been kind of

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
up in the air and what we

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
don't want is for that to have an answer

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
ever right the way that

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
we kind of didn't want

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
like the days of manifest destiny

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
it was like okay we're

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
we're just gonna we're gonna make a nation and then

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
it was a war between the people who wanted one

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
big old country and the people who wanted each state

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
to be independent and then we we get tricked

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
into thinking that we have to choose between one

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
good guy one bad guy and it's like they're all

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
a bunch of fucking politicians right

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
no and I and I actually I totally

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
agree with your butt fun

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
theory of change don't and I really

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
it's kumail's butt fun

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
I might have been fun but I'm not sure I don't want to

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
defame but I really think

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
that so in Iceland there's a politician

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
called Jan Narn

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
he was a comedian and he started

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
this joke party called the best party

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
and they promised like free towels

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
and that they would listen to women

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
and like

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
and just like

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
like making free towels

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and so crazy

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
it started off as this joke and then

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
became like a real thing and he actually got

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
attention and became the mayor of Iceland

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
and so that's and our because it continued to be

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
entertaining right exactly the way walking

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
dead does the way the way true

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
detective does the way

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
like we've got a nation of people who can

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
agree on one thing for sure you got our

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
devotion if it suits

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
our consumption right

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
devotion without consumption

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
is tyranny

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
think like that like I

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
thank the crowd for being in it for this

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
wonky sort of discussion but that

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
no they like listening they're into it

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
if they're not fuck them

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
but I think I mean like I hate to sound

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
thick about this but I'm not sure what I'm

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
supposed to be afraid of right now the government or the corporations

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
we're gonna figure something out we don't have to

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
figure out today what am I supposed to be

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
where am I supposed to aim my BB gun

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
you should be you should be for net neutrality

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I certainly am but I don't

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I don't know who I'm what building

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I'm supposed to go toilet paper right now

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
well I mean it I think

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
if you know the corporations

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I hate to sound so simplistic would be the

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
bad guys in the situation and if you're

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
an average citizen then you are hopefully

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
telling the FCC telling your representative

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
that you want net neutrality

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
and you know you're trying to counterbalance

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
you're saying the head of the FCC is a former

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
lobbyist he is but I mean

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
you know if they only hear one

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
side you know then we're doubly

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
fucked and so it's like

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
yes the system is totally

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
you know

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
you know going against us but like you know we

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
we go and we yell at them

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
when we can but isn't the internet punk rock

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
enough like when they came after Napster we

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
we all used to a long time ago

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
go get music for free and then that

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
peer-to-peer stuff we all used to get whatever we wanted

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
then that became illegal then gradually we all

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
okay fuck it iTunes 99 cents

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
then Spotify comes along there's a way to monetize

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
that and we pay for that it always seems like

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
the internet finds a way to make it egalitarian

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
and to make it

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
like freebie and sexy

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
and punk rock wouldn't like aren't

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
there enough cool like a revolutionary

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
we're talking about the actual structure of the internet

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
yes I'm saying is there no way

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
to get underneath that and to subvert

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
that or no I mean there are people who talk

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
about that and but

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
it's not something that

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
one should count on or

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
looks like it would be any sort of viable

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
option I mean actually where it sounds like the only

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
heroes right now that you can actually

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
rely on are the hackers are the anonymous

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
people

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
that the people who are simply anarchists are

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
simply in favor of subversion and

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
of course you can't rely on them to

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
to do anything but corrode

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
which is what I want them to do if there were ever

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
another revolution like in the

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
way that we revolted against

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
the English and the way

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
certain countries revolt against empires

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
the next revolution would have

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
to be like an information one

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
would have to be it wouldn't it wouldn't be a country

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
again I mean there's

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
certainly there was there was there was still be countries that revolt

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
against their imperial masters but

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
the next one would have to be us revolting

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
against a

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
a control like

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
that I feel like it's going to be lead pipes

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
in the street because of information

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
well yeah well because like when there are

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
riots and you know people people go

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
protest against the you know the world trade

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
organization whatever the first thing they do is they switch off

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
your cell phones and that you can't text if you do

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
you're you're you go to jail and

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
they will make and I think they're going to do that

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
here and I think that yeah I

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
foresee like the moment they switch off our

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
fucking funds there we will have to revert

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
to lead pipe technology because that's all

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
we have in our fingertips yeah and

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
we won't know how to fucking make a lead pipe

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
because we won't be able to google how to make

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
lead pipes so google

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
it now

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
print it out that's what we're saying

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
like I

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
want I mean I don't want to live in a time

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
where there is revolution because upheavals a bummer

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
and everybody starts 40 year olds yeah

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I don't have the back for it it's a big

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
fucking drag it's nice to live in a

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
country or to live in a world where there has been

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
a revolution in the last

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
century because we're all the beneficiaries

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
of incredible robots

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
the new paintings men and women that

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
stood up and fucking did crazy things

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
we the lights will go out for a while

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
and when they shut the lights out on us

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
now it's the lights out in a whole

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
different way like you and I

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Dan and I don't know how old you

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Eddie I'm 30 yes I mean so like we

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
talked about this before like there was a

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
time when lights went out and it didn't

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
mean that much you you lit a candle and

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
you didn't have a fucking cell phone

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
anyway like now the moment they start

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
fucking with our ability to communicate

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
with each other on the level that we're used to

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
people are going to lose their minds

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
there's to be a weird kind of ludite revolution

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
because for the people that are the biggest

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
fans of the technology it's called

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
steampunk bro

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
we have to start talking to each other now

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
we have to create a network of

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Dixie cups and strings

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
to prepare to doomsday

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
prep for the man coming down

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
on us I mean I got to tell you Eddie

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
like I think I think you're one of these

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
people that's like like you have the

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
practical solution and you're the one that

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
actually is practical about it and I feel

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
like just as dumb would be Han

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
solos who's decided that he's going

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
to do nothing and that that's more convenient

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
because I feel I feel

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
bad for a genuine

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
hard-working erstwhile

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
net neutrality activist who

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
has found themselves in the position of

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
petitioning

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
a fucking corrupt

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
right government official

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
in hopes that they'll

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
protect them more than you'll play

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
yeah I know and no

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
thank you for that there's got to be a

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
there's got to be a way around this

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
there's got to be a way we can just flip this whole

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
cop car over because

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
we have net neutrality right now and we should

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
use it in a sign of fucking

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
you Eddie who your site

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
set on right now if there's a car you I mean

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
like a metaphorical car you could flip

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
over without flipping over an actual car like

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
what is it that's a good question

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I haven't thought about it in those

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
terms

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
I guess I'd blow up the puppies first

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
net neutrality over

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
tell me what to point my confusion

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
or anger or rage at

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
you know I

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
this like and this goes a little

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
outside the bounds but I mean we

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
you know we have such a fucked up

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
system of campaign financing

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
that all that you know

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I think everyone who hears this

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
and is in this room like knows that you know

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
elections are run on money

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and I think until I thank you very much

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
and you know I

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
like until we like a top hat

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
that's not the only guy that agrees

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
you do that's just the only guy that thinks

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
that was a great time to clap

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
not that that was a wrong time

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
so I'm gonna clap him clap

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
thank you

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
so I

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
you know in the larger scale like and

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
that's actually the last the last place I

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
worked was working on sort of money

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
politics I mean I think

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
that is so unsexy but I think

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
it's at the core you know it's this

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
sort of like first issue until we find

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
a way to do you know

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
for instance a small dollar

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
funded campaigns or anything like that

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
and that's not flipping the car over

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
you know it's totally not fun but that is

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
no I mean that is that is like

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
the biggest god damn change that

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
has to happen and I know

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
dipping your pinky toe into that water all of a

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
sudden you're tainted with your

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
first things first buddy when you come through here

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
are you liberal you conservative you liberal

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
conservative I am

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
against fucking capitalism

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
being involved in civil service

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I am like I don't think

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
that there's we know

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
we yell at Olympians

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
when they take

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
money from Wheaties like we

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
we want them to be non-professional

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
like we police when we want

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
to we figure out ways to keep money out

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
of stuff when it behooves us

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
we have a we have a whole

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
bunch of people who are willing to

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
jump into the now neutral

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
internet in search of finding ways

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
to keep money from flowing around

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
it's there's a lot of easy ways

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
to keep money from flowing around when it comes

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
to the fucking

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
old white dudes that we elect

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
to say yes or no to

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
all this bullshit that is supposed to be

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
at the end of the day should be the easiest thing in the world

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
it's like what do my constituents want

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
what are the how does this affect people in Connecticut

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
oh it affects apples so people

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
love apples in Connecticut okay done

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
instead of the that guy having somehow

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
been been some compromised

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
that's insane it's insane that that's

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
the presidency is involved in that it's insane

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
that we only have two candidates

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
from two parties it's insane that there's two parties

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
it's insane that we think that that's what government

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
is it's insane that we're taught that in high schools

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
it's it's all from money

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
it's all a bunch of goddamn

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
fucking bullshit

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I would say Eddie Stan

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
let's bring Camille out here in case he has something to say with Eddie

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Camille, not Johnny

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Hello Camille

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Hello Eddie

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Good to see you again

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Jeff

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I wrote on a website that if you say people's names

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
to them they trust you more

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Jeff

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Thanks Camille

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
I like you more

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
but if you push it you become a creepy guy

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I know people who do that

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Camille

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and here's the thing about that Camille

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
if you do it more

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
than three times in a minute

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Camille the thing is

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
it starts to take on this

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
I called American Airlines for a problem

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
and they said my name way too many times

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
and I was like please stop saying my name

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
and then they tweeted an apology

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
with my name

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
you know I can't dig with the fucking

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
when you're on with AT&T or American Airlines

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
or fucking whatever

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
I said AT&T

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
I just want to make sure that my

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
I just got my new internet service

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I can actually help you with it

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
actually what was going to happen

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
they keep saying actually

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
even they're surprised they can do something

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
whoa this is the first time this has happened

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
well I can actually help you with that

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
fucking la di da

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
I can actually do something about this

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
I can actually make a check out for you

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
you fucking speed it up

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
I can literally assist you right now

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
that's your job

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
it is weird because you're like

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
it's this huge like amorphous corporation

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
and you're talking to like one head of it right then

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
and they literally have almost

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
no power

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
when anyone calls me up I just changed over

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I finally I found out by the way

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
the surprise

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
no one who listened to the show

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I didn't realize that I've had DSL forever

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
like dick fucking lips

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
we all knew

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
well now that you say his name like that

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
now I see it

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
I said the way he said it it sounded like a disease

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I did not assume that I had state-of-the-art internet access

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
but I got a disease

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I didn't know it I've had DSL this whole time

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
oh yeah he did

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I should have known it because my pinky always twitches

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I am talking about second dick

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
yeah

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
it has nothing to do with sucking dick

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
it's just about the quality

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
like the fullness of the lips

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
DSL

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
yeah

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
go ahead

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
people respect your lips

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
they want them on their dick

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
it doesn't mean that you

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
that means when you see my lips

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
you wish they were on your dick

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
those are beautiful full lips

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
they're full lips and in an abstract way

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
it would be great

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
if they were around my dick

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
in an abstract theoretical way

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
wow

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Jeff

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
so I'm on the phone

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
whenever

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
the telemarketers ever call me up

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I use their name back at them

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
and it fucking bums them out

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
they don't like it

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
hello this is Leslie from 18A

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
hello Leslie how are you doing today

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I go Leslie what's going on

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I just wanted to go

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
come on Leslie

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
they don't fucking dig it

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
so fucking yeah

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
you can reverse the fucking

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I feel so bad for them

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
now you're just staring at my lips like a weirdo

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
it's not so weird

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
isn't there a way

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
you can't suck your dick with lips

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
isn't there a way

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
even though it doesn't

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
are you just getting horrible toothy blowjobs all the time

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
no a blowjob is more than lips

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
no I know

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
but that's what it starts

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
you know you

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
you've got dick suckin eyes

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
thank you

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
chamele

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
um

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
isn't there a way

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
to keep the internet exactly the way it is

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
even though it doesn't profit

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
anybody and there's no one that needs to be

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
shot or arrested

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
isn't it already fucked up because every time I shut my computer off

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
for some reason like whatever my home page

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
would be

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
once in a while

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
every fucking couple weeks it completely fucks

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
my settings all of a sudden

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I know everything about Miley Cyrus

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
or a certain network

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
NBC is like

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
it's such bullshit

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
what they'll do is if you're installing a program

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
by like Microsoft or something

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
even though it has nothing to do with your browser

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
they'll change the default

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
homepage on your website

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
which is such shit I don't know how they're allowed to do that

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
that pisses me off so much

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
and also I think

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
it feels it's sad but it feels like

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
inevitable that we

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
net neutrality

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
it's gonna go away and then we're not even

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
gonna remember it and there's gonna be different tiered

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
service and I was talking you guys

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
mentioned this I really think

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
it needs a sexier name the neutrality

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
that word inspires

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
no passion it should be like net freedom

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
or that's what

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Howard Kramer was saying

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
net freedom won't be a great name

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
net equality or net brave heart

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
net brave heart

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
a name we can get behind

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
six internets in a movie

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
like a slogan we can get

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
when I was a kid and the internet was just starting

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
we called it the world wide web back then

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
there was a thing called electronic freedom

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
but I think that sounded too cyberpunk

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
for they just sound too nerdy

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
neutrality I don't I mean it's obviously

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
something to hold on to

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
but it just doesn't I think people see that word

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
they don't get excited about it

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
no I don't disagree and there have been

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
numerous discussions by people much smarter

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
more powerful than I am who want to change

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
it and it's like they just keep defaulting

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
back to it because it's like oh I guess

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
it feels neutral about it

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
right I know it's

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
it's not very important

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
issue right I feel like

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
not that many people are engaged

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
if only Adam Goldberg were here to think

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
of a funny name or a better more punchy

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
name for net neutrality

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
I'm sure I'm shocked

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
that we didn't I wanted to

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
graduate him yeah I haven't heard a peep out

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
of him we're talking about

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
the internet and opinions

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
and he

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
and I haven't heard

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
a sound from the Goldberg section

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
we were talking about like Bigfoot last

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
week well maybe we've

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
achieved we've achieved Goldberg neutrality

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
maybe

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
he brought a date

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
maybe he's here on a date he's trying to impress

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
her or him was he surrounded by dudes

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
maybe he's

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
NFL quarterback Adam Goldberg

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I don't know

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
that guy's not in the NFL or a quarterback

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I know

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
it's my own form of prejudice I don't know anything about

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
sports they're all quarterbacks to me

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
and they're all gay now they're all gay

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
along this

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I really hate when Ellen Page came out

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
she also came out a couple days ago

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
oh yeah yeah Ellen Page came out

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
and so many people on Twitter were like

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
surprise surprise that's not the fucking

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
no it's not it's not the point

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
the openly

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
part of openly gay is the important

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
point if gay

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
was the important point what do you do

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
you might as well congratulate people on being straight

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
the openly gay is the

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
important point because of the culture of

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
it's important and historic

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
that a guy in a notoriously

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
homophobic environment like the NFL comes out

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
and does that before he's even in like going through the draft

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
sure his career his

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
livelihood the things he's worked most of his life

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
toward is jeopardized

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
by him saying that that's awesome

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I don't know what's at stake for an actress

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
I think it's gonna be hard for her to get

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
popular I think it's gonna get harder

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I hope it doesn't

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I hope so too

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I don't know what the actual ramifications

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
well I also don't want to live in a world

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
where she has to sit and think about whether or not

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
she's famous enough or high stakes enough

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
to be

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I don't know what I was gonna say

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
what I wasn't saying is that it merits

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
press conference status now

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
we have to come out

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
and all the fucking floodlights

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
have to be under and go here everybody

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
alright ok

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
ok gay gay gay

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
people like to get into a big crisis for everybody

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
it's insanity

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
I said this on Twitter but I feel like

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
at some point we're gonna live in a world where just saying who you

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
are isn't like a brave political statement

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
you know

58:59.000 --> 59:08.000
We'll get there if people stop wearing hairpieces and stop having implants and stop being ashamed of what they are.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
I felt like an asshole for watching.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
I flipped by her press conference she was talking about.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Not against her or against what she's doing.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Who gives a shit?

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Why is this a fucking story?

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
It's crazy.

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
But it's a story because it needs to be a story so that it's not a story in the future.

59:23.000 --> 59:30.000
I'm just saying, let's fucking grow up as a country or as a world. Let's get past it.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
That's why I love Johnny Ware for fucking dressing up like an absolute...

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
But what also sucks is that he can do it in Russia but nobody else can.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Is there on cameras?

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
It'll be funny the day some thresholds that we cross don't feel like thresholds.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
Like the space program when it's like, okay, we've been exploring space so long.

59:47.000 --> 59:54.000
Remember in Apollo 13, there's that sad scene where they're like, they're not on TV right now.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
They think they're on TV but they're not on TV because you know why?

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Because we're so fucking good at exploring space that as a species we've succeeded at something.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I just hope we get a female...

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
There will come a point where there will be some actor.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Ladies and gentlemen, daytime Emmy winner Kyle Flanagan.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I'm gay.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And you hear one picture.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's like his mom.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I always knew you could do it.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
There it is, the non-shot herd not around the world for gayness.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
We are officially equal with gays.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
It doesn't matter anymore because it's important is my point.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
We shouldn't bully people for being gay.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
We're not really allowed to because if Tom Cruise came out tomorrow,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
it would be a big fucking deal.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And he hasn't yet.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And the fact that he hasn't yet is important.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And since he's not going to yet,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
if eight people underneath him that equal one Tom Cruise underneath him all come out...

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
There's been so much denial for a lot of people through a lot of culture

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
that now the guy that didn't say eight years ago when he went into the first locker room with his NFL teammates,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
now that's weird to do it.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Like at some point when you've just denied it for your whole life, it's heroic.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
People go, look, guess what everybody, I'm coming clean.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
That's fucking awesome.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I just wish that, like we're saying, that wasn't the top story.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
There are also then what 10 years after that, after we achieved that fucking high watermark of like,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
it doesn't matter if you're where you put your wiener,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
there will be a guy who's like, you know what, I don't know where I want to put my wiener.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Put a label on that.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Call it asexual, call it still figuring it out, leave me alone.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Then that guy will be a hero.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
As long as there's a status quo, there's going to be people who are heroic for confronting it

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
until we get to the point where we're all actually just honest with each other,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
until we're not hiding things from each other,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
because only then will we be truly different from the animals that we descended from.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
We are such political mammals.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
We invented it so when we were like these squirrel creatures,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and we are shaking that legacy.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I feel like it's like we're constantly in a battle with ourselves

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
over whether or not we're going to become insectoid or gods.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And I don't know which is worse or which is better.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
What turns us into great people with almond eyes that are floating them through the cosmos,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000
seeking other people's DNA so they can splash themselves with some genetic compari.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I don't know, but I know that right now, it's not a great idea to lobby for borgness.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I get bummed out when people are offended by everything,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
like, let's all be perfect and run, Mary.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
But I also got a high five people who in the face of all of this chaos,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
they rise up against the immediate things that make it difficult for them to...

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
For me, the big problem is whenever I turn the TV on and I'm watching anything,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
there's commercials for me, and now we get to fast-forward to everything.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Commercials are broken up between...

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Mostly for me, insurance commercials are a lot of insurance, lots of insurance commercials.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
But then, more and more, it's like, I'm a truck guy.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Oh, yeah.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
You know, truck guys.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Like, I was like, fucking stop it with a truck.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
If you call yourself a truck guy, go fuck off.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I don't know what that means.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
You turn it into a culture of identifiers.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
There's a genre of commercial right now.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I was just, truck guy.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Okay.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Well, that's what manhood, they're trying to...

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Because it's sort of changing, what being a man is, is changing, the more sort of sensitive,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
less aggressive alpha men are sort of...

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
You know, that's who we're seeing in movies and stuff, too.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And so I think that's like a reaction to that.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Like, remember the good old days?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
You had a truck and you'd fuck it every morning and that was...

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I think that's what it is.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Look at my huge dick.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
It's got so much room in it.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
It's the first one-year-old, as she will say.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
It's the first one-year-old, as she will say.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It's the first one-year-old, as she will say.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
It is.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
It's only...

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I will say that's been going on forever.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
It's 2014 that's been going on since the 70s.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Like, men have that...

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
We do that the same way politicians do it to us.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Politicians convinces that there's a left and a right so that they can fuck around with us forever

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
because there's only rich and poor.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Men say that there's such a thing as feminism and there's such a thing as masculinity

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
so that we can constantly go back and forth between being Alan Alda

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
and then going like,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Fuck it, I fuck it though, it's a guy thing, we've been doing it since the 70s.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
That's as far back as I can go.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I'm assuming we've been doing that since 6000 BC.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I don't think we're ever gonna...

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Like, that's a fucking dodge.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Like, that culture.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Like, we have like these belushies that are like out there going like speaking for us

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
and going like,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Real men don't apologize.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I'll fuck a quiche.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I'm gonna come on Tim Allen's forehead or whatever the...

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And then we sit around and we go like,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Oh, fuck those guys, I wanna...

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I'm metrosexual, I'm gonna...

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
You last on the fuck a quiche?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I last on to coming on Tim Allen's forehead.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Yeah, I'm not sure how that's masculine,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
but I assume that those guys like they, you know,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Oh, come on my forehead, that's all we have left.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I don't know.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I got off on a tear.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I just didn't want to let men off the hook for a second there

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
because it was like the idea that recently there's some kind of like big volcanic

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
eruption of like masculine backlash.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
That backlash has been there since forever.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I think it's a cyclical thing that we're returning to kind of a caveman-y kind of...

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Like, it's okay to have Dennis...

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
What's his name? Dennis Leary?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Leary?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Like be the voiceover.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Hey, look at that.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
The torque's on the truck.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
The torque is what turns...

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Torque, let me break it down for you.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
It's what makes this beer cap come off your bottle.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Like, that's what they're fucking selling a truck to.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Ooh, is that how... is that what torque is?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Like, we're returning to the idea that let's get back to the good old days.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
But just know when you say returning, you imply movement.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
We all agree there's no movement happening, right?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
There's stagnation. That's it.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
No, I think we're moving.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
There's a tube projecting fucking images into our living room.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Sure, but we're changing.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I think what it means to be a man, I think, is different from, you know, ten years ago.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And I think we're sort of a step in the right direction.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
To the extent that it's not regulated by either corporations or the government.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Like, this internet thing happened, and we all kind of like...

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
There's been this burst of actual culture developing.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Like, we're kind of like...

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Sure, yeah.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I would say that, bringing it back around to,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
what the hell are we going to do about this?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Eddie Geller says...

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
What are we going to do about that?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
We should go suck off this guy that works at the FCC.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Oh, thank you.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
What do we do about it?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Oh, that's not me. Sorry.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I got that in my head.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I think it's just like, you know, it's tough, because I...

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
We also have such short attention spans.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Like, I was talking about this, like, remember a week ago,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
we all had strong opinions on Woody Allen,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and now nobody's talking about it anymore.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Right, no, and that's definitely true.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
But it's also cyclical, like, you know, net neutrality was a big thing.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Like, it first popped up in 2006, and then...

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Soap and stuff, right, yeah.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You know, so, you know, it does pop up again when, you know,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
the news finds it, you know, interesting enough to cover.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And I think, you know, just to be having this conversation,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
you know, is worthwhile, and that might sound like not enough, but...

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
For real, though, that's the important thing.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
What do you tell the 15-year-old kid who's listening right now

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
who shouldn't be, by the way?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
But, like, he's listening.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
He's like, you know what, I'm going to dip my toe into this big world,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
and I'm going to start... I'm going to become a rebel.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I'm going to become an activist.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Like, how can you tell this kid, like, like...

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Even what should he Google?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
What should he start reading about?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Gee, sorry.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Well, there's... I'm actually about to start working for an organization

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
called Demand Progress, which was started by Aaron Schwartz,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
the activist who, about a year ago, took his life.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
So that's a great organization that I'll shell for,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
because they are about to hire me.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
What was he an activist for?

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
He was an activist for these same sorts of things from the Internet.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
By the way, it gives me... It makes me feel...

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
It gives me no hope that the guy fighting for this was like,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
fuck it, I'm going to kill myself.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Well, he... It's kind of a complicated story, but he had...

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
That's terrifying.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Well, he was actually...

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So he was charged with stealing these journalistic articles

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
he was downloading from MIT.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
It's like a very... It's a big can of worms,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
but he did not, you know, to the best of my knowledge,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
you know, take his own life because of this fight.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
But yeah, so there are organizations.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Like, if you're someone who's like,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
yeah, fuck it, I'll click this petition, I'll sign it,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
then yeah, you can find an organization like Demand Progress.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Do those really make a difference

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
those petitions that you sign online?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
You know, they imbue these organizations

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
that are working their ass off with a little bit of credibility.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Because if you're going to a congressman,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
you're going to the FCC, and you have, you know,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
100,000 petitions, then you're at least bringing something to the table.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And that does mean something to them?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Yeah, it does. If you have enough of them en masse,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
it's a place to start, even if it's not...

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
You're not going to sign something and, you know,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
give us net neutrality tomorrow,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
but you will be helping the people who are, you know,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
working to make this, you know, make these things better.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
You're saying the least you can do

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
is sign one of these online petitions?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I think if you're listening and you're like,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
what's the least I can do, then yeah.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
You know, when a petition comes across your Facebook page

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and you see it on Twitter, you know,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
take the 30 seconds, fill it out,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
and you know, give these organizations...

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Can we sign 100,000 cars and flip them over?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It's just, you know...

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And I think to be angry.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I think just to have some latent anger

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
for when the, you know, fat butt party comes along,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
and you're like, yeah, these...

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I love these guys. I want to vote for them.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
It was fun butt, by the way.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Sorry, fun butt. Not anti-fat butt, I'm just saying.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Eddie Gallo, everybody. Thank you, Eddie.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Thanks for coming on.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Thanks, Eddie.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Thank you, sir.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Thank you.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Let's bring Spencer up right now.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Spencer Critt...

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
All right, Jeff, you snapped into action.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I don't have that clock over your shoulder anymore.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
9.25.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yeah, I know, I just looked at my phone.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And we started late too.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I got called up on stage.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Yeah, Spencer!

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Remember when that happened?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Spencer, is it true that you're about to be 25 years old?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
At midnight.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
That's very midnight.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Spencer's birthday to you.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Spencer's birthday to us.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It's also Dustin Marshall's birthday actually today.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Come out here, Dustin.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Dustin, get out of here, little devil.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It's actually Dustin Marshall's birthday today.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Our podcast producer, extraordinaire, Dustin.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Podcast producer and podcast dungeon master,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
they have consecutive birthdays.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
It's weird, man.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Making for a veritable birth-to-palooza.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
A kind of burning birth.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Can I mention how Anatoli's look is really coming along, huh?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Well, he's really committing to something right now.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
He's really committing to something right now.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
He's like a Roy Orbison.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Can I describe...

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I want to describe her people sitting beyond row two.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Can you stand up and just sort of show...

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Like, he's...

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Really, it looks great!

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Wait, what's he...

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
He's got an old-school Walkman, is that right?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Yeah, he's got an old-school Walkman.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
So you're like Don Cheadle in Boogie Nights.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
You're in search of an identity every...

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Yeah, he's got big 70s glasses on, long 70s hair.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
He looks like he might possibly either be Crosby Stills or Nash.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Yeah.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
What's crazy is he hasn't even gotten to the mustache yet.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Look at that mustache.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I mean, this might be cynical of me,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
but I feel like this whole Russian Winter Games has gone to your head

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
and I totally...

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
You've gone mad with Russian pride right now

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
and you feel like you can get away with anything.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Yeah, you don't look like a little kid

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
in the 70s had to draw a grown-up man.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I think you guys are connecting the Russian dot too much.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
He came out here to be a director.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Remember, we've been with Anatoly since his birth as a character.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Oh yeah, that's it.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I'm the character.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
He's like, I'm here to be a director

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
and we were like, do you watch TV?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
No.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Do you?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Nothing.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
He just wants to be a director.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
He's titling into...

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
This is what directing is, as far as I know.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
He's directing himself.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
That's what you've got to do, you've got to look like a director.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
But he's a director from the 70s for certain, right?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Yeah, he's got to work his way up to the present.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
No, in the 70s, they were dressed like Roman Togas and stuff.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
They had to do whatever they could to stick out.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
He's an Italian director from the 60s, maybe.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Or at least George Landis.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
John Landis.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
John Landis.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Or George...

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I combined George Lucas and John Landis.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Oh, wow.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And to one super 80s director.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
One day we're all going to be working for Anatoly, kind of.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Anatoly, what tape is in your Walkman?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
It's...

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So, Polpina buys the kinks?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
The kinks.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Oh, the kinks.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Well done.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Yeah, see?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
He's going to get by...

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
It's that Schrab thing.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
He's going to get by and just fucking weird shit.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Meanwhile, I fucking slave over a keyboard.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Fade in.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Fade in on what, Anatoly?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
You don't know.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Until I tell you.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Because I'm a writer.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
You know what I dress like?

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Buck Henry.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I dress like your dad, motherfucker.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Because I'm proud of it.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I'm an old bitch.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Like your dad.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
You just call all their dads old bitches.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Look, if they're writers, I don't know.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Whenever.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
My dad's an old bitch.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Fucking writers.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Unappreciated.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Bringing it back to that Hitler thing.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Although, in the green room I was like,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I was just kidding.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
It's just funny to me that I watched this movie

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
that was kind of made by George Clooney

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
and kind of gave me the misimpression

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
that Hitler loved art.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Everyone loves art.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Like, hey, I know that's not the impression he wanted to give.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
So I was just making that joke,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
and I liked to step on the gas and go like,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
yeah, Hitler loved art.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
He's an artist.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I'm like, Hitler wasn't a writer.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
And then someone goes, mind comp much?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Spreckenzie mind comp.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
He's arguably a more famous and worse writer than, yeah.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Arguably more famous than you?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I didn't say than me.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Then he was an artist.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Oh, sure.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Yeah, no, his book certainly had more of an impact

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
than his art did.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Yeah, well, yeah.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
The writing he did,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
we bring up more than the art he did.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
You really thought I was going to,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.000
all right, Hitler is arguably a more famous writer than me.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I'm kind of begrudgingly giving him that.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
But he wasn't that good.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You should date line Hollywood.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
How's it going, Spencer?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Why did I get brought up here?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
How's it going?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Have you had a fun week?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I was just sitting somewhere else earlier.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Did you just say why did I get brought up here?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Yeah, that was kind of weird, right?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Spencer's murder complex.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I don't, drives me nuts.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I just do what you guys tell me to.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I brought him up and then we didn't talk to him for a 10 minutes.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I know, that's what we always do.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
We did aggressively.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Okay, fine.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
It's cool.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Just don't bring me up.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I'll watch from the back.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
We will not bring you up.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
All right.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Problem solved.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
No taken.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
The guy, he hates to be brought up.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
No, he wants to be brought up,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
but he wants to be addressed like a human being when he's up here.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
We brought him up and we ignored him for 10 minutes.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
No, we talked to him.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Well, for a moment.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Yeah, we sang happy birthday for you motherfucker.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And then you brought out Dustin.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
We changed the words.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Yeah, happy birthday.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
You brought out Dustin who got exquisite lighting on my dad.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I think, I think.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And then.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And then.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It's his actual birthday.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And then you pivoted into this Anatoly.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I would say there's a G.I.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Anatoly dressed up like a porn star.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Yeah, he looks like my dad.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Yeah, holy shit.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Look at him.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I'm not complaining about any of the things.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
You're absolutely complaining.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
You said, don't bring me up.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
That's a complaint.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Yeah.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
That's an absolute complaint.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
That's an actual complaint.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Don't bring me up and then do that.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
That's a complaint.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
You can talk about Anatoly at length and then bring me up afterwards.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I did.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Yeah.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Not in that order.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
That's amazing that I'm being told what I can't do.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I'm not telling you anything.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
What's the name of the show, Spencer?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Harmontown.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I think it's two things.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Spencer is laid back and there's a geography thing where he literally is in the shadows

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
way offstage to the right.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I work.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
He's sitting down lower.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.500
Even if he was sitting up on stage, he probably wouldn't insert himself a lot, but he would

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:17.000
be more included in the conversation because you're physically then not aimed at him.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I think it's easy to not include somebody that's sitting physically way off of the stage.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I don't need to be included.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I just don't want to be brought up and then explicitly excluded.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Noted.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Noted.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Noted.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Noted.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
We will avoid that in the future.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
There we go.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
That is the first time on stage in Harmontown that there's been an adjustment to the

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
structure of the Harmontown show.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
We will no longer bring you up and then exclude you.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
That will not happen ever again by your decree.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Thank you.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
No, but we do that a lot though.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
We brought him up for many times.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
No, no, no.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
That's the first time we've gotten that adjustment.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
We do a lot of things all the time.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
That's true.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
We just never get told what to do.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But isn't he allowed to say that if you're going to bring me up and sit there alone for

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
12 minutes?

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Yes.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yes, he did.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Do you have any complaints you'd like to make?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Would you like the show to be different in any way?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Oh, shit.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Yeah.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I'd like it to be funnier from the beginning.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I'd like to get a standing ovation after every show.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I'd like it to be 15 minutes shorter all the time.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
To male?

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
To male?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Are you happy with the show all the way?

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I think the show is great and perfect and needs no adjustments.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Boom.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
What?

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
No.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I mean...

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I'm going to boo him now, but you won't when he's Comptroller next week.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Fuck yeah.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Fuck yeah.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And I'm pretty sure Adam Goldberg mentioned that he's a Dungeon Master, didn't he?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Oh, no.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Nobody's on board for that.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I don't know why I thought I'd be carried into this Liberator.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Yeah.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Yeah.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Okay.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
If we're going to start playing D&D, let's bring out Erin McGathy.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Hello.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Hi Spencer.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Hi Dan.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Part of the show is that it's messy and that's part of the thing of it, right?

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Right, Aaron?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Yes.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Dan, speaking of messy, something happened in between you going on stage.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Oh.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
This is crazy.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
This is no good.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
This is no good.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I'm going to try and hype it up way too much.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And then when you guys hear it, you're going to be like, you didn't hype it up enough.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
This is no good.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
So for Dustin and Spencer's birthday, I baked the audience a cake.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
That's the good news.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Let's play D&D.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I baked the audience a cake and right before cutting the cake, I went back to the green room and I washed my hands.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And after washing my hands.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
She washed her hands.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I know, big deal.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I washed my hands and I looked at my finger and I remember thinking, ah, I love my engagement ring.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Such a great engagement ring.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Oh no.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.000
So then I went back and I cut the cake with other Aaron, who's a great intern here.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
We were cutting the cake and talking and then you went on stage.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
So happy.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
And then I looked at my ring and the diamond is missing from my engagement ring.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I told you I couldn't hype it up enough.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
So my diamond, I hope no one ate it.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And I was like, I was like, what does it look like?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And then I was like, no, I guess if I see a diamond on the floor, that's probably your diamond.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But it'll look like a piece of chocolate cake probably.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
This is a good try to bring it up.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000
That so-called diamond is actually constructed of a very digestible substance.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
It's actually made of icing.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Called diamond naffia.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Birthday boy Dustin Marshall said, someone's going to die.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
No one's going to die.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Or get rich.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
No, that's not really, is that really dangerous if you swallow a little tiny diamond?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
You just shit it out.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Happy birthday.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.000
My older half-sister, one of her daughters, my niece, or when she was a little baby, ate her diamond ring, her wedding ring.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000
And for two or three days, I had to watch, or I didn't have to watch, but we had to hear reports about my sister.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000
I put diapers back on like the three-year-old or two-year-old that was off diapers.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Oh, to like sit through it.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
And then took a big fork and had to fork through her poop.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
So if everyone could do that.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Happy ending.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Happy ending.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
She found it and is still wearing it to this day.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Are they still using that fork?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
You get rid of that fork, right?

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000
The fork actually was destroyed, but it was framed and put up in their house.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
It's kind of as if that ring passed through her daughter's body.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It's fucking great.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Yeah, but now it's this diamond plaster in one of these guys' bodies.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I mean, I hope it's Anatoly.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
He does look like he ate a diamond.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah, and he does look like he would sift through his own shit.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
That's all he had.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
You dressed that way for a reason.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
You did not want attention.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
But real talk, real talk.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
The diamond is...

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Is in one of you.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Real talk, real talk.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Diamond is here.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
It's somewhere.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
The diamond is here.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Lock the doors.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
If you find it.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I mean, if you really need it.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
If you find it, keep it.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Fuck that.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Well, no, no.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Keep it and sell it.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
The top dollar.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I've sentimental attachments to it, I guess.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
No, you don't.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You lost it in a piece of cake.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And before that, that's the good news.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
We love each other.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
It's fine.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
My full statement was, if you need it, keep it.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
If you're a millionaire and you don't need it,

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I'll make you something and exchange for it.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I swear none of them are millionaires.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I'm looking at it totally.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Also, if you feel guilty about it,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
it actually is a blood diamond.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
It's a conflict diamond from...

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Adam, you were so good until now.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
I lost my wedding ring and I had to buy a new one.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
It was fine.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
The whole ring or just the jewel in there?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
No, I didn't have a jewel on it.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I knew it this.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I don't have mine yet.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Our love didn't suffer, yeah.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Aaron, all you have to do is ask,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I'll shit you a diamond.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
I know, I know.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
What do you want?

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
That's the new...

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Do you want marquee?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Fair shape, pretty like.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Square cut.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I didn't mean to cut you off, Aaron,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
so you were going to say the same thing I was.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Yeah, if you are at a point in your life

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
where you are willing to go through your own poop

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
because you think you may be the recipient of a diamond.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I don't think anybody was actually like,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
people chew cake, they don't swallow it whole.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
But it's not...

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
The bigger concern is that somebody

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
absolutely shatters a tooth trying to chew a diamond.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Then that's the...

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Yeah, you definitely get to keep the diamond.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I would say there's probably a half-eaten piece of cake

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
somewhere with a diamond sitting on top of it.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I bet it's on the floor somewhere.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Yeah, well, clearly, and this is only reasonable,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
but obviously we should not get married

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
unless the same diamond is found.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
If it is not found, there will be a murder.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
On a kind of semi-related note,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I lost a Gutenberg Bible backstage.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
If anybody sees a Gutenberg Bible,

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I had it inside of an 11-muffin.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
No, it's really a five-button.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
People at Otterbox, if they make wedding rings,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
like I'd like to get Aaron.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
At Otterbox?

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Your phone case is from.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Aaron can throw her phone across the room.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Spencer, what do you think of all this?

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I think it's great.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
You think it's great?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Yeah.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
She lost her...

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
It did help me look for it earlier.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I say we are speaking to Sifton through shit.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Let's play some D&D.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
When I find the music,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
keep your applause going until I shouldn't have brought it up.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I shouldn't have said it until I hit this.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Okay, cool.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Sorry, Spencer.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
What?

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I didn't kill you up well.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
You're doing a great job, Jeff.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Thank you, Spencer.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Don't change a thing.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Yeah, no notes.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
When we last met,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
our heroes were chained by the soul

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
on trial by skeletons in the city of Tormont Tour.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000
After upsetting and confusing the Bonesages,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Second Tour appointed the party a special defendant,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
a novice lawyer by the name of Skeleton Gary.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
After a brief recess to catch up,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Gary got down to business,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
cross-examining, citing precedents

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
and building a credible case.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
After a stirring and brilliant oratory,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Skeleton Gary managed to acquit our heroes

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
by promising that if freed,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
they'd bring back the head of the Marsh Minotaur,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
scourge of the flea market hills.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
But would our heroes be able

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
to fulfill their skeleton errand

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
or would they be cast into the pits of Skaldor?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Let's watch.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
All right, so we're freed from our soul chains, correct?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Yeah.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
That weird bug came and died.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Sure did.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
All right.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
So, I pull...

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I mean, is our lawyer gone?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I guess he is, right?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Yeah, he ran out.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
He has still a little money.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
All right, well, he's gone, so fuck him.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I turn to our group and say,

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
look, we made some promises during that court hearing

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
that we would go fight this Marsh Minotaur.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
It kind of sounded like improv to me,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000
but we did kind of bind ourselves to that promise.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Sounds like a bunch of malarkey.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I said we'd just get the hell out of here

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
and cut our losses.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Yeah, let's just get out of here

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
and be like, yeah, we'll do what you guys wanted to do,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
and then we'll just start to talk when we're outside.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Yeah, let's sign whatever we have to sign

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
and get the fuck out of here.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
There's nothing to sign, really.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
All right.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Well, thank you, Torah Mod and Torah.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
We appreciate your bureaucracy and everything,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
and I guess we'll be on our way.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I mean, you'll bring back the head of the Marsh Minotaur.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Yeah, yeah, totally.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Totally, totally.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
You point us in a direction and we'll do whatever you like.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Yeah, it's at the flea market hills.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Just be advised that as part of this whole thing,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:26.000
you know, you're obligated to do this under the penalty of soul loss.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Okay.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
We got it.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I mean, what do you mean exactly?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
We're not attached to the soul chains anymore.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
How does the soul loss thing?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Yeah, how could you...

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Yeah, like is a soul cop going to come and get us?

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000
I mean, no, it's just, it's in the magic of televarna that's already completed.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Wait, what do you mean?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Well, you saw the, you saw the beast of burden.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Yes.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
It made no sense to us.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I mean, it's kind of the benchmark of our law, but that's fine.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
It's, it doesn't matter to you.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Oh, so you're saying is if we default on getting the...

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
When it shrieks, the binding arbitrations of televarna

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
are inscribed onto your very soul,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and if they're not enacted properly, that'll, you know, kind of consume it.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
And if we don't bring back the marshmallow to our head,

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
then we just go kapoot, like...

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
What happens if we lose our souls?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I mean, you stop existing pretty much.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Is there a time limit?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
How does it know the difference between us taking a really long time to do it

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
and us not doing it?

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
What if we just don't get to it?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Is there a shot?

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
You can certainly try those.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Your soul.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
We can certainly try what?

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
To not, you know, to skirt televarna.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I mean, if it takes us a hundred years, is that cool?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Or if it takes us five years?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Like, how long is the shot?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
It's not up to me, man.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
The magic's already there.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Can we consult the magic and find out what the time limit is?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Sure, ask the magic.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I cast magic eye roll, and I ask the magic...

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
You glean nothing.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I mean, okay, have you guys ever done this before?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000
What's the normal statute of limitations on getting shit done before your soul disappears?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000
If you're not actively pursuing the quest, you're going to start feeling it.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I feel like we should have had this talk without him listening to us.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
It'll be like back to the future.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I mean, I don't know what that is.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Will we start disappearing?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Yeah, we'll look at our hand.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
All right, so we'll go do it.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
All right, you know what?

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
It'll be Zemeckis' discretion.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Are there any weaknesses to this marshmallow that we should know of?

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Ah, I'm sure he's not full of great strengths.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
You're probably fine.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Oh, so...

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
All right, so, Alita, tell us which direction we start walking to the flea market hills.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Oh, I'll do you one better.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Lenev, you show him.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Aw, fuck!

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Oh, we gotta go with this guy?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
God damn it!

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Okay, I pull Sharpie aside and say, Sharpie?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
No.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
What?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
We're gonna have to do this with Lenev.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
There's two ways to do this.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
The easy way or your way?

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Are we gonna get along or are we gonna fight the whole way through?

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I would like to go on a vision quest by myself.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
All right.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Can we get anyone but Lenev?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Why does it have to be Lenev?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
He's the marshal around these parts.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I've been to the flea market.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Hills?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Yeah.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
In fact, I know the Minotaur.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Yes.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
We don't need Lenev.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
We've got this one over here.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
All right.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Well, everybody leave.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
We're gonna do private stuff in here.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Sharpie, are you still going on a vision quest?

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Yeah, he's doing the private stuff.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Is Lenev coming with us?

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I guess not.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Lenev, are you coming with us or no?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Fuck you.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I'll show you guys the way.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I used to go out with the Minotaur.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
All right.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Sounds good.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I'll come with you guys.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I kind of wanted to hear about your vision quest after you were done.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Well, I mean, the good news is you're now on it.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Because she doesn't know where the fuck the Minotaur is.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Thank you.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
We had a romance.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Mulraine, lead the way.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
This way.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
I go in the right direction.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000
You search for the right direction and you see some hills.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
They're probably the only hills in the area.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
When I used to travel on these hills before,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
we used to call them the little eggs.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Come on, gentlemen.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
This way.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Little eggs?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Yeah.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
They look like big eggs, if anything.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
It made no sense when we said it then and now.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
We called them the little eggs.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Tell us about that.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
You said you met the March Minotaur.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Tell us all about him.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Tell us all about him.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
What's his favorite color?

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Flashback.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Oh, you're early.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
A Minotaur is never early.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Nor is he late.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
He arrives precisely when he meets you.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
March.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
His name is March?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
She thinks my name is Marsh.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
She thinks my name is Marsh Minotaur?

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Yeah, she thinks my last name is Minotaur.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:39.000
That's like having someone named Edward Heumann.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Marsh, I made you...

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I made you this little bucket.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
What is the bucket for?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I put good wishes in it for a date.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I routinely...

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
The Sedona family, we give everyone buckets.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
And this is...

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I mean, now I feel embarrassed, but here's this bucket.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Where are we going on the date?

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Thanks for this bucket.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Can I leave it here and pick it up later?

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Yes, yes, of course, yes, yes.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000
We're going to the flea market hills.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Oh, excellent. I've never been there before.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Real quick, pause.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
We flash back to the present while we watch you

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
kind of look up in the air while you're clearly going into a flashback.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
And I look every go, this is going to be an awesome flashback.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I can't wait to hear what happens on this one.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Back into the flashback.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Yeah, I guess we could go there.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Yeah, hey, I don't want to be weird,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
but you had a bad experience in the flea market hills

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
the last time you visited them.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000
You were part of a story that I read in...

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Do I tell the story?

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I.e. do the heavy lifting in this improv?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I heard that someone was selling something

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
that you found very offensive

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
and you charged several halflings

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
and you ended up...

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
you contributed to the deaths of many halfling children.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
I was misunderstood.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
They had a confederative flag with swastikas on it.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
And I was like, that's wrong.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And they were like, different symbols mean different things to different people.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And I just sort of went nuts

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
and some lives were lost,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
but I don't think there were lives worth saving anyway.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
They were like, you know...

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Yeah, I mean obviously I'm on the state,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
so I'm on your side, I just wanted to clear that up.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Yep, so that's it.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
But I think it's blown over.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
I don't think people think of me as like a bad guy anymore.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
There's no like council trying to like kill me or anything.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I feel like I've explained myself.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Oh, the buttons on your pants are coming apart.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
So here's that.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Yep, they are.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Aren't you curious?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000
How far down the hoarseness goes?

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Oh, that's a centaur.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Bull.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Bullness.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Yeah, that's a centaur.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Dan, I'm referencing our first date.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
JK, uh...

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Whoa.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
What happened?

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
He left.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
It's just a guy that has to take a shit.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
It happens every day.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I didn't mean that as sexually as it came across,

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
but so great.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Let's just stay here then,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
meaning that we won't actually go to the flea market,

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
but we've had a connection.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Yeah.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Flashback of it.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
You know the minotaur.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
So tell me all about him.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Well, I just relived that flashback out loud.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
What happened with the minotaur?

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Did you guys stay at home?

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Yeah, he...

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
You know what I mean?

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
We started...

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000
How far down did his hoarseness go?

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Bullness.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
It went down as far as you think.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
People have chemistry with certain people.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Things started to get hot and heavy,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
and it was clear that things weren't meant to be for us.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
That's all.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I put on Mark and Mindy,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and we watched that.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
And then he...

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Let's go to the flea market.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Back with the flashback.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
This never happens to me.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
No way.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
It's fine.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
It's fine.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I think I ate something bad for breakfast.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Nanu.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
I usually have you not have breakfast.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Nanu.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Mark and Mindy's still on the background.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
It's loud.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
It's a loud and assertive.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Nanu.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Like that.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Oh, oh, oh.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Oh.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Oh.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Nanu, nanu.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Nanu, nanu.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I said it quite...

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
The episode where he took over Europe

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
and hoarded all the art.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Nanu, nanu.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Nanu, nanu.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Burn the Picasso's...

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Oh, oh, oh.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
You know what?

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
You know what?

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
And I'll call you, though.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I swear.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And you know what?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I'll pick up the bucket when I come back.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Well, can I give you this wreath?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I want to...

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
I'm going to tie it around your neck.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I have an idea.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
How about I pick up the wreath when I come back for the bucket?

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Please just take this wreath.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
All right, I'll take the wreath.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I mean, it's very small.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I didn't even notice that.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I'll take the wreath.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Nanu, nanu, nanu.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
All right.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I'll call you.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Nanu, nanu, nanu.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000
It's the worst episode of work ever in the background.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
All right.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Well, so you...

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
So, suffice to say, you have a longstanding relationship with this monster.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Yes, I mean, I never saw him again.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
He's a nice guy.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
He's misunderstood.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I would like to face him.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
He doesn't sound very tough.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Like, he doesn't sound like a real threat.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Like, he sounds like he's kind of a regular...

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Like, he sounds kind of...

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
He sounds like you never know where he's coming from.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
So here, you say it.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Yeah.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I suppose that's true.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
But also...

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Like, if he was on Lulu, what's that app?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
His hashtag would be like,

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Lulu!

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000
All over the place.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Two horns, no ambition.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
I don't know.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
What are you...

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Two horns, not three.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
All right.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Well, so where is he?

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
He's up through these little legs.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
He's up in the middle.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
This way.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Let's go there.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
We start going there.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Okay.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
You shouldn't stop through a regression valley for a while?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Oh, yeah.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
It's right off exposition lane.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
All right.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
We head toward Small Egg Hills.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Little Eggs.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Little Eggs.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Yeah.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
You go to that place.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You see hills.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
You also see a lot of stalls and booths,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
like some sort of farmer's market

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000
or maybe a flea market has been set up.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
It looks largely abandoned, though.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
That's what you see.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Do you want to call out for him?

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Hey, Marsh.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Not to be weird, but I guess I happen to be here.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
It's not for you.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I'm here with my boyfriend.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I whittle.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I whittle.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
You see, you see shifting wood.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
There's like some sort of wreckage of wood

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
and you see a small skeletal figure

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
crawl out of this woodwork holding a little sign.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.000
The sign says, don't be cheesy.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Is that jont?

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Jont.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Like don't with a J.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Like Jango?

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Yeah.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Yeah, like that.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
But jont.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Hey, little one.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Bye, my cheeses.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.000
No.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Okay.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
And I like cheese.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I just don't like your sign.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I keep whittling.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Have you seen a Minotaur walking around

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
who's kind of, you know,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
emotionally unavailable,

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
but clearly handsome

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
and people are very taken by him,

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
but maybe he doesn't have the high enough self-esteem

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
to accept love yet.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I sure did.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
He came in and stomped all my cheeses.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I should have clarified earlier.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
It stomped cheese.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
He's slapped all your cheeses.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
He stomped them all.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Stomped cheese.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Stomped all the cheeses.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
That's just like him.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I think you're still kind of sweet on this guy.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I mean, who knows?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
You know, sometimes people come together

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
at different times in their lives,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
but you know, I'm like...

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Yeah, I agree.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Sometimes just the time isn't right, you know,

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
even if the people are right for each other.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Wait, how are you tied up in this?

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
I just, I sort of...

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I understand what she's saying.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
That's happened to me.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Do you two have a previous lover?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
I have pulled Chris out.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Flashback!

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Flashback!

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Hey.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Hey.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000
You want more of that?

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Every day.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Nanu Nanu!

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Nanu Nanu!

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Sorry, let me turn down the T, man.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
You know what?

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Just turn it off.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.000
All right, with pleasure.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
So it's two for six, six for two,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
and twelve for twenty.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And I like your style.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
You flashback.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
You guys sounded like you were really in love.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Yeah, I got the twelve for twenty.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Flashback!

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Flashback!

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I'm going to award you with the twelve for twenty.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Why?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
The government requires me to tell you

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
you'll never be the same.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Flash forward to the present.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
That was the last mistake I ever made.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Like, you met Dolph Lundgren?

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you, that twelve for twenty

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
was totally worth it.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
But I never have been able to write a song since then.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Oh, did you write Woman in Red?

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Lady in Red before that meeting?

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I wrote Woman in Red.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
He wrote it.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I wrote Lady in Red right before that meeting,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
and I was like, oh, I'm a songster.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Oh, my God.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
And I was like, nothing will take this away from me.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
He literally fucked you out of a career.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
But you know what?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I wouldn't have it any other way.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
I go examine the footprints and the cheese

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
that's been stomped.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
It's all stomped.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Did they lead in a direction?

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
They do. They lead over the hill, believe it or not.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
This way, gentlemen, let's go over the big yoke.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Yeah.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I guess you guys are doing that.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Yeah.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Yeah, we're going to get the marshy.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Yeah.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
You go over the hill and you see at the bottom of the hill,

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.000
just lying right there in sight a dank, smelly cave.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
You can smell it from here.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Let's go in there.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Yeah.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I don't want to wall it up with rocks.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Well.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
So that no one can ever get in or out.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
But maybe we should see what's happening.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000
I take two of my arrows,

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
and I put my hair up in a bun,

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
and I do that thing that middle schoolers do

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
when they put two pencils in their hair,

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
but with my arrows.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Oh, yeah.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Like with knitting needles.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Yeah.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
People do them.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
I'm just going to go in really quick,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
and just see what's going on.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Come on.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.000
No one.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
You're going in with us,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
because, first of all, this minotaur is ferocious.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Second of all, you can't control yourself around him.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
You have a history with him,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
and you don't know what you're doing.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Right.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000
You have a co-dependent relationship.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Well, I appreciate you guys coming in with me.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
If I make any jokes, please laugh loudly.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
And also, if it comes up organically,

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
please call me pretty and smart.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Let's do it.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Hey, before we go in there, resolve this.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:49.000
You should be the one staying outside this cave.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
You can't control yourself as a person.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000
A lot has happened to me since the last time that I saw him,

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
and I've evolved a lot, and I've changed a lot,

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
and I realize that I'm exposing myself

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000
for being an insecure archer.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
But I just want him to see how great I am now,

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
and I want him to see the company I keep.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Because more than anything, I'm proud of the company I keep.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I use sense motive, if I can.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Uh-oh.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Can I answer this one?

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
No, you have to do it truthfully.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Okay.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Yeah.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
So what's going on?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
What's going on?

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Is it a different voice, or is it?

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Yes.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Um, I love you.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I don't love him, but I want him to think I'm hot.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
So relatable.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I get it.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
We've all been through relationships where we feel like

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
they took our wallet.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
We want our wallet back.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
In a way, it seems like she wants to show you off to him

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
and say, look how great my life is.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Okay, I get it.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I'm going to be that guy for you.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Let's do this.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
By the way, I guess I'm your boyfriend?

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I didn't even know that.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Oh, you guys need a little bit of room?

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Should we?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
No, not at all.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
I'm asexual, but I'm a wizard.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
All right.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I take my sword out, and I look at you guys,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
and we all stand like four abreast,

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
and we're all standing at the entrance to this cave,

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
and I'm ready to go in there with you guys.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
All right, let's go in.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I'm super excited.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
What kind of pose do you take?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Are you saying that we all hold our weapons up,

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000
and that the sun is behind the weapons,

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:36.000
and that a kind of lens flare comes out,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000
and it says, should we continue in the lens flare?

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
But there is a voiceover that, kind of like Duke's hazardous,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
says, oh, what's about to happen?

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Kind of a teaser.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I think you could do more.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
We started the show late.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Hey, if it were up to me,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
we would be here until three in the morning.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Okay, we put our weapons together,

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
and I just charge into the cave.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Charge!

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Charge!

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Yelling.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I kick anything in my way.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Kick, kick.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
No, no, no.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
No, no, no.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
No, no, no.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
No, no, no.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Kick, kick, kick.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I run as fast as I can to get ahead of them,

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
so he doesn't need quirk first.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Shazbot.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Shazbot!

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Also, I have a partial boner,

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000
and my pants are halfway down.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I swear to God, if you rape my ex-boyfriend.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I'm trying my hardest.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
These flashbacks really turned me on.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I'm not saying...

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Don't blame you.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
All right.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
So you're stomping, stomping into this cave.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Could have ended the show.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
There's bones and skulls all over the place,

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
adorning the floor,

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
and as you charge in all loudly,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
and yelling, and kicking,

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
and doing those things,

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
you hear a weird wailing.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
It calls out.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000
It's like,

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Stay back.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Guys, I think Peter Sellers is in prison here.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
All right, guys.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I'll check it out.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Yeah, yell out to him.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Marsh?

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I will destroy him.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
I've been called that in a long time.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
No, okay.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
This was a joke we used to have,

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
where he would say,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
I'll destroy you.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
It doesn't mean anything.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
I smooth my hair back with my hand,

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000
and I approach.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Hey!

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Bananas, right?

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
It's a joke.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
It was a joke.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
We had a thing.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
You guys had a joke called bananas?

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Right?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
We had a...

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
There was this time where we were walking down the street,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
and there was a banana tree,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
and a bunch of bananas fell all at once.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
You know what?

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Sounds cool.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
What are the walls made of, Spencer?

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Like, cave stuff.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Okay, I start climbing the walls,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
and try to get up along the side of the walls,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
and it's like, while she's distracting,

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I try to get into a flanking maneuver.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
That's your solution to everything.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Kill it, then fuck it.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Starts climbing the walls.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
If it ain't broke?

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000
The walls are slick with some sort of weird moisture.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
That's my fault.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
That's all the description of skulls.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
You still manage to climb up into the cave.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
You're holding on to a slack-type.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I'm just crawling along slowly.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Very slowly.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I look back like...

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I feel like...

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Keep them talking.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Keep them on the phone call.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I bound down, like, kicking high,

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000
kicking massive amounts of dirt,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
smashing everything I can,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
waving my hands in the air,

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
and yelling,

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I'm in your cave!

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000
You do that.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000
I don't know if you're making the kind of boyfriend impression

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
that she wanted you to make.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Well, I'm angry, because, like, marry him.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Guess why?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Oh, come on.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
You didn't break.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
How would you react?

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
You said five moments ago

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
that you don't remember that we were dating.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000
I run towards the...

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Towards the voice.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I kick every stalagmite and stalactite.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Except the one that he's on?

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Well, whatever one he's on, fine.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I throw rocks behind me

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000
as to try to homelone Sharpie's path.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Uh, you homelone it.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Great.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000
What am I doing?

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
I don't know. What are you doing?

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
I'm, like, super weirded out by everything.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I yell, I am not on board!

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Okay.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
How close am I to wherever this voice is coming from?

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Not very.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I mean, you're crawling on a ceiling.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
He's all running.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I feel like we should just go talk to him.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
We don't need to go on ceilings and kick stuff, right?

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000
We just go talk to him.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
That's what I'm trying to do.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Because what we want to do,

01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000
we have to kill this guy.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Let's face it.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Right.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
He may as well bring him to us.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
I don't want to come looking for him.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Where are you?

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Stay back!

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Do I see him yet?

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
I'm running and I'm running and I'm running.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
You keep running and you see a light around the bend,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
like there's lit stuff around the bend.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I keep on running towards that light.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
You see, you see the Marsh Minotaur.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
It's seated.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
It's sitting.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Kind of sprawled out.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000
You see it's utter, just kind of laying all over the floor.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
It's utter!

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
The reality of my past lover.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
He's a cow?

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And it's, uh, it's looking at,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
like a weird, like a cow symbol.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Yeah, I'm doing it like a cow symbol.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Boys, boy, boy Minotaur.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Whoa, metagaming, metagaming.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
This thing's got another.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Okay.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Yeah.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
You don't even see it, man.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Also, maybe he identifies as a male,

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
but he's not biologically.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000
There's also another?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I run, I run towards, uh, I run towards him.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Marsh!

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
You're not skeletons.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
No, it's, uh...

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I thought you guys were skeletons.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Hey!

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
We're, we're...

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
You're not there.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Okay.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Sorry.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
It's, it's me.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Are you okay?

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.000
What?

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Do you, do you remember me, Mallory and Sedana?

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
What are you talking about?

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Talking about memories.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Then no.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Dude, you, you remember me?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
We met in that elevator.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I dropped all my papers and you picked them up.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
What's an elevator?

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Dude, did you hook up with a different Minotaur?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
That's racist.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I, I, I examine his face and I,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000
and I see that he is clearly a different.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000
But you let us here.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Hey, do you know another Minotaur

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
who really likes Smork and Mindy?

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
What's Smork and Mindy?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Okay.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Um, you seem suicidal.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I mean, I wouldn't go that far.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
What are you doing in my cave?

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I, I draw my long sword and I say,

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:19.000
uh, ending this.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000
And then I, I take it down on them.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
We won at his head, right?

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I'm on a ceiling back in the hall.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Yeah.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I've been reminded that I'm not there.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Yeah.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
None of us are there.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
It was just, you had all kinds of funny stuff to say.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I was not there.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I look, I look around his neck and I say that there's no wreath.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Um, and clearly the guy, the Minotaur I dated

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
would always wear this wreath,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
even if he felt nothing for me,

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
because that's how Mulrainee Sidhanna deals with the world.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
I take the sword and I, and I,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:56.000
I put it down on the Minotaur's neck with great force.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Um, you bring down the sword upon its neck in it.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
It just hits its neck and it just breaks your blade.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000
The wreath, the wreath is a Sharpie and Chris de Burgh arrive.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Hey!

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Hey!

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Hey!

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Did you do any, you didn't do anything stupid, did you?

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.000
How can I support your relationship?

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
As a good person.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I have a box of wine.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Hey guys, that sword I bought at the Magic Shop

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
really works.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
It breaks when you want it to.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Why would you attack your ex-boyfriend?

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Yes.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Have I crawled on this hilling enough to be in the same room

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
when I still haven't been in the hallway?

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I mean, if you were walking, you would have.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
I mean, I, I, I'm comm- I'm comm-

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
It's crawling!

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
It's crawling!

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I'm comm-

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I don't care if it takes me 10 episodes.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I made my bed, I'm gonna lie on it, I'm gonna fuck it.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
How far outside of this room am I?

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Um, well, like a couple rounds.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
You're in there.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000
The Marsh Minotaur rises to its feet and it's like,

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000
why are all these humans down here and why are you attacking me?

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Are there skeletons you could go bother?

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
You are, right?

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Excuse me, Marsh?

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Is it Marsh?

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000
No, it's Kaedef.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Kaedef?

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Yep.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Definitely a different guy.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Guy?

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Minotaur, sorry.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I'm sure he Buttsalot.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Uh, my, my, uh, my friends and I have gotten mixed up in a lot of bullshit

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:45.000
with a lot of parasites, a lot of bureaucrats over this, uh, campaign.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Uh, whatever you'd call that.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
In a-

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
I've been there.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Yeah.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Uh, we were on trial with the, uh, skeletons.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
You know them?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Yes.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Our lawyer, our lawyer got us off by promising that we'd kill you.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
I don't want to do it.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I see no profit in it.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Frankly, I don't see how we'd do it.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000
You're a big strap and very straight guy.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000
What?

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
You're so straight.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Do you know how udders work?

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I'm sorry.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000
A very strapping, uh, entity.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Uh, of any, of anything.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I didn't mean to imply gender at all.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
All right.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Okay.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Shit.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000
This is definitely not your minotaur.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
We, we briefly come back to meet the ceiling.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Uh, god damn it, son of a bitch.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000
The truth of the matter is that we got, we got time bombs implanted on our souls

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:50.000
by these skeletons, uh, if we don't fulfill our goal, uh, we are, you know,

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
our souls blow up or something.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I got no beef with you.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I got more beef with people that would do that kind of thing to people.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Yeah.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Skeletons are dicks.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
They're total dicks.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
There's a skeleton guy who comes in and milks me.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
What?

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Yeah.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000
His name's Jonte.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Jonte, be cheesy.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000
If you, you're more native to this bureaucracy than we are.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000
If we could figure out a way to like, you know, turn this whole thing on its head.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
I just fell down here one day through a marsh.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
That's metaphorically what happened to us.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Whoa.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Um.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
It sounds like we have a common enemy.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Finally, finally we find a, we meet a nice person.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I like this guy.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I like, oh, I like this person.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
I like this person.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I also like this person.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
I give, I give a kaif.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Yep.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Uh, will you accept this bucket?

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I guess I will as a symbol of me casting off my oppression.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000
It's kind of, it's, it's like a rapper wearing, you know, yeah.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
What?

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Oh, chains?

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Yeah, well.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Whoa.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
No, I mean, it's profound.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Yeah, it's profound.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I didn't, I didn't come up with it.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Am I in the room yet?

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
No dude.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Yeah.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Yeah.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
You arrived.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000
I, I, I, I, I emerge in this, on the ceiling of the room and look down.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Talk to me after the show if you want to talk about that.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Are these rappers worn chains because they're reminiscent of the chain's history?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I don't know, not, not consciously.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Oh, it's part of their unconscious ancestral memory that they have inherited from their

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000
brethren.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.600
You look down and say, hey guys, is that the Marsh Minotaur?

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:39.600
Yep.

01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:43.280
Oh, Jesus, I'm on the ceiling.

01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:44.280
Oh, hey.

01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:45.280
It's a spider pal.

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.280
You made it.

01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:47.840
I'm startled, and I take my knife,

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:50.160
and I throw it at his back.

01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:52.760
Who is that?

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.920
I declared it was me.

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:57.280
You hit, yeah.

01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.760
It takes six damage.

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:02.520
Shit.

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:05.440
I store that memory and bury it deep, deep inside.

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.040
Is he still up there?

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:10.040
I start shimmying down the side to get down there.

01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:12.040
And I go, look, is everything cool?

01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:15.960
I thought I was doing the right thing by getting up here and like being like sneaky,

01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:18.120
but apparently we didn't have to be sneaky about this.

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:19.680
Karev, was that your name?

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:20.680
Kaedev.

01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:21.680
Kaedev?

01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:22.680
Kaedev?

01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:23.680
Kaedev.

01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:24.680
Like Kaedev, but with a K?

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:25.680
Correct.

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:26.680
What's Kaedev?

01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:27.680
Okay.

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:28.680
Kaedev, it is.

01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:29.680
Kaedev?

01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:30.680
Kaedev.

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:34.160
Listen, let's form a human minotaur pact.

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:35.760
Okay.

01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:44.320
But I'm telling you, we're kind of bound, like we got like a cosigned autolone here

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:48.520
on our souls, like I've been honest about that with you.

01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:50.200
Yeah, that sucks, man.

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:53.280
I'll try and help you out, I guess, I don't know how that works.

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:57.280
Let's go attack them, because I feel like skeletons have been dicked to us from the

01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.280
very beginning.

01:59:58.280 --> 01:59:59.280
I agree.

01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:00.880
You've been awesome to us.

02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.880
So great.

02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:02.880
Thanks.

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:03.880
Thanks.

02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:07.760
Thanks for thinking my knife on your neck joke was funny.

02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:08.760
Wow.

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:11.760
Yeah, what was that?

02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:15.120
Okay, be very careful.

02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.760
That's how humans say they love me.

02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:19.920
Yeah, it's like blood brothers, but more intense than ones I did.

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:23.440
See, she liked quarks so much she threw a knife at him.

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:24.960
Yeah, we do that sometimes.

02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:29.320
I take her knife and I just kind of put it in the back of my pants and just like kind

02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:31.960
of like stare kind of creepily like a fucking...

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:38.240
I have a bad pitch, bad pitch, room number.

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:42.800
We keep writing back to the skeletons and saying, we're still looking for him.

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.520
I think we're right behind him.

02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:45.520
Great.

02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:46.760
And we just keep that going forever.

02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:47.760
I think that's a great idea.

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:50.840
But we adopt him as a member of our party.

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:55.480
And so we're always kind of like one step behind him because he's in front of us.

02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:03.880
And then hopefully that'll thwart whatever soul magic is enforcing this dumb magic-packed

02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:05.720
thing on us.

02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:06.720
Just to try it.

02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:15.400
If we start to get nauseous or he falls out, we kill the Minotaur because he's not a real

02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:16.400
Minotaur.

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.400
He is.

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.400
Utters.

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:22.880
Don't look behind you, Spencer's rolling dice when you're talking.

02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:26.480
But overall, we're a happy family.

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:29.000
It's not losing our lives.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.520
It's gaining a party member.

02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.640
Weren't you saying that not to him?

02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:35.640
Weren't you saying that like...

02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:36.640
Yeah, saying it to us.

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:37.640
Yeah.

02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:38.640
Yeah.

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:40.040
But you're looking at me like the Minotaur heard that.

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.040
Now I'm turning to look at you.

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:42.040
He was looking at you like Spencer.

02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:43.040
I'm going.

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:44.040
Hey, let's go.

02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:45.040
And so it's Karev.

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.040
Kydef.

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.040
Kydef.

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.040
Karev.

02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:49.040
Mostef.

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:52.840
We would like to welcome you into our happy family.

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.840
Awesome, man.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:54.840
Cliff Hanger?

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:55.840
Question mark.

02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.840
Question mark.

02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:57.840
Question mark.

02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:58.840
We did it.

02:01:58.840 --> 02:01:59.840
Thank you everybody for coming to Harmontown.

02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:00.840
I mean, we ended on kind of a peaceful resolution there.

02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:01.840
You find that diamond, you may keep it or tell me that you have it.

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:02.840
There's a diamond here.

02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:03.840
