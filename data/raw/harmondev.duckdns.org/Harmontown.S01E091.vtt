{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.000\nFeral Audio\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:17.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:19.000\nHello.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:29.000\nWelcome to Meltdown Comics. The NerdMelt Theater and the epicenter of Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:44.000\nBuckle up, motherfuckers. Welcome to the stage. The mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:54.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, fuck you, mama, fuck your daddy in the mouth.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:59.000\nI fucked your daddy from the north to the south. Predictable rhymes, I don't care, I'm still rapping.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:03.000\nRapping like I was a butt, that's crappin'. Crappin' in the toilet that is your ears.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:08.000\nDominatin' your desires and fears. Freestyle rappin' like I've never done before.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:13.000\nFuck your mama on the ceiling, fuck your mama on the floor. I'm rappin'. Freestyle rappin'.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:18.000\nSounds like it's written, but I'm freestyle rappin'. Didn't think about it in the green room at all.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:22.000\nNow I'm gonna fuck your mama in the summer and fall. Fuck your mama, fuck your daddy on the street.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:25.000\nFuck your mama in her mouth, fuck your daddy on his feet.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:30.000\nCome on his toes, put on his shoes, take him downtown and show him the blues.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:35.000\nTeach him how to roll with the blacks. Teach him how to feel his slacks.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:45.000\nTake him choppin', take him choppin'. Lumberjacks. Yo, yo, yo, what? Yo, yo, rapping.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:59.000\nFuckin' intense. I don't know if you've ever spit fire before, but it comes through you.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:06.000\nThe term spit implies that it starts inside you. It's not true. It comes through the back of your head.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:16.000\nIt goes back to mythology. There's a, the band-aid on the back of Marcellus Wallace's neck in Pulp Fiction.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:24.000\nAnd in the Coen Brothers movie, that's an old, something Jewish about the thing on the back of the neck.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:30.000\nNow, do you feel that was a one-time thing for tonight, or do you feel that that's gonna stay true throughout the entire show tonight?\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:37.000\nI'm on fire tonight. God is above me, right above me. High noon.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:45.000\nLike, it's a harmonic convergence. I felt it when I was walking through. They were playing some, what do you call that, R&B, hip-hop?\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:46.000\nYes.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:52.000\nHip-hop. I just felt like, let's give them, let's not talk about it. It was phenomenal.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:56.000\nWhat you don't want to do is look at it and try to capture that same lightning bug in the same jar.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:57.000\nNo, no.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:04.000\nMy biggest challenge, Jeff, my biggest challenge when I'm freestyle rapping is when I hear, like you do, it's too good.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:10.000\nIt sounds written. And you heard me address it in the thing. I was panicking.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:14.000\nI was like, oh shit, they're gonna think this is written. I'm not Eminem.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:15.000\nDan, right it.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\nDan, was that?\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:21.000\nI don't have it. I'm like him, except fuck your hand. Fuck your marker on your hands.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nWas that your guilty conscience saying, this sounds written because I did prepare something?\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:26.000\nNo!\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nIt was my...\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nI'm Shakespeare, right?\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:32.000\nSounds written because it's fucking God is writing it.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:33.000\nYeah.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:39.000\nAnd so I'm like, guys, I'm sorry. It's like how a magician stops halfway through and he goes, I'm sorry, I have to remind you again.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:40.000\nNothing up my sleeve.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nBecause this rabbit's actually just flying out of hats.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:51.000\nNow, I mean, what I'm not gonna do, Dan, and I'm saying I'm not going to do this because I don't want to ruin the experiment.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:56.000\nI could play that same beat again and I think you're in such a zone that you could even go further than that.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:00.000\nI'm not going to. We're gonna save it for later at any point though.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:04.000\nI feel like you need to be in that free fall state.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nI'll tell you what, tonight, little favor to you.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:07.000\nOkay.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:08.000\nCatch me off guard.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:09.000\nAlright.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:13.000\nSneak up on me. Be like Kato and Pink Panther.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nAm I mixing my references?\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:16.000\nYou're close enough.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nAlright.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:21.000\nThe guy that Clusso pays to keep him on his toes.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nYeah, attack me.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:24.000\nCome up behind me.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nTry and catch me. You can't.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:31.000\nBecause you opened up with it with a real normal pitfall of saying in the mouth.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nAnd then it has to be.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:33.000\nExactly.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:36.000\nBecause it's just like rum, rum, rum in the parking lot.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nOkay.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:43.000\nWe're not, we're porn... we're pornifying it.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nPornographizing?\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nPornographizing it.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nAlright, we got a lot of stuff to do.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nHere's my new segment.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nIt's called Controversial Thoughts.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:53.000\nWoo!\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nWoo!\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nWoo!\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nNo!\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nNo!\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nNo!\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nNo!\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nNo!\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.000\nNo!\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.000\nNo.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\nOkay.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:04.000\nI know.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nThat was not the time for it.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nBut I like that you're on your toes.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:10.000\nAlright.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nBecause you're fucking nimble as a mountain goat tonight.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:13.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nYou know how cockroaches?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nYou probably don't know this.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nI provide knowledge.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nI drop it.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nI drop science.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.000\nI spit fire.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:21.000\nI provide knowledge.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nHave you ever spit knowledge?\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nTimes on accident.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\nThe cockroach has a photoreceptor in its legs.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nIt's running before it knows why.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nWhen you turn on the lights, the cockroaches start running.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nIts brain doesn't even, hasn't even, has yet to say,\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:37.000\noh shit, I'm a cockroach.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nIts legs are going, you have to run.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:40.000\nThere's light.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nWe're a cockroach.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:46.000\nWhen I hear that beat, Jeff, I start moving and rapping.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:52.000\nBecause the street part of me has its own tiny, urban brain.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nI'm not saying urban people have a tiny brain.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nOr that they're cockroaches.\n\n05:58.000 --> 05:59.000\nOh boy.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nOh boy.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:06.000\nWell, like cockroaches, we, the urban people, will never die.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nI speak on behalf of us.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nWhat is it about you that makes you so urban, dad?\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nBecause I'm from the streets.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nThat's the only thing that you need.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nI'm 52nd in Calumet, bitch.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nMilwaukee.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nLook it up.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:25.000\n526, I think that was my area code.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:26.000\nLook it up.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nYou'll see.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nThere's a street there.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:33.000\nControversial, controversial thoughts.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:42.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nClearly you weren't ready for that one.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:49.000\nNo, I was, you know, alright.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:50.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:53.000\nI saw monuments, men.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:57.000\nAnd I didn't, I don't know anything about this aspect of history.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:02.000\nBut it seemed to me like Hitler was really into art.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:07.000\nJust like America and Europe and everybody.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nIt seemed like poor people just kill each other in wars\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nand rich people just care about paintings.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:18.000\nSo I wasn't that moved by George Clooney's story about fat old men\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\ngoing into war to protect paintings from Hitler\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nwho was intent on building a giant Hitler museum\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nto store all the paintings.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nUgh.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:34.000\nYeah, yeah, yo, yeah, oh, yeah, controversial thoughts.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nOkay.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nI mean, Aaron and I got in a fight about it.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:41.000\nShe's an artist.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nShe's a visual artist.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nWait, no, what was the fight about?\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nWhat side were you on and what side was she on?\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nWell, because I was, because I don't know anything.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nWho was on Hitler's side?\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nMe.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nKind of.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nOh, no, no, that's not true.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nThat's not true at all.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nShe kept accusing me of being a Hitler side.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nThe irony was, I'm not on Hitler's side.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nI'm not on artist's side.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nI'm not on art's side because I kept going like,\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nseems like art's kind of a, you know,\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nwe keep talking about art, how important it is.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nEveryone agrees art and support is important.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nThere's a scene in the movie where they find,\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:15.000\nthey're looking for all this art.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nWe gotta protect the art.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nAnd then they find a bunch of gold.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nAnd then like, Eisenhower comes down,\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nhe's taking his picture with all the gold\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nand like two of the characters go,\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nyou know, they give a fuck about gold,\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nbut they don't give a fuck about art.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nIt's like, what's the fucking difference?\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nThere's just less art.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nIt's like, the gold is like stacks of shit\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nthat everyone agreed was valuable.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nThat's all art is.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nAnd I was just like saying,\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nAaron was, Aaron bursted the tears part of it,\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nnot because she thought the movie was good,\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nbut because she actually,\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nbecause she thought the movie was profaning\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nsomething that she cared a lot about.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nShe was explaining, by the way, we're both drunk.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nShe's explaining the way home.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nLike, oh, I just, you know, it's like,\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nHitler, like he wanted to, he wanted to destroy\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nall the art that he didn't think was good.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nAnd that was terrible.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nThere's a scene where they blow-tarch a bunch of art.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nAnd I was like, well, that was Scorched Earth, though.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nThey were, Hitler did a Nero doctrine where he said,\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:09.000\nif I fall or if Germany falls, start destroying everything.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nSo then the art was in trouble.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:15.000\nSo I was just like driving home with Aaron and going,\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:19.000\nlike, I feel like all the rich people in the movie\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nall agree that art is valuable\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nand all the poor people were just off camera\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\ngetting shot and blown up.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nAnd all of them were like, fuck art.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nLike, there's a bullet in my brain.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nAnd that's the side I was on.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nBut she twisted that into me being pro-Hitler.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nBecause I was like, he wanted to make a museum.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nHe didn't want to make a museum.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nHe wanted to make a very big Hitler museum.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nThat is not debatable.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nHe declared lots of art degenerate art.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nBut also, there was just also, it was open season,\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nif like Himmler or whoever.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nSo I'm really into such and such an artist.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nThat was for you.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nLike, whether or not that was degenerate or not.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nIt was just basically, let's just go pilfer and loot\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nall of Europe.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nThey stole all the art.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nBut they weren't going to open a museum.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nThey weren't earning it.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nThey were all going to go keep it and hoard it\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nbecause you could equate that to gold.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nWorth money.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\nWorth gold.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:08.000\nYeah.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nAnd that's different from the Vatican Howe.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nWow, you made a leap there, man.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nThat's different from the Louvre Howe.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:20.000\nI mean, why are we all hoard art?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nWe hang it on the wall.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nWe look at it.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nIt's fucking great.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nIt's so valuable.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nWe all agree it's valuable.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nWow, look at this precious thing.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nIt was one of a kind.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nGold is valuable because it's a rare element.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nAluminum is less valuable.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nI would say gold is more arbitrary.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nA value of worth just because it doesn't decay\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nor oxidize or whatever.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nArt you could at least agree on that it has beauty,\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nhas like intrinsic value to whoever.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nBut I don't think that's what they were doing.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nThere's a bunch of asshole German guys going around there\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nand stealing shit that they wanted to belong to.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nI don't think those guys had good taste.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nI think the first person that will tell you that\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nis an artist, someone in art school.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nThey can't wait to tell you what a mediocre artist Hitler was.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nYou know why?\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nBecause otherwise, Hitler's just an artist.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nEveryone's going to tell you what a bad artist Hitler was\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nbecause otherwise you get to go,\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nyeah, you artists, you live in boxes\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nand you eat poop for living,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nbut give you a little bit of power and oh boy.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nThey got to go,\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nHitler doesn't count, Hitler doesn't count.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nIt's really bad at perspective.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nHe was an artist.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nI haven't seen the movie, but there are like,\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nyou see films of like the German museum\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nis like during the Reich and they, you know,\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:33.000\ncleansed Europe or at least Germany of all the degenerate art.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:36.000\nAnd so there's all these galleries full of like Germanic,\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\njust a bunch of like big macho statues\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nand there's no emotion to it.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nIt's just really stark and intimidating.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nMeanwhile, the Nazis that had taste\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nwere scooping up all the Botticelli\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nand all the really good shit,\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nand they were all just taking it like,\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nlike we know that Hitler's not down for this,\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nbut we want a fucking gigantic basement\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:01.000\nfull of the stuff that we know that will always have value, right?\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nYes.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nSo, okay, look, I don't,\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nI probably won't see the movie,\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nis there a way to tell me what happens without spoiling\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nor is that the whole story?\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nHitler loses all his art.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nHe loses all the art.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nAnd we get it all back.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nDo we get it all back?\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nOr is there a bunch of lost?\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nIs there a bittersweet code?\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nWe'll never know what we didn't get back.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nThere's points where they're holding up like burnt frames\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nand it says Picasso on the bottom.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nIt's like we lost a fucking Picasso.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nYeah, but also we lost a bunch of people.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nAnd also like, you know, like, yeah.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nYeah.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nCome on, Colbert and they showed a clip of him and that,\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nDamon talking about how old they were\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nand they're going to go save art paintings.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nIt didn't seem like a good movie.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nIt's, yeah, it's not, it's, it's, it's,\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nthe concept of whether or not a painting\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nis worth more than human life,\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nI think is a very important one\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nand I think that you need to,\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nyeah, I mean, it's just, you need to be cinematic.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nCiscal and Abert wade movies on thumbs\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nand some people wade on stars.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nI feel a more accurate way to measure\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:09.000\na movie's value is through freestyle rapping.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nOkay, look.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nIt was about to rhyme with Rocket.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nI was going to go places.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nAll right, new segment, next segment.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nDo you want a different beat or do you want to stick with that?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nI don't, I'm not in control.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:55.000\nMy new segment is called Ruin It For Me.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nYo, yo, ruin it for me.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nI'm happy about something.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nSee, you're going to come up and ruin it for me.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nOkay, so.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nThat was good.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nFor real, don't base this at what,\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nwe can do a segment later called I want to be on stage.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nAnd I will, we will not punish you\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nfor wanting to be on stage, but for real,\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nlike, if you, if you really think\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nyou can ruin this for me because you've been thinking\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nabout it more than I have, because I heard,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nI saw one paragraph on the internet\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nand I get excited and then I retweet it\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nand then I feel like my job is done\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nand I live in a better world.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nThe gay NFL guy.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nThe guy, we have our first openly gay NFL guy.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nThat's all I know. That's it.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nI know one tweet's worth of information.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nIt's very uplifting to me.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nI would imagine it's very hard to be\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nan openly gay NFL draft pick\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nor whatever the hell he is.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nSounds like our first gay sports corner.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nNo.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nGay sports corner.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nGay sports corner.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nI mean, I want to, yes, and you,\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nbut that's really a derailment.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nBecause the segment is,\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nI'm happy about this current event\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nthat I know one tweet's worth of information about.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nWhat I want is for somebody,\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nbecause I, then I go to bed and I go,\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nyou know, the world's getting better.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nGay rights, it takes a huge leap forward.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nSomebody that's in a position\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nto be nothing but punished for it\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\ncomes out and says,\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nhey, I'm gay, which really is more\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nsymbolic of the fact that, you know what,\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nyour neighbor's probably gay.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nThere's people who aren't admitting it\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nand it's not weird to be gay\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nand I can throw a football or I can catch it\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nor whatever the hell he does in that dumbass sport.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nI'll become open minded about that shit\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:53.000\nand I'll die.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nBecause those guys called me fags\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nfor a long time.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nBut, so that's it, right?\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nI go to bed, I sleep like a baby,\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nbut there's got to be somebody in the room, right,\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nwho can tell me, because this is how it always works,\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nlike you mentioned it at a cocktail party\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nand then somebody goes, yeah, but you know that guy's a pedophile.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nOr that guy, that guy wasn't going to be,\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nhe was the number three draft pick\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nbecause it actually boosted him to number one.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nSo is there anybody here that has\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nlike mitigating information\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:23.000\nto dilute this rainbow of joy?\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:27.000\nHe has a room full of Hitler's art.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nI'll say this, Dan.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nA guy, believe me,\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nI don't know much about it either,\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nbut there's a guy who's going into the draft, right?\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nIs a college player going into the NFL draft\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nand before he got drafted,\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nhe said, also, I'm a homosexual,\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nwhich might make him less marketable\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nbecause coaches are weird about\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nputting distractions as they call it\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nin their locker room.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nThat could be some guys two in the news\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nor two of this or that,\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nand I don't want to fuck up my locker room with this or that.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nOn ESPN news, there were people\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nwho are coaches, who are pundits,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nwho come out and talk about all sorts of issues.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nThey all, like, they were like,\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nwould that be distracting for you?\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nYou were a coach once, or you were a player once,\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nand a lot of people came out\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nand say, because there's certainly no market\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nand say, yeah, I wouldn't want to be in a room with that guy.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nThey don't say that.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nWhat they do is say, well, you know,\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nI do see the side of the locker room.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nYou know, locker rooms, there's lots of different kinds\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nof people in there, different whatever,\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nand it can be a distraction.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nYou're like, you basically just said\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nthat would be a problem for you.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nAnd also, other people have said,\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nso somebody was asked, some player was asked,\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nwhat percentage of NFL players\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\ncurrently do you think are gay?\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nSo anywhere between 5 and 80%,\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nlike, is that zero?\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nWell, that's where this don't ask, don't tell thing.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nWe went through this with the military.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nI think a gay activist,\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\na man would tell, would say,\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nthat was into this, would go,\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nyou know what, it's a fucking distraction\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nfor the parking meter\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nattendant that I'm gay.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nOn some level, like, there's not equality yet.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nLike, somehow, even though\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nI don't have to tell you where I put my dick\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nwhen I look for pleasure,\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nsomehow, it's a straight run society\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nand it's blowing back on me.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nAnd somehow, like,\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nbecause straight people\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\ncan run around high-fiving each other for being straight,\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nyou can put up billboards that have innuendo,\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nlike, hey, come get a bagel,\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nit's kind of like fucking a pussy, right?\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nAnd on some level,\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nlike, starburst commercials,\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nand it's a straight man's world.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nAnd so there's, like,\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\na certain amount of, like,\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nif you come out of the closet\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nand you're in a political position,\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nyou know, it's a risky proposition.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nLike, people, like, Kobe got in trouble\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nfor calling somebody faggot.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nLike, that's something you just, like,\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\ncertain people just say when they get angry.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nI don't know that was necessarily homophobic,\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nwhich is something that certain people just say\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nand people drop n-bombs on each other.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nIt doesn't necessarily mean they're saying that.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nSometimes they do, sometimes they don't.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nBut I would imagine that any sports locker room,\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nwhen you have a bunch of people who aren't necessarily,\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nlike, across the board,\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nlike, PhDs,\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nand they're trained to be really good at one,\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nlike, athletic endeavor,\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nthere's gonna be lots of, like, visceral bullshit,\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nand\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nthey're gonna tease you about anything that you're different at.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nLet's say you read a lot.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nBut using that as a reason to, like,\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nnot draft people, then we have a problem,\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nbecause we have systemic, that's the thing.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nAnd the thing is, because if this guy\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nmade it to the college level,\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nbeing into football and\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nbeing gay...\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nThe reason why it's good for him is because he's, like,\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nI think he's, like, a graduate or some good school\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nor something like that. Like, he's got a shit together\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nand he's, you know, like, he's not just\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nsome any old knucklehead. Like, would you actually have to be a representative?\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nI think it's smart, because what you don't want to do,\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nwhich I think a lot of people, the reason why they can't come out,\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nif you're in a soccer locker room\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nor a football or baseball locker room,\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nand you've been playing with these people for\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\neight years, and you've been\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nin the shower with them for eight years, and you go,\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\noh, by the way, the whole time that we've been doing dick jokes\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nand doing all this, like, grab-assing\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nweird male shit that we all do,\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nI've always been gay the whole time.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nThen you open yourself up to a whole other thing.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nHe's saying, before you draft... Right.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nIf this ruins my career,\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nI want everyone to know, before I go in,\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nI'm gay. Now, currently,\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nmy favorite fucking thing in the world is,\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nand I forget his name, but I love the Winter Olympics\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nand the cat that's gay that calls\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nthe figure skating?\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nWhat's his name? Reed? Weir.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nJohnny Weir? Yeah.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nYeah, John Weir. And he,\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nVladimir Putin's Russia, who has made it\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nvery clear that it's not cool to be gay there,\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nalthough he never has a shirt on,\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nand he's constantly\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nstraddling some sort of beast.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nJohnny Weir comes out dressed\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nlike the fucking, like the\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nEaster Parade every time,\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nand he's just like, hello!\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nAnd he's dressed like Peter Pan,\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nand it's good, and he's got, like,\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:49.000\nhe has the best makeup on, and he couldn't...\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nThere's no way to be gayer than Johnny Weir\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nis right now in Russia. And he's basically\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nsaying, come arrest me on fucking camera,\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nand that's great, because\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nsport has to be full of gay people.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nLike, it has to be full of everything,\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nand I love the fact that\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nRussia was homophobic, or is.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nI'm like, oh, you know, but so is America.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nSo is probably every\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\ngovernment, like, across the board in some ways.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nBut Russia came out and said,\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\ndon't propagandize\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nabout your homosexuality.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nJohn Weir's\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\njust presents in Russia as propaganda, which is\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nawesome.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nDon't propaganda is homosexuality, because\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nwe're all just\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\na tick away from\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\ngoing homo if we see the right poster.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nThey made\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nit really ambiguous, like,\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nno gay propaganda. What does that mean exactly?\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nYeah, you know, don't be gay and be happy.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nAnd they go, just keep it\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\naround. Don't jump around being gay.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nKeep it away from the kids.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nSo if I walk by a child,\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nthey left it pretty fucking loose.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nAll right. Well, so\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nI'm leaving it at that. I'm not going to stretch this out.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nLet's say there's 150 people\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nin this room. I said, ruin it for me. It doesn't sound\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nlike this guy sounds like\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nhe made getting drafted a little more difficult\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nin the 11th hour\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nby doing this amazing thing.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nHe certainly did, because there might be some coaches\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nwho say, I don't want that quote-unquote\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\ndistraction. Because why bother? And you could fall\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nback on, I'm not homophobic, but it's a\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\ndistraction. So he had that\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nhorrible\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nempire of mediocrity working against him.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nWorse than having\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nactive aggression working against him.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nHe had actual just status quo\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nstagnation working against him.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nJust gravity. Let's say\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nyou're a coach of\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nthe Patriots.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nI'll make up a team, like the\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nflim flammers. And\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nyou have a quarterback that is\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nworth all the money in the league. And\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nyou, as a coach, happen to know that this guy\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nis a rampant homosexual. Rampant?\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nRampant.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nAs soon as the lights go down,\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nhe's just\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\ngay bashing.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nWait, is he\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nrampant homophobic or rampant homosexual?\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nI'm sorry, I meant homophobic. Oh, rampant homophobic.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nOkay, that's why.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nRampant homosexual. I'm sorry, I missed\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\ngoing.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nI said rampant, I went and hold a different\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\ndirection. But listen, like you as a coach\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nknow that a certain percentage of your\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nteam are homophobic. Right. And they're\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nworth a zillion dollars. Like, do you want to\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nbring out like a linebacker in who\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\ncauses distress? Capitalism,\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nmediocrity,\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\npath of least resistance, people doing\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nwhat they do, wanting\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\ntoday to be as easy as yesterday.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nThose are the things that heroes rise\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nup against. It's not\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nwhen it's fashionable, not when\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nyou can goad people to throw\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nlettuce at you and somehow\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:41.000\ngarner that into like a murder story,\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nwhich is what I often do in my own little\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nworld. You know, like somebody that\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nrises up and goes like, you know what, I\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\ncould have fucking just hung out forever\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nwith this toupee on. But I'm bald,\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nmotherfucker. I got it.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nMy scalp itches. And\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nactually, it wasn't even about selfishness.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nLike you said, there's a\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\ncourtesy to that to go like, you know\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nwhat, so that seven years later when we\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\ngot our Super Bowl rings, like you, I\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nwant you to have gotten it with a gay\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nguy in the locker room. I don't want\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nthis to be a story that somehow\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nbrings us back down into the gutter\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nabout showers and all this shit.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nAnyways, that's enough of that.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nBut my point wasn't so much\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nabout, you know, we're in L.A., we can\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nlove gay people all we want. But my point\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nwas more like in this age, like you\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nhear these heroic things and like, you\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nknow, there's a spin on them. And then so often\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nlike you read one more paragraph down\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nand you click on one comment in the comment\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nsection, it just starts to fall apart\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nbecause of relativity and all this stuff. But it\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nsounds like a pure hero story.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nAre you hoping that somebody did mitigate\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nthat? No, I'm glad nobody did.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nNo, no wrong answers.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nIf somebody came up and ruined it, that's\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\ngood too. Like, that's\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\ninteresting as well. That would show\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nus that there's no such thing as\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nfucking heroes. Like, would Julian Assange\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nlike get\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\ntangled up in some weird sexual stuff\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nor Martin Luther King, like\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nthe first thing they go after is his\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\ncrotch, you know, because he's causing\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\ntrouble. Like, maybe what we need\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nto learn is that we're not supposed to be\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nlooking for these non-human people.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nJust so happens that this guy sounds\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nlike inhumanly awesome. Alright,\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nenough of that. Whatever his name is, and he plays\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\na dumb sport, so he's a fucking idiot.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nAnd\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nthat is a prejudice I will go to\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nmy grave with. And that segment\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nis called Burying the Lead.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nThat's why\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nI was especially inspired by it because it\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nmeans that people can do heroic things even\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nif they're so not bright that they play\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nfootball for their whole lives.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nI think that's inspiring that lizard people\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\ncan also be\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nheroic.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nI'm making, I'm kidding.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nI'm sure there's great football players out there.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nCome on the show, we'll talk to you.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nWe'll have a special microphone that picks up\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\non whatever wavelengths you speak in.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nIt won't block\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:03.000\nthe pathway through your mouth so you can breathe.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nI'm kidding.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nI'm kidding. I'm kidding.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nHow good do you think you would be,\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nthe world's greatest interviewer,\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nhow good do you think you would be with a\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nfamous, highly educated, black, gay,\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nNFL draftee?\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\nThat sounds kind of awesome.

I'm almost willing to forgive him\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nfor playing football.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nI would\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nlove to talk\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nto him about, I mean, how do you...\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nSo now that he's black, you want him on the show?\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nHe's not a lizard man anymore?\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nNo, I would have wanted to talk to him no matter\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nwhat his race was.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nAnd that's on the record.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nNo, but come on.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nFuck you. I'm not apologetic about my glee\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nabout wanting people\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nwho have reasons to be afraid\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nbeing not afraid.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nI think that's\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nfucking amazing.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nAnyways, let's\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nspeaking of being afraid and being activated\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nand all kinds of stuff, I want to move forward.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nWe got\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\na guest tonight\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nthat I mentioned last week because I felt like\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nlast week I complained about Uber.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nI complained about\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nI don't know how hard it is for me to scratch my ass\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nand jerk off into a laptop.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nThe theme last week was\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nkind of like\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nwas sort of like\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nit was first world problems\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nto be sure. And I'm not ashamed\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nof that. I'm in the first world. I have problems.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nI'm not going to...\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nBut I also kind of came to this epiphany\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nduring that as I have often like, yeah, but\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nI'm 41.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nI don't give a shit. I got to start figuring out\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nthe world. But I don't believe in politics.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nI don't buy into the liberal versus conservative shit.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nI think that\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nthe fucking government is an asshole\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nand people who aren't systems aren't assholes.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nAnd so the thing that really appeals to me at a blush\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nthat I know nothing about\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nis this concept of net neutrality.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nAnd I happen to know through Aaron\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nthis net neutrality activist.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nAnd his name is Eddie Geller and he's here.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nThank you.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nSit anywhere you like.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nThank you. Thank you so much.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nIt's my favorite part of the show. I get to sit down.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nPerfect.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nAlright, so I purposely didn't research\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nbecause that's my passion is for doing nothing.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nI know for sure\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nthat the words net neutrality\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nmean that the internet\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nis a perfect place where everybody can do\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nwhatever the hell they want.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nAnd that must mean that there's some FCC\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\ntypes coming and got in for us that are trying\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nto make sure that there's some kind of law\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\ngoing down the road that's going to protect\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nthe interests of corporations and things\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nand ultimately marginalize the poor. Do you take it from there?\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nYes. You pretty much nailed it.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nSo net neutrality is essentially\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nthe default way that we think about the internet\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nthat you're free to go anywhere\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nand go to any sites\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nand anyone who starts a website\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\ncan get to you. It's this free flow of information.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nAnd so the reason\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nnet neutrality has been in the news\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nis because the government agency\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nthat oversees this, the FCC\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nhad these net neutrality rules\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nthat they made in 2010. They said\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nalright, if you are a Comcastier or Time Warner\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nyou can't fuck with people's internet.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nYou have to let them go where they want.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nAnd those rules just got tossed out\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nin the DC circuit court.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nSo now it's like\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nwhen the internet first started\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nwe kind of had some net neutrality rules\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nand then those got\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nderegulated and we were in this\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nWild West for a little bit and then these\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nnew net neutrality rules\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nand I apologize that this is a little\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\ngoes a little in the weeds, but these\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nnewer net neutrality rules which were kind of a half\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nmeasure got thrown out. So we're back in the Wild West.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nSo right now it's an open table?\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nYeah, it's essentially\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nanything could happen, but these\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nIn Deadwood you've got your Hearst\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nmoving into town. He's\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nthere, he's got his resources\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nbut they've also got your\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nswear engines and your other people\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nlike whoever shoots who first.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nExactly. Well and the other\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nthing that happened this week is\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nComcast is attempting to buy Time Warner Cable.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nSo Comcast is the biggest\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nprovider of internet and TV\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\ntrying to buy the second biggest\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nprovider and so\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nwe're talking about a giant\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nmega corporation that has\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nenormous control over everyone's communications.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nSo everyone, remember\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nwhen you seem a little younger than me\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nwhen I was a lad\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nthat phrase Time Warner\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\ndidn't exist. There was a\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\ntime and there was a Warner Brothers.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nRight, right. And now\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nComcast is going to merge with Time Warner.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nYeah, that's what they're going to try and do and so\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nthis is and so net neutrality\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nactivists such as myself, we see\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nthis is a terrible thing.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nWe don't need less companies\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nin control of our communications.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nSo when we talk about being in control because\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nwhere now I went I went to\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nEurope recently and I was in a hotel\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nroom and there was like a way for me to get\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nI could get free internet. It was free\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nWi-Fi that seemed to be somehow in\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nthe ether almost like a kind of ether\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\ninternet.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nI didn't have to give a credit card number\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nI could get on the internet by putting\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nI think I had to put my email address or something like that\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nbut it was certainly and I don't know how I\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nfound this out but the porn was definitely\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nblocked like it was a it was sort\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nof like a it was sort of like a Disney\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\ndisneyfied like that of internet\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nthat is that\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nthe world that was like like when we\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\ntalk about companies like Comcast\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nand Warner Cable because they offer\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\ncable internet is the idea that\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nthey're going to offer\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nthey think that they see a world\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nwhere internet is like cable yes and\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nthat they're they can offer\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nthese sort of packages right and this\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nyou know that they that they\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\ncan make their content go\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nfaster and run better\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nfor you at home and then other people\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nyou know smaller websites or\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nother people making content are going\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nto you know have a second-class internet.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nSo you go to the president's website who's telling you\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nhey it's I'm the president I had\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nan Easter egg roll and a car wash and\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nI love guns or I hate guns and in either\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\ncase like fucking pay attention to me and it's like\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nwhoosh comes through you at maximum\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nbandwidth and then you go to a GeoCities\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\npage where someone's like fuck the president\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nfuck the government they all governments\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nyou can't read the first three words\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nit's slowly loading\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nyeah yeah exactly and that actually something\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nlike that actually happened in Canada where\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nthis telecom had\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nits union was striking against them and\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nso the telecom blocked the\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nthe website to the union so it's\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nyou know it it's like we see these\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nlittle things that are that are fucked up and it's\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nnot all going to happen tomorrow it's like tomorrow the internet\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nis not going to all be this like dire situation\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nbut these are the things they're capable\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nof doing but we might as well be talking about\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\ntelegraph neutrality\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nor telephone telephonic neutrality\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nwhich are a lot that you said the\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nFCC is involved the FCC\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nshouldn't even fucking exist anymore\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nbecause the insane thing is that the\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nreason they existed this is me going back\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nto my freshman year communications\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nclass but what I understand\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nabout the FCC is that\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nthe reason they exist is because\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nthere was this thing called radio\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nand we just invented it\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nand we thought that it was like a big\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\npie and each\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nslice was a frequency and you could\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nwell we need the government's help\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nso that everyone can have radio\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\neveryone gets a slice and we got to make\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nsure that nobody gets too big\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\na slice or that there's not enough slices\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nblah blah blah cut to\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nthese people telling you that the\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nJanet Jackson's titty is offensive\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nduring the Super Bowl it makes no sense\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nit has nothing to do with anything because far\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nsince the FCC was established we found\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nout that there's no such thing as limitations\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\non frequency\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nit doesn't matter\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nbut the thing about government is\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nthat God bless them they're only trying\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nto help probably usually but they\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nnever fucking go away\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nonce they're around they never go away\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nand I'm not being a libertarian by saying that\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nI'm just being a human being that's saying\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nonce you invite these guys into your life\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nand they start telling you\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nlike no one's ever\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\ngoing to have a meeting where they go so that's it\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nFCC's finished huh\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nall in favor no more\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nFCC\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nit never happens so they're still around\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nand it doesn't like why are they still around\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nwell no and I think like stuff like\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nthe you know the Janet Jackson\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nnipple thing is is ridiculous but\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nthere is also a school of thought which I\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nyou know subscribed to which is like\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nin an ideal world we want\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nsomeone like the FCC\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nto say that these\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nComcast of the World cannot work\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nbut you made it sound like they were protecting us in an ironic twist\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nyeah well I mean\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\non the internet so it's like you know the FCC\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nhas sort of a wide\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\npurview of things they do and so\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nthe hope would be that on the grounds of the internet\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nthat they would tell these\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nyou know these huge corporations that you cannot\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nfuck with people's access right\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nand that I mean and that's a totally different story\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nthan you know Janet Jackson's nipple\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nyou know this is you know clearly two different\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nthings but I totally get your point\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nright right alright so let's\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nset up the chess board right now and hopefully\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nyou can explain it to me like where the pawns are\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nwhere the kings are etc we've got all of us\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nwho don't give a shit about anything\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nwho would never impinge on anyone's right to do anything\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\neveryone listening to me\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\neveryone in this room every human being\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nthat was born with a beating heart we've got\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nall those people now\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nnow we've got those people all like\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\ndone deal no one's ever gonna fucking\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nvote for anything or\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\ndo anything unless they're operating on some kind of weird\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nagenda now so\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nnow let's bring in the corporations what\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nwhat what what is their\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nrelationship with the government in all of this\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nthey well so if\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nif the FCC\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nI'll go back to that for a second if the FCC actually\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nwanted to do something wanted to be really\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\ngood and go back to regulating the internet\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nthe way it had been when it first\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nstarted and really like put the hammer down\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nthen what would happen is these\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\ncorporations who have enormous lobbying\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\npower would actually tell\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\ncongress to be like cut the funding\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nfor the FCC not necessarily destroy it\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nbut you know\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\ndeplete it severely so I mean\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nthere's so much power and they have\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nso much influence lobbying not only congress people\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nbut going to the FCC and lobbying\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nthe people who work over there so I mean\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nit's a gigantic\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nI mean there's no two ways now my brain's a\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nbecause I'm really realizing the extent to which I\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nstarted babbling about the FCC and how it should go\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nfucking something you're like the biggest\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nfan because it's like the government is\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nlike like the only recourse of us being\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nlike a European nation where it's like they're\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nI know nothing about this what's the\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\ndanger that they will actually control certain content\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nbased on like if Fox\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\ncontrols Comcast or whatever that they\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nwant to control certain like political\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\ncontent or well they'll be\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nI mean we'll go ahead oh well\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nthat well the fears that\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nComcast would you know\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nprioritize their own content\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nand block and slow down content that's not\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nthere were you talking about that or the FCC\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nI mean I was going to like an Orwellian\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nkind of like well I'm\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nI'm all in for Orwellian\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nphysically geographically let's\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nlook at it like a map of the city and let's pretend\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nthat the internet is traffic\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nyeah like it's the streets it's the\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\ninfrastructure okay so I think that's why you're\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nsaying the FCC needs to be involved\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nbecause the government needs to be involved in which\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nlights turn green at which time right and which\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nwhether which streets are widened which are not\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nand if you if you privatize\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nthe city streets then\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nthe the\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\npinkberry\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nis going to go okay where are you going\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nyou're going over to mom\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\npops\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nat rush hour and you know what we got to close\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nthat street down anyway it's like you know\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nexactly we're giving\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nprivatizing things that everyone uses\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nis never a good idea\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nI'll go out on a limb here be\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nin health education so where do we stand right now\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nare we in some sort of crisis right now like\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nis it like is it we in the balance\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nright well yeah we're it's kind of precarious\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nright now so the FCC\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nis you know it is saying actually\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nnow that these rules have been thrown out they're\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nconsidering what they're going to do next they say\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nthey still care about net neutrality\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nthough the new head of the SEC\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nis a former communications lobbyist\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nwhich shouldn't surprise anyone that\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nthat's pretty much our government works but the hope\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nis that you know I\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nit's we were talking in the back about\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nhow you know hopeless this might\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nbe and you know that might\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nbe true but like it that you know\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nactivists you know people I work\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nwith you know it's like our only thing it's like\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nwell we gotta fucking do something like even if\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nit's a petition and we have to like\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nyou know go down to DC and yell at these\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\npeople you know what we're\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nsaying in the green room was\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nlike like cuz kumail said like man\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nyou guys gotta I mean it's stuff so important\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nand then everyone has such a short attention span\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nyou guys got to call it change it from net neutrality\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nto like butt fun or something\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nthat's like yeah but like\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nlike the real danger the real\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nproblem is that like we\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nwe're competing with people who work\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nlegislatively bureaucratically\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\ntheir joy in life is to\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nhang out push buttons yes no\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nvote on this I believe in this system\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nI'm the thing the problem\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nis that the beating heart of humanity the\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nregular person who just wants to\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nhang out and live their life pursue their happiness\n\n39:43.000 -->

--> 40:41.000\nChristian Slater supposed to come along\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nand save us from all that like\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nwe got by pumping up the volume\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nare you talking about gleaming the\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\ncube I don't know which Christian Slater\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nmove I mean I'm saying some he's supposed to

owns\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nthe internet the like\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nfor a long time the answer has been kind of\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nup in the air and what we\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\ndon't want is for that to have an answer\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\never right the way that\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nwe kind of didn't want\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nlike the days of manifest destiny\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nit was like okay we're\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nwe're just gonna we're gonna make a nation and then\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nit was a war between the people who wanted one\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nbig old country and the people who wanted each state\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nto be independent and then we we get tricked\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\ninto thinking that we have to choose between one\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\ngood guy one bad guy and it's like they're all\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\na bunch of fucking politicians

41:43.000\nthat so in Iceland there's a politician\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\ncalled Jan Narn\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nhe was a comedian and he started\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nthis joke party called the best party\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nand they promised like free towels\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nand that they would listen to women\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nand like\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nand just like\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nlike making free towels\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nand so crazy\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nit started off as this joke and then\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nbecame like a real thing and he actually got\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nattention and became the mayor of Iceland\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nand so that's and our because it continued to be\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nentertaining right exactly the way walking\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\ndead does the way the way true\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\ndetective does the way\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nlike we've got a nation of people who can\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nagree on one thing for sure you got our\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\ndevotion if it suits\n\n42:21.000 -->

that like I\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nthank the crowd for being in it for this\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nwonky sort of discussion but that\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nno they like listening they're into it\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nif they're not fuck them\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nbut I think I mean like I hate to sound\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nthick about this but I'm not sure what I'm\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nsupposed to be afraid of right now the government or the corporations\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nwe're gonna figure something out we don't have to\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nfigure out today what am I supposed to be\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nwhere am I supposed to aim my BB gun\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nyou should be you should be for net neutrality\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nI certainly am but I don't\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nI don't know who I'm what building\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nI'm supposed to go toilet paper right now\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nwell I mean it I think\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nif you know the corporations\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nI hate to sound so simplistic would be the\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nbad guys in the situation and if you're\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nan average citizen then you are hopefully\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\ntelling the FCC telling your representative\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nthat you want net neutrality\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nand you know you're trying to counterbalance\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nyou're saying the head of the FCC is a former\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nlobbyist he is but I mean\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nyou know if they only hear one\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nside you know then we're doubly\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nfucked and so it's like\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nyes the system is totally\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nyou know\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nyou know going against us but like you know we\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nwe go and we yell at them\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nwhen we can but isn't the internet punk rock\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nenough like when they came after Napster we\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nwe all used to a long time ago\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\ngo get music for free and then that\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\npeer-to-peer stuff we all used to get whatever we wanted\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nthen that became illegal then gradually we all\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nokay fuck it iTunes 99 cents\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nthen Spotify comes along there's a way to monetize\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nthat and we pay for that it always seems like\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nthe internet finds a way to make it egalitarian\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nand to make it\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nlike freebie and sexy\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nand punk rock wouldn't like aren't\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nthere enough cool like a revolutionary\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nwe're talking about the actual structure of the internet\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nyes I'm saying is there no way\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nto get underneath that and to subvert\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nthat or no I mean there are people who talk\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nabout that and but\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nit's not something that\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\none should count on or\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nlooks like it would be any sort of viable\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\noption I mean actually where it sounds like the only\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nheroes right now that you can actually\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nrely on are the hackers are the anonymous\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\npeople\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nthat the people who are simply anarchists are\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nsimply in favor of subversion and\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nof course you can't rely on them to\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nto do anything but corrode\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nwhich is what I want them to do if there were ever\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nanother revolution like in the\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nway that we revolted against\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nthe English and the way\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\ncertain countries revolt against empires\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nthe next revolution would have\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nto be like an information one\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nwould have to be it wouldn't it wouldn't be a country\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nagain I mean there's\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\ncertainly there was there was there was still be countries that revolt\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nagainst their imperial masters but\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nthe next one would have to be us revolting\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nagainst a\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\na control like\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nthat I feel like it's going to be lead pipes\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nin the street because of information\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nwell yeah well because like when there are\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nriots and you know people people go\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nprotest against the you know the world trade\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\norganization

switch off our\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nfucking funds there we will have to revert\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nto lead pipe technology because that's all\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nwe have in our fingertips yeah and\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nwe won't know how to fucking make a lead pipe\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nbecause we won't be able to google how to make\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nlead pipes so google\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nit now\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nprint it out that's what we're saying\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nlike I\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nwant I mean I don't want to live in a time\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nwhere there is revolution because upheavals a bummer\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nand everybody starts 40 year olds yeah\n\n45:47.000

been\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\na revolution in the last\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\ncentury because we're all the beneficiaries\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nof incredible robots\n\n45:59.000 -->

nerdy\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nneutrality I don't I mean it's obviously\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nsomething to hold on to\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nbut it just doesn't I think people see that

a notoriously\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nhomophobic environment like the NFL comes out\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nand does that before he's even in like going through the draft\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\nsure his career his\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nlivelihood the things he's worked most of his life\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\ntoward is jeopardized\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nby him saying that that's awesome\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nI don't know what's at stake for an actress\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nI think it's gonna be hard for her to get\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\npopular I think it's gonna get harder\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nI hope it doesn't\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nI hope so too\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nI don't know what the actual ramifications\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nwell I also don't want to live in a world\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nwhere she has to sit and think about whether or not\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nshe's famous enough or high stakes enough\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nto be\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nI don't know what I was gonna say\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nwhat I wasn't saying is that it merits\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\npress conference status now\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nwe have to come out\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nand all the fucking floodlights\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nhave to be under and go here everybody\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nalright ok\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nok gay gay gay\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\npeople like to get into a big crisis for everybody\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nit's insanity\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nI said this on Twitter but I feel like\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nat some point we're gonna live in a world where just saying who you\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nare isn't like a brave political statement\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nyou know\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:08.000\nWe'll get there if people stop wearing hairpieces and stop having implants and stop being ashamed of what they are.\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:09.000\nI felt like an asshole for watching.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:12.000\nI flipped by her press conference she was talking about.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.000\nNot against her or against what she's doing.\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:15.000\nWho gives a shit?\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nWhy is this a fucking story?\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:18.000\nIt's crazy.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:23.000\nBut it's a story because it needs to be a story so that it's not a story in the future.\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:30.000\nI'm just saying, let's fucking grow up as a country or as a world. Let's get past it.\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:34.000\nThat's why I love Johnny Ware for fucking dressing up like an absolute...\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:38.000\nBut what also sucks is that he can do it in Russia but nobody else can.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nIs there on cameras?\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:44.000\nIt'll be funny the day some thresholds that we cross don't feel like thresholds.\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:47.000\nLike the space program when it's like, okay, we've been exploring space so long.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:54.000\nRemember in Apollo 13, there's that sad scene where they're like, they're not on TV right now.\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:57.000\nThey think they're on TV but they're not on TV because you know why?\n\n59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nBecause we're so fucking good at exploring space that as a species we've succeeded at something.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nI just hope we get a female...\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nThere will come a point where there will be some actor.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nLadies and gentlemen, daytime Emmy winner Kyle Flanagan.\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nI'm gay.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nAnd you hear one picture.\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nIt's like his mom.\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nI always knew you could do it.\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nThere it is, the non-shot herd not around the world for gayness.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nWe are officially equal with gays.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nIt doesn't matter anymore because it's important is my point.\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nWe shouldn't bully people for being gay.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nWe're not really allowed to because if Tom Cruise came out tomorrow,\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nit would be a big fucking deal.\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nAnd he hasn't yet.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nAnd the fact that he hasn't yet is important.\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nAnd since he's not going to yet,\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nif eight people underneath him that equal one Tom Cruise underneath him all come out...\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nThere's been so much denial for a lot of people through a lot of culture\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nthat now the guy that didn't say eight years ago when he went into the first locker room with his NFL teammates,\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nnow that's weird to do it.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nLike at some point when you've just denied it for your whole life, it's heroic.\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nPeople go, look, guess what everybody, I'm coming clean.\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nThat's fucking awesome.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nI just wish that, like we're saying, that wasn't the top story.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nThere are also then what 10 years after that, after we achieved that fucking high watermark of like,\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nit doesn't matter if you're where you put your wiener,\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nthere will be a guy who's like, you know what, I don't know where I want to put my wiener.\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nPut a label on that.\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nCall it asexual, call it still figuring it out, leave me alone.\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nThen that guy will be a hero.\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nAs long as there's a status quo, there's going to be people who are heroic for confronting it\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nuntil we get to the point where we're all actually just honest with each other,\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nuntil we're not hiding things from each other,\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nbecause only then will we be truly different from the animals that we descended from.\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nWe are such political mammals.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nWe invented it so when we were like these squirrel creatures,\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nand we are shaking that legacy.\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nI feel like it's like we're constantly in a battle with ourselves\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nover whether or not we're going to become insectoid or gods.\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nAnd I don't know which is worse or which is better.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nWhat turns us into great people with almond eyes that are floating them through the cosmos,\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nseeking other people's DNA so they can splash themselves with some genetic compari.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nI don't know, but I know that right now, it's not a great idea to lobby for borgness.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nI get bummed out when people are offended by everything,\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nlike, let's all be perfect and run, Mary.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nBut I also got a high five people who in the face of all of this chaos,\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nthey rise up against the immediate things that make it difficult for them to...\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nFor me, the big problem is whenever I turn the TV on and I'm watching anything,\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nthere's commercials for me, and now we get to fast-forward to everything.\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nCommercials are broken up between...\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nMostly for me, insurance commercials are a lot of insurance, lots of insurance commercials.\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nBut then, more and more, it's like, I'm a truck guy.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nYou know, truck guys.\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nLike, I was like, fucking stop it with a truck.\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nIf you call yourself a truck guy, go fuck off.\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nI don't know what that means.\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nYou turn it into a culture of identifiers.\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nThere's a genre of commercial right now.\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nI was just, truck guy.\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nOkay.\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nWell, that's what manhood, they're trying to...\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nBecause it's sort of changing, what being a man is, is changing, the more sort of sensitive,\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nless aggressive alpha men are sort of...\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nYou know, that's who we're seeing in movies and stuff, too.\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nAnd so I think that's like a reaction to that.\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nLike, remember the good old days?\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000\nYou had a truck and you'd fuck it every morning and that was...\n\n01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nI think that's what it is.\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nLook at my huge dick.\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nIt's got so much room in it.\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nIt's the first one-year-old, as she will say.\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nIt's the first one-year-old, as she will say.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nIt's the first one-year-old, as she will say.\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nIt is.\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nIt's only...\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nI will say that's been going on forever.\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nIt's 2014 that's been going on since the 70s.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nLike, men have that...\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nWe do that the same way politicians do it to us.\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nPoliticians convinces that there's a left and a right so that they can fuck around with us forever\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nbecause there's only rich and poor.\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nMen say that there's such a thing as feminism and there's such a thing as masculinity\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nso that we can constantly go back and forth between being Alan Alda\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nand then going like,\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nFuck it, I fuck it though, it's a guy thing, we've been doing it since the 70s.\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nThat's as far back as I can go.\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nI'm assuming we've been doing that since 6000 BC.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nI don't think we're ever gonna...\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nLike, that's a fucking dodge.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nLike, that culture.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nLike, we have like these belushies that are like out there going like speaking for us\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nand going like,\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nReal men don't apologize.\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nI'll fuck a quiche.\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nI'm gonna come on Tim Allen's forehead or whatever the...\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nAnd then we sit around and we go like,\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nOh, fuck those guys, I wanna...\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nI'm metrosexual, I'm gonna...\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nYou last on the fuck a quiche?\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nI last on to coming on Tim Allen's forehead.\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nYeah, I'm not sure how that's masculine,\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nbut I assume that those guys like they, you know,\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nOh, come on my forehead, that's all we have left.\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nI got off on a tear.\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nI just didn't want to let men off the hook for a second there\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nbecause it was like the idea that recently there's some kind of like big volcanic\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000\neruption of like masculine backlash.\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nThat backlash has been there since forever.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nI think it's a cyclical thing that we're returning to kind of a caveman-y kind of...\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nLike, it's okay to have Dennis...\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nWhat's his name? Dennis Leary?\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nLeary?\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nLike be the voiceover.\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nHey, look at that.\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nThe torque's on the truck.\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nThe torque is what turns...\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nTorque, let me break it down for you.\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nIt's what makes this beer cap come off your bottle.\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nLike, that's what they're fucking selling a truck to.\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nOoh, is that how... is that what torque is?\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nLike, we're returning to the idea that let's get back to the good old days.\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nBut just know when you say returning, you imply movement.\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nWe all agree there's no movement happening, right?\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nThere's stagnation. That's it.\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nNo, I think we're moving.\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nThere's a tube projecting fucking images into our living room.\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nSure, but we're changing.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nI think what it means to be a man, I think, is different from, you know, ten years ago.\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nAnd I think we're sort of a step in the right direction.\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nTo the extent that it's not regulated by either corporations or the government.\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nLike, this internet thing happened, and we all kind of like...\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nThere's been this burst of actual culture developing.\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nLike, we're kind of like...\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nSure, yeah.\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nI would say that, bringing it back around to,\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nwhat the hell are we going to do about this?\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nEddie Geller says...\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nWhat are we going to do about that?\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nWe should go suck off this guy that works at the FCC.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nWhat do we do about it?\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nOh, that's not me. Sorry.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nI got that in my head.\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nI think it's just like, you know, it's tough, because I...\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nWe also have such short attention spans.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nLike, I was talking about this, like, remember a week ago,\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nwe all had strong opinions on Woody Allen,\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nand now nobody's talking about it anymore.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nRight, no, and that's definitely true.\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nBut it's also cyclical, like, you know, net neutrality was a big thing.\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nLike, it first popped up in 2006, and then...\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nSoap and stuff, right, yeah.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nYou know, so, you know, it does pop up again when, you know,\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nthe news finds it, you know, interesting enough to cover.\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nAnd I think, you know, just to be having this conversation,\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nyou know, is worthwhile, and that might sound like not enough, but...\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nFor real, though, that's the important thing.\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nWhat do you tell the 15-year-old kid who's listening right now\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nwho shouldn't be, by the way?\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nBut, like, he's listening.\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nHe's like, you know what, I'm going to dip my toe into this big world,\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nand I'm going to start... I'm going to become a rebel.\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nI'm going to become an activist.\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nLike, how can you tell this kid, like, like...\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nEven what should he Google?\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nWhat should he start reading about?\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nGee, sorry.\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nWell, there's... I'm actually about to start working for an organization\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000\ncalled Demand Progress, which was started by Aaron Schwartz,\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nthe activist who, about a year ago, took his life.\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nSo that's a great organization that I'll shell for,\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nbecause they are about to hire me.\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nWhat was he an activist for?\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nHe was an activist for these same sorts of things from the Internet.\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nBy the way, it gives me... It makes me feel...\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nIt gives me no hope that the guy fighting for this was like,\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nfuck it, I'm going to kill myself.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nWell, he... It's kind of a complicated story, but he had...\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nThat's terrifying.\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nWell, he was actually...\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nSo he was charged with stealing these journalistic articles\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nhe was downloading from MIT.\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nIt's like a very... It's a big can of worms,\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nbut he did not, you know, to the best of my knowledge,\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nyou know, take his own life because of this fight.\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nBut yeah, so there are organizations.\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nLike, if you're someone who's like,\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nyeah, fuck it, I'll click this petition, I'll sign it,\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nthen yeah, you can find an organization like Demand Progress.\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nDo those really make a difference\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nthose petitions that you sign online?\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nYou know, they imbue these organizations\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nthat are working their ass off with a little bit of credibility.\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nBecause if you're going to a congressman,\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nyou're going to the FCC, and you have, you know,\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000\n100,000 petitions, then you're at least bringing something to the table.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nAnd that does mean something to them?\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nYeah, it does. If you have enough of them en masse,\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nit's a place to start, even if it's not...\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nYou're not going to sign something and, you know,\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\ngive us net neutrality tomorrow,\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nbut you will be helping the people who are, you know,\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nworking to make this, you know, make these things better.\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nYou're saying the least you can do\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nis sign one of these online petitions?\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nI think if you're listening and you're like,\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nwhat's the least I can do, then yeah.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nYou know, when a petition comes across your Facebook page\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nand you see it on Twitter, you know,\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000\ntake the 30 seconds, fill it out,\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nand you know, give these organizations...\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nCan we sign 100,000 cars and flip them over?\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nIt's just, you know...\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nAnd I think to be angry.\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nI think just to have some latent anger\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nfor when the, you know, fat butt party comes along,\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nand you're like, yeah, these...\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nI love these guys.

01:10:58.000\nIt's weird, man.\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nMaking for a veritable birth-to-palooza.\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nA kind of burning birth.\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nCan I mention how Anatoli's look is really coming along, huh?\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nWell, he's really committing to something right now.\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nHe's really committing to something right now.\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nHe's like a Roy Orbison.\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nCan I describe...\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nI want to describe her people sitting beyond row two.\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000\nCan you stand up and just sort of show...\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nLike,

right?\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nYeah, he's got an old-school Walkman.\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nSo you're like Don Cheadle in Boogie Nights.\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nYou're in search of an identity every...\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nYeah, he's got big 70s glasses on, long 70s hair.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nHe looks like he might possibly either be Crosby Stills or Nash.\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nYeah.\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nWhat's crazy is he hasn't even gotten to the mustache yet.\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nLook at that mustache.\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nI mean, this might be cynical of me,\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nbut I feel like this whole Russian Winter Games has gone to your head\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nand I totally...\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nYou've gone mad with Russian pride right now\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nand you feel like you can get away with anything.\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nYeah, you don't look like a little kid\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000\nin the 70s had to draw a grown-up man.\n\n01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nI think you guys are connecting the Russian dot too much.\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nHe came out here to be a director.\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nRemember, we've been with Anatoly since his birth as a character.\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000\nOh yeah, that's it.\n\n01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nI'm the character.\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nHe's like, I'm here to be a director\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nand we were like, do you watch TV?\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nNo.\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nDo you?\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nNothing.\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nHe just wants to be a director.\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nHe's titling into...\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nThis is what directing is, as far as I know.\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000\nHe's directing himself.\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000\nThat's what you've got to do, you've got to look like a director.\n\n01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nBut he's a director from the 70s for certain, right?\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nYeah, he's got to work his way up to the present.\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nNo, in the 70s, they were dressed like Roman Togas and stuff.\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nThey had to do whatever they could to stick out.\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nHe's an Italian director from the 60s, maybe.\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nOr at least George Landis.\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nJohn Landis.\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nJohn Landis.\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nOr George...\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nI combined George Lucas and John Landis.\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nOh, wow.\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nAnd to one super 80s director.\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nOne day we're all going to be working for Anatoly, kind of.\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nAnatoly, what tape is in your Walkman?\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nIt's...\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nSo, Polpina buys the kinks?\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nThe kinks.\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nOh, the kinks.\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nWell done.\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nYeah, see?\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nHe's going to get by...\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nIt's that Schrab thing.\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nHe's going to get by and just fucking weird shit.\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nMeanwhile, I fucking slave over a keyboard.\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nFade in.\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nFade in on what, Anatoly?\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nYou don't know.\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nUntil I tell you.\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nBecause I'm a writer.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nYou know what I dress like?\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nBuck Henry.\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nI dress like your dad, motherfucker.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nBecause I'm proud of it.\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nI'm an old bitch.\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nLike your dad.\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nYou just call all their dads old bitches.\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000\nLook, if they're writers, I don't know.\n\n01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nWhenever.\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nMy dad's an old bitch.\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nFucking writers.\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000\nUnappreciated.\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nBringing it back to that Hitler thing.\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nAlthough, in the green room I was like,\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nI was just kidding.\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000\nIt's just funny to me that I watched this movie\n\n01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000\nthat was kind of made by George Clooney\n\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nand kind of gave me the misimpression\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nthat Hitler loved art.\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nEveryone loves art.\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nLike, hey, I know that's not the impression he wanted to give.\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nSo I was just making that joke,\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nand I liked to step on the gas and go like,\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nyeah, Hitler loved art.\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nHe's an artist.\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nI'm like, Hitler wasn't a writer.\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000\nAnd then someone goes, mind comp much?\n\n01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nSpreckenzie mind comp.\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nHe's arguably a more famous and worse writer than, yeah.\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nArguably more famous than you?\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nI didn't say than me.\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000\nThen he was an artist.\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nOh, sure.\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000\nYeah, no, his book certainly had more of an impact\n\n01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nthan his art did.\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nYeah, well, yeah.\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000\nThe writing he did,\n\n01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nwe bring up more than the art he did.\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nYou really thought I was going to,\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nall right, Hitler is arguably a more famous writer than me.\n\n01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nI'm kind of begrudgingly giving him that.\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000\nBut he wasn't that good.\n\n01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nYou should date line Hollywood.\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000\nHow's it going, Spencer?\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nWhy did I get brought up here?\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nHow's it going?\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nHave you had a fun week?\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000\nI was just sitting somewhere else earlier.\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nDid you just say why did I get brought up here?\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000\nYeah, that was kind of weird, right?\n\n01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nSpencer's murder complex.\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nI don't, drives me nuts.\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000\nI just do what you guys tell me to.\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nI brought him up and then we didn't talk to him for a 10 minutes.\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000\nI know, that's what we always do.\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nWe did aggressively.\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nOkay, fine.\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000\nIt's cool.\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nJust don't bring me up.\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000\nI'll watch from the back.\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000\nWe will not bring you up.\n\n01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nAll right.\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nProblem solved.\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nNo taken.\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nThe guy, he hates to be brought up.\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nNo, he wants to be brought up,\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000\nbut he wants to be addressed like a human being when he's up here.\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nWe brought him up and we ignored him for 10 minutes.\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000\nNo, we talked to him.\n\n01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000\nWell, for a moment.\n\n01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nYeah, we sang happy birthday for you motherfucker.\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000\nAnd then you brought out Dustin.\n\n01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000\nWe changed the words.\n\n01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nYeah, happy birthday.\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000\nYou brought out Dustin who got exquisite lighting on my dad.\n\n01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nI think, I think.\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000\nAnd then.\n\n01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nAnd then.\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nIt's his actual birthday.\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nAnd then you pivoted into this Anatoly.\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nI would say there's a G.I.\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nAnatoly dressed up like a porn star.\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nYeah, he looks like my dad.\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nYeah, holy shit.\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nLook at him.\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nI'm not complaining about any of the things.\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nYou're absolutely complaining.\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nYou said, don't bring me up.\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nThat's a complaint.\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nYeah.\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nThat's an absolute complaint.\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nThat's an actual complaint.\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nDon't bring me up and then do that.\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000\nThat's a complaint.\n\n01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nYou can talk about Anatoly at length and then bring me up afterwards.\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nI did.\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nYeah.\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nNot in that order.\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000\nThat's amazing that I'm being told what I can't do.\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nI'm not telling you anything.\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nWhat's the name of the show, Spencer?\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nHarmontown.\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nI think it's two things.\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nSpencer is laid back and there's a geography thing where he literally is in the shadows\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nway offstage to the right.\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000\nI work.\n\n01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nHe's sitting down lower.\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.500\nEven if he was sitting up on stage, he probably wouldn't insert himself a lot, but he would\n\n01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:17.000\nbe more included in the conversation because you're physically then not aimed at him.\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nI think it's easy to not include somebody that's sitting physically way off of the stage.\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nI don't need to be included.\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nI just don't want to be brought up and then explicitly excluded.\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nNoted.\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nNoted.\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nNoted.\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nNoted.\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nWe will avoid that in the future.\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nThere we go.\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nThat is the first time on stage in Harmontown that there's been an adjustment to the\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000\nstructure of the Harmontown show.\n\n01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nWe will no longer bring you up and then exclude you.\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nThat will not happen ever again by your decree.\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nThank you.\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000\nNo, but we do that a lot though.\n\n01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nWe brought him up for many times.\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nThat's the first time we've gotten that adjustment.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000\nWe do a lot of things all the time.\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nThat's true.\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nWe just never get told what to do.\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nBut isn't he allowed to say that if you're going to bring me up and sit there alone for\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000\n12 minutes?\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000\nYes.\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nYes, he did.\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nDo you have any complaints you'd like to make?\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nWould you like the show to be different in any way?\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nI'd like it to be funnier from the beginning.\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nI'd like to get a standing ovation after every show.\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nI'd like it to be 15 minutes shorter all the time.\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nTo male?\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nTo male?\n\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nAre you happy with the show all the way?\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nI think the show is great and perfect and needs no adjustments.\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nBoom.\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nWhat?\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000\nNo.\n\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nI mean...\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nI'm going to boo him now, but you won't when he's Comptroller next week.\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nFuck yeah.\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nFuck yeah.\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nAnd I'm pretty sure Adam Goldberg mentioned that he's a Dungeon Master, didn't he?\n\n01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nNobody's on board for that.\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nI don't know why I thought I'd be carried into this Liberator.\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000\nOkay.\n\n01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nIf we're going to start playing D&D, let's bring out Erin McGathy.\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nHello.\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nHi Spencer.\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000\nHi Dan.\n\n01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nPart of the show is that it's messy and that's part of the thing of it, right?\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nRight, Aaron?\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nYes.\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000\nDan, speaking of messy, something happened in between you going on stage.\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nOh.\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nThis is crazy.\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nThis is no good.\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nThis is no good.\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nI'm going to try and hype it up way too much.\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nAnd then when you guys hear it, you're going to be like, you didn't hype it up enough.\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nThis is no good.\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nSo for Dustin and Spencer's birthday, I baked the audience a cake.\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nThat's the good news.\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nLet's play D&D.\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nI baked the audience a cake and right before cutting the cake, I went back to the green room and I washed my hands.\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nAnd after washing my hands.\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nShe washed her hands.\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nI know, big deal.\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nI washed my hands and I looked at my finger and I remember thinking, ah, I love my engagement ring.\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nSuch a great engagement ring.\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nOh no.\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nSo then I went back and I cut the cake with other Aaron, who's a great intern here.\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nWe were cutting the cake and talking and then you went on stage.\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nSo happy.\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nAnd then I looked at my ring and the diamond is missing from my engagement ring.\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nI told you I couldn't hype it up enough.\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000\nSo my diamond, I hope no one ate it.\n\n01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000\nAnd I was like, I was like, what does it look like?\n\n01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nAnd then I was like, no, I guess if I see a diamond on the floor, that's probably your diamond.\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nBut it'll look like a piece of chocolate cake probably.\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nThis is a good try to bring it up.\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nThat so-called diamond is actually constructed of a very digestible substance.\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000\nIt's actually made of icing.\n\n01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nCalled diamond naffia.\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nBirthday boy Dustin Marshall said, someone's going to die.\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nNo one's going to die.\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nOr get rich.\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nNo, that's not really, is that really dangerous if you swallow a little tiny diamond?\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nYou just shit it out.\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nHappy birthday.\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nMy older half-sister, one of her daughters, my niece, or when she was a little baby, ate her diamond ring, her wedding ring.\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nAnd for two or three days, I had to watch, or I didn't have to watch, but we had to hear reports about my sister.\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nI put diapers back on like the three-year-old or two-year-old that was off diapers.\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000\nOh, to like sit through it.\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nAnd then took a big fork and had to fork through her poop.\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nSo if everyone could do that.\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nHappy ending.\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nHappy ending.\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nShe found it and is still wearing it to this day.\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nAre they still using that fork?\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000\nYou get rid of that fork, right?\n\n01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nThe fork actually was destroyed, but it was framed and put up in their house.\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nIt's kind of as if that ring passed through her daughter's body.\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nIt's fucking great.\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nYeah, but now it's this diamond plaster in one of these guys' bodies.\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nI mean, I hope it's Anatoly.\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000\nHe does look like he ate a diamond.\n\n01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nYeah, and he does look like he would sift through his own shit.\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nThat's all he had.\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nYou dressed that way for a reason.\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nYou did not want attention.\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nBut real talk, real talk.\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nThe diamond is...\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nIs in one of you.\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nReal talk, real talk.\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nDiamond is here.\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nIt's somewhere.\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000\nThe diamond is here.\n\n01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nLock the doors.\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000\nIf you find it.\n\n01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nI mean, if you really need it.\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nIf you find it, keep it.\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nFuck that.\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nWell, no, no.\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nKeep it and sell it.\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nThe top dollar.\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000\nI've sentimental attachments to it, I guess.\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nNo, you don't.\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nYou lost it in a piece of cake.\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nAnd before that, that's the good news.\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nWe love each other.\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nMy full statement was, if you need it, keep it.\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nIf you're a millionaire and you don't need it,\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nI'll make you something and exchange for it.\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nI swear none of them are millionaires.\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nI'm looking at it totally.\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nAlso, if you feel guilty about it,\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nit actually is a blood diamond.\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nIt's a conflict diamond from...\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nAdam, you were so good until now.\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000\nI lost my wedding ring and I had to buy a new one.\n\n01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nIt was fine.\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000\nThe whole ring or just the jewel in there?\n\n01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000\nNo, I didn't have a jewel on it.\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nI knew it this.\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nI don't have mine yet.\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nOur love didn't suffer, yeah.\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nAaron, all you have to do is ask,\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000\nI'll shit you a diamond.\n\n01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nI know, I know.\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nWhat do you want?\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nThat's the new...\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nDo you want marquee?\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nFair shape, pretty like.\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nSquare cut.\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nI didn't mean to cut you off, Aaron,\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nso you were going to say the same thing I was.\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nYeah, if you are at a point in your life\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nwhere you are willing to go through your own poop\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nbecause you think you may be the recipient of a diamond.\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nI don't think anybody was actually like,\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000\npeople chew cake, they don't swallow it whole.\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nBut it's not...\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nThe bigger concern is that somebody\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nabsolutely shatters a tooth trying to chew a diamond.\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nThen that's the...\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nYeah, you definitely get to keep the diamond.\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nI would say there's probably a half-eaten piece of cake\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nsomewhere with a diamond sitting on top of it.\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nI bet it's on the floor somewhere.\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nYeah, well, clearly, and this is only reasonable,\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nbut obviously we should not get married\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nunless the same diamond is found.\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nIf it is not found, there will be a murder.\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nOn a kind of semi-related note,\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nI lost a Gutenberg Bible backstage.\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nIf anybody sees a Gutenberg Bible,\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nI had it inside of an 11-muffin.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nNo, it's really a five-button.\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nPeople at Otterbox, if they make wedding rings,\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nlike I'd like to get Aaron.\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nAt Otterbox?\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nYour phone case is from.\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nAaron can throw her phone across the room.\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nSpencer, what do you think of all this?\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nI think it's great.\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nYou think it's great?\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nShe lost her...\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nIt did help me look for it earlier.\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nI say we are speaking to Sifton through shit.\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nLet's play some D&D.\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nWhen I find the music,\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nkeep your applause going until I shouldn't have brought it up.\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nI shouldn't have said it until I hit this.\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nSorry, Spencer.\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nWhat?\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000\nI didn't kill you up well.\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nYou're doing a great job, Jeff.\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nDon't change a thing.\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nYeah, no notes.\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nWhen we last met,\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nour heroes were chained by the soul\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000\non trial by skeletons in the city of Tormont Tour.\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nAfter upsetting and confusing the Bonesages,\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nSecond Tour appointed the party a special defendant,\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000\na novice lawyer by the name of Skeleton Gary.\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nAfter a brief recess to catch up,\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nGary got down to business,\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000\ncross-examining, citing precedents\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nand building a credible case.\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nAfter a stirring and brilliant oratory,\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nSkeleton Gary managed to acquit our heroes\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nby promising that if freed,\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nthey'd bring back the head of the Marsh Minotaur,\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nscourge of the flea market hills.\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nBut would our heroes be able\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nto fulfill their skeleton errand\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nor would they be cast into the pits of Skaldor?\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nLet's watch.\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nAll right, so we're freed from our soul chains, correct?\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nYeah.\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nThat weird bug came and died.\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nSure did.\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nSo, I pull...\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nI mean, is our lawyer gone?\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nI guess he is, right?\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nYeah, he ran out.\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nHe has still a little money.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nAll right, well, he's gone, so fuck him.\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nI turn to our group and say,\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nlook, we made some promises during that court hearing\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nthat we would go fight this Marsh Minotaur.\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nIt kind of sounded like improv to me,\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nbut we did kind of bind ourselves to that promise.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nSounds like a bunch of malarkey.\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nI said we'd just get the hell out of here\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nand cut our losses.\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nYeah, let's just get out of here\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nand be like, yeah, we'll do what you guys wanted to do,\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nand then we'll just start to talk when we're outside.\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nYeah, let's sign whatever we have to sign\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nand get the fuck out of here.\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nThere's nothing to sign, really.\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nWell, thank you, Torah Mod and Torah.\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nWe appreciate your bureaucracy and everything,\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nand I guess we'll be on our way.\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nI mean, you'll bring back the head of the Marsh Minotaur.\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nYeah, yeah, totally.\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nTotally, totally.\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nYou point us in a direction and we'll do whatever you like.\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nYeah, it's at the flea market hills.\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nJust be advised that as part of this whole thing,\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nyou know, you're obligated to do this under the penalty of soul loss.\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nOkay.\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nWe got it.\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nI mean, what do you mean exactly?\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nWe're not attached to the soul chains anymore.\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nHow does the soul loss thing?\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nYeah, how could you...\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nYeah, like is a soul cop going to come and get us?\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nI mean, no, it's just, it's in the magic of televarna that's already completed.\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nWait, what do you mean?\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nWell, you saw the, you saw the beast of burden.\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nYes.\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nIt made no sense to us.\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nI mean, it's kind of the benchmark of our law, but that's fine.\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nIt's, it doesn't matter to you.\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nOh, so you're saying is if we default on getting the...\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nWhen it shrieks, the binding arbitrations of televarna\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nare inscribed onto your very soul,\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nand if they're not enacted properly, that'll, you know, kind of consume it.\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000\nAnd if we don't bring back the marshmallow to our head,\n\n01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nthen we just go kapoot, like...\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nWhat happens if we lose our souls?\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nI mean, you stop existing pretty much.\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nIs there a time limit?\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nHow does it know the difference between us taking a really long time to do it\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nand us not doing it?\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000\nWhat if we just don't get to it?\n\n01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nIs there a shot?\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nYou can certainly try those.\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nYour soul.\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nWe can certainly try what?\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nTo not, you know, to skirt televarna.\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nI mean, if it takes us a hundred years, is that cool?\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nOr if it takes us five years?\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nLike, how long is the shot?\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nIt's not up to me, man.\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nThe magic's already there.\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nCan we consult the magic and find out what the time limit is?\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nSure, ask the magic.\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nI cast magic eye roll, and I ask the magic...\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nYou glean nothing.\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nI mean, okay, have you guys ever done this before?\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nWhat's the normal statute of limitations on getting shit done before your soul disappears?\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nIf you're not actively pursuing the quest, you're going to start feeling it.\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nI feel like we should have had this talk without him listening to us.\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nIt'll be like back to the future.\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nI mean, I don't know what that is.\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nWill we start disappearing?\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nYeah, we'll look at our hand.\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nAll right, so we'll go do it.\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nAll right, you know what?\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nIt'll be Zemeckis' discretion.\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nAre there any weaknesses to this marshmallow that we should know of?\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nAh, I'm sure he's not full of great strengths.\n\n01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nYou're probably fine.\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nOh, so...\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nAll right, so, Alita, tell us which direction we start walking to the flea market hills.\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nOh, I'll do you one better.\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nLenev, you show him.\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nAw, fuck!\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nOh, we gotta go with this guy?\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nGod damn it!\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nOkay, I pull Sharpie aside and say, Sharpie?\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nNo.\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nWhat?\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nWe're gonna have to do this with Lenev.\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nThere's two ways to do this.\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nThe easy way or your way?\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nAre we gonna get along or are we gonna fight the whole way through?\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nI would like to go on a vision quest by myself.\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nAll right.\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nCan we get anyone but Lenev?\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nWhy does it have to be Lenev?\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nHe's the marshal around these parts.\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nI've been to the flea market.\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nHills?\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nIn fact, I know the Minotaur.\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000\nYes.\n\n01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000\nWe don't need Lenev.\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nWe've got this one over here.\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nAll right.\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nWell, everybody leave.\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nWe're gonna do private stuff in here.\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nSharpie, are you still going on a vision quest?\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nYeah, he's doing the private stuff.\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nIs Lenev coming with us?\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nI guess not.\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nLenev, are you coming with us or no?\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000\nFuck you.\n\n01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nI'll show you guys the way.\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nI used to go out with the Minotaur.\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nAll right.\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nSounds good.\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000\nI'll come with you guys.\n\n01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nI kind of wanted to hear about your vision quest after you were done.\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nWell, I mean, the good news is you're now on it.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nBecause she doesn't know where the fuck the Minotaur is.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nThank you.\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nWe had a romance.\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nMulraine, lead the way.\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nThis way.\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nI go in the right direction.\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nYou search for the right direction and you see some hills.\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000\nThey're probably the only hills in the area.\n\n01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nWhen I used to travel on these hills before,\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nwe used to call them the little eggs.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nCome on, gentlemen.\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nThis way.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nLittle eggs?\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nThey look like big eggs, if anything.\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nIt made no sense when we said it then and now.\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nWe called them the little eggs.\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nTell us about that.\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000\nYou said you met the March Minotaur.\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nTell us all about him.\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000\nTell us all about him.\n\n01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nWhat's his favorite color?\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nFlashback.\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nOh, you're early.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nA Minotaur is never early.\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nNor is he late.\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nHe arrives precisely when he meets you.\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nMarch.\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nHis name is March?\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nShe thinks my name is Marsh.\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nShe thinks my name is Marsh Minotaur?\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nYeah, she thinks my last name is Minotaur.\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nThat's like having someone named Edward Heumann.\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nMarsh, I made you...\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000\nI made you this little bucket.\n\n01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nWhat is the bucket for?\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nI put good wishes in it for a date.\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000\nI routinely...\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nThe Sedona family, we give everyone buckets.\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nAnd this is...\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nI mean, now I feel embarrassed, but here's this bucket.\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nWhere are we going on the date?\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nThanks for this bucket.\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nCan I leave it here and pick it up later?\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000\nYes, yes, of course, yes, yes.\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000\nWe're going to the flea market hills.\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000\nOh, excellent. I've never been there before.\n\n01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nReal quick, pause.\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nWe flash back to the present while we watch you\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000\nkind of look up in the air while you're clearly going into a flashback.\n\n01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nAnd I look every go, this is going to be an awesome flashback.\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nI can't wait to hear what happens on this one.\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nBack into the flashback.\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000\nYeah, I guess we could go there.\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nYeah, hey, I don't want to be weird,\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nbut you had a bad experience in the flea market hills\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nthe last time you visited them.\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nYou were part of a story that I read in...\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nDo I tell the story?\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nI.e. do the heavy lifting in this improv?\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nI heard that someone was selling something\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nthat you found very offensive\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nand you charged several halflings\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nand you ended up...\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nyou contributed to the deaths of many halfling children.\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nI was misunderstood.\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nThey had a confederative flag with swastikas on it.\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nAnd I was like, that's wrong.\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000\nAnd they were like, different symbols mean different things to different people.\n\n01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000\nAnd I just sort of went nuts\n\n01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nand some lives were lost,\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nbut I don't think there were lives worth saving anyway.\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000\nThey were like, you know...\n\n01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000\nYeah, I mean obviously I'm on the state,\n\n01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nso I'm on your side, I just wanted to clear that up.\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000\nYep, so that's it.\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000\nBut I think it's blown over.\n\n01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000\nI don't think people think of me as like a bad guy anymore.\n\n01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000\nThere's no like council trying to like kill me or anything.\n\n01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000\nI feel like I've explained myself.\n\n01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nOh, the buttons on your pants are coming apart.\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nSo here's that.\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000\nYep, they are.\n\n01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000\nAren't you curious?\n\n01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nHow far down the hoarseness goes?\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nOh, that's a centaur.\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nBull.\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nBullness.\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000\nYeah, that's a centaur.\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nDan, I'm referencing our first date.\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nJK, uh...\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nWhat happened?\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nHe left.\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nIt's just a guy that has to take a shit.\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nIt happens every day.\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nI didn't mean that as sexually as it came across,\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nbut so great.\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nLet's just stay here then,\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nmeaning that we won't actually go to the flea market,\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nbut we've had a connection.\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000\nYeah.\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nFlashback of it.\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nYou know the minotaur.\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nSo tell me all about him.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nWell, I just relived that flashback out loud.\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nWhat happened with the minotaur?\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nDid you guys stay at home?\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nYeah, he...\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000\nWe started...\n\n01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000\nHow far down did his hoarseness go?\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nBullness.\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nIt went down as far as you think.\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nPeople have chemistry with certain people.\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nThings started to get hot and heavy,\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nand it was clear that things weren't meant to be for us.\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nThat's all.\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nI put on Mark and Mindy,\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000\nand we watched that.\n\n01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nAnd then he...\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000\nLet's go to the flea market.\n\n01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nBack with the flashback.\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000\nThis never happens to me.\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nNo way.\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nI think I ate something bad for breakfast.\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000\nNanu.\n\n01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000\nI usually have you not have breakfast.\n\n01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nNanu.\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nMark and Mindy's still on the background.\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000\nIt's loud.\n\n01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nIt's a loud and assertive.\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000\nNanu.\n\n01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nLike that.\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nOh.\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000\nOh.\n\n01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nNanu, nanu.\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nNanu, nanu.\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nI said it quite...\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nThe episode where he took over Europe\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nand hoarded all the art.\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nNanu, nanu.\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000\nNanu, nanu.\n\n01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000\nBurn the Picasso's...\n\n01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nYou know what?\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nYou know what?\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nAnd I'll call you, though.\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000\nI swear.\n\n01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nAnd you know what?\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nI'll pick up the bucket when I come back.\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nWell, can I give you this wreath?\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000\nI want to...\n\n01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000\nI'm going to tie it around your neck.\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000\nI have an idea.\n\n01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nHow about I pick up the wreath when I come back for the bucket?\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000\nPlease just take this wreath.\n\n01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nAll right, I'll take the wreath.\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nI mean, it's very small.\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nI didn't even notice that.\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000\nI'll take the wreath.\n\n01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000\nNanu, nanu, nanu.\n\n01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nAll right.\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000\nI'll call you.\n\n01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nNanu, nanu, nanu.\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000\nIt's the worst episode of work ever in the background.\n\n01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nAll right.\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000\nWell, so you...\n\n01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nSo, suffice to say, you have a longstanding relationship with this monster.\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nYes, I mean, I never saw him again.\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000\nHe's a nice guy.\n\n01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nHe's misunderstood.\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nI would like to face him.\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nHe doesn't sound very tough.\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nLike, he doesn't sound like a real threat.\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nLike, he sounds like he's kind of a regular...\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000\nLike, he sounds kind of...\n\n01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000\nHe sounds like you never know where he's coming from.\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000\nSo here, you say it.\n\n01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nYeah.\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nI suppose that's true.\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000\nBut also...\n\n01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000\nLike, if he was on Lulu, what's that app?\n\n01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000\nHis hashtag would be like,\n\n01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nLulu!\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000\nAll over the place.\n\n01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nTwo horns, no ambition.\n\n01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000\nWhat are you...\n\n01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nTwo horns, not three.\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nAll right.\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nWell, so where is he?\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nHe's up through these little legs.\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nHe's up in the middle.\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000\nThis way.\n\n01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nLet's go there.\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000\nWe start going there.\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nOkay.\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nYou shouldn't stop through a regression valley for a while?\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nIt's right off exposition lane.\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nAll right.\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nWe head toward Small Egg Hills.\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000\nLittle Eggs.\n\n01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nLittle Eggs.\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000\nYeah.\n\n01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nYou go to that place.\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000\nYou see hills.\n\n01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nYou also see a lot of stalls and booths,\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nlike some sort of farmer's market\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nor maybe a flea market has been set up.\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000\nIt looks largely abandoned, though.\n\n01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000\nThat's what you see.\n\n01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000\nDo you want to call out for him?\n\n01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000\nHey, Marsh.\n\n01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000\nNot to be weird, but I guess I happen to be here.\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nIt's not for you.\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000\nI'm here with my boyfriend.\n\n01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nI whittle.\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000\nI whittle.\n\n01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nYou see, you see shifting wood.\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nThere's like some sort of wreckage of wood\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nand you see a small skeletal figure\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000\ncrawl out of this woodwork holding a little sign.\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.000\nThe sign says, don't be cheesy.\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nIs that jont?\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000\nJont.\n\n01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000\nLike don't with a J.\n\n01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000\nLike Jango?\n\n01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000\nYeah.\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000\nYeah, like that.\n\n01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nBut jont.\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000\nHey, little one.\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000\nBye, my cheeses.\n\n01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nNo.\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000\nOkay.\n\n01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000\nAnd I like cheese.\n\n01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000\nI just don't like your sign.\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nI keep whittling.\n\n01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nHave you seen a Minotaur walking around\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000\nwho's kind of, you know,\n\n01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nemotionally unavailable,\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nbut clearly handsome\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000\nand people are very taken by him,\n\n01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nbut maybe he doesn't have the high enough self-esteem\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000\nto accept love yet.\n\n01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000\nI sure did.\n\n01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000\nHe came in and stomped all my cheeses.\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000\nI should have clarified earlier.\n\n01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nIt stomped cheese.\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nHe's slapped all your cheeses.\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000\nHe stomped them all.\n\n01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nStomped cheese.\n\n01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000\nStomped all the cheeses.\n\n01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nThat's just like him.\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000\nI think you're still kind of sweet on this guy.\n\n01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000\nI mean, who knows?\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nYou know, sometimes people come together\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000\nat different times in their lives,\n\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nbut you know, I'm like...\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000\nYeah, I agree.\n\n01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000\nSometimes just the time isn't right, you know,\n\n01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000\neven if the people are right for each other.\n\n01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000\nWait, how are you tied up in this?\n\n01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000\nI just, I sort of...\n\n01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000\nI understand what she's saying.\n\n01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000\nThat's happened to me.\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nDo you two have a previous lover?\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000\nI have pulled Chris out.\n\n01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000\nFlashback!\n\n01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nFlashback!\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000\nHey.\n\n01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000\nHey.\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000\nYou want more of that?\n\n01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000\nEvery day.\n\n01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000\nNanu Nanu!\n\n01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nNanu Nanu!\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nSorry, let me turn down the T, man.\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000\nYou know what?\n\n01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nJust turn it off.\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.000\nAll right, with pleasure.\n\n01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000\nSo it's two for six, six for two,\n\n01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000\nand twelve for twenty.\n\n01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000\nAnd I like your style.\n\n01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000\nYou flashback.\n\n01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000\nYou guys sounded like you were really in love.\n\n01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000\nYeah, I got the twelve for twenty.\n\n01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.000\nFlashback!\n\n01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000\nFlashback!\n\n01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000\nI'm going to award you with the twelve for twenty.\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000\nWhy?\n\n01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000\nThe government requires me to tell you\n\n01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000\nyou'll never be the same.\n\n01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.000\nFlash forward to the present.\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000\nThat was the last mistake I ever made.\n\n01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000\nLike, you met Dolph Lundgren?\n\n01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000\nYeah, I mean, I'll tell you, that twelve for twenty\n\n01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000\nwas totally worth it.\n\n01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000\nBut I never have been able to write a song since then.\n\n01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nOh, did you write Woman in Red?\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000\nLady in Red before that meeting?\n\n01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000\nI wrote Woman in Red.\n\n01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000\nHe wrote it.\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000\nI wrote Lady in Red right before that meeting,\n\n01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000\nand I was like, oh, I'm a songster.\n\n01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000\nOh, my God.\n\n01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000\nAnd I was like, nothing will take this away from me.\n\n01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000\nHe literally fucked you out of a career.\n\n01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000\nBut you know what?\n\n01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000\nI wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000\nI go examine the footprints and the cheese\n\n01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000\nthat's been stomped.\n\n01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000\nIt's all stomped.\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000\nDid they lead in a direction?\n\n01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000\nThey do. They lead over the hill, believe it or not.\n\n01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000\nThis way, gentlemen, let's go over the big yoke.\n\n01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000\nI guess you guys are doing that.\n\n01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000\nYeah.\n\n01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000\nYeah, we're going to get the marshy.\n\n01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000\nYou go over the hill and you see at the bottom of the hill,\n\n01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.000\njust lying right there in sight a dank, smelly cave.\n\n01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000\nYou can smell it from here.\n\n01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000\nLet's go in there.\n\n01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000\nYeah.\n\n01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000\nI don't want to wall it up with rocks.\n\n01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000\nWell.\n\n01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000\nSo that no one can ever get in or out.\n\n01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000\nBut maybe we should see what's happening.\n\n01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nI take two of my arrows,\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000\nand I put my hair up in a bun,\n\n01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000\nand I do that thing that middle schoolers do\n\n01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000\nwhen they put two pencils in their hair,\n\n01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nbut with my arrows.\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000\nLike with knitting needles.\n\n01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000\nPeople do them.\n\n01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000\nI'm just going to go in really quick,\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000\nand just see what's going on.\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000\nCome on.\n\n01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.000\nNo one.\n\n01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000\nYou're going in with us,\n\n01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000\nbecause, first of all, this minotaur is ferocious.\n\n01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000\nSecond of all, you can't control yourself around him.\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000\nYou have a history with him,\n\n01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000\nand you don't know what you're doing.\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000\nRight.\n\n01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000\nYou have a co-dependent relationship.\n\n01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nWell, I appreciate you guys coming in with me.\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000\nIf I make any jokes, please laugh loudly.\n\n01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000\nAnd also, if it comes up organically,\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000\nplease call me pretty and smart.\n\n01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000\nLet's do it.\n\n01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000\nHey, before we go in there, resolve this.\n\n01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:49.000\nYou should be the one staying outside this cave.\n\n01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000\nYou can't control yourself as a person.\n\n01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000\nA lot has happened to me since the last time that I saw him,\n\n01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000\nand I've evolved a lot, and I've changed a lot,\n\n01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000\nand I realize that I'm exposing myself\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000\nfor being an insecure archer.\n\n01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000\nBut I just want him to see how great I am now,\n\n01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000\nand I want him to see the company I keep.\n\n01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000\nBecause more than anything, I'm proud of the company I keep.\n\n01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:18.000\nI use sense motive, if I can.\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000\nUh-oh.\n\n01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000\nCan I answer this one?\n\n01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000\nNo, you have to do it truthfully.\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000\nOkay.\n\n01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000\nYeah.\n\n01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000\nSo what's going on?\n\n01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000\nIs it a different voice, or is it?\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nYes.\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nUm, I love you.\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:44.000\nI don't love him, but I want him to think I'm hot.\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000\nSo relatable.\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000\nI get it.\n\n01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nWe've all been through relationships where we feel like\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000\nthey took our wallet.\n\n01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000\nWe want our wallet back.\n\n01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000\nIn a way, it seems like she wants to show you off to him\n\n01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000\nand say, look how great my life is.\n\n01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000\nOkay, I get it.\n\n01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000\nI'm going to be that guy for you.\n\n01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000\nLet's do this.\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000\nBy the way, I guess I'm your boyfriend?\n\n01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000\nI didn't even know that.\n\n01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000\nOh, you guys need a little bit of room?\n\n01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000\nShould we?\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000\nNo, not at all.\n\n01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000\nI'm asexual, but I'm a wizard.\n\n01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000\nAll right.\n\n01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000\nI take my sword out, and I look at you guys,\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000\nand we all stand like four abreast,\n\n01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nand we're all standing at the entrance to this cave,\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000\nand I'm ready to go in there with you guys.\n\n01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nAll right, let's go in.\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nI'm super excited.\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000\nWhat kind of pose do you take?\n\n01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000\nAre you saying that we all hold our weapons up,\n\n01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000\nand that the sun is behind the weapons,\n\n01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:36.000\nand that a kind of lens flare comes out,\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000\nand it says, should we continue in the lens flare?\n\n01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000\nBut there is a voiceover that, kind of like Duke's hazardous,\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000\nsays, oh, what's about to happen?\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000\nKind of a teaser.\n\n01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000\nI think you could do more.\n\n01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000\nWe started the show late.\n\n01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000\nHey, if it were up to me,\n\n01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000\nwe would be here until three in the morning.\n\n01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000\nOkay, we put our weapons together,\n\n01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000\nand I just charge into the cave.\n\n01:47:01.000 -->

doesn't need quirk first.\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000\nShazbot.\n\n01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nShazbot!\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000\nKick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.\n\n01:47:18.000

ex-boyfriend.\n\n01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nI'm trying my hardest.\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000\nThese flashbacks really turned me on.\n\n01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000\nI'm not saying...\n\n01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000\nDon't blame you.\n\n01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nAll right.\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000\nSo you're stomping, stomping into this cave.\n\n01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000\nCould have ended the show.\n\n01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nThere's bones and skulls all over the place,\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000\nadorning the floor,\n\n01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000\nand as you charge in all loudly,\n\n01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nand yelling, and kicking,\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000\nand doing those things,\n\n01:47:44.000 -->

01:47:59.000\nGuys, I think Peter Sellers is in prison here.\n\n01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000\nAll right, guys.\n\n01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000\nI'll check it out.\n\n01:48:02.000 -->

time.\n\n01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000\nNo, okay.\n\n01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000\nThis was a joke we used to have,\n\n01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000\nwhere he would say,\n\n01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000\nI'll destroy you.\n\n01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000\nIt doesn't mean anything.\n\n01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000\nI smooth my hair back with my hand,\n\n01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000\nand I approach.\n\n01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000\nHey!\n\n01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000\nBananas, right?\n\n01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000\nIt's a joke.\n\n01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000\nIt was a joke.\n\n01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000\nWe had a thing.\n\n01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000\nYou guys had a joke called bananas?\n\n01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000\nRight?\n\n01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000\nWe had a...\n\n01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000\nThere was this time where we were walking down the street,\n\n01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000\nand there was a banana tree,\n\n01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000\nand a bunch of bananas fell all at once.\n\n01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000\nYou know what?\n\n01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000\nSounds cool.\n\n01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000\nWhat are the walls made of, Spencer?\n\n01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000\nLike, cave stuff.\n\n01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000\nOkay, I start climbing the walls,\n\n01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000\nand try to get up along the side of the walls,\n\n01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000\nand it's like, while she's distracting,\n\n01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000\nI try to get into a flanking maneuver.\n\n01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000\nThat's your solution to everything.\n\n01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000\nKill it, then fuck it.\n\n01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000\nStarts climbing the walls.\n\n01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nIf it ain't broke?\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000\nThe walls are slick with some sort of weird moisture.\n\n01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000\nThat's my fault.\n\n01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000\nThat's all the description of skulls.\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000\nYou still manage to climb up into the cave.\n\n01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000\nYou're holding on to a slack-type.\n\n01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000\nI'm just crawling along slowly.\n\n01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000\nVery slowly.\n\n01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000\nI look back like...\n\n01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000\nI feel like...\n\n01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nKeep them talking.\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000\nKeep them on the phone call.\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:37.000\nI bound down, like, kicking high,\n\n01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nkicking massive amounts of dirt,\n\n01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000\nsmashing everything I can,\n\n01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000\nwaving my hands in the

you're making the kind of boyfriend impression\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nthat she wanted you to make.\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000\nWell, I'm angry, because, like, marry him.\n\n01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000\nGuess why?\n\n01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000\nOh, come on.\n\n01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000\nYou didn't break.\n\n01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000\nHow would you react?\n\n01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000\nYou said five moments ago\n\n01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000\nthat you don't remember that we were dating.\n\n01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000\nI run towards the...\n\n01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000\nTowards the voice.\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000\nI kick every stalagmite and stalactite.\n\n01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000\nExcept the one that he's on?\n\n01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000\nWell, whatever one he's on, fine.\n\n01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000\nI throw rocks behind me\n\n01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000\nas to try to homelone Sharpie's path.\n\n01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000\nUh, you homelone it.\n\n01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000\nGreat.\n\n01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000\nI don't know. What are you doing?\n\n01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000\nI'm, like, super weirded out by everything.\n\n01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000\nI yell, I am not on board!\n\n01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000\nOkay.\n\n01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nHow close am I to wherever this voice is coming from?\n\n01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000\nNot very.\n\n01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000\nI mean, you're crawling on a ceiling.\n\n01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000\nHe's all running.\n\n01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000\nI feel like we should just go talk to him.\n\n01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000\nWe don't need to go on ceilings and kick stuff, right?\n\n01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000\nWe just go talk to him.\n\n01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000\nThat's what I'm trying to do.\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000\nBecause what we want to do,\n\n01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000\nwe have to kill this guy.\n\n01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000\nLet's face it.\n\n01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000\nRight.\n\n01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000\nHe may as well bring him to us.\n\n01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000\nI don't want to come looking for him.\n\n01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000\nWhere are you?\n\n01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000\nStay back!\n\n01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000\nDo I see him yet?\n\n01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000\nI'm running and I'm running and I'm running.\n\n01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000\nYou keep running and you see a light around the bend,\n\n01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000\nlike there's lit stuff around the bend.\n\n01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000\nI keep on running towards that light.\n\n01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000\nYou see, you see the Marsh Minotaur.\n\n01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000\nIt's seated.\n\n01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000\nIt's sitting.\n\n01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000\nKind of sprawled out.\n\n01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000\nYou see it's utter, just kind of laying all over the floor.\n\n01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000\nIt's utter!\n\n01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000\nThe reality of my past lover.\n\n01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000\nHe's a cow?\n\n01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000\nAnd it's, uh, it's looking at,\n\n01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000\nlike a weird, like a cow symbol.\n\n01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000\nYeah, I'm doing it like a cow symbol.\n\n01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000\nBoys, boy, boy Minotaur.\n\n01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000\nWhoa, metagaming, metagaming.\n\n01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000\nThis thing's got another.\n\n01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000\nOkay.\n\n01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000\nYeah.\n\n01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000\nYou don't even see it, man.\n\n01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000\nAlso, maybe he identifies as a male,\n\n01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000\nbut he's not biologically.\n\n01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000\nThere's also another?\n\n01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000\nI run, I run towards, uh, I run towards him.\n\n01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000\nMarsh!\n\n01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000\nYou're not skeletons.\n\n01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000\nNo, it's, uh...\n\n01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000\nI thought you guys were

01:52:13.000\nWhat?\n\n01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000\nDo you, do you remember me, Mallory and Sedana?\n\n01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000\nTalking about memories.\n\n01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000\nThen no.\n\n01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000\nDude, you, you remember me?\n\n01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000\nWe met in that elevator.\n\n01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000\nI dropped all my papers and you picked them up.\n\n01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000\nWhat's an elevator?\n\n01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000\nDude, did you hook up with a different Minotaur?\n\n01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000\nThat's racist.\n\n01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000\nI, I, I examine his face and I,\n\n01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000\nand I see that he is clearly a different.\n\n01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000\nBut you let us here.\n\n01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000\nHey, do you know another Minotaur\n\n01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000\nwho really likes Smork and Mindy?\n\n01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000\nWhat's Smork and Mindy?\n\n01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000\nOkay.\n\n01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000\nUm, you seem suicidal.\n\n01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000\nI mean, I wouldn't go that far.\n\n01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000\nWhat are you doing in my cave?\n\n01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.000\nI, I draw my long sword and I say,\n\n01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:19.000\nuh, ending this.\n\n01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000\nAnd then I, I take it down on them.\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000\nWe won at his head, right?\n\n01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000\nI'm on a ceiling back in the hall.\n\n01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000\nYeah.\n\n01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000\nI've been reminded that I'm not there.\n\n01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000\nNone of us are there.\n\n01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000\nIt was just, you had all kinds of funny stuff to say.\n\n01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000\nI was not there.\n\n01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000\nI look, I look around his neck and I say that there's no wreath.\n\n01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000\nUm, and clearly the guy, the Minotaur I dated\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000\nwould always wear this wreath,\n\n01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000\neven if he felt nothing for me,\n\n01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000\nbecause that's how Mulrainee Sidhanna deals with the world.\n\n01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000\nI take the sword and I, and I,\n\n01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:56.000\nI put it down on the Minotaur's neck with great force.\n\n01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000\nUm, you bring down the sword upon its neck in it.\n\n01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000\nIt just hits its neck and it just breaks your blade.\n\n01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000\nThe wreath, the wreath is a Sharpie and Chris de Burgh arrive.\n\n01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000\nHey!\n\n01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000\nHey!\n\n01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000\nHey!\n\n01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.000\nDid you do any, you didn't do anything stupid, did you?\n\n01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.000\nHow can I support your relationship?\n\n01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000\nAs a good person.\n\n01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000\nI have a box of wine.\n\n01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000\nHey guys, that sword I bought at the Magic Shop\n\n01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000\nreally works.\n\n01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000\nIt breaks when you want it to.\n\n01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000\nWhy would you attack your ex-boyfriend?\n\n01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000\nYes.\n\n01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000\nHave I crawled on this hilling enough to be in the same room\n\n01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000\nwhen I still haven't been in the hallway?\n\n01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000\nI mean, if you were walking, you would have.\n\n01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000\nI mean, I, I, I'm comm- I'm comm-\n\n01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000\nIt's crawling!\n\n01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000\nIt's crawling!\n\n01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000\nI'm

01:55:05.000\nHow far outside of this room am I?\n\n01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000\nUm, well, like a couple rounds.\n\n01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000\nYou're in there.\n\n01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000\nThe Marsh Minotaur rises to its feet and it's like,\n\n01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000\nwhy are all these humans down here and why are you attacking me?\n\n01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000\nAre there skeletons you could go bother?\n\n01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000\nYou are, right?\n\n01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000\nExcuse me, Marsh?\n\n01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000\nIs it

01:55:54.000\nUh, we were on trial with the, uh, skeletons.\n\n01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000\nYou know them?\n\n01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000\nYes.\n\n01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000\nOur lawyer, our lawyer got us off by promising that we'd kill you.\n\n01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000\nI don't want to do it.\n\n01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000\nI see no profit in it.\n\n01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000\nFrankly, I don't see how we'd do it.\n\n01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000\nYou're a big strap and very straight guy.\n\n01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000\nWhat?\n\n01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000\nYou're so straight.\n\n01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000\nDo you know how udders work?\n\n01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000\nOh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n01:56:17.000 -->

imply gender at all.\n\n01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000\nAll right.\n\n01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000\nOkay.\n\n01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000\nShit.\n\n01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000\nThis is definitely not your minotaur.\n\n01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000\nWe, we briefly come back to meet the ceiling.\n\n01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000\nUh, god damn it, son of a bitch.\n\n01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000\nThe truth of the matter is that we got, we got time bombs implanted on our souls\n\n01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:50.000\nby these skeletons, uh, if we don't fulfill our goal, uh, we are, you know,\n\n01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000\nour souls blow up or something.\n\n01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000\nI got no beef with you.\n\n01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000\nI got more beef with people that would do that kind of thing to people.\n\n01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000\nYeah.\n\n01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000\nSkeletons are dicks.\n\n01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000\nThey're total dicks.\n\n01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000\nThere's a skeleton guy who comes in and milks me.\n\n01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000\nWhat?\n\n01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000\nYeah.\n\n01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000\nHis name's Jonte.\n\n01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000\nJonte, be cheesy.\n\n01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000\nIf you, you're more native to this bureaucracy than we are.\n\n01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000\nIf we could figure out a way to like, you know, turn this whole thing on its head.\n\n01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000\nI just fell down here one day through a marsh.\n\n01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000\nThat's metaphorically what happened to us.\n\n01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000\nUm.\n\n01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000\nIt sounds like we have a common enemy.\n\n01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000\nFinally, finally we find a, we meet a nice person.\n\n01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000\nI like this guy.\n\n01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000\nI like, oh, I like this person.\n\n01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000\nI like this person.\n\n01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000\nI also like this person.\n\n01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000\nI give, I give a kaif.\n\n01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000\nYep.\n\n01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000\nUh, will you accept this bucket?\n\n01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:57.000\nI guess I will as a symbol of me casting off my oppression.\n\n01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000\nIt's kind of, it's, it's like a rapper wearing, you know, yeah.\n\n01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000\nWhat?\n\n01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000\nOh, chains?\n\n01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000\nYeah, well.\n\n01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000\nNo, I mean, it's profound.\n\n01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000\nYeah, it's profound.\n\n01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000\nI didn't, I didn't come up with it.\n\n01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000\nAm I in the room yet?\n\n01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000\nNo dude.\n\n01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000\nYeah.\n\n01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000\nYeah.\n\n01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000\nYou arrived.\n\n01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000\nI, I, I, I, I emerge in this, on the ceiling of the room and look down.\n\n01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000\nTalk to me after the show if you want to talk about that.\n\n01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000\nAre these rappers worn chains because they're reminiscent of the chain's history?\n\n01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000\nI don't know, not, not consciously.\n\n01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:35.000\nOh, it's part of their unconscious ancestral memory that they have inherited from their\n\n01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000\nbrethren.\n\n01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.600\nYou look down and say, hey guys, is that the Marsh Minotaur?\n\n01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:39.600\nYep.\n\n01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:43.280\nOh, Jesus, I'm on the ceiling.\n\n01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:44.280\nOh, hey.\n\n01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:45.280\nIt's a spider pal.\n\n01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.280\nYou made it.\n\n01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:47.840\nI'm startled, and I take my knife,\n\n01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:50.160\nand I throw it at his back.\n\n01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:52.760\nWho is that?\n\n01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.920\nI declared it was me.\n\n01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:57.280\nYou hit, yeah.\n\n01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.760\nIt takes six damage.\n\n01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:02.520\nShit.\n\n01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:05.440\nI store that memory and bury it deep, deep inside.\n\n01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.040\nIs he still up there?\n\n01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.040\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:10.040\nI start shimmying down the side to get down there.\n\n01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:12.040\nAnd I go, look, is everything cool?\n\n01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:15.960\nI thought I was doing the right thing by getting up here and like being like sneaky,\n\n01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:18.120\nbut apparently we didn't have to be sneaky about this.\n\n01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:19.680\nKarev, was that your name?\n\n01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:20.680\nKaedev.\n\n01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:21.680\nKaedev?\n\n01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:22.680\nKaedev?\n\n01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:23.680\nKaedev.\n\n01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:24.680\nLike Kaedev, but with a K?\n\n01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:25.680\nCorrect.\n\n01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:26.680\nWhat's Kaedev?\n\n01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:27.680\nOkay.\n\n01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:28.680\nKaedev, it is.\n\n01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:29.680\nKaedev?\n\n01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:30.680\nKaedev.\n\n01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:34.160\nListen, let's form a human minotaur pact.\n\n01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:35.760\nOkay.\n\n01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:44.320\nBut I'm telling you, we're kind of bound, like we got like a cosigned autolone here\n\n01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:48.520\non our souls, like I've been honest about that with you.\n\n01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:50.200\nYeah, that sucks, man.\n\n01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:53.280\nI'll try and help you out, I guess, I don't know how that works.\n\n01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:57.280\nLet's go attack them, because I feel like skeletons have been dicked to us from the\n\n01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.280\nvery beginning.\n\n01:59:58.280 --> 01:59:59.280\nI agree.\n\n01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:00.880\nYou've been awesome to us.\n\n02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.880\nSo great.\n\n02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:02.880\nThanks.\n\n02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:03.880\nThanks.\n\n02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:07.760\nThanks for thinking my knife on your neck joke was funny.\n\n02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:08.760\nWow.\n\n02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:11.760\nYeah, what was that?\n\n02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:15.120\nOkay, be very careful.\n\n02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.760\nThat's how humans say they love me.\n\n02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:19.920\nYeah, it's like blood brothers, but more intense than ones I did.\n\n02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:23.440\nSee, she liked quarks so much she threw a knife at him.\n\n02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:24.960\nYeah, we do that sometimes.\n\n02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:29.320\nI take her knife and I just kind of put it in the back of my pants and just like kind\n\n02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:31.960\nof like stare kind of creepily like a fucking...\n\n02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:38.240\nI have a bad pitch, bad pitch, room number.\n\n02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:42.800\nWe keep writing back to the skeletons and saying, we're still looking for him.\n\n02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.520\nI think we're right behind him.\n\n02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:45.520\nGreat.\n\n02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:46.760\nAnd we just keep that going forever.\n\n02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:47.760\nI think that's a great idea.\n\n02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:50.840\nBut we adopt him as a member of our party.\n\n02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:55.480\nAnd so we're always kind of like one step behind him because he's in front of us.\n\n02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:03.880\nAnd then hopefully that'll thwart whatever soul magic is enforcing this dumb magic-packed\n\n02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:05.720\nthing on us.\n\n02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:06.720\nJust to try it.\n\n02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:15.400\nIf we start to get nauseous or he falls out, we kill the Minotaur because he's not a real\n\n02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:16.400\nMinotaur.\n\n02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.400\nHe is.\n\n02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.400\nUtters.\n\n02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:22.880\nDon't look behind you, Spencer's rolling dice when you're talking.\n\n02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:26.480\nBut overall, we're a happy family.\n\n02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:29.000\nIt's not losing our lives.\n\n02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.520\nIt's gaining a party member.\n\n02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.640\nWeren't you saying that not to him?\n\n02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:35.640\nWeren't you saying that like...\n\n02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:36.640\nYeah, saying it to us.\n\n02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:37.640\nYeah.\n\n02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:38.640\nYeah.\n\n02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:40.040\nBut you're looking at me like the Minotaur heard that.\n\n02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.040\nNow I'm turning to look at you.\n\n02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:42.040\nHe was looking at you like Spencer.\n\n02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:43.040\nI'm going.\n\n02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:44.040\nHey, let's go.\n\n02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:45.040\nAnd so it's Karev.\n\n02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.040\nKydef.\n\n02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.040\nKydef.\n\n02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.040\nKarev.\n\n02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:49.040\nMostef.\n\n02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:52.840\nWe would like to welcome you into our happy family.\n\n02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.840\nAwesome, man.\n\n02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:54.840\nCliff Hanger?\n\n02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:55.840\nQuestion mark.\n\n02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.840\nQuestion

02:02:00.840\nI mean, we ended on kind of a peaceful resolution there.\n\n02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:01.840\nYou find that diamond, you may keep it or tell me that you have it.\n\n02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:02.840\nThere's a diamond here.\n\n02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:03.840\nSengedi Geller.\n\n02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:04.840\nKanel.\n\n02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:05.840\nKanel Lajiani.\n\n02:02:05.840 -->
