00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comic Harmontown is now in session!

00:14.000 --> 00:25.000
Let's take this moment to realize that the music that you're hearing over the last three

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
episodes, and this one currently made you, for you, by Shorty White.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
It's so fucking awesome!

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It's bringing us Spencer Crittenden, everybody!

00:38.000 --> 00:47.000
Rob Schwab!

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Thank you!

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Can I get a collective you?

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah, Dave Kline, that's a reference to Dave Kline for new subscribers.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
Dave Kline, can I tell, is it okay to talk about the gift you gave me on the sidewalk?

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
The gift of unsolicited handjobs.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
It was a big giant gold joint.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
The paper was gold.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
24 karat.

01:45.000 --> 01:56.000
And I recently have over-vaped, so I was like, I'll do the Dave Kline joint.

01:56.000 --> 02:06.000
And the last couple of weekends, I've, like, that's some serious fucking yupin.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
That was burpin.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Made my brain go yup.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
What is that? Is that the Indica or the Sativa?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
There's a really magnificent Sativa board there.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Okay, so Sativa, that's my jam.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Now, someone write that down, because I can never remember.

02:22.000 --> 02:32.000
Because my mnemonic device was, like, I would get high and then I would go, all right, all right, I get too high on Indica.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
And then the next time I'd get high, I'd be like, I, what is it? I love Indica.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
What's with the gold, the gold paper? There's paper around it that's gold? What's up with that?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I don't know.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
What's up with that?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So, game-recognized game.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Game-recognized game, he told you.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Oh, I still don't know.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
That's a reference from an old episode of Harmontown where Kumail was out here, right?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh, God, I miss Kumail so much.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
We lost Kumail to Hollywood.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
You know what? Fuck Kumail.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Fuck Kumail.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Like, if Kumail, if he came out right now, I'd punch him in his fucking face.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Kumail Najiani, everybody!

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
What? No!

03:27.000 --> 03:42.000
No!

03:42.000 --> 03:57.000
You know what? Punch him, Dan. Punch him.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
You know, I haven't been here in a while, but I haven't changed. I'm still the same guy.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I've always been.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
We were worried, Kumail, that Hollywood might have changed you a bit.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh, no, no, no.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
The Covert of Wired magazine might have changed.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
No, no, dude, you know me. I'm grounded as fuck.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Both feet on the ground. Nothing is different about me.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
Okay, not to spring a pop quiz on you, but name three of Dr. Friend's attributes.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
He's just very grounded.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Who's Dr. Friend?

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Wasn't that his old D&D character?

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
I mean, his old D&D character is wrong on many levels.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I mean, he never played him, I don't think, right?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
No, I played...

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Once, right?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Christopher, and I played Dr. Friend.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
What's with the crown?

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, oh, this, yeah, I'm sorry, he was cold.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
I was gonna say, it's great that Harmontown has evolved to the point where people are doing walk-on bits now, you know?

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah, heavily visual bits for a podcast.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Last week, Schrab was vacuuming the podium or some shit?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
That was great.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
What was the bit there?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I was vacuuming the podium.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
It was great for the listeners at home.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Why were you vacuuming the podium?

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Rob found a giant stand-up, old-timey, standing vacuum.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
It was dirty.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
And he actually vacuumed my...

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
This is the world's largest podium, right?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah, has it gotten bigger since?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
It feels like it's like growing and encroaching.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Hey, thank you for noticing, Camille.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
By the way, dad has not said a fucking word.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
He was distracted because Laffy Pants is back.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm sorry, it's his laugh.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Who's Laffy Pants?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
He's the happiest guy in the world.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
You can't yell at him for having a laugh.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
His laugh is present.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
He's the guy.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Everyone's always like, who's that laughing?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
No, but that was a different guy.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, it's a different guy.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Oh, wait, what the...

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, tell him whatever...

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Oh, we know, right?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
All right.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Well, I don't get it.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I don't get what's so funny.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
And now I've done it.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Now I feel like I've done a terrible thing.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
What have you done?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Who's the original Laffy Guy?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
That's Doug.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
That's Doug.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
And we have a new Laffy Guy?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yes.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Now, I mean...

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, you've served the laughing crowd.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
There you go.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
More than those two people laugh during the show, I hope.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I know, but you heard his laugh.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And now you can't hear it.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Now I feel like...

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
We killed it.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Yeah, computers.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Is there a way to isolate each of their laughs

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
and have like an American Idol Laff Off kind of thing?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
What if we have a Laff Off right now?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Who can do the greatest thing?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
All right, so nobody...

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Nobody else is allowed to laugh.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Except for Laff...

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
By the way, this is great like for a comedy show.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Don't laugh.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
We're doing a thing.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Okay, Schrab, make...

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Doug...

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
It's not my show.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
It's not my show.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
And Kumail hasn't been here in a while.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, I don't know how this works anymore.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Right.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Help him out.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Is there a way to isolate each laugh

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
so we can find out what makes each laugh different and special

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
in its own way?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
No.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
I don't think there's a way to do that.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Spencer, I think you're selling the show short.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I think probably if I told a joke...

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
But it has to be a joke that's only funny to one...

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah, exactly.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
One of those two and nobody else.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Can we isolate like with a laser, Dan,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
tell each of them like singularly a joke?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, like what's funny to you?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
What's your favorite like topic that's funny

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
that nobody else thinks is funny?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Time travel.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
He likes time travel, Dan.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Tell him a time travel joke.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Tell him a time...

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I already told you one yesterday.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
No, the point is...

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
This is what I was saying.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
This is what I was saying.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Stop laughing!

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Stop it!

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
You're fucking up this shit!

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
You're fucking up the bit!

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Now stop laughing!

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Please tell the joke again.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Stop it!

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
I already told him the joke 30 seconds ago.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Okay.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
All right, we got a taste of that.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
It's not going to work at all.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
No, no, no.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I got a taste of that.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I'm not a fan, so it's yours to lose.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Oh, yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
He won.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
But think of the guy behind him.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You gave him that crown and the guy behind him is like,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
so now his laugh and his head?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm hyper-conscious.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I want everyone to be happy.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Laffer guy number two.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
What is your name?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Lewis.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
We have Doug and Lewis.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Laffer one, Laffer two.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Throughout the show, we're going to find out.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
We're going to...

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'll keep an eye on this.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I have a little chart over here.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm going to be graphing their laughter.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
It's the worst.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
They feel like a supervillain.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm like, who's laughing so mirthily?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
It's terrible.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
What do we need?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah, the hero we need.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Maybe this is the one we deserve.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
All right, now that I've cooled down the crowd,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
we have a lot of friends here tonight.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
And I want to...

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
We have a friend here, you know.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah, hello, Dan.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
I haven't seen you in a week.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I thought we were drifting apart,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
but it's good to know that we're still friends.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I just saw you at dinner.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Have you ever eaten dinner with Rob Schrab in a restaurant?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
No, what's it like?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
It's awesome.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Is it like the waiters?

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Are there any specials in the tropes?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Are there any specials?

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Is it that shit?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
It has been.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Well, let me ask you this.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
The male, do you like vines at any point?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Do you...

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Do you really enjoy vines?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Like vines, yeah, like on the Vine app.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Do you like vines?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Do you like the vines?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
They're vines.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I feel like I'm being set up for some vines.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Have you ever enjoyed a vine at all?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Are you familiar with vines?

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Do you like vines in your mouth?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah, I've enjoyed a vine or two in my day.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Would you like the person sitting next to you in a public restaurant

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
to watch his favorite vines at full volume?

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Well, you don't talk to me.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm sitting there waiting for my food, food like a boob.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I tell you, turn it down.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
You don't respond to that.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
And then I go, what do you want to talk about?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, because I'm fucking like...

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
I'm writing down on my phone into my Harmontown topic list.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Talk about this guy.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Fucking address this shit.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Attention must be paid.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
What was the vine that was...

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I'll be the mediator.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
What was the vine that was so urgent?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
There's a couple of them.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah, the best one was one that definitely involved a fart

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
because it was like on a loop.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Wobba-jobba!

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Wobba-jobba!

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Wobba-jobba!

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
And people are just looking and...

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
What is the restaurant?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
What restaurant?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
What's the level of restaurant we're talking about?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Spargos.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
No, it was Chibo across the street, but it's a fucking club.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Chibo?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
You're McDonald's?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I see people who are Chibo all the time.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
No!

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
What was the...

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Let's listen to it and see.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
You ready for some fun?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Are you ready for some fun?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
You ready for some fun?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
You ready for some fun?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
You ready for some fun?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
You ready for some fun?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
You ready for some fun?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
You ready for some fun?

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
If they're in awards or world's best podcasts

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
what is the Emmy...

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
If they're in Emmys or Toneys or…

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
He's thinking...

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
I don't think anybody could hear it.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Was that this was happening today, earlier today?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Everybody was in time.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
And everybody else was having a ball.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Everybody was like, oh, I want to look at it.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Oh, my God.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
It's so funny.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
So funny.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
This is great.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Oh, my God.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
You sent me to...

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And then...

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Bum, bum, bum.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Just turn it down.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Dan says, stop.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Can you please turn down your vine?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I'm trying to eat my bread here.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I don't say that.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Your vines are disrupting my enjoyment of this.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
I'm not mine.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Strangers.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
They were loving it, too.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
A guy on the way out was like, hey, you know, I'm not a fan of that shit, but you really,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
you know, took it above.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Okay.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Well, just...

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
You don't know.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
You don't know.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
This is you, like, blinders.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
You don't care.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
You don't care.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm the only one that's aware of strangers in public when I'm with you.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
You know, I've missed this.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
All right.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Chris?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Let's bring out a friend of yours.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, bring up our friend.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
A new friend of mine.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
He's...

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
Well, you know, look.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Here's the thing.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
Hulu has an original series called Ghost Balloon.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
It's about a guy with a ghost balloon.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
That's right.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
You've seen the billboards.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
It's a guy holding a balloon.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
It's a ghost.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
It's actually called Dead Beat.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It's a Hulu original series.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
It's about a guy named Pac who can see ghosts and he helps them finish their...

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
I saw it on one of those bus stop couches.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
And I never got...

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Couches.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Bus stop couches.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Bus stop couches.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Are you a Beverly Hill Billy?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Yes.

14:21.000 --> 14:31.000
For people that don't live in LA, if you live somewhere else, our bus stops have couches.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I always like the tagline of this show because I don't...

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Because it's...

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
He helps ghosts, can't help himself.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
And I don't know if it's like, is it...

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
He helps ghosts.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
He can't help himself.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Or he helps ghosts.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
He can't help himself.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Well, let's get some information.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Please welcome Tyler Labine.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Wow.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
That was a classic, classic introduction to a guy that you really don't know.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yeah.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
I really... Thank you for dressing up for the show, by the way.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
You're dressed for a night in.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I got my pink flamingo shorts on.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
I don't know if anybody's noticed that, but...

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I'm jealous.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I mean, you know, not everyone can pull these off.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I'm jealous of those shorts.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I'm jealous of those calves.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
They're muscular, muscular calves.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Yeah.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Spencer, you have great calves, Spencer.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
My calves are great, yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
And yet you still aspire to Tyler's calves.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
I find that from carrying around this, this giant lumbering frame,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I tend to get very, very nice definition in my calves.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Exactly.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
You guys know guys who wear shorts a lot because you're fat.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
You know what I'm talking about.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Tyler, the fourth season of Deadbeat.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
No, no.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
The impending fourth season of Deadbeat.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
The third, yeah.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
This is the third one.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
The third is about to come out on Wednesday, yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Oh, okay.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Unless you had a question about the upcoming potential fourth season.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yes.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Put a pin in it.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
We'll come back to that one in like a year from now.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It's because my girlfriend co-created the show,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
so I'm used to talking about the fourth season as the impending season.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
The third season is about to air.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah, or it's about to drop, as they say.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
It's about to drop entirely in binge fashion.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, in classic binging fashion.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
On Hulu.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
On Hulu.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
And by the way, people think that I'm paid,

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
I mean, I am paid by Hulu, not to be here,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
but I think that Hulu, does anybody have Hulu?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Okay, that's a fucking dope platform.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Is it not?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Again, I don't want to come off as one of those guys.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
Guys, I know I'm on a show on Hulu, but Hulu.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Hulu's rad.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
No, Hulu is rad.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
It's good shit.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
It's not as good as CISO though.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
None of you have CISO.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
Talk about a rad platform!

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Platform fight.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Platform wars.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Platform fight.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Go 90.

17:17.000 --> 17:26.000
HBO's been doing some cool stuff recently.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
HBO?

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
HBO Canada's got some pretty tight shit too.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Is that what Deadbeat is on over there?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
No, no, no.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
We're not quality enough for HBO Canada.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
I like Vines.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
All right.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I would like to see that Vines later by the way.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
I'll show it to you.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Oh no.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Let's continue over there.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Wait, wait, wait.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
I got it.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
What the...

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
For the listeners at home, he's going through his Vines.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
I'll get you a good one.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
That was the whole thing.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I was waiting for it to start.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
It's a dog.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
It's going to be on the back of it.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
It turns around he's wearing sunglasses.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Well, now I get it.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Now it is funny.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
That's funny.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I didn't catch it.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
That's an away homer.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I want you to explain it.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
That's an away homer, man.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
All right.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
I was like up till 3.30 in the morning and I'm texting my friends like Vines.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
I text it to Kate and I hear from like the bedroom.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
It's like 3.30 in the morning.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm trying to sleep.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
All right.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Well, someone's got to run this.

18:52.000 --> 19:00.000
Can I just check in right now, I'm keeping a flow chart of Doug and Lewis' laughs.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Right now, I have a Venn diagram.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
The center circle is Crypt Keeper.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
And then there's two offshoots, which is joy and evil.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
And right now, they're completely tied.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
They're joyful slash evil Crypt Keepers.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I'll keep you informed that there's a little update.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
They're both fine.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
You don't feel embarrassed, did you, Lewis?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I didn't mean to.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I mean, obviously, I didn't mean to.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
Why is this guy got a wheel like on his lap?

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
We're looking and no one's addressed the wheel in the room.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
He's got a wheel in it.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
What's the wheel?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Show the wheel.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Show the wheel.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
It's a star of David.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
It's like it's a juicicle.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
It's a juicicle.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
What's a juicicle?

19:53.000 --> 20:02.000
It's a frozen treat that comes out around Ramadan, but it's kosher.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
It's like a pentacle, but it's Jew because it's a star of David.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Is that a functioning tire for your bike?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Doesn't it have a cup holder on it?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
A motorized unicycle?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
You couldn't leave it at home?

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
How would he have gotten here if he'd left it at home?

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Also, how many balls do you have calling that out?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
I saw a guy holding a big metal round thing in his lap, and I was like,

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
what if he stood up and that's how he breathes?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
The guy was like, leave that alone.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
The guy's got equipment.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
There's no room.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
You gotta stand.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
It's a standing unicycle.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
That's why it's cheaper.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
No, no. There's no way. What are you talking about?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
All right.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
This is...

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
All right.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
This is a terrible idea.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm very nervous right now.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
The front row is so upset about this.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
It's a joke. It doesn't actually work, does it?

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

21:26.000 --> 21:36.000
You did it. Best podcast ever.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I have a question.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Nick in his magical juicicle.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
That was amazing.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
I have a question. I have two questions.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
I have a thousand questions.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Are you Jewish?

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
I'm 63.125.

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
That's such a Jew answer.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
Our next guest is my insurance agent.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
By the way, that would have easily, like, eight people could have sued us.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
What I'm blown away by is the engineering of that.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Like, how does that work? That's so cool.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
Upon first viewing, that looks like an impossible feat that you just did.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
So the pedals just spin.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
Like, the inside, the rim, if you will, spun independently of them.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I was like, that doesn't make any sense.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Does the star of David, is that an important functional piece,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
or is that just for design purposes?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
It's structural. It's structurally very sound.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Is it called a JunoCycle?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Did he say that? What's what it's called?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
A JewCycle.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
He said JewCycle.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I got it mixed up.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Can you walk faster than you can do that?

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
Walk faster.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
You don't know.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
That's not a more efficient way to get around.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
Nick, try walking, and then you don't have to carry that thing around.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
Nick, I'm assuming it's a lot harder than riding a regular Unicycle with a seat, right?

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Well, it took me about a week and a half to learn to ride a regular Unicycle,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
and this took me six weeks.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Six weeks, okay.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
But you had already learned how to ride a regular Unicycle.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
So, yes.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Let's not start from scratch.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Can you pick that up first?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I have a question. Why?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Are you like a performer?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I'm a serious question. Are you like a performer,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
or is it just like you were like, I want to do this?

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
Well, I just think, well, I learned how to ride a Unicycle,

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
and I got bored with it, and then I found this on YouTube,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
and I said, I want to do that.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
I want to try it.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
That makes sense.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Not here, not on this stage, but I want to try it.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
But isn't there like a chain that you can lock it up outside?

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
I like that he's assuming people are going to steal it.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Well, I mean, you can't just leave it laying out.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Someone would steal it, but I guess like...

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Nick, do you want to set it down up here?

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah, you can put it up there for the sake of your neighbors.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah, just the streets of Los Angeles are on that thing.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
All right. Jeff just left with it.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Sid, it's been stolen.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
So that proves the theory right there.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Tyler, tell us about your show Deadbeat.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
That's a nice natural segue.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I can't stop thinking.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
I thought that was like a Captain America shield.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I thought you were sitting there holding like a shield,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
but just got it like really wrong.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Wouldn't lift it up.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
But then all I saw was a little bit of steel and rubber,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
and I just assumed like that may be holding that man's body together.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
And Schrab's like, what's with that shit?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I was like, oh man.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
I did have like a half second of...

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
It might be a collapsible wheelchair.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Right, right, right.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
This could go badly.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Touchy subject.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Anyways, Deadbeat.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Yes, Deadbeat.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
I can't seem to make myself talk about this show.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
My boss is in the audience too.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Your girlfriend.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I should probably talk about it.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Yeah, it's the third season.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
I think you covered a lot of it.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I hold a ghost balloon.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
I hold a balloon a lot.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
There's a lot of yellow in the show.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Is balloon actually a part of it?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Oh, balloon's a big part of the show.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Yeah, balloon's a big part of the show.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I mean, at least for the first like season,

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
and then people realize that balloon was not...

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
It always seemed to me...

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Super.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
You and the balloon are kind of like a Sam and Diane kind of thing.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Like, will they want that?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Yeah, will they want that?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
It's like, are they or aren't they?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
You know?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Will they want they?

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
It always seemed to me when I was driving by those billboards,

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
when I knew what the show was,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
that I would look at the key art and I would go,

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
okay, somebody at Hulu decided that they didn't want the show

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
to be perceived as like a nerdy show

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
because it's really about a guy who can see ghosts

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
and who helps them finish their business.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
That's what the show's like.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
It has nothing to do with the balloon, honestly.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
So then the key art seems to be engineered to be like,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
yeah, but it's about people too.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Yeah, and I think somebody in R&D was like,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
and yellow makes people think happy thoughts

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
and it also makes them hungry.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
So we should use yellow.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
What's that?

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Is it a drama or a comedy?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
It's a comedy.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
It literally has nothing to do with balloons.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
It has nothing to do with it.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
No.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Well, it's a good pitch for a show,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
which the key art never really made clear,

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
which is that it's a dude who can see ghosts,

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
but he's a loser.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm a total fucking loser.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Oh, so it's drug addicts.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
And he can't help himself.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Yeah, your first instinct was right.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Okay.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
No, he can't help himself.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
But do you...

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
and been helping the ghosts?

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah, I can help them, but I can't help myself.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
You can't help yourself helping them?

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
No, I think you're hung up on that.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Okay.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
I really am.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Yeah, I guess now it's become less about the emphasis.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
So you're a loser.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
You can't help yourself, but you can help these ghosts.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Yeah, I can help other people,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
but I don't know how to make my own life work,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
if that makes sense.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
But here are some reasons to watch the show,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
even though it's already been on for nine seasons.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Yeah.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
You're going at your tenth season now, right?

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Yeah, the eleventh season is coming out.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I was just at the premiere of, well,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
and you showed episode 311, which, you know,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
they're all dropping at the same time on 420,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Pneumonic device.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Check it out, 420.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I saw the, it was the LARPing one.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Yeah.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
It was very cohesive.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I was from talking to my lover,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
who helped create the show.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Talk about that one.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Her insights of like, oh, there's like,

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
you know, this fact of serializing this,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I was like, oh, I'm not going to understand,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I'm just dropping into the thing,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
but that's a nice little episode about it.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Yeah, it was a good little stand-align.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
That's why they put it on at the premiere party.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
At the premiere, because they were afraid

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
there would be new viewers at the premiere.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Yeah, like, what the fuck is this all about?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
They'd be judging it like, fuck this, I don't get it.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
I end up here.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
They knew I was coming.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
But yeah, we lampooned pretty much every, like,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
style of film.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
And, you know, we did the LARPing thing.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
We did the Thomas Crown affair.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I almost said Crown Royal affair.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
We do like a fight club one.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Who said tight?

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Sight.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Who said that?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Velvet, nice tight velvet bag, bro.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
He raised his hand like with devil horn,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
which is the least surprising thing

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
for a guy who just yelled tight to do.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
And then take a bow.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
On brand.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
That guy is holding it like a giant tall boy

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Takate right there.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Perfect.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Huh?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
You're not?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
What is that?

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
The tall boy.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Yeah.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
It's a strong arena.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah, so that's basically the show.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
It's like, I feel like, did you guys know

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Being There, Peter Sellers?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Yeah.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
That was what I, I know Cody had a different

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
inspiration for the show, but I always like

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
to liken the character to Chauncey Gardner.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
He's just an idiot who's failing upwards

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
and can't, can't help himself.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I have a question.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Are there a different ghost each episode

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
or are there, you have like a crew of ghosts

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
that you're afraid of?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
No, it's like a ghost of the week.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
And we have one, we did have one ghost

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
that followed, which was sort of the

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
balloon, I guess, if it had to be.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Do you have like a ghost?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Is there like a blob?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
He was a blob.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Is there like a underwater ghost?

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
Or there's like a ghost like bull or something

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
like that.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And there's like, you know, like,

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
That's not like people, like dead, like normal,

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
like just dead people.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
There's like, like a mummy, but it's a ghost mummy.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
It's a guy who's, who's wrapped up with bandages

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
and he just suffocated so he came back as a ghost.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Tyler, Tyler, keep going, you're getting close.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Rob is unemployed right now.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
He's trying to, he's trying to pitch himself

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
as a director.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
He's just trying to get some shit going.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
So this is a fantasy of yours.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You want to play a ghost mummy on a...

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Yeah, I want to watch it.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Oh, you want to watch it?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Okay.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I don't really, yeah.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
How long are the people who are ghosts?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
How long have they been dead?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Are they like recent?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Or is it also like from 1800s?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
It's like dinosaurs.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
There we go.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Let's just keep it to people.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Just keep it to people.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
I don't know.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Yeah.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Well, I mean...

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
There's a good episode.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
A ghost dinosaur.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Yeah.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
You guys see a whole like language barrier thing

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
would come up.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Yeah.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
You know.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
There would be misunderstandings all over the place.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
It would be cuckoo.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
What business would a dinosaur need to finish?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Yeah, I don't know.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
That would be all.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
If that was possible.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Yeah.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
There would be ghost dinosaurs everywhere

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
because they all...

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
They never...

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Yeah.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
They're a fucking meteor hit.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Well, maybe that was their business.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
They were kind of like, maybe they stuck around

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
because he was like,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
we kind of need you to help us like solve

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
this whole extinction thing.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Yeah.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Could you go back and help us?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
But that would be every episode.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
That would be like your static.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
You'd be like,

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
are you a fucking dinosaur?

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
You died in a meteor.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Yeah.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Maybe they're after the meteor.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
What?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Revenge.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Oh, we do have a meteor after the meteor.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Oh, they're a ghost.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
They hate meteors.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Yeah.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Tyler, would you like a drink?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Do you...

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
I'm gonna...

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
My doctor told me not to drink anymore

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
after Wednesday night.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
This is a true story.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
What happened?

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
I just exploded.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
My whole insides exploded basically.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
What kind of doctor do you have

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
if that's the diagnosis he's giving you?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Are you a ghost?

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Yeah, basically.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Hey, he helped himself.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
I have looked.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
No, he could find me.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Help himself.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Is that why the billboard doesn't...

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
It's just you and a balloon?

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Because you're the ghost?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Finally.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
You guys finally got it.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
You got it.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
A short answer is no.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Thank you, Dan.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
I'm okay.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Whoa!

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Right through.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Whoa!

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Oh!

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Whoa!

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
But you're touching me.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
You're physically touching me.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
No, I didn't.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
I can't.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
You're a ghost.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Wait, but what happened with the...

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
What happened on Wednesday night?

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
Oh, now that I just drank a lot on Wednesday night,

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
and I've been having...

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
I've been having a lot of gastrointestinal issues, guys.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
A lot of diarrhea.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
A lot of unexplained sounds and pains,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and I've just been drinking my way through it,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
which my wife thinks is a bad idea.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
My doctor does, too.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
I saw you at the premiere.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Yeah, and I was drinking a lot.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
And you were like,

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
I can't wait to come drink on the show.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Yeah, I was like,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm gonna bring you a bottle of booze and everything.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
And I was like,

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
there's booze there.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
And you were like,

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
yeah, but there won't be enough.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
And then we split up,

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
and then you walked into the spinning propeller of a plane.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Yeah.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
And I died, and now I'm here.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Yeah, no.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Basically, my doctor...

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
This is so stupid.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Why am I fucking telling this?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
No, this is important.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Are you kidding me?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
This is the second act of any hermitage.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
I'm not kidding you right now,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
but I was moments ago.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
There are issues going on with me and my guts.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
We are yet to be determined in my doctor.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
How long have you had these?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
It's about three months.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Gut?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
I was shooting season three of Deadbeat.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I almost killed myself in New York with food,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
but there's just lots of food and alcohol.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Because that's what they pay you at Hulu.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Yeah, they pay you at Hulu.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
They're like, here's more crackers.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah, here's some more crackers,

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
and here's some,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
at least they give me some T-Dos once in a while.

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
But I got some sort of elimination diet thing going on in my doctor.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I said, why don't we just start with alcohol?

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
We'll start with alcohol and see where we go from there.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
And then it'll be like,

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
oh, now it's bananas,

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
and now it's avocado,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
man, I would start with bananas.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I know, right?

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
He got me worried though.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
This is a Western medicine doctor.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I think I should go to see some,

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
like on purpose I should go see some really hokey-whackies.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
This is an easy thing to eliminate first.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Yeah, eliminate first is the thing you drink for fun.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Like, I would be like,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
eliminate every fucking thing until then,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
because that's my toe hold.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Because once you eliminate that,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I'm like, I'm dead.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Like, eliminate avocado, eliminate toast,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
eliminate church.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I'm thinking, I'm thinking long game.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
I'm thinking like,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I don't want to have to eliminate booze forever.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
So if I eliminate it now and figure out some shit,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
maybe I can drink in like a month.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, I hear you.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Rather than just keep drinking through.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
And they're like, well, you were fine a month ago,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
and then you drank a hole in your guts.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Yeah, I don't know.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
And now you can't do it anymore.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I have had some serious intestinal problems,

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
but they cleared up right after I stopped going to church, so.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Oh, yeah.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I would definitely try that.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Alright, so maybe I should start with church.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Maybe I should start with giving up church.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
That's why I've never had gastrointestinal problems.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Must be nice.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Muslim privilege.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
Hashtag third world problems.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
What if we turn the tables?

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Third world problems.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Oh, great.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
I don't know where you're going with that.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
You're eating rust from a bowl again.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Camille, what have you been up to, Superstar?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Can we talk about your project?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Or is that a secret?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
No, what project?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Your movie.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
No, we can talk about it.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Oh, yeah.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Well, Silicon Valley comes back April 24th,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
and that's going to be great.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
That's going to be great.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
And then I think we...

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
I mentioned the movie here once before, right?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
He doesn't pay attention.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Yeah.

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
He doesn't pay attention.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Alright.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Emily and I wrote a movie.

35:33.000 --> 35:42.000
Unless your vine is louder than his bread.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Since you've eliminated alcohol,

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
have you experienced any relief from your symptoms?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
You mean in the last two days?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
I'm trying to help you.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Don't fucking turn on me.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
No, I haven't.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
I haven't.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Well, it's been four.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
What's the day? Sunday?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
I never know what day the week it is.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Sunday.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
So your last track, Wednesday?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
On Wednesday.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Friday. Friday.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
So I had about two days of real excruciating stomach pain.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
That's why I stopped, because I couldn't stand up.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
You think it's ulcers?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Yeah, it might be ulcerative colitis assumption.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
I don't know what it is.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
But all I know is that after that drinking,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and there was like two nights of drinking before that,

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
that set me off.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Yeah.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
But in the last four days, I feel good.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
I just drink like double vodka on the rocks,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
which may have also something to do with...

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
Yeah.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
Oh, is that your drink, too?

36:34.000 --> 36:41.000
Dan wanted to hear you say anything other than that answer.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
It's the best drink on the face of the planet.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I mean, just vodka and ice is like...

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And you got to drink it before the ice melts,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
because otherwise you get watery booze,

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
and then you drink, you know...

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Yeah, it goes, it's good.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
And you don't want to drink any water by mistake.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
No, no, no, no.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Wow.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Not at all.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
You don't know what's in that shit.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
You don't know what they put in that shit.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
It's a race against time.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
And I always win.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
I win that race, usually.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
Dan was hoping you were going to say margaritas.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
Or vitamin water.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I drink a lot of moon juice.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
I'm resigned to the fact that each of us are snowflakes,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
and we don't...

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
I mean, I'm not...

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
My big fear is like, you know,

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
when people, like, their obituaries happen,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
and then everybody's like...

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I guess that's my way of saying they die.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
You know, their obituaries happen.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Oh, my God.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
No, there's no recipe for death.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
We were just talking about this.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Well, Brittany Murphy, remember?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
When her obituary happened?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
She died.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And it was like, oh, her lifestyle,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
and she did this, and she didn't eat,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
and she only put butts on her heads, and whatever.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
Like, everybody just sounded off on how she died,

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
and then moved on, and then her husband died?

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
And it was because their fucking shower had mold in it,

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
and it was like...

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Is that really what it was?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah, black mold, man.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
It'll kill you.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
But it was like, shit, man.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Like, I don't know what the point of that fable is,

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
but it's like...

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Fuck.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
You know, when people die, just fucking say it's tragic.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Yeah, man.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Or when people go out of their way,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
their whole life to be the most healthy part,

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
like, obnoxiously healthy,

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
and then they fucking drop dead in the gym.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
You know, there's no...

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
There is no plan.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
If we had figured it out,

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
there would be a very noticeable disparity

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
between doctor life spans and patient life spans.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
It never happens.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
We've spent all this money going to these guys

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
that are doctors or ladies.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Doctors can be ladies.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Guys is unisex.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Guys is unisex.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
But it's all their life spans are random, you know?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Like, they're like,

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
you should eat more peanuts.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
They're like, well, what do you do?

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
You're going to die randomly, too.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
That's the point.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
That was the whole point in a nutshell.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
You're going to die randomly.

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
I've met more old doctors and comedians.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
It's an astute observation.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
I think that's fair.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
That's fair.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
That's because as a comedian,

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
you're constantly going to the doctor.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
All right.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
Fair enough.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I don't know, man.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
No, that would be noticeable.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
People would be like,

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
Tyler just told you that drinking double vodka is killing him.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Yeah, but what he's saying is that's killing me.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
That doesn't mean it's going to kill him.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
It's random.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
He's not the same.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Tyler has me.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
I don't want anybody out there thinking

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
that this is some sort of fucking PSA

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
for not drinking vodka.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Drink vodka.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Drink vodka, man.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I wish I could drink vodka with you right now.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Until your stomach bleeds and then stop.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Yeah, and then be like,

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
is there some way to retroactively fix this,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
put a band-aid on it,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and then start drinking again as soon as possible.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Ron Funches did a Great Minds.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
He's allergic to alcohol.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
I was like, oh, like allergic to alcohol,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
like you drink it and then you get really drunk.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
No, allergic to alcohol,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
like if Ron Funches takes a drink.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Anaphylactic.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Yeah, his throat closes up.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
I was like, can you imagine being a high schooler?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Oh, no, I don't want to.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
I'm allergic to it.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Yeah, fuck you, pussy.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
And like, I bet you he found himself

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
on the floor of a lot of parties and like,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
oh, shame, shame, shame.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Like, we're not all the same.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Shame, shame, shame.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
We're not all the same.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
I just had an image of him like succumbing to peer pressure.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Like, drink, drink, drink.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
And he's like, all right, let me get my EpiPen.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Yeah.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Yeah, I mean, that's like.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Where's the orange for this guy?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I don't know, like I smoke some weed

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
and I start checking my polls and freaking out.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
And like, the angels are talking to me.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Yeah.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
And then Spencer's like, like, you know,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
eats a brick of hash for this breakfast

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
and to keep his hands steady.

40:51.000 --> 41:01.000
That's fresh ice that I poured for the next person.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
You can use that.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
That's so thoughtful.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Keep talking.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
No, I'm talking.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And of course, Jeff is a slave to.

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
You guys fling a craven on me.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I don't know what that craven thinks.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Decent.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Decent pour.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Decent pour.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
You are.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
You haven't.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
I approve.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
You haven't had to drink in two days, right?

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Four days.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
No, I'm okay.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Yeah.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
But I go through.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
I go through bouts of not drinking often.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I have two small children and a third one on the way.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
And thank you.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
And I find that it's not it's not so much that it's the drinking.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
It's the recovery.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Do your kids drink?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Yeah, they drink.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Man, guys.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Somebody's got to stay in control.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Someone's got to be lucid, you know.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Now, the morning, the morning, the 515.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
You're like the designated driver these days.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Yeah, it's bullshit.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
How old are your kids?

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I have a five-year-old girl, a two-and-a-half-year-old boy,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
and a 10-and-a-half-week-old.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
That one's a ghost.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
That one's a ghost.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
That one's a ghost.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
That one's a ghost.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Yeah.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
No spoilers.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
Inspired by Ghost Balloon.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
His third kid's a balloon.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
You have three children?

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
No, two with a third.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
One is still so tiny.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I shouldn't even be talking about it right now.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Third is imminent.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Well, no.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
It's like, it's literally, it's a 10-and-a-half-week-old fetus.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Oh, so many of them.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
I told my mom yet.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
I don't think my mom knows yet.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Maybe she listens to Harmontown.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Does your mom listen to Harmontown?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Yeah.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
She's a big fan.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
This is the plan.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
This is why I'm here.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Yeah.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I'm having a third baby.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
Are you, are you Catholic?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
No, I'm nothing.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Some people want children.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
You know what it is?

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
I really, I really like the feeling of coming in my way.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
That called me crazy.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
I don't know.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
I just like it.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
I was willing to throw it all away for that one.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
And she's like, well, oh, God.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Here he goes again.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
We'll see.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
That makes two of us, Taylor.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Yeah.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Right, so.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Oh, oh, you mean coming in my wife?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
I get it.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
He just gave me a pin.

43:17.000 --> 43:24.000
I'm just saying, if your third child comes out wearing a suit, I know who to call.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
We'll wait till that.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Again, put a pin in that.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
We'll put a pin in that.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
The slogan of this podcast is, he comes in his wife and we can't help ourselves.

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
Which is, it's, can you read it the right way?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It almost works better for that.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
He comes in his wife.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Can't help himself.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Comes in his wife.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Comes in his wife.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
He can't help himself, though.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
He can't, he comes in his wife.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Can't come in himself.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
That's not true, though.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
I mean, I could.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Okay, you can.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
You have to get your wrist going.

43:58.000 --> 44:03.000
Yeah, there's a thing, I think it's called like retro grid ejaculation where you just come up inside your bladder.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Oh yeah, that's no good.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
That doesn't happen to everybody in here?

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
Is that like a choice you make as you're coming like inside and then it goes inside?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
I don't know.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
I just, I just.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Do you choose or is that a condition?

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
I just read, I just read about it.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I know, I know as much about it as you do.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
If you yell inside in Latin as you're coming, you just come inside yourself.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
I don't know.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
I just thought it was something that everybody had experienced at one point.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Every time I've come, I've come outside.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Yeah, yeah, that's why it's called retro grid.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I've never had like reverse orgasms.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Well, let me tell you something.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
It feels horrible.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
What are you talking about when you pinch the, yeah.

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
No, the only reason I actually know this is because Dr. Drew Pinsky explained it to me once.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
I'm not blind.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Apparently what happens is if you.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
Did he explain it to you or was it on the radio and you heard it?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah, I was on his show.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Oh, okay.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
So both.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
It was in the green room.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Yeah.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Split the difference.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Let's bring him out.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
He can explain it to you.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Dr. Drew, come on.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
I think it's one of those things where if you try to stop the E-jack for too long.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Yes.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
E-jack.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
E-jack.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
This is my theory.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Not do it.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
And I guess it can eventually, because it doesn't go back up inside of your nuts.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
It goes back up your urethra and part so it can end up in your bladder.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Why are you stopping it?

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
You pee out your.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Because you want to fuck longer.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Yeah, are you like, people call, is something called edging, I think, where you just keep fucking.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Never heard of it.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Almost there.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Never heard of it.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Yeah.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Well, there's a thing called edging.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Yeah.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Yeah.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Yeah.

45:35.000 --> 45:44.000
Now, for the Harmontown listeners that have not paid $5 a month to see the live stream,

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
Tyler is currently edging Rob Schrab right now.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Only $5 a month.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
You get to see.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Okay.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
So what are you doing?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
He's getting an education.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Okay.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
All right.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Don't encourage that.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Have a vodka.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Have a.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
No.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
No word plan.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
No sports.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
That was great.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Sorry.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
I only have two rules.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
But wait.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
I want to talk about this, obviously.

46:11.000 --> 46:19.240
But when you're talking about not wanting to orgasm for a while, that's different from

46:19.240 --> 46:20.240
pinching the tip.

46:20.240 --> 46:21.240
No, but they're not.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.240
It's not pinching.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.240
It's like hold.

46:23.240 --> 46:24.240
Right.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.240
It's like, it's not literally like you.

46:25.240 --> 46:28.560
It has already happened and you're, it's at the tip and you're just stopping it.

46:28.560 --> 46:29.560
That would just eventually come out.

46:29.560 --> 46:33.240
I think it's like, it's like, it's like the active.

46:33.240 --> 46:40.640
It's the act of actively going to stop, go, stop, ejaculation, if you do that long enough,

46:40.640 --> 46:41.640
you can come inside.

46:41.640 --> 46:44.360
Like thinking about, I know you hate this, but like, you know, when people think about

46:44.360 --> 46:47.640
baseball, when they're fucking, do not come.

46:47.640 --> 46:48.640
It's like that.

46:48.640 --> 46:56.720
Red light, green light, red light, green light, like if you're about to come, you go red light

46:56.720 --> 46:57.720
and then you stop.

46:57.720 --> 47:04.720
Then you come inside you, if you red light too many times, Tyler, you start going the

47:04.720 --> 47:05.720
wrong way.

47:05.720 --> 47:09.880
I genuinely feel like I still want to open this up to the, to the crowd and have other

47:09.880 --> 47:14.800
people talk about their experiences with, with, to a great, spectacular, and you, you

47:14.800 --> 47:17.440
think you have felt the repercussions of that?

47:17.440 --> 47:18.720
No, I've never had it happen to me.

47:18.720 --> 47:19.720
I've had it explained to me.

47:19.720 --> 47:22.400
Is this a wives tale or a husband's tale or a thing?

47:22.400 --> 47:23.920
It's a Dr. Drew Pinsky tale.

47:23.920 --> 47:26.360
It's a, it's a, and if he says it, it's got to be true.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.160
I think it's a thing that happens.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.800
What would be the worst possible scenario that that?

47:30.800 --> 47:31.800
I don't know.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.320
I'm not an expert on this.

47:33.320 --> 47:37.320
I just think, I think if you, I mean, if you imagine, you know, infection or maybe some

47:37.320 --> 47:38.760
kind of sepsis or something.

47:38.760 --> 47:43.200
Yeah, you go, no, there is a, well, look, I, like, what I've read about this is that

47:43.200 --> 47:46.440
there are, there are, he's read about it too.

47:46.440 --> 47:54.200
There are men who are into the idea of you actually physically, like, restrain the actual

47:54.200 --> 47:55.200
emission.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.200
Oh, right.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.200
It's called the Dr. Drew Pinsky.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.200
Oh!

47:59.200 --> 48:00.200
I guess.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.200
That's been our show.

48:01.200 --> 48:04.440
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

48:04.440 --> 48:05.440
Drive fast.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.440
Take chances.

48:06.440 --> 48:07.440
I don't like it.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.440
I don't like wordplay.

48:08.440 --> 48:13.200
He doesn't like it because if he thought of it, he would have said it.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.720
That's not true.

48:14.720 --> 48:15.720
That's not true.

48:15.720 --> 48:16.720
So true.

48:16.720 --> 48:21.440
I'm, I'm thinking of a thousand puns a minute and just rejecting them.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.000
Give us one you reject it.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
That's a good one.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
That's a good one.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
I like that one.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.320
Uh, uh, uh, why, why are you judging me with your microphone?

48:35.320 --> 48:45.320
That seems like a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

48:45.320 --> 48:54.280
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, and a, a, a, a, a,

48:54.280 --> 49:02.720
a, a, a a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

49:02.720 --> 49:06.200
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a a, a, a, a, a, maybe even better than that.

49:06.200 --> 49:09.240
It's good, it's not good, but it's not bad, it doesn't matter.

49:09.240 --> 49:13.000
I think you could mess up your epididymis, give it some blockage or swelling.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Your epidermis?

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Your skin?

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Epididymis.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Epidymis.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.320
Well, is the epididymis, is that part of the, is that weird?

49:20.320 --> 49:24.000
Is that weird gum, chewed gum looking feeling thing on your testicles?

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
Feeling thing.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
I don't think I have one of those.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
Oh, that's, you gotta get that gum chewed man.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
I think epididymis was the Greek God of shriveling.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.880
No, no, no, I do have that on my testicles, yeah.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.880
Um, anyways.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.880
Do you guys, do you guys come a lot?

49:42.880 --> 49:43.880
Oh.

49:43.880 --> 49:44.880
Yeah.

49:44.880 --> 49:45.880
What do you mean?

49:45.880 --> 49:46.880
Do you mean like a, like a large amount?

49:46.880 --> 49:47.880
This is a sausage party.

49:47.880 --> 49:48.880
Do you mean like number of times?

49:48.880 --> 49:49.880
No, volume, volume.

49:49.880 --> 49:50.880
Oh, yeah.

49:50.880 --> 49:51.880
Oh, yeah.

49:51.880 --> 49:52.880
Not really.

49:52.880 --> 49:53.880
I don't think I'm coming.

49:53.880 --> 49:54.880
I don't, I don't.

49:54.880 --> 49:55.880
Can I get that too?

49:55.880 --> 50:00.880
I don't know what, I don't know how much, I don't know how much other people are popping.

50:00.880 --> 50:08.880
What about Jeff, what about Jeff, what about Jeff, what about Jeff, Jeff, are you coming

50:08.880 --> 50:09.880
a lot?

50:09.880 --> 50:12.840
Jeff, Jeff, are you coming a lot?

50:12.840 --> 50:13.840
Right now?

50:13.840 --> 50:16.920
I'd say regular amount.

50:16.920 --> 50:17.920
Regular amount.

50:17.920 --> 50:18.920
What's a regular amount?

50:18.920 --> 50:20.840
Can I tell a story really quick about this?

50:20.840 --> 50:26.200
So years ago, my, my, my, my friend's wife was going through like an Eastern meds, Chinese

50:26.200 --> 50:27.840
medicine school.

50:27.840 --> 50:28.840
And she was like.

50:28.840 --> 50:33.560
Yeah, well, to become a doctor, like a naturopath or a, or a homeopathic doctor.

50:33.560 --> 50:37.720
It's not a doctor, but you know what I mean, they call themselves doctors.

50:37.720 --> 50:41.320
And she was like, would you come in for my final exam, which is basically me and my,

50:41.320 --> 50:44.720
my professor, and I'm doing an exam on you in front of the professor.

50:44.720 --> 50:45.720
Yes, there were professors.

50:45.720 --> 50:46.720
Loose leaf.

50:46.720 --> 50:47.720
Yeah.

50:47.720 --> 50:48.720
They're professors.

50:48.720 --> 50:49.720
Loose leaf.

50:49.720 --> 50:50.720
Loose leaf.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.720
Loose leaf professors.

50:51.720 --> 50:55.400
And, and I went, I was like, yeah, sure, because she was a friend of mine.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.400
I went in there.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.400
Why am I racing through this?

50:57.400 --> 50:58.400
Jesus.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.400
I was like, I'm panicking.

50:59.400 --> 51:00.400
Take your time.

51:00.400 --> 51:01.400
Take your time.

51:01.400 --> 51:02.400
Take your time.

51:02.400 --> 51:03.400
Everybody take it fucking easy.

51:03.400 --> 51:04.400
Let him tell his side.

51:04.400 --> 51:05.400
Yeah, I'm like trying to just like get through it before someone says something, and then

51:05.400 --> 51:06.400
start over.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.400
Okay.

51:07.400 --> 51:08.400
So because of all that sublimated cum you have.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.400
Oh God.

51:09.400 --> 51:13.240
It's all, it's all so backed up.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.800
You get to dilute that with vodka.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.480
I wish.

51:17.480 --> 51:19.820
Oh, come on, man.

51:19.820 --> 51:21.900
That's not, God.

51:21.900 --> 51:22.900
Just tell the story.

51:22.900 --> 51:23.900
All right.

51:23.900 --> 51:24.900
So here we go.

51:24.900 --> 51:25.900
Really quick.

51:25.900 --> 51:34.420
I went into the classroom, guess it's called a classroom, and the professor is in there.

51:34.420 --> 51:39.220
And he's got like eight students in there, as well as my friend Sarah, who's giving

51:39.220 --> 51:40.220
me the exam.

51:40.220 --> 51:43.100
And I was like, I thought it was just going to be me and you and your professor.

51:43.100 --> 51:44.900
And she was like, no, no, no, it's got to be in front.

51:44.900 --> 51:45.900
So can you lay down on the exam table?

51:45.900 --> 51:46.900
I'm going to do some stuff.

51:46.900 --> 51:49.060
And I was like, I thought it was all going to be like questions or whatever.

51:49.060 --> 51:50.060
So she lays me down.

51:50.060 --> 51:53.620
She starts doing some like feely, touchy feely stuff, checking out my vital organs and what

51:53.620 --> 51:56.340
I'm not asking me questions along the way.

51:56.340 --> 51:57.340
Yeah.

51:57.340 --> 52:00.340
So one of the questions was, how often do you masturbate?

52:00.340 --> 52:03.500
And there's nine grown adults right there.

52:03.500 --> 52:05.980
And I'm like, whatever, that's all right.

52:05.980 --> 52:10.060
I masturbate frequently, let's say like two, three times a week, which is a lie.

52:10.060 --> 52:11.300
It's like five times a week.

52:11.300 --> 52:12.300
What?

52:12.300 --> 52:13.300
Yeah.

52:13.300 --> 52:14.300
Yeah.

52:14.300 --> 52:15.300
And that's below.

52:15.300 --> 52:17.100
But I just want to be feeling self-conscious.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.780
I'm surrounded by nine people.

52:18.780 --> 52:19.980
Five times a week?

52:19.980 --> 52:24.140
So I lied about the amount, but now I'm realizing that I'm in a room with many more people

52:24.140 --> 52:27.140
in it.

52:27.140 --> 52:29.980
All of whom jerk off three times a day minimum.

52:29.980 --> 52:30.980
Yeah.

52:30.980 --> 52:31.980
I just, before we move on.

52:31.980 --> 52:33.980
Oh, so I'm like a, I'm a pillar of my strength.

52:33.980 --> 52:34.980
Yeah.

52:34.980 --> 52:35.980
You're like a creaker.

52:35.980 --> 52:36.980
Yeah.

52:36.980 --> 52:37.980
Yeah.

52:37.980 --> 52:42.780
So I think, you know, I'm not super comfortable with this line of questioning.

52:42.780 --> 52:47.700
And then inevitably she, she says, so how much do you ejaculate?

52:47.700 --> 52:49.180
And again, this is in front of a bunch of people.

52:49.180 --> 52:52.980
And they're all like scribbling on pads and looking at me like, this is going down in

52:52.980 --> 52:55.020
some medical text.

52:55.020 --> 52:56.020
Is it?

52:56.020 --> 52:57.020
Yes.

52:57.020 --> 52:58.020
It's called a medical text.

52:58.020 --> 52:59.020
Is it on papyrus?

52:59.020 --> 53:00.020
Is it a scroll?

53:00.020 --> 53:01.020
Yeah.

53:01.020 --> 53:02.020
It's on papyrus.

53:02.020 --> 53:03.020
Yes.

53:03.020 --> 53:04.020
Yeah.

53:04.020 --> 53:05.020
So it's written in calligraphy.

53:05.020 --> 53:06.020
Yeah.

53:06.020 --> 53:07.460
Also, all in Mandarin calligraphy.

53:07.460 --> 53:10.500
The professor or witch doctor.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.300
You have to know how to convert into metric.

53:12.300 --> 53:13.300
Yeah.

53:13.300 --> 53:14.300
Yeah.

53:14.300 --> 53:15.300
Yeah.

53:15.300 --> 53:16.300
Well, this is in Canada.

53:16.300 --> 53:17.300
So we were, yeah, we were already metric.

53:17.300 --> 53:18.300
It's all metric.

53:18.300 --> 53:19.300
Yeah.

53:19.300 --> 53:24.860
But I'm just looking at her like, you fucking asshole, you ambushed me with this weird ass

53:24.860 --> 53:27.300
test in front of all your friends.

53:27.300 --> 53:28.780
And she's like, how much do you ejaculate?

53:28.780 --> 53:31.580
And I was just like, this is a real critical moment in my life.

53:31.580 --> 53:35.140
I'm like, do I totally exaggerate and make myself like, is that a thing?

53:35.140 --> 53:36.140
Is it like, how would you say it?

53:36.140 --> 53:39.140
Like, well, that's what I was like, well, do you mean in like teaspoons, tablespoons?

53:39.140 --> 53:44.140
Uh, you know, we're talking about her ladle, and she was like, she was like, she was only

53:44.140 --> 53:48.580
doing this right, I don't know, like, like, what's she doing?

53:48.580 --> 53:49.580
What is that?

53:49.580 --> 53:50.580
What is that?

53:50.580 --> 53:53.580
Like, as if it landed on the ground and it just, it just oozed out into her perfectly.

53:53.580 --> 53:58.860
Did she think you're coming a glom or was like, I was making like a fucking tennis ball

53:58.860 --> 53:59.860
of cum?

53:59.860 --> 54:02.260
Like, as if I was making like, like, cum pancakes.

54:02.260 --> 54:03.260
I had a ladle.

54:03.260 --> 54:04.260
Oh yeah.

54:04.260 --> 54:05.260
Put it in there.

54:05.260 --> 54:06.260
There we go.

54:06.260 --> 54:07.260
Okay.

54:07.260 --> 54:08.260
Are they kid sized, cum pancakes?

54:08.260 --> 54:09.260
Yeah.

54:09.260 --> 54:10.760
Child, like children sized, cum pancakes.

54:10.760 --> 54:13.660
I'm something like a Belgian waffle the bottle.

54:13.660 --> 54:14.660
Over a dollar.

54:14.660 --> 54:18.340
I can make, I can make a Mickey Mouse cake for you.

54:18.340 --> 54:20.940
So I just basically, it was like, I was like, yeah.

54:20.940 --> 54:21.940
Yeah.

54:21.940 --> 54:22.940
Yeah.

54:22.940 --> 54:23.940
What is she doing?

54:23.940 --> 54:24.940
What does that mean?

54:24.940 --> 54:25.940
I don't know.

54:25.940 --> 54:29.380
And then, and then, and then I basically finished the exam and left and she gave me a whole

54:29.380 --> 54:32.980
bunch of little meds that looked like rabbit poo pellets.

54:32.980 --> 54:35.380
And this will help with your ejaculation.

54:35.380 --> 54:40.540
And I was like, I didn't, but I told you I come a lot and she's like, she was like,

54:40.540 --> 54:41.540
come on.

54:41.540 --> 54:43.900
It's supposed to be this.

54:43.900 --> 54:47.900
We're all coming full unicycles over here.

54:47.900 --> 54:51.060
So they had like a conference after I left, like that guy needs to come more.

54:51.060 --> 54:52.060
Yeah.

54:52.060 --> 54:53.060
Let's give them these pellets.

54:53.060 --> 54:54.060
Yeah.

54:54.060 --> 54:55.060
So I, what I thought was a gross exaggeration.

54:55.060 --> 54:56.060
They were like, yeah.

54:56.060 --> 54:57.060
No, but it depends.

54:57.060 --> 55:04.020
Like if, if you're like, if that's a really small slide, then it's like, if it's a one

55:04.020 --> 55:07.460
cell height, then I'm coming fucking highways.

55:07.460 --> 55:12.260
That's what I mean, it's all, it's not really relative to like where you're coming in that

55:12.260 --> 55:13.260
situation.

55:13.260 --> 55:15.460
I mean, just put it in washcloth terms.

55:15.460 --> 55:16.460
Yeah.

55:16.460 --> 55:18.260
Like how many socks do you need to wipe up?

55:18.260 --> 55:19.260
It's a fucking dribble.

55:19.260 --> 55:22.020
How many, how many tube socks do you use to wipe up?

55:22.020 --> 55:23.020
Right.

55:23.020 --> 55:26.060
Nobody needs more than one tube sock.

55:26.060 --> 55:27.060
Sometimes I'll recycle.

55:27.060 --> 55:28.060
I'll use the same sock toys.

55:28.060 --> 55:40.060
Then you look down and you're like, nothing happened.

55:40.060 --> 55:41.060
Oh yeah.

55:41.060 --> 55:45.620
I think a fucking hitting home runs and then I look down and it's like a foul ball.

55:45.620 --> 55:48.820
What's funny is that, sorry about the baseball.

55:48.820 --> 55:49.820
Yeah.

55:49.820 --> 55:50.820
No, it's okay.

55:50.820 --> 55:55.220
But, but it's funny that we would think that that would really, I wonder, I kind of wonder

55:55.220 --> 56:01.940
in the back of women's minds like in their most like, I know obviously like, I know the

56:01.940 --> 56:05.140
business casual part of their forebrain, they'd be required to say, of course we don't give

56:05.140 --> 56:09.860
a shit about that, but, but, but somewhere in the back of their head, some, somebody,

56:09.860 --> 56:13.900
you know, there's, I don't know, they want like a monster shooter though.

56:13.900 --> 56:14.900
Why not?

56:14.900 --> 56:16.400
You know, why not?

56:16.400 --> 56:18.700
We have a girl shaking her head vehemently in the front row here.

56:18.700 --> 56:20.700
I think there's probably more back there.

56:20.700 --> 56:21.700
She's an ambassador.

56:21.700 --> 56:23.460
She's like, we don't know what her deal is.

56:23.460 --> 56:27.340
It's like saying, like, oh, it'd be great if this guy like blew his nose way harder

56:27.340 --> 56:28.340
than normal.

56:28.340 --> 56:29.340
This is all this snot.

56:29.340 --> 56:32.980
Well, I don't, it's a healthy amount of snot.

56:32.980 --> 56:33.980
Yeah.

56:33.980 --> 56:36.300
That's, that's in a world where we're all Vulcans.

56:36.300 --> 56:37.300
Yes.

56:37.300 --> 56:39.540
That's exactly how everyone would meet mop move.

56:39.540 --> 56:47.140
But here's the thing, a fucking, like some people are like, yeah, because it's fucking

56:47.140 --> 56:51.940
gooey and gross and give it to me more like fucking, sorry, if we hadn't been taught that

56:51.940 --> 56:55.620
that equal like virility from porno's, do you think that you would just naturally be

56:55.620 --> 56:59.620
like, yeah, if I can feel more like a man, because I, well, I think that's where stuff

56:59.620 --> 57:01.540
comes out and you'd be like, I did something.

57:01.540 --> 57:02.540
I made more stuff.

57:02.540 --> 57:03.540
Yeah.

57:03.540 --> 57:04.540
Yeah.

57:04.540 --> 57:05.540
Yes.

57:05.540 --> 57:07.980
Because I think that shit is so primitive that that is like actually like, that's the,

57:07.980 --> 57:10.900
that's the original, like it goes all the way back.

57:10.900 --> 57:13.740
That's all cavemen ever did was like, how much did you come?

57:13.740 --> 57:18.420
They probably did it in Iraq and like looked at it and then they were like, all right, I'll

57:18.420 --> 57:19.420
be president.

57:19.420 --> 57:20.420
Come contest.

57:20.420 --> 57:25.220
And I'm like, oh, he might have just eaten more broccoli that day.

57:25.220 --> 57:26.900
Oh, oh, oh, it's a comocracy.

57:26.900 --> 57:27.900
Just stop.

57:27.900 --> 57:32.260
I just had you, I already told you the rules.

57:32.260 --> 57:33.260
You know what?

57:33.260 --> 57:34.260
Don't watch that show.

57:34.260 --> 57:36.760
Don't watch Jedby.

57:36.760 --> 57:37.760
It's all about wordplay.

57:37.760 --> 57:41.260
Ghost jokes and puns.

57:41.260 --> 57:44.380
Well, deadbeat itself is a pun.

57:44.380 --> 57:49.060
It's a play on words because he's a deadbeat and he's helping dads beat whatever problems

57:49.060 --> 57:50.060
they have.

57:50.060 --> 57:51.060
It is.

57:51.060 --> 57:52.060
It is a pun.

57:52.060 --> 57:53.060
Deadbeat.

57:53.060 --> 57:54.060
It is a pun.

57:54.060 --> 57:55.060
Yeah, that's, that's it.

57:55.060 --> 57:56.060
That's, you nailed it.

57:56.060 --> 57:59.820
Well, I draw, I draw a line between play on words and like puns, you know, and I guess

57:59.820 --> 58:07.420
I mean, very fine line it, you know, okay, you can watch it.

58:07.420 --> 58:09.460
The episode I watched, there wasn't any puns.

58:09.460 --> 58:13.860
I think it's just something that Camille, you were talking about your movie.

58:13.860 --> 58:21.860
Yeah, we, I guess we got a little sidetracked there, didn't we?

58:21.860 --> 58:22.860
Yeah.

58:22.860 --> 58:29.900
Hey, Rob, Rob, that was good controlling that man.

58:29.900 --> 58:44.980
I don't, for the listeners, I just put on my hat.

58:44.980 --> 58:45.980
I just put my hat on.

58:45.980 --> 58:46.980
Okay.

58:46.980 --> 58:47.980
You put your hat on and I'll, I'll take it off.

58:47.980 --> 58:48.980
Locking eyes with me.

58:48.980 --> 58:49.980
I'll take it off.

58:49.980 --> 58:50.980
Okay.

58:50.980 --> 58:51.980
I won't look at you either.

58:51.980 --> 58:53.620
I won't put my vines on while you're eating your bread.

58:53.620 --> 58:54.620
I won't.

58:54.620 --> 58:58.180
Just turn it down.

58:58.180 --> 59:02.380
No one was complaining, everybody was having a ball, we were all enjoying ourselves.

59:02.380 --> 59:03.380
So that's the rule.

59:03.380 --> 59:05.820
If no one complains, keep doing it.

59:05.820 --> 59:08.660
If everybody is smiling.

59:08.660 --> 59:09.660
Was everybody smiling?

59:09.660 --> 59:10.660
Yeah.

59:10.660 --> 59:14.340
Except, okay, he's fucking delusional.

59:14.340 --> 59:15.340
Everyone's smiling.

59:15.340 --> 59:19.020
You think the world is like pollinated by your fucking vines?

59:19.020 --> 59:22.700
Rob, were you doing it to try to get Dan's attention to vibe?

59:22.700 --> 59:23.700
Yes.

59:23.700 --> 59:24.700
Yes.

59:24.700 --> 59:25.700
Well, you got it.

59:25.700 --> 59:27.500
He just wants you to listen to him.

59:27.500 --> 59:28.500
He just wants to be acknowledged.

59:28.500 --> 59:29.500
He just wants your love, Dan.

59:29.500 --> 59:31.500
Turn your vines down.

59:31.500 --> 59:37.340
But he just, he just wants you to acknowledge his vines.

59:37.340 --> 59:39.700
That's not even you wanting an acknowledgement.

59:39.700 --> 59:40.700
He just wants you to acknowledge his vines.

59:40.700 --> 59:41.700
To cry for help.

59:41.700 --> 59:44.220
It's like a, a six seconds at a time.

59:44.220 --> 59:48.940
If there was, if there was somebody at an adjacent table playing their vines loud enough

59:48.940 --> 59:50.140
for you to hear.

59:50.140 --> 59:51.140
I'd walk over.

59:51.140 --> 59:54.700
I'd be like, oh, do you see this one?

59:54.700 --> 59:55.700
Oh yeah.

59:55.700 --> 59:56.700
Yeah.

59:56.700 --> 59:57.700
Yeah.

59:57.700 --> 59:58.700
Yeah.

59:58.700 --> 59:59.700
Right.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.700
And we'd, we'd be happy.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.700
Right.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.700
Happy.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.700
We just, happy.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.700
Dan, Dan, I'm on your side.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.740
If I'm out at a restaurant, people that leave their ringers on or talk into their phone

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:12.620
like a walkie-talkie or, or, or, or, or, or turn like, like, or watch a movie at the

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:13.620
restaurant.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.620
Yeah.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.140
I want to murder in a Elizabethan fashion.

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:18.140
Yeah.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:19.140
I want something horrible.

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.140
Three things I don't do.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:23.500
I'm not, I'm not a snob about other people's behavior, really.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:29.340
But I'm very, very, like, anxious about my own table, like, being judged by other tables.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.340
Yeah.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.340
You just want to keep a low profile.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340
I'll cop to that.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:37.140
I want, I want my table to enjoy themselves and have a good time.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.900
Well, I'm not being concerned about other tables.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.180
You skipped my needs in that department.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.180
What?

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.340
You, you want your table to have a good time.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.100
Most of us were except for you.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.100
Everybody was having a ball.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.580
We were all having a ball.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.780
How long did this?

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.740
Did he ask you to turn down the vines?

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:55.740
I did.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:56.740
And I did.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.740
And you did?

01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.740
Yeah.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:00:59.740
No.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:00.740
It's fucking liar.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.740
Liar.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:02.740
Liar.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:03.740
He's lying in front of everyone.

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.740
That's all he does is lie.

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.740
That's your, your perspective.

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.740
What happened?

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.740
My perspective is he's lying.

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:08.740
No, no, no, no.

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.740
No judgment.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.740
No judgment.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.740
No, no.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:12.740
Describe the facts.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.740
What happened?

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:14.740
You often turn it down.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.740
What did he do?

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.740
The facts are he knows one thing and is saying a different thing.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.740
You said.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.740
It's liar-ish.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:23.740
Whoa, not to judge or anything, but there's a liafication in the room.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:24.740
All right, I'm on your side.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.740
He's a fucking liar.

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:30.740
So you said turn down the vines and he didn't turn them down.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.740
Yes, for eight years now.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.740
Yes.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.740
Vines.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.740
I have no idea.

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.740
Vines aren't eight years old.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.740
All right.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.740
Don't get hung up on that shit.

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:42.500
He, he, he means vines equals my presence.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.740
He wants my presence to turn.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.740
I see the turn you down.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:53.740
He wants my, what, if the lower the opacity of my existence, then then he'll be happy.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.740
That's fair though.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:58.740
Other, other tables.

01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.740
You're very opaque.

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:00.740
Yeah.

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:08.740
I wish you guys could knew like, like the real Rob Schrab, like who, who like on his

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:15.740
birthday, people are like happy birthday and he's like, no, no, no.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.740
Hates the birthday song.

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.740
Hates it.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:19.740
Hates it.

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.740
If, if, if someone else's birthday, hey Rob, let's play Pictionary.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.740
No, no, no.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:28.740
Like everything's like, oh, hey Rob, can I, can I use a writing utensil?

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.740
Utencil.

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:34.740
Like, best of every time I, you're full of hatred.

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.740
You're a, you're a hateful person.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.740
It's, it's, it's, you, you, you know, it's, you, you play this.

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:40.740
Not true.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.740
No, he's gaslighting me.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:43.740
That's not true.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.740
He always makes it look like I'm the bad guy, but he's a monster.

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.740
You, you, you hate a lot of things too.

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.740
I don't hate, I hate you.

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:51.740
You hate word play.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:53.740
You hate word play.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.740
You hate sports and word play.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:59.740
You know something I do too.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.740
You know what?

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.740
I like you.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.740
I don't get sick of hanging out with you.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:12.740
Even though you're so mean.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:22.740
Well, I guess, I guess that's a Schrab of a different color.

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:28.740
Happy birthday to you.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:34.740
Happy birthday to you.

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:41.740
Happy birthday to America.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:45.740
Happy birthday.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:04:00.740
Happy birthday to you.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:06.740
Happy birthday to you.

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:07.740
It's 9-12.

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:14.740
Happy birthday to America.

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:21.740
Happy birthday to you.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.740
One more time.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:29.740
Happy birthday to you.

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:35.740
Happy birthday to you.

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:42.740
Happy birthday to America.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:50.740
Happy birthday to you.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.740
He can sit here.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.740
We did it.

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:59.740
So, I love the song now.

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:02.740
There currently is no award for best podcast.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:07.740
I think we should be winning the best podcast award right now.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:11.740
Camille, you were talking about your movie.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.740
No, I wasn't.

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.740
I have nothing to say about it.

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.740
I think it is a good podcast, man.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.740
What are we supposed to...

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:26.740
What are we supposed to sit up here and talk about Game of Thrones?

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.740
Game of Thrones, people.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.740
Basically, this is what happened.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:33.740
Last week, I was at the Game of Thrones premiere.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:38.740
I was hanging out and this gentleman came up to me.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.740
He was very nice.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.740
He was like, oh, I love Harmontown.

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.740
I'm a huge fan of Harmontown.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.740
I said, oh, thanks, man. That means a lot.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.740
You know, the normal thing.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.740
And I was about to be like, thanks, man, so much.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:54.740
And then I was like, oh, my God, this is Grey Worm.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.740
Grey Worm from Grey Worm.

01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.740
He plays Grey Worm.

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:04.740
So, I got his email and I'm going to bring him up right now.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.740
Please welcome to the stage Jacob Anderson.

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:08.740
Are you here?

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:27.740
There he is.

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:36.740
Yo, yo, yo.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.740
Hello.

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:42.740
I don't drink, but if I was someone who drank,

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.740
I would have been very drunk at this party.

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.740
I was so drunk.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.740
And I was very...

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.740
I was trying to figure out if I said anything stupid to you

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.740
or was our interaction fine?

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.740
You said so much dumb shit.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.740
Did I?

01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.740
It was embarrassing.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.740
Yeah, it was, right?

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.740
That's how I figured it was going to be.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.740
Jacob...

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.740
Yes.

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.740
Sorry, this is so weird.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.740
He's a huge...

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.740
He's a huge fan of this show.

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.740
I've listened to every episode of Armour Town.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:20.740
I'm a...

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:25.740
And we should probably plug your show too.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.740
It premieres...

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:31.740
April 20th, I think.

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:35.740
April 25th.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.740
April 24th.

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:39.740
April 24th.

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.740
It's called Game of Thrones.

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.740
Let's get the word out.

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.740
Why is it called Game of Thrones

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:50.740
when there's only one throne in it?

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:53.740
That's a great question.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.740
What the fuck, Jacob?

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.740
What are you doing?

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.740
The central premise of the show and the thrones

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.740
is there's this balloon.

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:09.740
And the balloons...

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:10.740
I like the show.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:11.740
I like it.

01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:13.740
I got to start watching the show.

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.740
I have a serious question about Game of Thrones.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.740
How does castration work?

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:23.740
Because there are numerous characters

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:27.740
who are without various levels of gonad dairy.

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.740
Like...

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:32.740
Reek has clearly been mutilated.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.740
Everything's gone.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.740
Your character, for instance,

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.740
and all the unsullied,

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:42.740
they are castrated, which I understand.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.740
The removal of the testes.

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.740
Implying that the wiener is still there.

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.740
That's my understanding.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.740
So the wiener is still there?

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:55.740
I believe so.

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:58.740
That's a spoiler.

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:01.740
Wait, is that a big plot point this season?

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:07.740
What is the level of genital mutilation?

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:11.740
All the unsullied come in with giant boners.

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:14.740
Martin's not done with the final book.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:17.740
You don't know what the title is.

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:20.740
It's called What's Left of the Unsullied.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.740
Here's an actual serious question on that note.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.740
But that is a good question.

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.740
If I'd gotten the job,

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:29.740
my first question would be,

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.740
so what are we talking about?

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.740
Is there a penis or nothing?

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.740
You don't know.

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.740
No, I asked. Who's asked?

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.740
What did they say?

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.740
I believe the sausage is still there.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.740
The sausage.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.740
That bit.

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:49.740
The baby's on.

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:52.740
I think the dick bit.

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.740
The dick bit.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.740
The dick bit is called the dick.

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:02.740
This is genuinely every conversation I have with anyone ever.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.740
Nobody's ever like,

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.740
what's north of the wall and when's the...

01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:09.740
Jacob, I can't believe how...

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.740
You're English, I imagine, right?

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:12.740
Yes.

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.740
That's the most English answer.

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.740
The sausage.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:18.740
The dick bit.

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.740
The dick bit.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.740
What's your serious question?

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.740
The Piccadilly Circus.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.740
My serious question, based on that,

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.740
is also so you're probably...

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.740
This show is like...

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.740
Obviously, you have to sign an NDA.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.740
You have to like...

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.740
How much trouble are you at risk of?

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.740
What do they tell you?

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.740
How in the dark are you about plot lines and things

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.740
when you do interviews?

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.740
Ask me some questions and we'll find out.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.740
By the way,

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.740
Jacob, you did tell me a spoiler that night.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.740
You told me something that I don't know if...

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.740
Well, I'm not going to say it

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.740
because I don't know what level of spoiler it was.

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.740
Can you whisper it?

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.740
Into a microphone?

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.740
Not fair!

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.740
You can't do this in front of an audience of big fans.

01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.740
It's not fair!

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.740
I know what it is.

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:09.740
I know what it is.

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:14.740
I didn't...

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.740
I stepped on your...

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.740
I said something...

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.740
That's okay. I was done.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.740
It's...

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:30.740
One of your balls goes back this season.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.740
But it's a dragon egg.

01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:37.740
But then the...

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.740
But then the dragon is...

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.740
Jamie Lannister's hand.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.740
And then that hand...

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.740
Drowns...

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.740
Stone Man...

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.740
Jura.

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:55.740
Jura Marma?

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.740
Jura Marma?

01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.740
I don't know.

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:01.740
I really want to see that show.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.740
You should watch it. It's called Game of Thrones.

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.740
Here's a question.

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.740
Well, so one of the...

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.740
We're all gearing up to watch the next season.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.740
So one of the...

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.740
Sorry, Dan. I don't mean to interrupt you.

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.740
But I know you're a terrible interviewer.

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.740
You don't have to pretend.

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.740
I wasn't pretending, but thank you for reminding me.

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:21.740
Just be yourself, Dan.

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:23.740
He's on board already.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.740
I wasn't even trying to interview.

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.740
Don't go for the interview.

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.740
I'm sorry.

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.740
I wasn't even trying to interview.

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.740
Don't go for segues or...

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:35.740
I was just going with the flow and asking fanboy questions.

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.740
I just wanted to know...

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.740
So...

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.740
You had that big fight scene.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:43.740
I mean, you had a lot of fight scenes,

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.740
but that big one where everyone's dying

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.740
left and right on the edge of my scene.

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.740
Which of these fucking guys is going to die

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.740
and who's going to live?

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.740
In those scenes, how much...

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.740
You seem like a fit guy.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.740
I'm not hitting on you, but...

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.740
But if you were, it would go a little something.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.740
I like this.

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.740
I guess that's a dumb question.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.740
I'm just curious about the amount of stunt

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.740
stuntmanery, how that shit works.

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.740
How much you have to learn...

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.740
How much gonadery, how much stuntmanery...

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.740
How much stick twirling did you have to learn?

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.740
And what do you...

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.740
I don't know.

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:19.740
They really didn't want me to do it.

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:21.740
Because of insurance, I guess.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:23.740
I'm not sure.

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:25.740
But I did all of it in the last one.

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.740
I did all of that. That was fun.

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.740
They let you...

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.740
That was such a...

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.740
Were you trained?

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.740
I wasn't courting that, by the way.

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:37.740
Jacob, were you trained

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.740
in any stuntman or martial arts

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:41.740
or anything like that before that?

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:43.740
Not at all. It's like dancing.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.740
You just have to be able to count.

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.740
If you can count to 30, then you can do a fight.

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.740
I bet there's plenty of people here who can count to 30

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.740
and can't twirl a sword.

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.740
What?

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:55.740
Are you trained in dancing?

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.740
No.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.740
Jacob, do you think you could write a juice cycle?

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.740
No.

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.740
I could try.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.740
Alright.

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.740
No, don't.

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.740
No, don't.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.740
We can't fucking hurt him.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.740
That's not clever at all.

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.740
What if he gets an injury?

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.740
Guys, if our podcast kills Greyworm,

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.740
we're the best, man.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.740
We're like a new house in Game of Thrones.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.740
I mean, they couldn't kill him over four seasons.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.740
The thing is that I did...

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.740
I mean, this is crazy

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:35.740
for a podcast of our level

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.740
to have this kind of exclusive, but

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.740
we do have a

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.740
sneak preview that we're able to

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.740
provide.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.740
We have the clip?

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:47.740
No, we don't.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:49.740
We just got the script.

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:51.740
And Jacob said he would

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:53.740
perform it with us.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.740
That it's a scene.

01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.740
It's a crucial scene from the new season.

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.740
And I...

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.740
He told me I had to be in it

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.740
in the scene.

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:07.740
Do you want to set the scene up?

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:09.740
Or should...

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.740
As you know, for most of the seasons,

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.740
they keep introducing new kingdoms and things,

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.740
and I'm going to play

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.740
a new lord

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.740
from House

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.740
Cock

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:23.740
House Rockin' Cock.

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.740
He's a cool guy

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.740
and he's like...

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.740
What is it from House Cock and Rock?

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.740
Rockin' Cock and Rock.

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:35.740
And you got a Rockin' Cock?

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.740
I guess I'm

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:39.740
from the Eastern realms

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.740
and I'm kind of like a badass

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.740
uncompromising guy.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.740
My firm finds out

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.740
that he's actually the bastard child

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.740
of...

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.740
that he takes his boat back

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.740
and finds me

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.740
and we do a scene

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.740
together.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.740
And then...

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:01.740
Yeah.

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:07.740
I'm like...

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.740
I'm like cutting a wild boar.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.740
Dobrokov, Dobrokov, Dobrokov,

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.740
Oh

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:25.740
Oh

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:35.740
Oh

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:46.620
Scary shit, I can put this wild boar in the cupboard

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:52.620
Oh

01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:58.540
That sounds like my biological son

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:10.300
And I I don't know if when he sees me he'll be happy or sad

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:16.460
So I will take my house's trademark weapon

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.540
The bore knife

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:26.620
Out onto the sandy coast of house rock and cock

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:32.940
This is a lot of stairs

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:44.540
So so you're not right on the beach you're you're I'm not very close to the beach

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:50.620
Okay, gotta gotta be we're watching the episode. Yeah. Yeah. I gotta I wonder what something's gonna happen. I don't know

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.100
This is a lantern

01:17:55.100 --> 01:18:01.260
Well, we can see he's holding a lantern. Why is he saying he's gonna say it? I don't see the lantern

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:05.180
Why is he saying it again? Because I don't want people to think I need

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:08.460
He's talking to us. Yeah, he's talking to us. So what the fuck?

01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.980
Oh

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.940
Next level HBO programming, holy shit

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:27.740
Oh Lord Lord harmonious, I I would recommend you don't walk down those steps alone tonight. Oh, here we go

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.380
Use your microphone Rob use your microphone

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.220
Hey, you should let somebody come with you

01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:46.940
It's it's really really really treacherous

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:52.220
It's really treacherous on the on the staircase

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:58.140
I believe myself more than capable of traversing my own house troll man

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:08.300
Lord harmonious may I send my troll servant with you to protect yourself? It's all a part of the the the the fun here

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:13.340
Yeah, let me let me let me come with you down the stairs

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.300
I can't believe this stretched the storyline out over four episodes

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:25.740
Let me hold that lantern for you at this point. I just want them to go downstairs

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:34.460
Cut to cut to Camille and Jacob down to down on the artillery chip

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.460
Oh

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.100
Like what's your deal down there

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:49.100
Like is it the sausage or the biscuits or

01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:56.220
Man, it's just the dick bit. Oh, I don't believe you

01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:01.980
Cut back to the staircase back to the staircase

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:15.660
I'll accept your service troll man. All right, but you should know I've heard the rumors

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.660
That was a big one

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:22.060
You're so good

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.060
What a good boy you are

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:27.180
I told you the staircase is treacherous

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.740
This goes in the black trash can not the green one

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.100
Take off your pants

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.220
There's a dragon coming

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:52.300
Quick take off your clothes and your pants first

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:54.300
There's a dragon coming

01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:03.980
This better be a thing take off your pants. Take off your pants. All right, it's a dragon's coming

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:09.900
I don't see one dragon's coming take off your pants. I took them off. Okay. Okay

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:18.300
Cut back to cut back to these uncellied boats. Okay. Hey, we're gonna defeat them. We have dragons on our side. Oh, fuck. They're no wearing pants

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:24.140
We don't have a shot anymore. How did they know that works?

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:32.300
Can you count to 30? Uh one two cut back to the staircase

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.740
That was a close one

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.060
I guess I'm good news and bad news

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:51.420
Good news is the dragon's gone bad news is I lost the lantern

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:57.420
Oh lord harmonious lord harmonious

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:02.860
Oh, it seems an uncelled ship has landed on the dock. Where's that voice coming from?

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.540

Oh, yeah. So many shirts. Take your fucking shirt off, Troll.

01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:45.100
Harmonious the ship has landed. We're getting out of here. The uncelled are marching up the staircase towards you right now.

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.260
I think we gotta run. Then I shall greet them

01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:49.980
For as I have learned

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:52.700
One of the uncelled is my seed

01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:57.340

I need now a warrior to lead my kingdom. There is only one way for the past to be forgotten

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:26.700
A father who sells his son into castration

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.620
There's only one way. Hello. Hello

There's room for both of you

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:28.700
Jacob, Jacob, when did you start listening and why are you are you a Harmontown fan? How did that come about?

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:38.940
Uh, I started listening. I'm a I'm a community fan and um, I don't know. I said that like it was it was some sort of

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.580
It's like a a or something. Yeah, I'm a

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.460

What would be his favorite season season four season four. Yeah, I love season four

01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:55.420
Really good really really caught the tone finally

01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:02.460
They really hit their stride and then somehow lost it. Yeah, I don't know what changed. I don't know

01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:05.180
But at least we got season four

01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:09.820
No, I haven't actually watched all of season four

01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:17.340
In solidarity it upset me. I had to because I just wanted to be a good showrunner and then I got up here. I'll drunk and I

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:25.180
I made bad comments about it that I only meant to be self deprecating about my experience and uh

01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:32.220
But uh, I think the people that worked on that season worked very hard and uh, wow, you really gave it up there. Wow

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.980
I mean, I yeah

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.980
I mean they really

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:39.980
Audio and video was in sync

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:47.340
Seemed like none of the credits were misspelled

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:55.420
Well, that's I mean, I mean, it's gonna be amazing to I mean your character's not dead

01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:59.900
So we're gonna be watching this guy and he's gonna be like uh fighting

01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.860
Gagus and uh

01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:05.180
And having having passionate strange

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:10.620
Uh, uh, will they want these with uh with certain, uh, core t.a.'s no spoilers

01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:14.540
I have no inside information, but then the every time we watch now this season

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:17.740
We can go like that dude that dude knows who Dave Kline is

01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.780
Yeah, by the way

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.540

I'll give the voice to a lot of people

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.660
You're a beautiful creature

01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:47.340
It takes it takes a lot of fury to like understand where you're coming from

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:53.900
And like what I'm trying to say is that like there aren't a lot of actors

01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:57.580
Who couldn't even attempt to do this shit you're doing

01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:03.580
And like where I'm really personally coming from is like I know a lot of hardcore dudes

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:15.980
I like that this is the short version long story short

01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:21.500
I'm a I'm a big fan of yours

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:28.620
I am Dave Kline endorsement. Yeah, I just I wanted to say as well. Thank you guys because this is like I'm

01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:31.820
I feel like we're all slightly unstable humans in this room

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:42.300
And this this this show sorts me right out when I'm feeling

01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:46.220
That's very flattering. Were you when you when you talk to me?

01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:52.540
Were you hoping because you I had to convince you to come on stage. Yeah when we were talking were you like, oh, I hope he

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:58.940
Asks and hooks me up with dance. I can get on the shore. Is this like no not at all. No, I was a bit worried

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:00.940
um

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:04.620
I mean actually to use like a community reference. I'm sorry. This is gonna be uh

01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:09.180
A fan, but I don't know. I don't know why communities such as

01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:12.220
So I'm attaching so much shame to it. Um

01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.180
Jacob

01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:18.780
Here's how much chatters you have right now dan is sitting down at Spencer's table right now

01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:23.580
I'm kneeling I'm on my knees

01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:29.820
Um, no, I was I was really concerned that that uh with all of you guys

01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:30.860
um

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:36.380
That I would have like a Troy Lavarba and kind of experience and I'm I'm sort of having it

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:39.260
Uh, and I'm talking too much, but thank you

01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:43.020
You guys are amazing. Thank you so much for coming

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:49.020
Should we should we turn him loose so that he doesn't have to feel the anxiety anymore? I mean

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:54.140
Well, my question was like, are you visiting town right now? Do you live in LA?

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:59.260
No, no, I came down for the premiere and then I just stayed around and you go back to uh, England or what?

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:01.100
Uh, go to new york

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:07.260
You're uh on tuesday and then uh, hey, I'm gonna be there. We should like hang out. Yeah

01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:11.660
Okay, cool

01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.900
Can I can I say hello to my friend george because I didn't tell him

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:26.700
Great worm. Hi george

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:37.260
Uh, yeah, I mean jigga, uh, uh, I started listening to Harmontown about two years ago

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.460
So yeah

01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:46.620
So before were you on game of thrones already at that point? Were you already shooting game of thrones or or is this the part?

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:50.860
Yeah, yeah, you already were okay. Yeah, can I ask a really mundane question that you must get asked all the time

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:57.180
When you're doing the uh, the other languages like how does that work? Like you get schooled on like on all the uh

01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:02.620
It's really boy. I feel like I'm this is a comedy show and I feel like I'm bringing it down

01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:09.020
That was my question too. I want to know too. Um, what is it? What does that take all all those languages?

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.700
That kind of mind-blowing

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.660
Like we get sent an mp3 and we just listen to it

01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:18.380
And just you kind of listen to it on repeat see somebody scratch vocals that you just you just kind of mimic

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:24.620
But basically, yeah, really, but then then you have to learn how to like act them act them. Yeah perform them. Yeah

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.780
Yeah, can I elaborate on the question? I've always wanted to know as an actor

01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:31.340
What is it like acting in a language that doesn't exist?

01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:35.660
Like do you just do you just sort of is it all about the emoting at that point?

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.660
Like is it all about sort of just your body language?

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:40.940
You pick a triple you pick one syllable ago. That's the syllable that you

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:47.260
Yeah, like what do you land with your dialogue? You know the hardest one is talking to other people that are talking in a different language

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:53.180
You have to like you have to is like picking up cues, but picking up words that don't exist

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:57.500
Oh, so you have to like all right. I think you're done with your gobbledygook time for my gobbledygook

01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.900
Yeah, basically

01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:04.860
I've seen you do that on the show sometimes you're like, oh, okay me

01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:09.820
I'm like they should edit that out

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:15.260
Well, I I I have never seen that on game of thrones and that's a real testament to that

01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:20.380
I've never seen that moment of like, I don't know what you're saying to me. It's fucking unreal, man

01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:23.900
That's why you guys always have to align earphones in your ears when you're speaking in

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:26.300
What is the language of the unsullied?

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.700
Valyrian

01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:31.260
Do you ever do a take?

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.020
It's not a medication

01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:42.140
Do you do a take when you you're saying a line in uh that language and director goes, uh, jake, can we take it again?

01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:45.180
And and really hit the gobbledygook

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:55.900
Like did they give you notes like like like line reads or just kind of I could be saying any old shit to be fair

01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:04.540
I think I think not to undermine the directors just some great directors, but um, but yeah, I think they're very often just like great

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:06.620
How much do you actually have to know your lines?

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:12.380
Yeah, and do you like improvise in the language and like hey, please stay on scrap with the fucking

01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:17.580
Fuck in we spent a lot of time writing these syllables

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:23.420
Because you know that yeah, no there's guest directors coming through so they're on their ipad and their fantasy football leagues

01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:28.540
And they're like okay great and you're like yeah, I'm the one that has to be here next week. Yeah, exactly. Yeah

01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:34.860
Is it like a difficult show to shoot is it like really grueling it feels like it would be like long hours and

01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:38.620
It uh, yeah, it's long hours, but it's it genuinely

01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:43.100
I really want to come on here and say some like talk some shit about it's like

01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:47.660
It's it's it's the best do both was the best job in the world genuinely

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:54.060
It's it's really fun. Is there one like the different cast in different worlds different kingdoms and stuff

01:37:54.940 --> 01:38:00.380
What's the best one to be in and what what cast talks the most shit about it's definitely not the wall

01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:06.540
Because they're like in fucking cold-ass horrible weather and then everybody else is like warm climbs

01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:11.500
What cast has the easiest and what cast has the hardest? Yeah, we have the easiest because we're always in the sun

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.580
Yeah

01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:16.300
Yeah, but sometimes you get nipple cut off

01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:19.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.660
That's true. I've got you know what I can give you one spoiler for this year. I've got a new yeah

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.100
No, you've built it up now. I've got uh

01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:33.820
Uh, so no, it's because I was thinking about the heat and I used to I used to wear a tunic that I'd like create waterfalls down

01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:36.780
The front of my body in the heat. It was disgusting

01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:43.740
It's it's the worst. It's the worst, but I've got I've got a new jacket this year at least five people are turned on by this

01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:49.420
Wait, you're jacket. You're you're you're excited that you now have a jacket coming up. This is oh, yeah

01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:56.780
But it's because the sun is that hot that it's like like like like actually it's just like so as opposed to it

01:38:56.780 --> 01:39:00.860
Beating down on you. Yeah. Yeah, it's a little bit. That's your costume. I mean those costumes are like

01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:07.660
It fits a little thing. I'm not talking shit on the show, but like they're they're they're doing so much with so like the production

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.740
Level it's like your costume the unsullied are

01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:16.300
They're a lot like when I was in sixth grade. I played a tooth

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.740
I I was I was the third molar

01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:28.060
I was a like there's just there's costumes that are just like they have to be minimal because they also have to

01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:31.660
They have to make fucking dragons and they're like, oh, we don't have much money left

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:36.380
Okay, why would you be wearing like a you know popped collar and have like poofy sleeves

01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:39.740
He's a slave and stuff. Do you remember the scene when you were a tooth?

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:44.620
I yeah, well, I I was a I was the second molar and I had a

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:54.140
I was I I was small enough that all the kids costumes were grocery bags paper grocery bags

01:39:55.100 --> 01:40:00.060
So that's how small we were that our heads went through the upside down grocery bag. We were wearing them as

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:04.780
Oh my god, that's it. That seems safe. That seems like a safe cost. I don't know. We were put your head in this plastic

01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:10.860
Tyler it was a plastic bag. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but still there's a whole cut for the neck in the bottom of a

01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:12.860
Sure

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:19.580
And then a tooth painted on the front and then my line was you think you've got it bad incisor

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:23.660
We molars grind the food for early digestion

01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:27.980
And I fucking belted it out

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:33.660
Is that genuinely the line from that's truly the line that's been in there for that long because my yeah

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:38.300
My family came and they were and I knew it and I was like, I'm gonna fucking steal this show

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.220
Oh

01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:44.620
Second molar and I was like my definition of acting was like I'm gonna hit the back of the room

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:48.060
Dan what were the reviews like what how did it go?

01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:51.340
There was a there was a whole mouth full of teeth

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:57.900
Right, right. Okay, gotcha mythologically. What character do you think that would be in the game of thrones universe?

01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:00.620
Hey, jay, uh little finger

01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:07.020
I don't know. There's no funny answer to that. No, I think you're right

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:09.020
I think you got it right

01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:13.820
But I've got no I am glad to hear you're wearing it

01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:17.180
But I'm surprised to hear that you're glad that they're adding layers

01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:23.820
But but you're saying you're you're constantly under the beating sun. So adding clothes is good

01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.300
I this is something I don't understand about you

01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:31.580
But are you saying you get to take off the the the skin tight thing and throw a jacket over your skin now?

01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:35.420
Is it we're saying instead of wearing both? Yeah, yeah, it's just it's just one layer

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:39.500
But also, I think I mean, I don't want to say anything too bad

01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:43.820
I don't I don't want to shit on anyone, but it's very funky

01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:45.660
It's a very

01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:50.700
It's a very it's a very uh, it's got a kind of disco vibe to it. Oh, I think I mean it smelled bad

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.340
Yeah, like you

01:41:55.340 --> 01:42:03.420
Mean like parliament funky like all right, but you're into it. You're like we're looking forward to this gray worm is gonna come out

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:06.540
And that's gonna be all right. There's gonna be a baseline

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:26.220
I think we're doing ourselves a great disservice if we don't eventually end this show with a gray worm wrap the sequence

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:36.380
Do you branch into that world you say what what is your what is your uh, no, I'm more of it like a singer

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.540
Yeah, but I get because I'm brown

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.500
But you I get asked I get asked if I'm a rapper every day

01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:47.020
Oh, you can the routine shirt kind of I thought I made some assumptions. I'm not I made some assumptions

01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:50.780
I feel bad. So you I'm brown. Nobody thinks I'm a rapper

01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:54.620
Well, and they're like, hey, can you help me with my computer?

01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:01.020
But also also your your your stage name, uh, Raleigh Richie, that

01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:07.660
It sounds a little rappery, but you see things beautifully. It's the least rapid. It's from a Wes Anderson film

01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:11.340
You've got a beautiful singing

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:15.980
After we met I listened to your music. It's beautiful. Oh, thanks. What's like, uh, look at

01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:20.140
I wasn't doing these things beautiful. What sort of style you remember half an hour ago

01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:23.820
I'm working on remember two hours ago when we were talking give me a fucking second

01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:26.380
You sing beautifully

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:33.180
But for sure Raleigh Richie can do the Rihanna bridge in my uh in my closing rap

01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:36.300
Jacob

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:39.500
Jacob what sort what sort of style would you would you call your music?

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.500

Throne throne throne punk. No. No, this is not

01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:51.020
I was gonna become really defensive then

01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:54.620
I don't cross the two over

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.500
I'm sorry

01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:04.540

Sorry, it's just something you're a baritone too. Yes, I am

01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:17.100

Well, you guys can leave. We're just gonna work through some shit. We should do the we should do the rap, right?

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:13.740
I think we should

01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:17.020
We should do the rap

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:26.300
I I'm done come on. I'm all finished. Yeah

01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:33.260
Let's hit the lights. You look at you. You don't get to come back from a three-year hiatus and try to reverse control

01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:39.340
All drives all drives

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:44.700
And because you're brown you might have to rap in this one come on. Oh fuck. No

01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:50.460
I I really have no rhythm. I have no rhythm. What he'll do it for me. Maybe do you sing at all?

01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.420
Do I sing? Yeah, no never

01:46:54.140 --> 01:47:00.540
No, do you sing in the shower? Do you sing in the car? No, never. No, you never sing. No, can you fix my computer?

01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:06.460
Yeah, probably

01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:14.460
Serious question come out and I'm not joking. You don't sing to yourself ever. You don't sing when you're alone or in the car

01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:18.220
Or anything. I'm gonna truth man. Be honest. I'm not like a no

01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:23.260
You don't hum whistle ever. You don't you don't carry it. I can't whistle. I cannot whistle

01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:27.260
That's me doing my best for real

01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:29.980
I swear, but you can sing happy birthday

01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:32.700
Sing sing the first words happy birthday

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.700
Oh

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.940
Because I'm a friend believer that everybody

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.500
Everybody can sing everybody can

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:41.980
He's not he's not great at singing

01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:47.100
Little girl, you can hear it. Come out sing on the indoor kids. If you want to hear him sing

01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:49.660
It's all on the internet. He doesn't have to do it right now

01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:55.260
You can sing everybody can sing. This is this is his way of saying I don't want to sing

01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.060
I'm not I'm not gonna make you. Yes

01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:04.940
No, I'm pretty sure I will then I retract that but I'm saying this is ritual bullying

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:08.940
This is really no, I'm not I'm not gonna make anybody sing

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:13.340
But you do you just sing once in a while you can carry a tune. No for real

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:16.300
Yeah, every question you've asked me. I've answered no

01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:21.820
But your voice is so like melodic. Don't fucking patronize me to sing

01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:26.220
This shit isn't gonna work. You have this gorgeous melodic

01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:29.740
Uh-huh. Okay. Maybe I should give you a very rich timbre to your voice. It's true

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:34.380
Here watch me sing. I'll sing something. All right. Yeah

01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:42.060
Yeah

01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:48.300
I'm singing a song about being me. I am camell

01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:52.860
You see

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:57.260
It's not it's not bullying

01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:02.620
It's not bullying sometimes people need a little bit of encouragement. That's all that's all that went

01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:05.340
Yeah, bullying is just hyper encouragement

01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:10.860
It's extreme encouragement

01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:15.660
But but look at the result that was beautiful. There was a touching moment. I didn't know I had it in me

01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:19.180
That's why that's why I'm so clean and thin after 43 years

01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:22.380
It's just a lot of support around me

01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:28.060
I had no idea people wanted me to comb my hair and believed I could. All right, Dan

01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:29.740
