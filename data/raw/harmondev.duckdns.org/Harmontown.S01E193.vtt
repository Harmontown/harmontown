06:55.000\nI know, but you heard his laugh.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:56.000\nAnd now you can't hear it.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:57.000\nNow I feel like...\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:58.000\nWe killed it.\n\n06:58.000

11:42.000\nWobba-jobba!\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nWobba-jobba!\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nWobba-jobba!\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nAnd people are just looking and...\n\n11:47.000 -->

11:53.000\nSpargos.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nNo, it was Chibo across the street, but it's a fucking club.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:58.000\nChibo?\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nYou're McDonald's?\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nI see people who are Chibo all the time.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nNo!\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nWhat was the...\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nLet's listen to

fun?\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nYou ready for some fun?\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:24.000\nIf they're in awards or world's best podcasts\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nwhat is the Emmy...\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nIf they're in Emmys or Toneys or…\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nHe's thinking...\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:33.000\nI don't think anybody could hear it.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nWas that this was happening today, earlier today?\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nYeah.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nEverybody was in time.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nAnd everybody else was having a ball.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nEverybody was like, oh, I want to look at it.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nOh, my God.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nIt's so funny.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nSo funny.\n\n12:46.000 -->

to eat my bread here.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nI don't say that.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:04.000\nYour vines are disrupting my enjoyment of this.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:05.000\nI'm not mine.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nStrangers.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nThey were loving it, too.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:13.000\nA guy on the way out was like, hey, you know, I'm not a fan of that shit, but you

care.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nYou don't care.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:28.000\nI'm the only one that's aware of strangers in public when I'm with you.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:33.000\nYou know, I've missed this.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:34.000\nAll right.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nChris?\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nYeah.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nLet's bring out a friend of yours.\n\n13:37.000 -->

13:49.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:55.000\nHulu has an original series called Ghost Balloon.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nIt's about a guy with a ghost balloon.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nThat's right.\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nYou've seen the billboards.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nYeah.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nIt's a guy holding a balloon.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nIt's a ghost.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nYeah.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.000\nIt's actually called Dead Beat.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nIt's a Hulu original series.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nIt's about a guy named Pac who can see ghosts and he helps them finish their...\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nI saw it on one of those bus stop couches.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nYeah.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nAnd I never got...\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nCouches.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nBus stop couches.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nBus stop couches.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nAre you a Beverly Hill Billy?\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:21.000\nYes.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:31.000\nFor people that don't live in LA, if you live somewhere else, our bus stops have couches.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:35.000\nI always like the tagline of this show because I don't...\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nBecause it's...\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nHe helps ghosts, can't help himself.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nAnd I don't know if it's like, is it...\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:42.000\nHe helps ghosts.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:43.000\nHe can't help himself.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nOr he helps ghosts.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.000\nHe can't help himself.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:50.000\nWell, let's get some information.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nPlease welcome Tyler Labine.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:05.000\nWow.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:10.000\nThat was a classic, classic introduction to a guy that you really don't know.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nYeah.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:15.000\nI really... Thank you for dressing up for the show, by the way.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nYou're dressed for a night in.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nI got my pink flamingo shorts on.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:25.000\nI don't know if anybody's noticed that, but...\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nI'm jealous.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:29.000\nI mean, you know, not everyone can pull these off.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nI'm jealous of those shorts.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:34.000\nI'm jealous of those calves.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nThey're muscular, muscular calves.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:37.000\nYeah.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nSpencer, you have great calves, Spencer.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:42.000\nMy calves are great, yeah.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nAnd yet you still aspire to Tyler's calves.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nYeah.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:50.000\nI find that from carrying around this, this giant lumbering frame,\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nI tend to get very, very nice definition in my calves.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nExactly.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:54.000\nYeah.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nYou guys know guys who wear shorts a lot because you're fat.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nYeah.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nYou know what I'm talking about.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nTyler, the fourth season of Deadbeat.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nNo, no.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nThe impending fourth season of Deadbeat.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nThe third, yeah.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nThis is the third one.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nThe third is about to come out on Wednesday, yeah.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:12.000\nOh, okay.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:16.000\nUnless you had a question about the upcoming potential fourth season.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nYes.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nPut a pin in it.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nYeah.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:23.000\nWe'll come back to that one in like a year from now.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nIt's because my girlfriend co-created the show,\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nso I'm used to talking about the fourth season as the impending season.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nThe third season is about to air.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nYeah, or it's about to drop, as they say.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:36.000\nIt's about to drop entirely in binge fashion.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, in classic binging fashion.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nOn Hulu.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:40.000\nOn Hulu.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nAnd by the way, people think that I'm paid,\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nI mean, I am paid by Hulu, not to be here,\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:49.000\nbut I think that Hulu, does anybody have Hulu?\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nOkay, that's a fucking dope platform.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\nIs it not?\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nAgain, I don't want to come off as one of those guys.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:59.000\nGuys, I know I'm on a show on Hulu, but Hulu.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nHulu's rad.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nNo, Hulu is rad.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nIt's good shit.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nIt's not as good as CISO though.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:08.000\nNone of you have CISO.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:12.000\nTalk about a rad platform!\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nPlatform fight.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nPlatform wars.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nPlatform fight.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nGo 90.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:26.000\nHBO's been doing some cool stuff recently.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:32.000\nHBO?\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:35.000\nHBO Canada's got some pretty tight shit too.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:38.000\nIs that what Deadbeat is on over there?\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:39.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nWe're not quality enough for HBO Canada.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:46.000\nI like Vines.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nAll right.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nI would like to see that Vines later by the way.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nI'll show it to you.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nOh no.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nLet's continue over there.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:56.000\nI got it.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:57.000\nWhat the...\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nFor the listeners at home, he's going through his Vines.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:08.000\nI'll get you a good one.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:13.000\nThat was the whole thing.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nI was waiting for it to start.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nIt's a dog.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nIt's going to be on the back of it.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:21.000\nIt turns around he's wearing sunglasses.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nWell, now I get it.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nNow it is funny.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nThat's funny.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nI didn't catch it.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nThat's an away homer.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nI want you to explain it.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nThat's an away homer, man.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nAll right.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:36.000\nI was like up till 3.30 in the morning and I'm texting my friends like Vines.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:40.000\nI text it to Kate and I hear from like the bedroom.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nIt's like 3.30 in the morning.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:48.000\nI'm trying to sleep.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nAll right.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:52.000\nWell, someone's got to run this.\n\n18:52.000 --> 19:00.000\nCan I just check in right now, I'm keeping a flow chart of Doug and Lewis' laughs.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:03.000\nRight now, I have a Venn diagram.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:08.000\nThe center circle is Crypt Keeper.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:12.000\nAnd then there's two offshoots, which is joy and evil.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:15.000\nAnd right now, they're completely tied.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:19.000\nThey're joyful slash evil Crypt Keepers.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.000\nI'll keep you informed that there's a little update.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nThey're both fine.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nYou don't feel embarrassed, did you, Lewis?\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nI didn't mean to.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nI mean, obviously, I didn't mean to.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:34.000\nWhy is this guy got a wheel like on his lap?\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:37.000\nWe're looking and no one's addressed the wheel in the room.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nHe's got a wheel in it.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nWhat's the wheel?\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nShow the wheel.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nShow the wheel.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:46.000\nIt's a star of David.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nIt's like it's a juicicle.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nIt's a juicicle.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nWhat's a juicicle?\n\n19:53.000 --> 20:02.000\nIt's a frozen treat that comes out around Ramadan, but it's kosher.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:07.000\nIt's like a pentacle, but it's Jew because it's a star of David.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nIs that a functioning tire for your bike?\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nDoesn't it have a cup holder on it?\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nA motorized unicycle?\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:16.000\nYou couldn't leave it at home?\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.000\nHow would he have gotten here if he'd left it at home?\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:23.000\nAlso, how many balls do you have calling that out?\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:26.000\nI saw a guy holding a big metal round thing in his lap, and I was like,\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:31.000\nwhat if he stood up and that's how he breathes?\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.000\nThe guy was like, leave that alone.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:38.000\nThe guy's got equipment.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nThere's no room.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nYou gotta stand.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nIt's a standing unicycle.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:47.000\nThat's why it's cheaper.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:53.000\nNo, no. There's no way. What are you talking about?\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nAll right.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nThis is...\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:02.000\nAll right.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nThis is a terrible idea.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nI'm very nervous right now.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:20.000\nThe front row is so upset about this.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:23.000\nIt's a joke. It doesn't actually work, does it?\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nOh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:36.000\nYou did it. Best podcast ever.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nI have a question.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nNick in his magical juicicle.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:43.000\nThat was amazing.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:46.000\nI have a question. I have two questions.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:49.000\nI have a thousand questions.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nAre you Jewish?\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:55.000\nI'm 63.125.\n\n21:55.000 --> 22:01.000\nThat's such a Jew answer.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:05.000\nOur next guest is my insurance agent.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:10.000\nBy the way, that would have easily, like, eight people could have sued us.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:13.000\nWhat I'm blown away by is the engineering of that.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nLike, how does that work? That's so cool.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:19.000\nUpon first viewing, that looks like an impossible feat that you just did.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:22.000\nSo the pedals just spin.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:26.000\nLike, the inside, the rim, if you will, spun independently of them.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nI was like, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nDoes the star of David, is that an important functional piece,\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nor is that just for design purposes?\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nIt's structural. It's structurally very sound.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:39.000\nIs it called a JunoCycle?\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nDid he say that? What's what it's called?\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nA JewCycle.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nHe said JewCycle.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nI got it mixed up.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:50.000\nCan you walk faster than you can do that?\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:53.000\nWalk faster.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nYou don't know.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:59.000\nThat's not a more efficient way to get around.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:04.000\nNick, try walking, and then you don't have to carry that thing around.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:08.000\nNick, I'm assuming it's a lot harder than riding a regular Unicycle with a seat, right?\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:11.000\nWell, it took me about a week and a half to learn to ride a regular Unicycle,\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nand this took me six weeks.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nSix weeks, okay.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nBut you had already learned how to ride a regular Unicycle.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nSo, yes.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nLet's not start from scratch.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nCan you pick that up first?\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nI have a question. Why?\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nAre you like a performer?\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nI'm a serious question. Are you like a performer,\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:30.000\nor is it just like you were like, I want to do this?\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:35.000\nWell, I just think, well, I learned how to ride a Unicycle,\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:39.000\nand I got bored with it, and then I found this on YouTube,\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:42.000\nand I said, I want to do that.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nI want to try it.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nThat makes sense.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nNot here, not on this stage, but I want to try it.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:52.000\nBut isn't there like a chain that you can lock it up outside?\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nI like that he's assuming people are going to steal it.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nWell, I mean, you can't just leave it laying out.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nSomeone would steal it, but I guess like...\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nNick, do you want to set it down up here?\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:08.000\nYeah, you can put it up there for the sake of your neighbors.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:12.000\nYeah, just the streets of Los Angeles are on that thing.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:18.000\nAll right. Jeff just left with it.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nSid, it's been stolen.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:23.000\nSo that proves the theory right there.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:26.000\nTyler, tell us about your show Deadbeat.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:30.000\nThat's a nice natural segue.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nI can't stop thinking.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:34.000\nI thought that was like a Captain America shield.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nI thought you were sitting there holding like a shield,\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nbut just got it like really wrong.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nWouldn't lift it up.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nBut then all I saw was a little bit of steel and rubber,\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:46.000\nand I just assumed like that may be holding that man's body together.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:49.000\nAnd Schrab's like, what's with that shit?\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nI was like, oh man.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:55.000\nI did have like a half second of...\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:58.000\nIt might be a collapsible wheelchair.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nRight, right, right.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:01.000\nThis could go badly.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nTouchy subject.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nAnyways, Deadbeat.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:05.000\nYes, Deadbeat.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:08.000\nI can't seem to make myself talk about this show.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nMy boss is in the audience too.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:11.000\nYour girlfriend.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nI should probably talk about it.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nYeah, it's the third season.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nI think you covered a lot of it.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nI hold a ghost balloon.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:21.000\nI hold a balloon a lot.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:24.000\nThere's a lot of yellow in the show.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nIs balloon actually a part of it?\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nOh, balloon's a big part of the show.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nYeah, balloon's a big part of the show.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nI mean, at least for the first like season,\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nand then people realize that balloon was not...\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:34.000\nIt always seemed to me...\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.000\nSuper.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:38.000\nYou and the balloon are kind of like a Sam and Diane kind of thing.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nLike, will they want that?\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nYeah, will they want that?\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nIt's like, are they or aren't they?\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nYou know?\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:44.000\nWill they want they?\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:47.000\nIt always seemed to me when I was driving by those billboards,\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.000\nwhen I knew what the show was,\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nthat I would look at the key art and I would go,\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:54.000\nokay, somebody at Hulu decided that they didn't want the show\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:57.000\nto be perceived as like a nerdy show\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:00.000\nbecause it's really about a guy who can see ghosts\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nand who helps them finish their business.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nThat's what the show's like.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nIt has nothing to do with the balloon, honestly.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:09.000\nSo then the key art seems to be engineered to be like,\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nyeah, but it's about people too.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:15.000\nYeah, and I think somebody in R&D was like,\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nand yellow makes people think happy thoughts\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nand it also makes them hungry.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nSo we should use yellow.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nWhat's that?\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:22.000\nIs it a drama or a comedy?\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:23.000\nIt's a comedy.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:26.000\nIt literally has nothing to do with balloons.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:27.000\nIt has nothing to do with it.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nNo.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nWell, it's a good pitch for a show,\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nwhich the key art never really made clear,\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:36.000\nwhich is that it's a dude who can see ghosts,\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:37.000\nbut he's a loser.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nI'm a total fucking loser.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:39.000\nOh, so it's drug addicts.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nAnd he can't help himself.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:44.000\nYeah, your first instinct was right.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:45.000\nYeah.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nOkay.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nNo, he can't help himself.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:51.000\nBut do you...\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nand been helping the ghosts?\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:58.000\nYeah, I can help them, but I can't help myself.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:01.000\nYou can't help yourself helping them?\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:04.000\nNo, I think you're hung up on that.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nOkay.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nI really am.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nYeah, I guess now it's become less about the emphasis.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:10.000\nSo you're a loser.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:13.000\nYou can't help yourself, but you can help these ghosts.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nYeah, I can help other people,\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nbut I don't know how to make my own life work,\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nif that makes sense.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nBut here are some reasons to watch the show,\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\neven though it's already been on for nine seasons.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nYeah.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nYou're going at your tenth season now, right?\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:28.000\nYeah, the eleventh season is coming out.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.000\nI was just at the premiere of, well,\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nand you showed episode 311, which, you know,\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nthey're all dropping at the same time on 420,\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nPneumonic device.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nCheck it out, 420.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nI saw the, it was the LARPing one.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:43.000\nYeah.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nIt was very cohesive.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nI was from talking to my lover,\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nwho helped create the show.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nTalk about that one.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nHer insights of like, oh, there's like,\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:55.000\nyou know, this fact of serializing this,\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nI was like, oh, I'm not going to understand,\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nI'm just dropping into the thing,\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nbut that's a nice little episode about it.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nYeah, it was a good little stand-align.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nThat's why they put it on at the premiere party.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nAt the premiere, because they were afraid\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nthere would be new viewers at the premiere.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nYeah, like, what the fuck is this all about?\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nThey'd be judging it like, fuck this, I don't get it.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nI end up here.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nThey knew I was coming.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:20.000\nBut yeah, we lampooned pretty much every, like,\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nstyle of film.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nAnd, you know, we did the LARPing thing.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:27.000\nWe did the Thomas Crown affair.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nI almost said Crown Royal affair.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.000\nWe do like a fight club one.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:35.000\nYeah.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nWho said tight?\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nSight.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:39.000\nWho said that?\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nVelvet, nice tight velvet bag, bro.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:44.000\nHe raised his hand like with devil horn,\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nwhich is the least surprising thing\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:49.000\nfor a guy who just yelled tight to do.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nAnd then take a bow.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:51.000\nOn brand.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:55.000\nThat guy is holding it like a giant tall boy\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\nTakate right there.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nPerfect.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:58.000\nHuh?\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nYeah.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:00.000\nYou're not?\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:01.000\nWhat is that?\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nThe tall boy.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:03.000\nYeah.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:06.000\nIt's a strong arena.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nYeah, so that's basically the show.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nIt's like, I feel like, did you guys know\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nBeing There, Peter Sellers?\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nYeah.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nThat was what I, I know Cody had a different\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\ninspiration for the show, but I always like\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:20.000\nto liken the character to Chauncey Gardner.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nHe's just an idiot who's failing upwards\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nand can't, can't help himself.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nI have a question.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nAre there a different ghost each episode\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nor are there, you have like a crew of ghosts\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:31.000\nthat you're afraid of?\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:32.000\nNo, it's like a ghost of the week.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nAnd we have one, we did have one ghost\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nthat followed, which was sort of the\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nballoon, I guess, if it had to be.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nDo you have like a ghost?\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nIs there like a blob?\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.000\nHe was a blob.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nIs there like a

30:50.000\nWhat business would a dinosaur need to finish?\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:51.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:52.000\nThat would be all.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:53.000\nIf that was possible.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:54.000\nYeah.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.000\nThere would be ghost dinosaurs everywhere\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nbecause they all...\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nThey never...\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nYeah.\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nThey're a fucking meteor hit.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nWell, maybe that was their business.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:01.000\nThey

31:33.000\nMy whole insides exploded basically.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:34.000\nWhat kind of doctor do you have\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:37.000\nif that's the diagnosis he's giving you?\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nAre you a ghost?\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nYeah, basically.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nHey, he helped himself.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nI have looked.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:44.000\nNo, he could find me.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:45.000\nHelp himself.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nIs that why the billboard doesn't...\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:48.000\nIt's just you and a balloon?\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:49.000\nBecause you're the ghost?\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:50.000\nYeah.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:51.000\nYeah.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.000\nFinally.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nYou guys finally got

32:00.000\nWhoa!\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:01.000\nRight through.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:02.000\nWhoa!\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:03.000\nOh!\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nWhoa!\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nBut you're touching me.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.000\nYou're physically touching me.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:07.000\nNo, I didn't.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.000\nI can't.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nYou're a ghost.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nWait, but what happened with the...\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nWhat happened on Wednesday night?\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:14.000\nOh, now that I just drank a lot on Wednesday night,\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nand I've been having...\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nI've been having a lot of gastrointestinal issues, guys.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:21.000\nA lot of diarrhea.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:24.000\nA lot of unexplained sounds and pains,\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nand I've just been drinking my way through it,\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nwhich my wife thinks is a bad idea.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:29.000\nMy doctor does, too.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nI saw you at the premiere.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nYeah, and I was drinking a lot.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.000\nAnd you were like,\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nI can't wait to come drink on the show.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nYeah, I was like,\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nI'm gonna bring you a bottle of booze and everything.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nAnd I was like,\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nthere's booze there.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.000\nAnd you were like,\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:40.000\nyeah, but there won't be enough.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:41.000\nAnd then we split up,\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:45.000\nand then you walked into the spinning propeller of a plane.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:46.000\nYeah.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:50.000\nAnd I died, and now I'm here.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nYeah, no.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:53.000\nBasically, my doctor...\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:54.000\nThis is so stupid.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:55.000\nWhy am I fucking telling this?\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nNo, this is important.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nAre you kidding me?\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nThis is the second act of any hermitage.\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.000\nI'm not kidding you right now,\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nbut I was moments ago.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:04.000\nThere are issues going on with me and my guts.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nWe are yet to be determined in my doctor.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:07.000\nHow long have you had these?\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.000\nIt's about three months.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nGut?\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nI was shooting season three of Deadbeat.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nI almost killed myself in New York with food,\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nbut there's just lots of food and alcohol.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nBecause that's what they pay you at Hulu.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nYeah, they pay you at Hulu.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nThey're like, here's more crackers.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nYeah, here's some more crackers,\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nand here's some,\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nat least they give me some T-Dos once in a while.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:31.000\nBut I got some sort of elimination diet thing going on in my doctor.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nI said, why don't we just start with alcohol?\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nWe'll start with alcohol and see where we go from there.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:36.000\nAnd then it'll be like,\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:37.000\noh, now it's bananas,\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:38.000\nand now it's avocado,\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nman, I would start with bananas.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nI know, right?\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.000\nHe got me worried though.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nThis is a Western medicine doctor.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nI think I should go to see some,\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:49.000\nlike on purpose I should go see some really hokey-whackies.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nThis is an easy thing to eliminate first.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nYeah, eliminate first is the thing you drink for fun.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:54.000\nLike, I would be like,\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\neliminate every fucking thing until then,\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nbecause that's my toe hold.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nBecause once you eliminate that,\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nI'm like, I'm dead.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:05.000\nLike, eliminate avocado, eliminate toast,\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\neliminate church.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nI'm thinking, I'm thinking long game.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:10.000\nI'm thinking like,\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nI don't want to have to eliminate booze forever.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nSo if I eliminate it now and figure out some shit,\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nmaybe I can drink in like a month.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:17.000\nYeah, I hear you.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nRather than just keep drinking through.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nAnd they're like, well, you were fine a month ago,\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nand then you drank a hole in your guts.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nAnd now you can't do it anymore.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nI have had some serious intestinal problems,\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:28.000\nbut they cleared up right after I stopped going to church, so.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:29.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nI would definitely try that.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:32.000\nAlright, so maybe I should start with church.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nMaybe I should start with giving up church.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:38.000\nThat's why I've never had gastrointestinal problems.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nMust be nice.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nMuslim privilege.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:46.000\nHashtag third world problems.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nWhat if we turn the tables?\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nThird world problems.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nOh, great.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nI don't know where you're going with that.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:56.000\nYou're eating rust from a bowl again.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:59.000\nCamille, what have you been up to, Superstar?\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nCan we talk about your project?\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nOr is that a secret?\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:03.000\nNo, what project?\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nYour movie.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:08.000\nNo, we can talk about it.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:09.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:12.000\nWell, Silicon Valley comes back April 24th,\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nand that's going to be great.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:18.000\nThat's going to be great.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:19.000\nAnd then I think we...\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:22.000\nI mentioned the movie here once before, right?\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nHe doesn't pay attention.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:25.000\nYeah.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:30.000\nHe doesn't pay attention.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.000\nAlright.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nEmily and I wrote a movie.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:42.000\nUnless your vine is louder than his bread.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nSince you've eliminated alcohol,\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:47.000\nhave you experienced any relief from your symptoms?\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nYou mean in the last two days?\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:50.000\nI'm trying to help you.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nDon't fucking turn on me.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nNo, I haven't.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:55.000\nI haven't.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:56.000\nWell, it's been four.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:57.000\nWhat's the day? Sunday?\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:58.000\nI never know what day the week it is.\n\n35:58.000 --> 35:59.000\nSunday.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:00.000\nSo your last track, Wednesday?\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:01.000\nOn Wednesday.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:02.000\nFriday. Friday.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nSo I had about two days of real excruciating stomach pain.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:07.000\nThat's why I stopped, because I couldn't stand up.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:08.000\nYou think it's ulcers?\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nYeah, it might be ulcerative colitis assumption.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\nI don't know what it is.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:14.000\nBut all I know is that after that drinking,\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nand there was like two nights of drinking before that,\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:17.000\nthat set me off.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:18.000\nYeah.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nBut in the last four days, I feel good.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:23.000\nI just drink like double vodka on the rocks,\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nwhich may have also something to do with...\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:30.000\nYeah.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:34.000\nOh, is that your drink, too?\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:41.000\nDan wanted to hear you say anything other than that answer.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:44.000\nIt's the best drink on the face of the planet.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nI mean, just vodka and ice is like...\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nAnd you got to drink it before the ice melts,\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nbecause otherwise you get watery booze,\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:51.000\nand then you drink, you know...\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:52.000\nYeah, it goes, it's good.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nAnd you don't want to drink any water by mistake.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:57.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nWow.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nNot at all.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nYou don't know what's in that shit.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:03.000\nYou don't know what they put in that shit.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:06.000\nIt's a race against time.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:07.000\nAnd I always win.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:11.000\nI win that race, usually.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:15.000\nDan was hoping you were going to say margaritas.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:19.000\nOr vitamin water.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nI drink a lot of moon juice.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:25.000\nI'm resigned to the fact that each of us are snowflakes,\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nand we don't...\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nI mean, I'm not...\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:32.000\nMy big fear is like, you know,\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:35.000\nwhen people, like, their obituaries happen,\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nand then everybody's like...\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nI guess that's my way of saying they die.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:42.000\nYou know, their obituaries happen.\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:43.000\nOh, my God.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:46.000\nNo, there's no recipe for death.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:47.000\nWe were just talking about this.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:50.000\nWell, Brittany Murphy, remember?\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nWhen her obituary happened?\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nShe died.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nAnd it was like, oh, her lifestyle,\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nand she did this, and she didn't eat,\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nand she only put butts on her heads, and whatever.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:04.000\nLike, everybody just sounded off on how she died,\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:08.000\nand then moved on, and then her husband died?\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:11.000\nAnd it was because their fucking shower had mold in it,\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:14.000\nand it was like...\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:15.000\nIs that really what it was?\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:16.000\nYeah, black mold, man.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nIt'll kill you.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nBut it was like, shit, man.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nLike, I don't know what the point of that fable is,\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.000\nbut it's like...\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:23.000\nFuck.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nYou know, when people die, just fucking say it's tragic.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:26.000\nYeah, man.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:27.000\nOr when people go out of their way,\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\ntheir whole life to be the most healthy part,\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:30.000\nlike, obnoxiously healthy,\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:31.000\nand then they fucking drop dead in the gym.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:32.000\nYou know, there's no...\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:33.000\nThere is no plan.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:34.000\nIf we had figured it out,\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:37.000\nthere would be a very noticeable disparity\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:40.000\nbetween doctor life spans and patient life spans.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nIt never happens.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nWe've spent all this money going to these guys\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:47.000\nthat are doctors or ladies.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:48.000\nDoctors can be ladies.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:49.000\nGuys is unisex.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:50.000\nGuys is unisex.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:53.000\nBut it's all their life spans are random, you know?\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:54.000\nLike, they're like,\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:55.000\nyou should eat more peanuts.\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:56.000\nThey're like, well, what do you do?\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:59.000\nYou're going to die randomly, too.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:00.000\nYeah.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:01.000\nThat's the point.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nThat was the whole point in a nutshell.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.000\nYou're going to die randomly.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:09.000\nI've met more old doctors and comedians.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nIt's an astute observation.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:12.000\nI think that's fair.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:13.000\nThat's fair.\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:14.000\nThat's because as a comedian,\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:17.000\nyou're constantly going to the doctor.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:18.000\nAll right.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:21.000\nFair enough.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nNo, that would be noticeable.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:25.000\nPeople would be like,\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:29.000\nTyler just told you that drinking double vodka is killing him.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nYeah, but what he's saying is that's killing me.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nThat doesn't mean it's going to kill him.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:34.000\nIt's random.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:35.000\nHe's not the same.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:36.000\nTyler has me.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:37.000\nI don't want anybody out there thinking\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nthat this is some sort of fucking PSA\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nfor not drinking vodka.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:42.000\nDrink vodka.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:43.000\nDrink vodka, man.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nI wish I could drink vodka with you right now.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nUntil your stomach bleeds and then stop.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:48.000\nYeah, and then be like,\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:51.000\nis there some way to retroactively fix this,\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:52.000\nput a band-aid on it,\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nand then start drinking again as soon as possible.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nRon Funches did a Great Minds.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nHe's allergic to alcohol.\n\n39:58.000 --> 39:59.000\nI was like, oh, like allergic to alcohol,\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nlike you drink it and then you get really drunk.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:02.000\nNo, allergic to alcohol,\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nlike if Ron Funches takes a drink.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:05.000\nAnaphylactic.\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nYeah, his throat closes up.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:10.000\nI was like, can you imagine being a high schooler?\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nOh, no, I don't want to.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:13.000\nI'm allergic to it.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:14.000\nYeah, fuck you, pussy.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nAnd like, I bet you he found himself\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\non the floor of a lot of parties and like,\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:19.000\noh, shame, shame, shame.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nLike, we're not all the same.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nShame, shame, shame.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:25.000\nWe're not all the same.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:28.000\nI just had an image of him like succumbing to peer pressure.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:29.000\nLike, drink, drink, drink.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:32.000\nAnd he's like, all right, let me get my EpiPen.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:33.000\nYeah.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:34.000\nYeah, I mean, that's like.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nWhere's the orange for this guy?\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nI don't know, like I smoke some weed\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:41.000\nand I start checking my polls and freaking out.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nAnd like, the angels are talking to me.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:44.000\nYeah.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nAnd then Spencer's like, like, you know,\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\neats a brick of hash for this breakfast\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.000\nand to keep his hands steady.\n\n40:51.000 --> 41:01.000\nThat's fresh ice that I poured for the next person.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:02.000\nYou can use that.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:06.000\nThat's so thoughtful.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nKeep talking.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:08.000\nNo, I'm talking.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nAnd of course, Jeff is a slave to.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:15.000\nYou guys fling a craven on me.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nI don't know what that craven thinks.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:18.000\nDecent.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:19.000\nDecent pour.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:20.000\nDecent pour.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:21.000\nYou are.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:22.000\nYou haven't.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:23.000\nI approve.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nYou haven't had to drink in two days, right?\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:26.000\nFour days.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:27.000\nNo, I'm okay.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:28.000\nYeah.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:29.000\nBut I go through.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nI go through bouts of not drinking often.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nI have two small children and a third one on the way.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nAnd thank you.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:39.000\nAnd I find that it's not it's not so much that it's the drinking.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:40.000\nIt's the recovery.\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:41.000\nDo your kids drink?\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:42.000\nYeah, they drink.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:43.000\nMan, guys.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nSomebody's got to stay in control.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nSomeone's got to be lucid, you know.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:48.000\nYeah.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nNow, the morning, the morning, the 515.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nYou're like the designated driver these days.\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:53.000\nYeah, it's bullshit.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:54.000\nHow old are your kids?\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nI have a five-year-old girl, a two-and-a-half-year-old boy,\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\nand a 10-and-a-half-week-old.\n\n41:58.000 --> 41:59.000\nThat one's a ghost.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:00.000\nThat one's a ghost.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:01.000\nThat one's a ghost.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:02.000\nThat one's a ghost.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:03.000\nYeah.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:04.000\nNo spoilers.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:07.000\nInspired by Ghost Balloon.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:10.000\nHis third kid's a balloon.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\nYou have three children?\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:13.000\nNo, two with a third.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nOne is still so tiny.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nI shouldn't even be talking about it right now.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:18.000\nThird is imminent.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:19.000\nWell, no.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:22.000\nIt's like, it's literally, it's a 10-and-a-half-week-old fetus.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:23.000\nOh, so many of them.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:24.000\nYeah.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:25.000\nI told my mom yet.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:26.000\nI don't think my mom knows yet.\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nMaybe she listens to Harmontown.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nDoes your mom listen to Harmontown?\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:31.000\nYeah.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:32.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:33.000\nShe's a big fan.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:34.000\nThis is the plan.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:35.000\nThis is why I'm here.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:36.000\nYeah.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nI'm having a third baby.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:41.000\nAre you, are you Catholic?\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nNo, I'm nothing.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:46.000\nSome people want children.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nYou know what it is?\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:54.000\nI really, I really like the feeling of coming in my way.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:55.000\nThat called me crazy.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:56.000\nI don't know.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:57.000\nI just like it.\n\n42:57.000 --> 43:00.000\nI was willing to throw it all away for that one.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:04.000\nAnd she's like, well, oh, God.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nHere he goes again.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:07.000\nWe'll see.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:08.000\nThat makes two of us, Taylor.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:09.000\nYeah.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:10.000\nRight, so.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:14.000\nOh, oh, you mean coming in my wife?\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:15.000\nI get it.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nHe just gave me a pin.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:24.000\nI'm just saying, if your third child comes out wearing a suit, I know who to call.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:25.000\nWe'll wait till that.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.000\nAgain, put a pin in that.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:27.000\nWe'll put a pin in that.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:33.000\nThe slogan of this podcast is, he comes in his wife and we can't help ourselves.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:39.000\nWhich is, it's, can you read it the right way?\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nIt almost works better for that.\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:42.000\nHe comes in his wife.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nCan't help himself.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nComes in his wife.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:47.000\nComes in his wife.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nHe can't help himself, though.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nHe can't, he comes in his wife.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nCan't come in himself.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:54.000\nThat's not true, though.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:55.000\nI mean, I could.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:56.000\nOkay, you can.\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nYou have to get your wrist going.\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:03.000\nYeah, there's a thing, I think it's called like retro grid ejaculation where you just come up inside your bladder.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nOh yeah, that's no good.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:07.000\nThat doesn't happen to everybody in here?\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:12.000\nIs that like a choice you make as you're coming like inside and then it goes inside?\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.000\nI don't know.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:14.000\nI just, I just.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:15.000\nDo you choose or is that a condition?\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:16.000\nI just read, I just read about it.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nI know, I know as much about it as you do.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:22.000\nIf you yell inside in Latin as you're coming, you just come inside yourself.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:23.000\nI don't know.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:26.000\nI just thought it was something that everybody had experienced at one point.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:29.000\nEvery time I've come, I've come outside.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nYeah, yeah, that's why it's called retro grid.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nI've never had like reverse orgasms.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nWell, let me tell you something.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nIt feels horrible.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:40.000\nWhat are you talking about when you pinch the, yeah.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:45.000\nNo, the only reason I actually know this is because Dr. Drew Pinsky explained it to me once.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:46.000\nI'm not blind.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nApparently what happens is if you.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:51.000\nDid he explain it to you or was it on the radio and you heard it?\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:52.000\nYeah, I was on his show.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:53.000\nOh, okay.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:54.000\nSo both.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:55.000\nIt was in the green room.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:56.000\nYeah.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\nSplit the difference.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:58.000\nLet's bring him out.\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nHe can explain it to you.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nDr. Drew, come on.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:06.000\nI think it's one of those things where if you try to stop the E-jack for too long.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\nYes.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:08.000\nE-jack.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nE-jack.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:10.000\nThis is my theory.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:11.000\nNot do it.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:15.000\nAnd I guess it can eventually, because it doesn't go back up inside of your nuts.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:18.000\nIt goes back up your urethra and part so it can end up in your bladder.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:19.000\nWhy are you stopping it?\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:20.000\nYou pee out your.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nBecause you want to fuck longer.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:26.000\nYeah, are you like, people call, is something called edging, I think, where you just keep fucking.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:27.000\nNever heard of it.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:28.000\nAlmost there.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:29.000\nNever heard of it.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:30.000\nYeah.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:31.000\nWell, there's a thing called edging.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:32.000\nYeah.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:33.000\nYeah.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:34.000\nYeah.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nYeah.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:44.000\nNow, for the Harmontown listeners that have not paid $5 a month to see the live stream,\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:49.000\nTyler is currently edging Rob Schrab right now.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:50.000\nOnly $5 a month.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\nYou get to see.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:52.000\nOkay.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nSo what are you doing?\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:54.000\nHe's getting an education.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:55.000\nOkay.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:56.000\nAll right.\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:57.000\nDon't encourage that.\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:58.000\nHave a vodka.\n\n45:58.000 --> 45:59.000\nHave a.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:00.000\nNo.\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:01.000\nNo word plan.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:02.000\nNo sports.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:03.000\nThat was great.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:04.000\nSorry.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:05.000\nI only have two rules.\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:06.000\nBut wait.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:11.000\nI want to talk about this, obviously.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:19.240\nBut when you're talking about not wanting to orgasm for a while, that's different from\n\n46:19.240 --> 46:20.240\npinching the tip.\n\n46:20.240 --> 46:21.240\nNo, but they're not.\n\n46:21.240 --> 46:22.240\nIt's not pinching.\n\n46:22.240 --> 46:23.240\nIt's like hold.\n\n46:23.240 --> 46:24.240\nRight.\n\n46:24.240 --> 46:25.240\nIt's like, it's not literally like you.\n\n46:25.240 --> 46:28.560\nIt has already happened and you're, it's at the tip and you're just stopping it.\n\n46:28.560 --> 46:29.560\nThat would just eventually come out.\n\n46:29.560 --> 46:33.240\nI think it's like, it's like, it's like the active.\n\n46:33.240 --> 46:40.640\nIt's the act of actively going to stop, go, stop, ejaculation, if you do that long enough,\n\n46:40.640 --> 46:41.640\nyou can come inside.\n\n46:41.640 --> 46:44.360\nLike thinking about, I know you hate this, but like, you know, when people think about\n\n46:44.360 --> 46:47.640\nbaseball, when they're fucking, do not come.\n\n46:47.640 --> 46:48.640\nIt's like that.\n\n46:48.640 --> 46:56.720\nRed light, green light, red light, green light, like if you're about to come, you go red light\n\n46:56.720 --> 46:57.720\nand then you stop.\n\n46:57.720 --> 47:04.720\nThen you come inside you, if you red light too many times, Tyler, you start going the\n\n47:04.720 --> 47:05.720\nwrong way.\n\n47:05.720 --> 47:09.880\nI genuinely feel like I still want to open this up to the, to the crowd and have other\n\n47:09.880 --> 47:14.800\npeople talk about their experiences with, with, to a great, spectacular, and you, you\n\n47:14.800 --> 47:17.440\nthink you have felt the repercussions of that?\n\n47:17.440 --> 47:18.720\nNo, I've never had it happen to me.\n\n47:18.720 --> 47:19.720\nI've had it explained to me.\n\n47:19.720 --> 47:22.400\nIs this a wives tale or a husband's tale or a thing?\n\n47:22.400 --> 47:23.920\nIt's a Dr. Drew Pinsky tale.\n\n47:23.920 --> 47:26.360\nIt's a, it's a, and if he says it, it's got to be true.\n\n47:26.360 --> 47:28.160\nI think it's a thing that happens.\n\n47:28.160 --> 47:30.800\nWhat would be the worst possible scenario that that?\n\n47:30.800 --> 47:31.800\nI don't know.\n\n47:31.800 --> 47:33.320\nI'm not an expert on this.\n\n47:33.320 --> 47:37.320\nI just think, I think if you, I mean, if you imagine, you know, infection or maybe some\n\n47:37.320 --> 47:38.760\nkind of sepsis or something.\n\n47:38.760 --> 47:43.200\nYeah, you go, no, there is a, well, look, I, like, what I've read about this is that\n\n47:43.200 --> 47:46.440\nthere are, there are, he's read about it too.\n\n47:46.440 --> 47:54.200\nThere are men who are into the idea of you actually physically, like, restrain the actual\n\n47:54.200 --> 47:55.200\nemission.\n\n47:55.200 --> 47:56.200\nOh, right.\n\n47:56.200 --> 47:58.200\nIt's called the Dr. Drew Pinsky.\n\n47:58.200 --> 47:59.200\nOh!\n\n47:59.200 --> 48:00.200\nI guess.\n\n48:00.200 --> 48:01.200\nThat's been our show.\n\n48:01.200 --> 48:04.440\nThank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.\n\n48:04.440 --> 48:05.440\nDrive fast.\n\n48:05.440 --> 48:06.440\nTake chances.\n\n48:06.440 --> 48:07.440\nI don't like it.\n\n48:07.440 --> 48:08.440\nI don't like wordplay.\n\n48:08.440 --> 48:13.200\nHe doesn't like it because if he thought of it, he would have said it.\n\n48:13.200 --> 48:14.720\nThat's not true.\n\n48:14.720 --> 48:15.720\nThat's not true.\n\n48:15.720 --> 48:16.720\nSo true.\n\n48:16.720 --> 48:21.440\nI'm, I'm thinking of a thousand puns a minute and just rejecting them.\n\n48:21.440 --> 48:23.000\nGive us one you reject it.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:26.000\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:27.000\nThat's a good one.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:28.000\nThat's a good one.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:29.000\nI like that one.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:35.320\nUh, uh, uh, why, why are you judging me with your microphone?\n\n48:35.320 --> 48:45.320\nThat seems like a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,\n\n48:45.320 --> 48:54.280\na, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, and a, a, a, a, a,\n\n48:54.280 --> 49:02.720\na, a, a a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,\n\n49:02.720 --> 49:06.200\na, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a a, a, a, a, a, maybe even better than that.\n\n49:06.200 --> 49:09.240\nIt's good, it's not good, but it's not bad, it doesn't matter.\n\n49:09.240 --> 49:13.000\nI think you could mess up your epididymis, give it some blockage or swelling.\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:14.000\nYour epidermis?\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:15.000\nYour skin?\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:16.000\nEpididymis.\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:17.000\nEpidymis.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:20.320\nWell, is the epididymis, is that part of the, is that weird?\n\n49:20.320 --> 49:24.000\nIs that weird gum, chewed gum looking feeling thing on your testicles?\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:25.000\nFeeling thing.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:26.000\nI don't think I have one of those.\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:29.000\nOh, that's, you gotta get that gum chewed man.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:34.000\nI think epididymis was the Greek God of shriveling.\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:38.880\nNo, no, no, I do have that on my testicles, yeah.\n\n49:38.880 --> 49:40.880\nUm, anyways.\n\n49:40.880 --> 49:42.880\nDo you guys, do you guys come a lot?\n\n49:42.880 --> 49:43.880\nOh.\n\n49:43.880 --> 49:44.880\nYeah.\n\n49:44.880 --> 49:45.880\nWhat do you mean?\n\n49:45.880 --> 49:46.880\nDo you mean like a, like a large amount?\n\n49:46.880 --> 49:47.880\nThis is a sausage party.\n\n49:47.880 --> 49:48.880\nDo you mean like number of times?\n\n49:48.880 --> 49:49.880\nNo, volume, volume.\n\n49:49.880 --> 49:50.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n49:50.880 --> 49:51.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n49:51.880 --> 49:52.880\nNot really.\n\n49:52.880 --> 49:53.880\nI don't think I'm coming.\n\n49:53.880 --> 49:54.880\nI don't, I don't.\n\n49:54.880 --> 49:55.880\nCan I get that too?\n\n49:55.880 --> 50:00.880\nI don't know what, I don't know how much, I don't know how much other people are popping.\n\n50:00.880 --> 50:08.880\nWhat about Jeff, what about Jeff, what about Jeff, what about Jeff, Jeff, are you coming\n\n50:08.880 --> 50:09.880\na lot?\n\n50:09.880 --> 50:12.840\nJeff, Jeff, are you coming a lot?\n\n50:12.840 --> 50:13.840\nRight now?\n\n50:13.840 --> 50:16.920\nI'd say regular amount.\n\n50:16.920 --> 50:17.920\nRegular amount.\n\n50:17.920 --> 50:18.920\nWhat's a regular amount?\n\n50:18.920 --> 50:20.840\nCan I tell a story really quick about this?\n\n50:20.840 --> 50:26.200\nSo years ago, my, my, my, my friend's wife was going through like an Eastern meds, Chinese\n\n50:26.200 --> 50:27.840\nmedicine school.\n\n50:27.840 --> 50:28.840\nAnd she was like.\n\n50:28.840 --> 50:33.560\nYeah, well, to become a doctor, like a naturopath or a, or a homeopathic doctor.\n\n50:33.560 --> 50:37.720\nIt's not a doctor, but you know what I mean, they call themselves doctors.\n\n50:37.720 --> 50:41.320\nAnd she was like, would you come in for my final exam, which is basically me and my,\n\n50:41.320 --> 50:44.720\nmy professor, and I'm doing an exam on you in front of the professor.\n\n50:44.720 --> 50:45.720\nYes, there were professors.\n\n50:45.720 --> 50:46.720\nLoose leaf.\n\n50:46.720 --> 50:47.720\nYeah.\n\n50:47.720 --> 50:48.720\nThey're professors.\n\n50:48.720 --> 50:49.720\nLoose leaf.\n\n50:49.720 --> 50:50.720\nLoose leaf.\n\n50:50.720 --> 50:51.720\nLoose leaf professors.\n\n50:51.720 --> 50:55.400\nAnd, and I went, I was like, yeah, sure, because she was a friend of mine.\n\n50:55.400 --> 50:56.400\nI went in there.\n\n50:56.400 --> 50:57.400\nWhy am I racing through this?\n\n50:57.400 --> 50:58.400\nJesus.\n\n50:58.400 --> 50:59.400\nI was like, I'm panicking.\n\n50:59.400 --> 51:00.400\nTake your time.\n\n51:00.400 --> 51:01.400\nTake your time.\n\n51:01.400 --> 51:02.400\nTake your time.\n\n51:02.400 --> 51:03.400\nEverybody take it fucking easy.\n\n51:03.400 --> 51:04.400\nLet him tell his side.\n\n51:04.400 --> 51:05.400\nYeah, I'm like trying to just like get through it before someone says something, and then\n\n51:05.400 --> 51:06.400\nstart over.\n\n51:06.400 --> 51:07.400\nOkay.\n\n51:07.400 --> 51:08.400\nSo because of all that sublimated cum you have.\n\n51:08.400 --> 51:09.400\nOh God.\n\n51:09.400 --> 51:13.240\nIt's all, it's all so backed up.\n\n51:13.240 --> 51:15.800\nYou get to dilute that with vodka.\n\n51:15.800 --> 51:17.480\nI wish.\n\n51:17.480 --> 51:19.820\nOh, come on, man.\n\n51:19.820 --> 51:21.900\nThat's not, God.\n\n51:21.900 --> 51:22.900\nJust tell the story.\n\n51:22.900 --> 51:23.900\nAll right.\n\n51:23.900 --> 51:24.900\nSo here we go.\n\n51:24.900 --> 51:25.900\nReally quick.\n\n51:25.900 --> 51:34.420\nI went into the classroom, guess it's called a classroom, and the professor is in there.\n\n51:34.420 --> 51:39.220\nAnd he's got like eight students in there, as well as my friend Sarah, who's giving\n\n51:39.220 --> 51:40.220\nme the exam.\n\n51:40.220 --> 51:43.100\nAnd I was like, I thought it was just going to be me and you and your professor.\n\n51:43.100 --> 51:44.900\nAnd she was like, no, no, no, it's got to be in front.\n\n51:44.900 --> 51:45.900\nSo can you lay down on the exam table?\n\n51:45.900 --> 51:46.900\nI'm going to do some stuff.\n\n51:46.900 --> 51:49.060\nAnd I was like, I thought it was all going to be like questions or whatever.\n\n51:49.060 --> 51:50.060\nSo she lays me down.\n\n51:50.060 --> 51:53.620\nShe starts doing some like feely, touchy feely stuff, checking out my vital organs and what\n\n51:53.620 --> 51:56.340\nI'm not asking me questions along the way.\n\n51:56.340 --> 51:57.340\nYeah.\n\n51:57.340 --> 52:00.340\nSo one of the questions was, how often do you masturbate?\n\n52:00.340 --> 52:03.500\nAnd there's nine grown adults right there.\n\n52:03.500 --> 52:05.980\nAnd I'm like, whatever, that's all right.\n\n52:05.980 --> 52:10.060\nI masturbate frequently, let's say like two, three times a week, which is a lie.\n\n52:10.060 --> 52:11.300\nIt's like five times a week.\n\n52:11.300 --> 52:12.300\nWhat?\n\n52:12.300 --> 52:13.300\nYeah.\n\n52:13.300 --> 52:14.300\nYeah.\n\n52:14.300 --> 52:15.300\nAnd that's below.\n\n52:15.300 --> 52:17.100\nBut I just want to be feeling self-conscious.\n\n52:17.100 --> 52:18.780\nI'm surrounded by nine people.\n\n52:18.780 --> 52:19.980\nFive times a week?\n\n52:19.980 --> 52:24.140\nSo I lied about the amount, but now I'm realizing that I'm in a room with many more people\n\n52:24.140 --> 52:27.140\nin it.\n\n52:27.140 --> 52:29.980\nAll of whom jerk off three times a day minimum.\n\n52:29.980 --> 52:30.980\nYeah.\n\n52:30.980 --> 52:31.980\nI just, before we move on.\n\n52:31.980 --> 52:33.980\nOh, so I'm like a, I'm a pillar of my strength.\n\n52:33.980 --> 52:34.980\nYeah.\n\n52:34.980 --> 52:35.980\nYou're like a creaker.\n\n52:35.980 --> 52:36.980\nYeah.\n\n52:36.980 --> 52:37.980\nYeah.\n\n52:37.980 --> 52:42.780\nSo I think, you know, I'm not super comfortable with this line of questioning.\n\n52:42.780 --> 52:47.700\nAnd then inevitably she, she says, so how much do you ejaculate?\n\n52:47.700 --> 52:49.180\nAnd again, this is in front of a bunch of people.\n\n52:49.180 --> 52:52.980\nAnd they're all like scribbling on pads and looking at me like, this is going down in\n\n52:52.980 --> 52:55.020\nsome medical text.\n\n52:55.020 --> 52:56.020\nIs it?\n\n52:56.020 --> 52:57.020\nYes.\n\n52:57.020 --> 52:58.020\nIt's called a medical text.\n\n52:58.020 --> 52:59.020\nIs it on papyrus?\n\n52:59.020 --> 53:00.020\nIs it a scroll?\n\n53:00.020 --> 53:01.020\nYeah.\n\n53:01.020 --> 53:02.020\nIt's on papyrus.\n\n53:02.020 --> 53:03.020\nYes.\n\n53:03.020 --> 53:04.020\nYeah.\n\n53:04.020 --> 53:05.020\nSo it's written in calligraphy.\n\n53:05.020 --> 53:06.020\nYeah.\n\n53:06.020 --> 53:07.460\nAlso, all in Mandarin calligraphy.\n\n53:07.460 --> 53:10.500\nThe professor or witch doctor.\n\n53:10.500 --> 53:12.300\nYou have to know how to convert into metric.\n\n53:12.300 --> 53:13.300\nYeah.\n\n53:13.300 --> 53:14.300\nYeah.\n\n53:14.300 --> 53:15.300\nYeah.\n\n53:15.300 --> 53:16.300\nWell, this is in Canada.\n\n53:16.300 --> 53:17.300\nSo we were, yeah, we were already metric.\n\n53:17.300 --> 53:18.300\nIt's all metric.\n\n53:18.300 --> 53:19.300\nYeah.\n\n53:19.300 --> 53:24.860\nBut I'm just looking at her like, you fucking asshole, you ambushed me with this weird ass\n\n53:24.860 --> 53:27.300\ntest in front of all your friends.\n\n53:27.300 --> 53:28.780\nAnd she's like, how much do you ejaculate?\n\n53:28.780 --> 53:31.580\nAnd I was just like, this is a real critical moment in my life.\n\n53:31.580 --> 53:35.140\nI'm like, do I totally exaggerate and make myself like, is that a thing?\n\n53:35.140 --> 53:36.140\nIs it like, how would you say it?\n\n53:36.140 --> 53:39.140\nLike, well, that's what I was like, well, do you mean in like teaspoons, tablespoons?\n\n53:39.140 --> 53:44.140\nUh, you know, we're talking about her ladle, and she was like, she was like, she was only\n\n53:44.140 --> 53:48.580\ndoing this right, I don't know, like, like, what's she doing?\n\n53:48.580 --> 53:49.580\nWhat is that?\n\n53:49.580 --> 53:50.580\nWhat is that?\n\n53:50.580 --> 53:53.580\nLike, as if it landed on the ground and it just, it just oozed out into her perfectly.\n\n53:53.580 --> 53:58.860\nDid she think you're coming a glom or was like, I was making like a fucking tennis ball\n\n53:58.860 --> 53:59.860\nof cum?\n\n53:59.860 --> 54:02.260\nLike, as if I was making like, like, cum pancakes.\n\n54:02.260 --> 54:03.260\nI had a ladle.\n\n54:03.260 --> 54:04.260\nOh yeah.\n\n54:04.260 --> 54:05.260\nPut it in there.\n\n54:05.260 --> 54:06.260\nThere we go.\n\n54:06.260 --> 54:07.260\nOkay.\n\n54:07.260 --> 54:08.260\nAre they kid sized, cum pancakes?\n\n54:08.260 --> 54:09.260\nYeah.\n\n54:09.260 --> 54:10.760\nChild, like children sized, cum pancakes.\n\n54:10.760 --> 54:13.660\nI'm something like a Belgian waffle the bottle.\n\n54:13.660 --> 54:14.660\nOver a dollar.\n\n54:14.660 --> 54:18.340\nI can make, I can make a Mickey Mouse cake for you.\n\n54:18.340 --> 54:20.940\nSo I just basically, it was like, I was like, yeah.\n\n54:20.940 --> 54:21.940\nYeah.\n\n54:21.940 --> 54:22.940\nYeah.\n\n54:22.940 --> 54:23.940\nWhat is she doing?\n\n54:23.940 --> 54:24.940\nWhat does that mean?\n\n54:24.940 --> 54:25.940\nI don't know.\n\n54:25.940 --> 54:29.380\nAnd then, and then, and then I basically finished the exam and left and she gave me a whole\n\n54:29.380 --> 54:32.980\nbunch of little meds that looked like rabbit poo pellets.\n\n54:32.980 --> 54:35.380\nAnd this will help with your ejaculation.\n\n54:35.380 --> 54:40.540\nAnd I was like, I didn't, but I told you I come a lot and she's like, she was like,\n\n54:40.540 --> 54:41.540\ncome on.\n\n54:41.540 --> 54:43.900\nIt's supposed to be this.\n\n54:43.900 --> 54:47.900\nWe're all coming full unicycles over here.\n\n54:47.900 --> 54:51.060\nSo they had like a conference after I left, like that guy needs to come more.\n\n54:51.060 --> 54:52.060\nYeah.\n\n54:52.060 --> 54:53.060\nLet's give them these pellets.\n\n54:53.060 --> 54:54.060\nYeah.\n\n54:54.060 --> 54:55.060\nSo I, what I thought was a gross exaggeration.\n\n54:55.060 --> 54:56.060\nThey were like, yeah.\n\n54:56.060 --> 54:57.060\nNo, but it depends.\n\n54:57.060 --> 55:04.020\nLike if, if you're like, if that's a really small slide, then it's like, if it's a one\n\n55:04.020 --> 55:07.460\ncell height, then I'm coming fucking highways.\n\n55:07.460 --> 55:12.260\nThat's what I mean, it's all, it's not really relative to like where you're coming in that\n\n55:12.260 --> 55:13.260\nsituation.\n\n55:13.260 --> 55:15.460\nI mean, just put it in washcloth terms.\n\n55:15.460 --> 55:16.460\nYeah.\n\n55:16.460 --> 55:18.260\nLike how many socks do you need to wipe up?\n\n55:18.260 --> 55:19.260\nIt's a fucking dribble.\n\n55:19.260 --> 55:22.020\nHow many, how many tube socks do you use to wipe up?\n\n55:22.020 --> 55:23.020\nRight.\n\n55:23.020 --> 55:26.060\nNobody needs more than one tube sock.\n\n55:26.060 --> 55:27.060\nSometimes I'll recycle.\n\n55:27.060 --> 55:28.060\nI'll use the same sock toys.\n\n55:28.060 --> 55:40.060\nThen you look down and you're like, nothing happened.\n\n55:40.060 --> 55:41.060\nOh yeah.\n\n55:41.060 --> 55:45.620\nI think a fucking hitting home runs and then I look down and it's like a foul ball.\n\n55:45.620 --> 55:48.820\nWhat's funny is that, sorry about the baseball.\n\n55:48.820 --> 55:49.820\nYeah.\n\n55:49.820 --> 55:50.820\nNo, it's okay.\n\n55:50.820 --> 55:55.220\nBut, but it's funny that we would think that that would really, I wonder, I kind of wonder\n\n55:55.220 --> 56:01.940\nin the back of women's minds like in their most like, I know obviously like, I know the\n\n56:01.940 --> 56:05.140\nbusiness casual part of their forebrain, they'd be required to say, of course we don't give\n\n56:05.140 --> 56:09.860\na shit about that, but, but, but somewhere in the back of their head, some, somebody,\n\n56:09.860 --> 56:13.900\nyou know, there's, I don't know, they want like a monster shooter though.\n\n56:13.900 --> 56:14.900\nWhy not?\n\n56:14.900 --> 56:16.400\nYou know, why not?\n\n56:16.400 --> 56:18.700\nWe have a girl shaking her head vehemently in the front row here.\n\n56:18.700 --> 56:20.700\nI think there's probably more back there.\n\n56:20.700 --> 56:21.700\nShe's an ambassador.\n\n56:21.700 --> 56:23.460\nShe's like, we don't know what her deal is.\n\n56:23.460 --> 56:27.340\nIt's like saying, like, oh, it'd be great if this guy like blew his nose way harder\n\n56:27.340 --> 56:28.340\nthan normal.\n\n56:28.340 --> 56:29.340\nThis is all this snot.\n\n56:29.340 --> 56:32.980\nWell, I don't, it's a healthy amount of snot.\n\n56:32.980 --> 56:33.980\nYeah.\n\n56:33.980 --> 56:36.300\nThat's, that's in a world where we're all Vulcans.\n\n56:36.300 --> 56:37.300\nYes.\n\n56:37.300 --> 56:39.540\nThat's exactly how everyone would meet mop move.\n\n56:39.540 --> 56:47.140\nBut here's the thing, a fucking, like some people are like, yeah, because it's fucking\n\n56:47.140 --> 56:51.940\ngooey and gross and give it to me more like fucking, sorry, if we hadn't been taught that\n\n56:51.940 --> 56:55.620\nthat equal like virility from porno's, do you think that you would just naturally be\n\n56:55.620 --> 56:59.620\nlike, yeah, if I can feel more like a man, because I, well, I think that's where stuff\n\n56:59.620 --> 57:01.540\ncomes out and you'd be like, I did something.\n\n57:01.540 --> 57:02.540\nI made more stuff.\n\n57:02.540 --> 57:03.540\nYeah.\n\n57:03.540 --> 57:04.540\nYeah.\n\n57:04.540 --> 57:05.540\nYes.\n\n57:05.540 --> 57:07.980\nBecause I think that shit is so primitive that that is like actually like, that's the,\n\n57:07.980 --> 57:10.900\nthat's the original, like it goes all the way back.\n\n57:10.900 --> 57:13.740\nThat's all cavemen ever did was like, how much did you come?\n\n57:13.740 --> 57:18.420\nThey probably did it in Iraq and like looked at it and then they were like, all right, I'll\n\n57:18.420 --> 57:19.420\nbe president.\n\n57:19.420 --> 57:20.420\nCome contest.\n\n57:20.420 --> 57:25.220\nAnd I'm like, oh, he might have just eaten more broccoli that day.\n\n57:25.220 --> 57:26.900\nOh, oh, oh, it's a comocracy.\n\n57:26.900 --> 57:27.900\nJust stop.\n\n57:27.900 --> 57:32.260\nI just had you, I already told you the rules.\n\n57:32.260 --> 57:33.260\nYou know what?\n\n57:33.260 --> 57:34.260\nDon't watch that show.\n\n57:34.260 --> 57:36.760\nDon't watch Jedby.\n\n57:36.760 --> 57:37.760\nIt's all about wordplay.\n\n57:37.760 --> 57:41.260\nGhost jokes and puns.\n\n57:41.260 --> 57:44.380\nWell, deadbeat itself is a pun.\n\n57:44.380 --> 57:49.060\nIt's a play on words because he's a deadbeat and he's helping dads beat whatever problems\n\n57:49.060 --> 57:50.060\nthey have.\n\n57:50.060 --> 57:51.060\nIt is.\n\n57:51.060 --> 57:52.060\nIt is a pun.\n\n57:52.060 --> 57:53.060\nDeadbeat.\n\n57:53.060 --> 57:54.060\nIt is a pun.\n\n57:54.060 --> 57:55.060\nYeah, that's, that's it.\n\n57:55.060 --> 57:56.060\nThat's, you nailed it.\n\n57:56.060 --> 57:59.820\nWell, I draw, I draw a line between play on words and like puns, you know, and I guess\n\n57:59.820 --> 58:07.420\nI mean, very fine line it, you know, okay, you can watch it.\n\n58:07.420 --> 58:09.460\nThe episode I watched, there wasn't any puns.\n\n58:09.460 --> 58:13.860\nI think it's just something that Camille, you were talking about your movie.\n\n58:13.860 --> 58:21.860\nYeah, we, I guess we got a little sidetracked there, didn't we?\n\n58:21.860 --> 58:22.860\nYeah.\n\n58:22.860 --> 58:29.900\nHey, Rob, Rob, that was good controlling that man.\n\n58:29.900 --> 58:44.980\nI don't, for the listeners, I just put on my hat.\n\n58:44.980 --> 58:45.980\nI just put my hat on.\n\n58:45.980 --> 58:46.980\nOkay.\n\n58:46.980 --> 58:47.980\nYou put your hat on and I'll, I'll take it off.\n\n58:47.980 --> 58:48.980\nLocking eyes with me.\n\n58:48.980 --> 58:49.980\nI'll take it off.\n\n58:49.980 --> 58:50.980\nOkay.\n\n58:50.980 --> 58:51.980\nI won't look at you either.\n\n58:51.980 --> 58:53.620\nI won't put my vines on while you're eating your bread.\n\n58:53.620 --> 58:54.620\nI won't.\n\n58:54.620 --> 58:58.180\nJust turn it down.\n\n58:58.180 --> 59:02.380\nNo one was complaining, everybody was having a ball, we were all enjoying ourselves.\n\n59:02.380 --> 59:03.380\nSo that's the rule.\n\n59:03.380 --> 59:05.820\nIf no one complains, keep doing it.\n\n59:05.820 --> 59:08.660\nIf everybody is smiling.\n\n59:08.660 --> 59:09.660\nWas everybody smiling?\n\n59:09.660 --> 59:10.660\nYeah.\n\n59:10.660 --> 59:14.340\nExcept, okay, he's fucking delusional.\n\n59:14.340 --> 59:15.340\nEveryone's smiling.\n\n59:15.340 --> 59:19.020\nYou think the world is like pollinated by your fucking vines?\n\n59:19.020 --> 59:22.700\nRob, were you doing it to try to get Dan's attention to vibe?\n\n59:22.700 --> 59:23.700\nYes.\n\n59:23.700 --> 59:24.700\nYes.\n\n59:24.700 --> 59:25.700\nWell, you got it.\n\n59:25.700 --> 59:27.500\nHe just wants you to listen to him.\n\n59:27.500 --> 59:28.500\nHe just wants to be acknowledged.\n\n59:28.500 --> 59:29.500\nHe just wants your love, Dan.\n\n59:29.500 --> 59:31.500\nTurn your vines down.\n\n59:31.500 --> 59:37.340\nBut he just, he just wants you to acknowledge his vines.\n\n59:37.340 --> 59:39.700\nThat's not even you wanting an acknowledgement.\n\n59:39.700 --> 59:40.700\nHe just wants you to acknowledge his vines.\n\n59:40.700 --> 59:41.700\nTo cry for help.\n\n59:41.700 --> 59:44.220\nIt's like a, a six seconds at a time.\n\n59:44.220 --> 59:48.940\nIf there was, if there was somebody at an adjacent table playing their vines loud enough\n\n59:48.940 --> 59:50.140\nfor you to hear.\n\n59:50.140 --> 59:51.140\nI'd walk over.\n\n59:51.140 --> 59:54.700\nI'd be like, oh, do you see this one?\n\n59:54.700 --> 59:55.700\nOh yeah.\n\n59:55.700 --> 59:56.700\nYeah.\n\n59:56.700 --> 59:57.700\nYeah.\n\n59:57.700 --> 59:58.700\nYeah.\n\n59:58.700 --> 59:59.700\nRight.\n\n59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.700\nAnd we'd, we'd be happy.\n\n01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.700\nRight.\n\n01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.700\nHappy.\n\n01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.700\nWe just, happy.\n\n01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.700\nDan, Dan, I'm on your side.\n\n01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.740\nIf I'm out at a restaurant, people that leave their ringers on or talk into their phone\n\n01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:12.620\nlike a walkie-talkie or, or, or, or, or, or turn like, like, or watch a movie at the\n\n01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:13.620\nrestaurant.\n\n01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.620\nYeah.\n\n01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.140\nI want to murder in a Elizabethan fashion.\n\n01:00:17.140

Were you already shooting game of thrones or or is this the part?\n\n01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:50.860\nYeah, yeah, you already were okay. Yeah, can I ask a really mundane question that you must get asked all the time\n\n01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:57.180\nWhen you're doing the uh, the other languages like how does that work? Like you get schooled on like on all the uh\n\n01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:02.620\nIt's really boy. I feel like I'm this is a comedy show and I feel like I'm bringing it down\n\n01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:09.020\nThat was my question too. I want to know too. Um, what is it? What does that take all all those languages?\n\n01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.700\nThat kind of mind-blowing\n\n01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.660\nLike we get sent an mp3 and we just listen to it\n\n01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:18.380\nAnd just you kind of listen to it on repeat see somebody scratch vocals that you just you just kind of mimic\n\n01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:24.620\nBut basically, yeah, really, but then then you have to learn how to like act them act them. Yeah perform them. Yeah\n\n01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.780\nYeah, can I elaborate on the question? I've always wanted to know as an actor\n\n01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:31.340\nWhat is it like acting in a language that doesn't exist?\n\n01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:35.660\nLike do you just do you just sort of is it all about the emoting at that point?\n\n01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.660\nLike is it all about sort of just your body language?\n\n01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:40.940\nYou pick a triple you pick one syllable ago. That's the syllable that you\n\n01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:47.260\nYeah, like what do you land with your dialogue? You know the hardest one is talking to other people that are talking in a different language\n\n01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:53.180\nYou have to like you have to is like picking up cues, but picking up words that don't exist\n\n01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:57.500\nOh, so you have to like all right. I think you're done with your gobbledygook time for my gobbledygook\n\n01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.900\nYeah, basically\n\n01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:04.860\nI've seen you do that on the show sometimes you're like, oh, okay me\n\n01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:09.820\nI'm like they should edit that out\n\n01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:15.260\nWell, I I I have never seen that on game of thrones and that's a real testament to that\n\n01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:20.380\nI've never seen that moment of like, I don't know what you're saying to me. It's fucking unreal, man\n\n01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:23.900\nThat's why you guys always have to align earphones in your ears when you're speaking in\n\n01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:26.300\nWhat is the language of the unsullied?\n\n01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.700\nValyrian\n\n01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:31.260\nDo you ever do a take?\n\n01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.020\nIt's not a medication\n\n01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:42.140\nDo you do a take when you you're saying a line in uh that language and director goes, uh, jake, can we take it again?\n\n01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:45.180\nAnd and really hit the gobbledygook\n\n01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:55.900\nLike did they give you notes like like like line reads or just kind of I could be saying any old shit to be fair\n\n01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:04.540\nI think I think not to undermine the directors just some great directors, but um, but yeah, I think they're very often just like great\n\n01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:06.620\nHow much do you actually have to know your lines?\n\n01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:12.380\nYeah, and do you like improvise in the language and like hey, please stay on scrap with the fucking\n\n01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:17.580\nFuck in we spent a lot of time writing these syllables\n\n01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:23.420\nBecause you know that yeah, no there's guest directors coming through so they're on their ipad and their fantasy football leagues\n\n01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:28.540\nAnd they're like okay great and you're like yeah, I'm the one that has to be here next week. Yeah, exactly. Yeah\n\n01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:34.860\nIs it like a difficult show to shoot is it like really grueling it feels like it would be like long hours and\n\n01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:38.620\nIt uh, yeah, it's long hours, but it's it genuinely\n\n01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:43.100\nI really want to come on here and say some like talk some shit about it's like\n\n01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:47.660\nIt's it's it's the best do both was the best job in the world genuinely\n\n01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:54.060\nIt's it's really fun. Is there one like the different cast in different worlds different kingdoms and stuff\n\n01:37:54.940 --> 01:38:00.380\nWhat's the best one to be in and what what cast talks the most shit about it's definitely not the wall\n\n01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:06.540\nBecause they're like in fucking cold-ass horrible weather and then everybody else is like warm climbs\n\n01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:11.500\nWhat cast has the easiest and what cast has the hardest? Yeah, we have the easiest because we're always in the sun\n\n01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.580\nYeah\n\n01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:16.300\nYeah, but sometimes you get nipple cut off\n\n01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:19.260\nYeah, yeah, yeah, that's true\n\n01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.660\nThat's true.

Do you remember the scene when you were a tooth?\n\n01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:44.620\nI yeah, well, I I was a I was the second molar and I had a\n\n01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:54.140\nI was I I was small enough that all the kids costumes were grocery bags paper grocery bags\n\n01:39:55.100 --> 01:40:00.060\nSo that's how small we were that our heads went through the upside down grocery bag. We were wearing them as\n\n01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:04.780\nOh my god, that's it. That seems safe. That seems like a safe cost. I don't know. We were put your head in this plastic\n\n01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:10.860\nTyler it was a plastic bag. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but still there's a whole cut for the neck in the bottom of a\n\n01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:12.860\nSure\n\n01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:19.580\nAnd then a tooth painted on the front and then my line was you think you've got it bad incisor\n\n01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:23.660\nWe molars grind the food for early digestion\n\n01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:27.980\nAnd I fucking belted it out\n\n01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:33.660\nIs that genuinely the line from that's truly the line that's been in there for that long because my yeah\n\n01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:38.300\nMy family came and they were and I knew it and I was like, I'm gonna fucking steal this show\n\n01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.220\nOh\n\n01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:44.620\nSecond molar and I was like my definition of acting was like I'm gonna hit the back of the room\n\n01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:48.060\nDan what were the reviews like what how did it go?\n\n01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:51.340\nThere was a there was a whole mouth full of teeth\n\n01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:57.900\nRight, right. Okay, gotcha mythologically. What character do you think that would be in the game of thrones universe?\n\n01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:00.620\nHey, jay, uh little finger\n\n01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:07.020\nI don't know. There's no funny answer to that. No, I think you're right\n\n01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:09.020\nI think you got it right\n\n01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:13.820\nBut I've got no I am glad to hear you're wearing it\n\n01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:17.180\nBut I'm surprised to hear that you're glad that they're adding layers\n\n01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:23.820\nBut but you're saying you're you're constantly under the beating sun. So adding clothes is good\n\n01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.300\nI this is something I don't understand about you\n\n01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:31.580\nBut are you saying you get to take off the the the skin tight thing and throw a jacket over your skin now?\n\n01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:35.420\nIs it we're saying instead of wearing both? Yeah, yeah, it's just it's just one layer\n\n01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:39.500\nBut also, I think I mean, I don't want to say anything too bad\n\n01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:43.820\nI don't I don't want to shit on anyone, but it's very funky\n\n01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:45.660\nIt's a very\n\n01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:50.700\nIt's a very it's a very uh, it's got a kind of disco vibe to it. Oh, I think I mean it smelled bad\n\n01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.340\nYeah, like you\n\n01:41:55.340 --> 01:42:03.420\nMean like parliament funky like all right, but you're into it. You're like we're looking forward to this gray worm is gonna come out\n\n01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:06.540\nAnd that's gonna be all right. There's gonna be a baseline\n\n01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:26.220\nI think we're doing ourselves a great disservice if we don't eventually end this show with a gray worm wrap the sequence\n\n01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:36.380\nDo you branch into that world you say what what is your what is your uh, no, I'm more of it like a singer\n\n01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.540\nYeah, but I get because I'm brown\n\n01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.500\nBut you I get asked I get asked if I'm a rapper every day\n\n01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:47.020\nOh, you can the routine shirt kind of I thought I made some assumptions.
