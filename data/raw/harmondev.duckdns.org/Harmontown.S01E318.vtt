WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
From beautiful downtown Los Angeles,

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
from MacArthur Park, Hepatitis District,

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
the Tennessee typewriter, Harmontown, is once again in session.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
For your delectation and delight, let's bring out the Game Master

00:22.000 --> 00:32.000
and our good friend, Spencer Crittenden.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Be heathen from heaven, be heathen from hell,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
the damn Elizabeth Pempernel.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Let's welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yep, yep.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
MLK, MLK day.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Don't go away, it's a great day.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Honoring a man that's made lots of hay

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
while the sun's shown, even though it didn't.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Okay.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
We got a lot.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I mean, I got a lot of balls opening with some rap.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Rest in peace.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't know if you can see there's a little sound board

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
and a laptop behind me,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
but we're probably going to be doing some,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
a fair share of hip and hoppin' tonight.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
There's going to be a lot of show tonight.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
It's MLK day.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, Steve Levy's coming, bearing gifts.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh, yeah.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
He's got the alcohol ice bucket.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
We honor a man today

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
whose Wikipedia page is probably crippled

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
for 24 hours.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I know I was all over it in the green room

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
so that I could learn the following.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Really, interesting stuff.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
I mean, some tidbits that I didn't know.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
He invented the typewriter.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
He had suffered from depression when he was a kid.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
There's stories about, you know, that having causes.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Obviously, that wasn't a big, you know,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
mental fitness wasn't like a,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
it wasn't like an understood thing back then.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I do think it was by the FBI.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
It's fucking crazy if you knew,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
it's never a good idea for a government

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
to write a letter to a guy saying,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
we have recordings of you fucking all these women.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
You should save your, you know,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
that letter that the FBI wrote to him in his adulthood

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
at the peak of him being targeted by Hoover.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
What I didn't know and what Hoover surely knew

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
when that letter was sent to him

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
is that he tried to jump out a window

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
when he was 12 years old.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
He did jump out a window.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
He didn't try.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
He tried to kill himself.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
And, you know, his dad was real hard on him physically.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
But his dad was, you know, kind of an inspiration to him

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
in terms of like his dad's personality

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
being very uncompromising.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
It's a funny thing because here's his dad is like,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
kind of not afraid to take a stick to somebody,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
but at the same time,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
probably part and parcel of that persona

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
is also why his dad would do these things like,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
you know, if somebody called him boy,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
he would, you know, he wouldn't lay down for it.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
He would confront people or he'd walk out of a store

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
that asked him to go in the back and things like that.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
So he's watching these two things, you know,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
from this mythical father.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
That's like both the punisher and the,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I mean, it's like the devil and God,

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
kind of at the same time.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
That's kind of interesting.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Somebody should make a biopic about this guy.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
What other tidbits did I learn?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I didn't know that he was born,

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
but his dad changed the names to Martin.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
I think for him and his son,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
after he went in the 30s to Germany,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
and he was so inspired by the story of Martin Luther,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
they actually had birth certificates changed.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
Their name was King, I don't know if it was,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
but Martin Luther King Jr. was born Michael

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
and then birth certificate was changed later to Martin,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I believe.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Wikipedia.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
Wikipedia facts about a guy.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
But imagine, I was realizing,

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
this guy watched JFK get assassinated, right?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And there's lots of quotes.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
If you go through the MLK quotes for your Instagram,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
you can see all the, you scroll down,

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
you see a fair share of real Christ-like,

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
going to the spiritual mattress in terms of,

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
unless you're willing to die for something,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
it doesn't matter kind of stuff.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
More than one quote about that,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
you have to know that this guy,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
more than anybody ever,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
he kind of had to make peace with that idea

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
and probably going to get,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm very likely to get assassinated.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
The president of the United States died,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
he watched it happen during this turbulent time,

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
and it's like, okay, so what am I going to hide behind?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Just imagine that, I can't even,

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
did who died first, RFK or MLK?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
No, RFK is on second.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm wondering if he also watched Bobby Kennedy get shot.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh yeah, I don't know what ordered Bobby and...

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Honestly, once the president is just in a motorcade,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
it's just like kaboom, and then you're like,

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
you're a civil rights activist,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
the FBI is trying to make you kill yourself.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I mean, you have to be just like,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
there must be almost maybe the only good news of that

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
is that maybe you get to wake up in the morning

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
so get over that or don't.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
If I leave the house today,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
it's because I got a mission,

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
because if my objective is safety,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
then I guess I should shut the fuck up

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
and hide under a rock,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
and they'll probably still find me.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
This reminds me very much of Gethsemane

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
and that U2 song.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
All right, so anyways, there's a...

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Nothing should remind anybody of any U2 song.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I fucking hate U2.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Why is there U2 on my...

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I didn't download it, it's on my fucking...

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Oh yeah.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I don't know how to get rid of it.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
It's on there like a Sharpie written on your hand.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
You have to wash it for the rest of your life.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
That was like 15 years ago.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I know.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I just turned my music on in my car,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
and I got...

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I'm like, what the fuck did I do to U2?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
All right, the latest...

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
No, I'm not done, Dan.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Oh, sorry.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
How do you hijack my iPad?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Somebody's air-dropping...

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh, no.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It's a meme that says,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
two Jews, one brain.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Oh, no.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
What does that mean?

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Maybe the Jews aren't as smart as the whole person?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Or is it a reference to...

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Was there air-dropping you?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You know...

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Was that person here?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Let's bring them up.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Why?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
If you're here, I'm joking.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Oh, it's like...

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Well, now I just promoted them,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
but also it might be worth noting that

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
it's a comedy podcast.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Oh.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
It's a comedy podcast, two Jews, one brain.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
So now...

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
We assume that the titular Jews are probably

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
okay saying

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
two Jews, one brain, if they're...

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
We're...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I don't know.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm not willing to get that comfortable yet.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I'm still on edge.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I saw a hand globe so they're here,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
but I'm not sure I'd want to fucking...

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah, I don't think that's how you should get

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
your podcast signal boosted.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
You don't just get to be...

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I think you should be targeted by the FBI

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
for a while or something.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I don't mind if it's a good podcast,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
but I don't want...

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
There are people who are sitting in their seats going,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
like, oh, what do I got to do?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I feel like...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
A dollar, right?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
A dollar, you know?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Like, what is this world where

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
the squeaky wheel gets the grease?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know nice people.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I don't know what to tell you.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I'm sorry.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
So there's a podcast...

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I'm not going to promote this shit.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
That's good. I believe...

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I mean, the joke's on them.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
They're never going to make any money in podcasting.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
It might actually be their punishment

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
if we direct a little bit of traffic to them

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
enough to keep them from getting real jobs.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
And let's just remind everybody,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
it's called Three Jews, Four Brains.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So go to ThreeJewsFourBrains.com

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Hashtag

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
ThreeJewsFourBrains.com

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I will signal boost a couple of things.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
There's just Netflix things.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
This is our next segment that we'll bring on our guests.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
This is...

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Dan Harmon's life now

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
is sitting in bed watching Netflix.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
All right. Well, you got to watch

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
the Bravo Dirty John adaptation.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Even if you heard the podcast, it's crazy.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
The Bravo Dirty John thing.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Oh, man.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Did you check it out? You watched it?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah. How long is it?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
What's the episode? What happens?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You need to kill it in like eight hours or something.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, the podcast was nuts.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah, I mean, you could go from the podcast

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
to the... It's not, like,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
unenjoyable to watch the adaptation.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
It's somewhat more enjoyable because the thing is,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
having listened to the podcast, then you know

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
that the young ladies...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
All the actors are killing it,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
the daughters, you know from listening to their interviews

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
in the podcast that they're not doing caricatures.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Right.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's a really interesting thing.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
These daughters...

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I won't spoil the story

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
of Dirty John,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
but these daughters are just like so...

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
If you wrote characters

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
like this in your sitcom or your movie,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
they would be so...

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You would, by default, you'd be like,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
oh, and they're bad people just because

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
of the trappings of them.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
These kind of like...

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
They judge their mom's relationships

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
and police them in all these things

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
because the mom's been divorced four times

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
and they're just sort of like...

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
They're just like, hey, I got you a chai tea latte.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Oh, my God, was he here again?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And it's just sort of like they're fully committed

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
to these characters, but they're great actors

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
playing these characters. Plus, those daughters,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
you know,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
emerge as heroes, which is all I can really say

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
about the story without spoiling it,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
but it's just interesting as a writer exercise

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
when you're like,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
yeah, there's characters

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
with depth that you're supposed to like

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
and then there's characters that are like

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
so fun because they're two-dimensional,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
but only in a real-life adaptation

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
of something as a writer forced to take

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
people that actually sound

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
to seem two-dimensional

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
and walk them through this

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
story where they're

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
heroes.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It's a

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
stranger-than-fiction kind of thing.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
You just watch it.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
You're going to like it.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Watch it for 30 seconds and you'll watch it for 40.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I mean, that's the Harmon guarantee on Dirty John.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Likewise, the documentary

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Three Identical Strangers. Check that out.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I think everybody's talking about that.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
The abducted and plain sight.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Whew, doggie.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Boy, at what price, Mormonism?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Check that one out.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Just, I don't even know...

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
That's what I've been saying.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I have a manifesto

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
on blogspot.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I listened to the Elizabeth Smart

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
book on tape

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
and it's this weird double-edged sword

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
because the only way

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
she survived that ordeal was

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
through her faith.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
She's such a resilient person

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
and I genuinely admire

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
whenever I see,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
whenever in real life you hear stories about

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
that involve Mormonism, it's like

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
you come up against this, you're like

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
geez, you guys really

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
believe in God.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
That's crazy how much you believe in God.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And it really gets them through

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
shit and it makes them

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
friendly and forgiving.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
The forgiveness.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
The weaponized forgiveness.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It's crazy.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
They're able to forgive

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
the fuck out of things.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It's truly inspirational

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
to anybody who's like a mainstream

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
just run-of-the-mill

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
podunk fucking

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
blue pill Christian.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
You gotta take that.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
What color pill would be Mormonism?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
You gotta take that

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
daffodil pill.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Anyways, but watch this.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
So this documentary,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
The Abducted in Plain Sight,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
it's another tale of

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
child

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
exploitation and abduction and stuff like that,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
but it is like only

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
within a Mormon community

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
does it seem as stuff as possible.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
It's just crazy. Watch it and then we'll talk about it.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I'll give you a week.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
But I did, while we were watching it,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Cody and I were talking about,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
here's like a little Mormon thing.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Should there be theme music for this?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
When the Mormons, when they go

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
to their Mormon college

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
and stuff and they're like regular

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
morning teenagers, but they're Mormon,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
they have developed these,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
any religion, if you're committing to it

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
and you're a teenager, there's gonna be these

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
things that are gonna develop. This is not

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
about judging anybody for their

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
faith, or

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
saying like, oh, those people are crazy.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Anybody, any place where there's,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
if you gotta believe in God and you're

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
living in America, some shit's

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
gonna be nuts as a byproduct.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
So this is not about

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
punching down, he proclaimed.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
But it's just

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
weird.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
So there's this thing called soaking.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
So we've

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
heard with Catholic kids, if you're

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
really Catholic,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
you hear these stories where like,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
oh, well I'm still a virgin if we do it in the butt,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
that kind of thing. So now that I've said

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
that, and I'm not judging like

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Mormons, but there's this thing called soaking

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
where they're like, the kids get themselves

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
convinced

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
that, well, if you just put it in

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
and you don't move it,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
then you're not, that's not

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
sex. Everybody knows

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
sex is like back and forth.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
So if you just marinate it,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
you're not, God doesn't

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
see that, he doesn't hear that cricket

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
leg.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's like in a quiet place

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
if you don't move the dick.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I used to be Mormon and

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
when I was a kid, I was

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Of course. He was soaking

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
all the time. I was soaking

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
to the east. I was soaking to the west.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I was soaking with

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
the Mormon that I loved the best.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
But this is the thing, that's the thing I believe.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
This is the part where I actually,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Cody and I were like, that can't be real

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
and then we looked it up and who knows

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
if you look something up whether it's real or not.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
But along with

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
soaking comes the concept of

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
jumpers.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
These are friends whose

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
aid you solicit. If the soaking

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
as I imagine it would

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
starts to become

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
unsatisfying

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
and you can

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
have your friends

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
come over

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and they

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
stand on the mattress and kind of

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
jump.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
So now you're

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
soaking. This is just

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
soaking turbulence.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
This is science. That's all it is.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
And the worst thing

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
that can happen is that you can become

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Supreme Court Justice.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Hashtag Kavanaugh.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I mean, don't all paths

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
lead to Rome. Can't you at that point

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
if you're soaking and jumping

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
and you're still getting into

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
heaven, can't you just go all the

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
way with it and call the

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
sperm that comes out

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
in the event of an over

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
jump soak?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Just say that that sperm doesn't

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
count because the tadpoles

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
are Lutheran or something.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
And just have the baby

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
and raise it

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
and say, well, you are conceived

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
as a jumper baby.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
So you can do whatever

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
you want.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
But you should know we love you because we're Mormon.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You can have caffeine.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
You can have caffeine. You can watch

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Reagan and Andy's Christmas Special

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
show.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I don't know if Mormons had to

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
is that like Jehovah's Witnesses?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Jehovah's Witnesses always had to leave

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
the room when we were in grade school.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
When we would sing Christmas carols

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
and watch Christmas

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
shows, like when we were kids and Christmas

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
would come around and then the Jehovah's Witnesses would have to

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
go out in the hallway.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
They would have to or they chose to?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Well, it's not like the teacher

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
was like, here's our Christ

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Frosty

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
meets Christ

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
special.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Hey, Carl, get the...

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
No, I mean they'd raise

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
their hand and

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
maybe if the teacher was new they'd explain

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
but over the years it was like, yeah,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
okay, yeah, get out of here.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Spoil sport. Go run the halls.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Yeah. Hey,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
we're going to force people to watch stupid shit.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Go do what you want.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Jehovah's Witnesses is also incredible.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
My memory of all of those kids, like

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
five of them in my public school,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
incredibly friendly,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
just non-judgmental,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
yeah, it's weird, this double

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
edge sword of when these religions

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
that kind of, yeah, they got a bit of a Steve

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Jobs approach as far as accessibility

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
to their children's souls.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Like, you know, it's like, no,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
we don't want any of your viruses

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
ideologically or anything, so

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
we'll just be behind these walls

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and we'll

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
kind of curate the

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
American experience for these folks.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
We're not going to take part in your general

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
pastiche.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
It produces, you know,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
it's like you get your good results

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
and you get your swarm

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
of 19-year-olds

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
who are like on the internet going

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
let's compare notes about being a Jehovah's Witness

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
and it starts to get pretty,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
that religions got PR problems.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Have I told you, Dan, like on the show

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
before about my friend, my Mormon friend

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
from high school, like the nicest family

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
they throw these great parties and like

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
one of the wealthiest families at our school

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
and they would throw these giant parties

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
and my friend Roy was like the coolest dude

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
and got along with everybody and

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
that family made such a case

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
for being Mormon because they were so

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
awesome, they were just like the most generous

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
lovely people. Have I told you the story about

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
the church sign?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
There's little billboards that put out

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
little things that say like, hey, this Sunday

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
you know, like Jesus loves you

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
like little like placards

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
out in front of the thing.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Roy was the nicest, straight

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
A student, the most meek and mild, lovely

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
dude. He called

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
like me, I think Matt Gorely, a few other

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
people and said

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
get up and drive around town

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
and look at these five churches

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
and they had all put up

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
this, I don't, I forget which

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
denomination it is, but they'd all

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
put up this thing that says God cares

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
and

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
lovely, meek, never heard

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
it fly, like straight A student

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Roy went out and changed

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
all of them to dog races.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
He just couldn't resist.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
He

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
worships a higher power called

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
word play.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But for three hours you

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
could drive around the wood here in California

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and it was just dog races.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
When he dies, he goes to heaven

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
and

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Gabriel just

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
stone faced points over to this

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
dog track where he has to spend eternity.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
It's like, you're not going to hell, but you have to

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
like, I hope you

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
have allergies.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Why are all these

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
these are all the dogs

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
these races are going to go on forever.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Yeah, you have to race every single

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
one of them. By the way

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
they age seven times faster than a person.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
So you're

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
never getting in.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
You're not getting into heaven. I've got to

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
restart this. I'm workshopping.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You're not getting into heaven until you've

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
raced every dog.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
He has to race the dogs himself.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Each dog needs to be individually

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
raced.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
But him versus the dog or other dogs racing

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
each other. They all have to be raced versus

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
another dog. I think it's better

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
if he has to race every dog.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Because all dogs

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
go to heaven and he has to race

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
every one of them.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It's like Tantalus or Sisyphus

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
or something. What about Kujo? Do you think he went to heaven?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
He was terrifying.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
It wasn't his fault?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
It wasn't Kujo's fault. Well,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
is it Jeffrey Dahmer's fault? What are we

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
saying?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Yes, it was Jeffrey Dahmer's fault.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
What's the difference between Kujo and Dahmer?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Kujo didn't put people in refrigerators and fuck them.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Obviously, people don't do that unless they're

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
fucked up. Kujo is a fucked up dog.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Dahmer's a fucked up guy.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Like, what are we... I don't understand.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
All dogs go to heaven.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Kujo is up in heaven going,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
look, everybody, I'm sorry. I had a bad run.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Kujo killed people.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Probably a mailman,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I assume. I've never seen the movie, but

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I assume the first to go

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
is a mailman. He killed 14

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Frisbees.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
God knows how many tennis balls. If you

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
are a Christian mailman

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
killed by Kujo, you go

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
to heaven and you're like,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
and they're checking the book and they're like, the mailman's

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
here. Looks like you steamed

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
open a couple of

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Clearinghouse sweepstakes

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
things. Yeah, I'm sorry.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I just wanted to see what they looked like

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
on the inside because my wife won't let me open them.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
It's not like I thought I was going to

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
steal somebody's winnings.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
You know, you can't lie up here. We can read your mind.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I accept that. Thank you.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And they're like

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
murmuring and he's like, fuck, god dammit.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I'm so fucked. And then you just hear like

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
woof, woof, woof, woof.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And you look through the pearly gates

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
and fucking Kujo's running around

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
fetching

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
a ball for Tom Hanks's

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
dad. I was just

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
trying to think of someone who's

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
guaranteed heaven. Wouldn't you ask that mailman to go,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
oh, wow, if Kujo's in here

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
then I'm good to go. No, you're in line

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
getting your balls busted by the velvet

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
roper and

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
and it is like Kujo's

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
and you're like, is that Kujo?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And they're like, yeah, and they're like,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
and you're pointing at the gaping

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
fucking bite wound on your neck.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Right. And Gabriel's

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
like, uh,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
you look, he, all dogs go to heaven.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I'm sure Kujo.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Is there a comment box?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I'm sure Kujo, when he went up to the pearly gates

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
he got his balls busted too

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and they're like, who's a bad boy?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Who's been a bad boy?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And then Kujo's going to be like,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
fuck you, I'll pee on you because all

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
dogs go to heaven. I already heard.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Like, like, you need

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
you need, you need, you need

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
like, that's what I'm saying.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
You either, it's pick a lane, heaven.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
If I go to heaven and I see

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
a happy Kujo who's been like, who's

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
atoned for his Kujo

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
sense, I'd be, oh, this is

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
this is a good heaven. I don't think all dogs go to heaven.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I think they picked that as a title for a movie

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
that they wanted to trick you into watching.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I don't think that's an official biblical

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
stance. I think

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
dogs cannot accept Christ as their savior.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
If it's

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
hard, hard for a rich man

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
to get into heaven through the eye

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
of a needle or whatever it is, like,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
what is it, a camel, a camel

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
can't get through a needle

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
but a camel

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
can get through the eye of a needle faster

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
than a rich man can get into heaven. Well,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
so that poor camel

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
like, well, the camel

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
was the camel going to heaven? No, the camel's

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
going through a needle.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
So the camel doesn't get into heaven at all.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
They just put through a needle. No, that's not on the table for the camel.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Camels go to heaven, but they're just using

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
camels as a metaphor. Right. Camels don't

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
sin, as we all know. What about camels that

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
refuse to go through the needle?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I think when the Bible was written, that was the biggest animal

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
they could think of. They didn't

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
know about elephants. Oh, yeah. Well, it was

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
the humpiest animal. Like, they probably saw

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
elephants, but they're like,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
well, they're like, let's be clever

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
about this, because a camel is

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
so humpy that

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
even if you made it a big needle, it would still

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
be like...

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It'd still be an arduous process

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
to get it through. It'd be like putting

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
a key on a key chain.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
That's what they just didn't have key chains.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
They're like, it's harder

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
for a rich man to get into heaven than it is to put

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
a key in a new key chain. Yeah, it's harder

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
for a rich man to get into heaven... If you don't have

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
fingernails. Than to put

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
your USB into any USB

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
port. Yeah, you have a better

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
chance of getting into heaven as a rich man than

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
you do of guessing right than when you plug in a USB

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
port.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
This is the King

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Harmon edition of the Bible.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
All right, well

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
let's discuss it all

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
with our old friend, open

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Mike Eagle.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
What's up, Mike?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Hey, how's it going?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I think

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
all dogs go to dog heaven.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh, it's like a shitty heaven.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Well, if you're a dog, it's the best

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
heaven, because it's just

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
dogs. Well, because they don't have anything to compare to.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
True.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Do you think

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
they achieve

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
heaven fatigue seven times

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
faster?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I never heard of heaven fatigue before.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I guess that's something

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
most of us assume. It's like an eternity of

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
anything. How many millennia

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
does it take for you to be like,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
oh, I wish I could die.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Maybe there's a reset button.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Oh, and you can just forget who you are.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
You can forget, yes. You can have

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
it over again anytime you want it.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
That starts to remove all meaning from any of it.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Right?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Because I bet you would do that.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
You would like achieve, I guess

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
it gets very eastern, because it's basically

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
like you achieve

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
this kind of ultimate perfection.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
You need to go, well, then let me experience

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
and you'd go back down and be like a termite or something.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
No, don't go back. No, I just mean start heaven over.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Right.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Not start life over, because that would be terrible.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I want to talk about dog heaven.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Being a game, yeah.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
But it's just heaven again.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Heaven plus, yeah.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I wouldn't mind getting reincarnated on earth

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
if you could prestige all the time.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I don't like this idea, you know, like

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
prestigeing in video games.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Send me back, but give me a rocket launcher

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
for the whole thing.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Life New Game Plus.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
You're born with a rocket launcher, so

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
they're weighing you and you're like, fuck you.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
You keep all your experience points from your last life.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah, you can now just like water ski

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
while you're learning.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
This baby's great at water skiing.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Why? Don't ask questions.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
It has a rocket launcher, yeah.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Why does your baby have a rocket launcher?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I do think we'll experience life

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
where babies can have skills.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
It's going to be scary, but I think

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
with genetic engineering,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
that's something we're going to have to contend with.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Whoa.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Skill babies.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
That's crazy. I buy it.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Holy shit.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
But they're going to be like, it's going to be

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
like the army reserves where the

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
parents will have a right.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
They'll go like, getting pregnant

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
will cost so much money.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
They'll come to you and go like, so you want to

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
procreate. You want to breathe some of this fucking air,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
which by the way, on the Dow Jones

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
is now like more than diamonds.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Sure.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I don't think diamonds are on the Dow Jones, but

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
they're like, so you're going to bring

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
a fucking rando

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
into this planet where we're like fighting

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
over molecules.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
What's in it for

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
society? And you're going to be like, well,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I, you know, Julie is

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
very good at painting and I created

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
community.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
What happened

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
to Cody? Who's this Julie?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
That was

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
a weird, weird

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
juggle of real life and then

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
you made it you.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
That's honest though.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And then

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
that was Duncan Trussell and I were talking about that

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
where it'll be like, if you, you can like

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
basically sell the first

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
20 years of your unborn

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
kid's life to various corporations.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Sort of like a fusion of the

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Israeli army and like

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
internships and like

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
like so that the kid, they go like, we're

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
going to give your kid

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
extra

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
charisma if they work

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
for Apple for two years.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
When they from 15 to 17

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
and then the army goes like

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
we'll make them jump high if he

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
does it with a gun

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
on his head

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
for two more years than that.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I think the thing with the baby skills come way

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
before that.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Baby skills, we're just going to hope.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Is there a list of baby skills or are the baby skills

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
like, are they assigned at birth or

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
just random? You don't, do you get to pick?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I think you get to pick. I think that's the whole sales

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
you get to pick what skills your baby has.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Wouldn't every couple pick

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
like flights or invisibility?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Well, I don't think they're

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
supernatural skills. I think

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
there's skills you could already have

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
as an adult, but your baby

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
could have. My baby speaks

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
four languages. There you go.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
That's the kind of baby skills that I can really see

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
happening in the marketplace.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
But that's dystopic, right?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
As soon as we open up that jar,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
we're in trouble, right? True. The jars

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
kind of open though. They make goats like every day.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
They make like new goats in a lab

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
every day. They're doing that already.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
They finally did some human cloning

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
in China, I think recently, which is

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
a benchmark I've always been watching because

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I always wanted to be the first person to do

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
a human clone. Like, I'm not a scientist

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
or anything. I just wanted to.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Like, accidentally? Well, no, on purpose.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I always wanted to clone myself and just be like,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
hey, I did it guys. I'm the clone guy.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I'm the guy who cloned humans successfully.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Ha, ha, you know, like

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
an instant clone or would you just be like

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
60 and there would be like a 30 year old Spencer

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
probably that coming out of a Petri dish.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
No, I'd give it a couple of years

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
and be like, check out this baby. That's

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
me. I bet you're wondering

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
how I got here.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And your baby's going to have the

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
unreliable narrator skill.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
That would be nice.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I don't, I don't want to, I don't want

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
to, I don't want to pick baby

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
baby skills. I don't want either, but

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
somebody will.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
It's going to happen no matter what. It's inevitable.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I'm kind of, I'm distracted by the thing

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
that you, you brought up though, like this idea

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
of like being in heaven and then there's this

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
button and you go, this

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
idea of like getting to a point where

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
you're like, I've done it all for real.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Like there's nothing I can experience anymore.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
And then there's this button that says

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
started over.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Let me, let me be, let me be honest here. This was

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
inspired. I just

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
started watching The Good Place and I just got through the first

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
season. So like that kind of happened in there

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
a little bit. That kind of, and, and you know,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
so. But it's interesting because it's like a

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
sci-fi or even a sitcommy

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
like way into like thinking about like, oh,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
well, what if the God that, that made

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
the universe is just like kind of, yeah,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
it's like, I mean, what's the difference, right?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
It's like you just, you're just doing this, this weird

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
thing where you're like, well, it's not going to be fun if I remember

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
anything. And then you're like,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
well, you're going to learn everything, right?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Because it's heaven and it'll be great.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Like you, if you're going to get fatigued, heaven fatigue,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
you taught me that.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
So yeah, that's the cure to heaven fatigue

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
is you push the reset button.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Yeah. You're not tired anymore because

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
you forgot you were tired. But in dog heaven,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
you're saying that dogs, it's just

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
dogs, right? It's just dogs. They don't have

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
any buttons. But who's going to throw the ball

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
or, you know, do the thing?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
The ball gets thrown. The ball just, they

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
don't care who throws the dog. It could be

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
another giant dog throwing the ball.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
They don't care. God throws the ball.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
They don't, they don't like us.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
We think they do. They don't like us.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
They think we're dogs. Yeah, they think

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
we're, they think we're like bears, I think.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I think dogs think we're bears.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I think we're bears. I think

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
dogs think that we're bears that think

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
they're bears. Right. And they think

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
they're the lucky dog who the bears think

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
they're a bear too. Yeah. But they all,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
that's why dogs all get along, essentially.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Like some of them are like, fuck you,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
but I think they're like, like, like,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
don't tell them we're dogs! Right. That's it.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
You're letting on! Yeah.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
But most of them, like, when they're sniffing each other's

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
butts, that's them going like, do they think

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
you're a bear? Yeah, of course they do. Otherwise, they'd be

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
feeding us. And they're like, this is what bears do, right?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
They sniff each other's butts, and it's just a show.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Because that's the thing in the wild that

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
looks the most like, in a

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
dog's, you know, it's like, they were

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
big hairy, or like weird things

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
that grow, like

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
walk around on hind legs, and like,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
if you fuck with our babies, we'll

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
kill you. Right.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
And we're like always like, gobbling

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
salmon out of a stream. Yeah, if bears

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
started, if bears started feeding

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
dogs first, we wouldn't even have dogs.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
We wouldn't have dogs. Wait, wait.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Yeah.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
If we, if we,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I missed the top of that.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
If we weren't around, bears would

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
have dogs? No, if bears started feeding

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
dogs first, let's say, bears

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
started sharing your salmon with a dog.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
We wouldn't even have dogs. Let's say

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
you're walking your dog who thinks you're a bear

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
that didn't

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
eat you because they thought

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
you thought it was a bear too.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Let's say you're walking through Yosemite National

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Park and a bear goes by

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
and like, with your dog.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
You're with your dog in Yosemite and a bear comes by.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Yeah, and the dog would be like

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
hey, like fucking, let's, let's hang out

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
with that guy. Well, that's why in bear attacks

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
you never, the dog never

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
protects the person. They're like

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
shit, bear war.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
There's only one loser

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
here. I'm headed for them.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
I'm grabbing the marshmallows

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
and I'm out of here.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
This is where my four legs come

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
in handy. I could leg it out of here.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I just became an outdoors dog.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Commence

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
world's longest walk.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Right.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Okay, another scenario. You're walking your dog.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Dan, you're out in Yosemite National Park

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
and you're walking Harvey around.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
You're golden doodle and

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
you see a wolf. Yeah.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
And what is

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I don't know. I mean, you're poking holes at my theory.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
What about coyotes?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I mean, what are they

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
saying? We got coyotes right behind

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
my back wall right now. They're just

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
like right there. I still haven't seen

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
one. My dog sitter saw one

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
when we were out of town.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
They cross my street all the time in a pack

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
and they come down two different streets

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
because they're surrounding

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
They're like the sharks and the jets. They're going to have

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
a rumble. Yeah.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
You're never alone. You're never disconnected.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
But it's so cramped.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
In my neighborhood, some of the coyotes

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
are Puerto Ricans

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
and some are just

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
some coyotes are Puerto Ricans.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I guess that's true.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Like genetically and

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
geographically. I'm doing one

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
story joke. Oh, I see.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Sondheim, remember?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
But they hunt

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
and patch and they all come down this

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
one street

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
down from the convent that I think Katy Perry bought

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
and

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
they come down this one road

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
and then they all split up

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
and they all just fan out

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
like the blue angels.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
And then 10 minutes later

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
you hear the sound of an animal dying

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
and then you hear a bunch of people

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
screaming and then I open my window

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and look out and you see people

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
just throwing shit at these coyotes

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
who were running off with their animal.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
You can track it like this

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
every time? Huh?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I've seen it happen.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Where I live, Paul Rust and Leslie Arfin,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
the great TV show creators

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
their cat got

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and their dog was

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
traumatized by it and never got over it

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
because the dog was giant. The dog's like

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
you can eat the cat?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I sat here for 11 years

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
taking this thing's

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
shit.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Why can't I eat the cat?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
There's nothing but the dog in me.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
But yeah,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
their cat got eaten

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
next door to me and the sound of it

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and then the wailing of the dog

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I'm helpless.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
If you keep seeing this happen

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
where there's this dog procession

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
and then some animal gets murdered

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
you should warn people.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I see coyotes all the time

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
come down my street

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
and I'll pick up a rock and throw it

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
and they're like get the fuck out of here

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
but all they do is just fan out

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
and you just see them

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
like a black ops unit

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
going through backyards

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
and what their technique is

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
what I want to know is

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
what is a dog hearing when they hear a coyote

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
but you see the dogs go crazy when they hear

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
the coyotes start doing this thing

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
but their typical technique is

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
they'll send one stray coyote

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
like there'll be one

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
it'll start doing this thing

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
and the dogs are like

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Do you have sample technology in there?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Can we loop his coyote or no?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Apparently they goad

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
dogs into

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
an interaction with like

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
pretty standard raptor

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
a clever girl technique

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
they purposely

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I think that's the fanning out thing

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
is that they basically

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
they do these little

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
trolling and then

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
any dog that takes the bait

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
and kind of like is like

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
like crazy dog over there

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
that I could fucking talk to

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
about

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
being disguised as a bear

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
and then

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
they just fucking run up

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
and grab that poor little fucker

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
there's a dementia

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
addled half blind French bulldog

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
that lives up above my wall

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
where I just hear these coyotes now

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and I'm like I got a broomstick

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
and I'm like get out of here

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
get out of here coyotes

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I'm gonna buy

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
long flannel underwear with a butt flap

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
just to

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
have a cowboy hat with a brim up

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
and I get out you ferments

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
you should buy

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
a couple road runners

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
that attracts them

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
they self-destruct

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
but then you can also sell faulty products

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
to the coyotes

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
if I start like

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
just like you can style the leaf catalogs

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
like magnetic boxing glove

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
they're like

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I'm making money

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
hand over fist

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I like once every couple years

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
have a

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
standoff with a family of skunks

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
that just decide that they live

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
for charity this is a charity thing

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
it's a

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
where do you live

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
he lost Vegas on stage

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
he has the worst Vegas

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
stage show

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
also I can make a tiger disappear

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
sometimes just skunks

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
the whole family like mama papa

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
and the little babies and they're adorable

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
they're so cute

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
and they'll just be on my front door

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
and I just go like

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
late at night

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
just got home and I'm looking

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
there's a bunch of skunks just hanging out there and they see you

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
and what they don't do is run off like other animals

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
like squirrels and cats

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
they just look at you and like

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
what up

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
and then if you get close and try to

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
chew them

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
the adults put their tails up in the air

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
and they're like you know

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
it actually hurts to walk around with this

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
shit

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
like give me a reason

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
it's burning my tail

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I think it stinks too

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
look at me sideways

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
just

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
infringe upon my

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
my ancient pact with

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
the druids that founded Las Feliz

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
they have like

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
a millennial old pagan

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
ceasefire

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I don't have a chip on my shoulder

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I have a chip on my butt that I can't wait to

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
fucking fire at you

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
did you ever see like in the nature

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
where they show like a skunk in high

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
speed super slow mo

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
a skunk spraying it's so gross

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
super disgusting

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
it's like snot coming out

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
it's not like

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
stinky spray or like

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
stone vapor it's like grody

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
nasty fucking

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Peter North gross

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
we're pretty fortunate that

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
only one animal got that

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
as a defense mechanism oh my god

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
yeah like

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
it is crazy like there's only like a

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
handful of ways to protect yourself

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
there could be birds that project

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
how shit at you

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I got pooped in the mouth

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I was

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
moving on

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I was walking down the road

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
walking

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
down the road

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
fucking midday

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
downtown Los Angeles

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
couldn't even get

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
my car everything was groovy

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
and I see a flight

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
of little birds like small little

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
sparrow swallow size birds little

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
little birds and I see a little

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
like a little hoplight of fucking birds coming at me

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
and they're gonna go up into a tree

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and I see one bird and

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I don't want to over

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
dramatize this

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
but I'm pretty sure this bird made eye contact with me

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
from the distance that Spencer is from me

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
but about 10 feet higher

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
and came down with the rest of the birds

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
broke fucking ranks

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
like feathered off of that one

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
and fucking pooped

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
like about 5 feet in the air

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
and it went right in my mouth

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
like it judged

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
the fucking trajectory

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
like an 83 in television games

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
no no it was like fucking

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
iron eagle

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
he just fired a missile

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
of little baby bird poop

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
it wasn't like a big seagull turd

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
it wasn't like a big giant thing

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
but it was just like the bird flew at me

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
and just dropped one about 4 feet away

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
but because of inertia

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
that the poop leaving the bird

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
is gonna carry the same speed

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
for the first few feet

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
it landed right in my bottom lip

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
my mouth was closed

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
and right there I'm like

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
what the fuck

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
that bird knew exactly what was happening

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
what is it with birds shit

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
it would be one thing if it was

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
either like turds

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
like hamster turds

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
or just

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
a glass of white goo

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
it's both that's so gross

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
and the other supernatural properties

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
of bird poop

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
it's black on

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
white stuff and white on black stuff

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
with the same bird butt

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
that doesn't even make sense

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
what do you mean?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
in large poop like pigeon poop

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I may be wrong about this

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
because my avian knowledge is not where it ought to be

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
oh I see what you're saying it's like a reverse chameleon

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
like they've adapted

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
just letting everyone know where our shit is

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
if master contrast

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
the brown part is the feces

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
and the white part

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
the lighter color stuff is the urine

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
so that bird probably peed in my mouth

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
birds you're gross

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
if there are any birds that listen to the podcast

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
like

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
your bones are hollow

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
so it's not impressive that you can fly

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I could fly too if I had hollow bones

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
and I don't want them

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I don't care I can get on a plane

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I don't want to do that either

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I hate planes

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I hate ego roles

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
no it's just a name

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I have no emotional connection to it

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
at all

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I do want to

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
remind everyone that this whole

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
moment was started with you saying

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I got pooped in the mouth

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
he was all enthusiastic about it

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I got pooped in the mouth

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
my enthusiasm

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
don't mistake my enthusiasm for outrage

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
the bird

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
intentionally

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
the birds were going off to my left

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
and one broke ranks and fired a poop in my mouth

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
or maybe pee

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
I don't know but all I know is

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
it's good luck

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
when did this happen

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
church are you still here

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
she fucked off

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
it was like two weeks ago

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
is this the first you're telling other people of this

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I told her

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I just got pooped in the mouth

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
is it fair to blame this

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
the government shut down

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
that wouldn't happen

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
if there was 800,000 people

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
getting pee at work

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
they regulate this stuff

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
maybe it was longer

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I feel like it was pretty shut down

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
I don't know

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
the timeline is not important

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
what matters is that I got pooped in the mouth

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
birds are savage

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
when my brother got married

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
we had a bachelor party

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
in Balboa

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
and we all went out the next morning

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
to have a bloody merry

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
cool old dive bar in Balboa

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
and we're hanging out

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
and my brother's friend Bren

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
is a college buddy

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
he's the most mellow surfer dude

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
he's like Matthew McConaughey

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
he's just one of those guys

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
he's super laid back

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
and he goes out to have a cigarette

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
and comes back in

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I've never seen him look worried or bummed out

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
and he comes back in

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
walking as fast as you can walk

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
without running into the bathroom

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
and then he comes back in

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
and he sits down next to him

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
and he picks up his buddy Mary

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and he's all like

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I'm like Bren what happened

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
and he goes

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I'm gonna try to say this without laughing

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I said

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
bird pulled a deuce on my bean

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
a bird pulled a deuce

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
on my bean

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
that's the way

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
if you're a surfer guy you say a bird shit on my head

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
see Australian

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
no

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I can't say a bird pulled a deuce on my bean

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
mate

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
he's a mate after it

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
let's make some music shall we

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
can I say one more weird bird thing

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I got a couple more animal things

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
go ahead

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
it was raining a lot here

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
in the last week or so

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
and I was riding around with my kid

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
and he goes

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I felt bad for the birds

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I'm gonna fly around

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
a falcon eagle

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
that's close

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
nevermind

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I was trying to riff your son's name

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
almost did

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
open Kevin Sparrow

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Kevin

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
a little Kevin turns to me and he says

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
oh no he says

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
he felt bad for the birds

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
and I was like

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
they're okay

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
you're driving

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
that's exactly what I was doing

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
you're almost mad at them

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
because in my heart I was like they are okay

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
but then he asked me why I had no answer

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
whatsoever

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
why are the birds okay are they okay

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
should we be concerned there should be sanctuaries

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
well if they weren't okay

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
wouldn't the ground

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
be covered with them

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
but then he starts crying

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
this is the confidence I had

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
but I also had no reason

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
do you ever watch the David Attenborough

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
life of birds thing

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
it's like the planet earth kind of stuff

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
it's called the life of birds

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
and I think there's like six or eight episodes

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
it's so good

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
it's just his British dating tips

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
oh look

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
look at that bird over there

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I fucking like to watch her flap around

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
she knows what she's doing

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
fucking now look at that fucking bird

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
hahaha

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
boy you drink bird you fucking little

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
offer a fag

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
no but there's one it's just about the technology

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
of feathers and the reason

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
why they don't fucking have to worry about it

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
is the feathers are like this like

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
like Klingon cloaking device for water

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
almost says some bullshit like further technology

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
but I couldn't back it up

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
also you also said

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
you would see birds all over the ground

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
you almost never see a dead bird in the ground

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
like maybe a few times in your life

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
you'll see like a oh shit there's a dead bird

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
it is weird the reason why you don't

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
is because they're instantly

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
eaten by other things and because they're so

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
light because the bones are hollow and they're made of feathers

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
they blow away

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
yeah I bet the feather

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
in the forest gump

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
is probably a recently

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
also

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
also that feather

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
killed Archduke Ferdinand to start the World War I

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
that's how fucking rich the history

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
of come before and

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
and when it did like someone was like

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
whoa feather why'd you do that

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
think different

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
yeah that's great

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
we should use that and that chocolate box was

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
made out of lunar lander

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
how old is Kevin Sparrow

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
he just turned 10

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
that's a that's sort of I mean

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
that's got to be amazing I would love to have a 10 year old

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I don't want anything

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
almost anything else I hear you

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
cause I remember being 10

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
that's going to go mimetic tomorrow

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
you're two years from him

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
chesting up on you

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
you're going to be like

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
why does that get an eye roll

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
all I said was good morning

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
in any way he can he tries to

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
dominate me now he just can't cause he's 10

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
but when he's 12 a little bit different

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
like the 10 year olds

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
first of all they play Minecraft so I'm just like

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
yeah

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
but then they just love

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
they love to just like talk about

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
lists of shit

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
the lapisaurus is another

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
I'm just like this is

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
something more interesting than

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
like credit cards

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
is your son a skill baby

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
uh

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
I don't think so

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I think we've taught him everything he knows

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
either that or somebody else

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
what's your relationship like

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
are you guys pals or

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
yeah we're pretty cool

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
we are

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
that was a measured response

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
yeah cause I think it's a complicated answer

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
sometimes I kind of think

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
maybe he's just hanging around cause he's legally

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
obligated to

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
that's what it sounded like

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
we went to the zoo the other day and I'm like

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I feel like it was kind of a mutual

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I love him alright

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
my question I guess what I'm asking is

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
do you like him as a person

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
oh I like him a lot

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
he is 10 though

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
so he could be

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
a pain in the ass oh my god

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
yes but in cute ways most of the time

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
is he gangly

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
first of all is he listening

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
oh no he hates podcasts

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
he's not allowed to listen to this one

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
but is he getting gangly

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
yeah he is

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
he's a tall skinny version

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
of his toddler self which is weird

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
but he's not quite like a teenager yet

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
he's just a long

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
small child

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
I see pictures of myself

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
around that age and I'm like

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I don't think our human brains

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
are like designed to

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
adorable lies

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
like

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
the day to day transition

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
where it's like this is the gangly

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
period where we're like will you just pick a lane

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
you know what I notice about

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
what I notice about him too cause

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
he's constantly growing we're having to buy shoes

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
and shit all the time he grows out of everything

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
his pants always get short

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
he's wearing the same

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
shirts he's wearing when he was 5 I swear to God

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
it's like his legs get long with his torso

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
he's gonna be same size

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
he's gonna be tall then

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
maybe that's all children I have no idea

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
when I was 10 I had like

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I was really short but I giant

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
my shoes were like really

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
so I looked like I was

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
skiing all the time

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
I made a lot of noise walking around

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
I was like skinny and short

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
with like big ass feet

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
that's all of them I saw a British documentary

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
about puberty

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
is David Edinburgh

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I don't know

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
I bought it in Times Square

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
from some guy in a raincoat

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
it was

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
it was really cool I can't

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
remember what it's called I saw it like years ago

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
but it was like

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
it was like

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
they kind of like take you through

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
a boy and a girl both are going through

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
these changes

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
it starts

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
they live next door to each other in this little

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
town

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
and then like they go to school together

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
and then it's like they walk you through

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
puberty and including

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
like the fact that

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
the boy his brain chemistry

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
is starting to change and so like thoughts

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
of like

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
it's like he starts like

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
scuffling with other boys

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
talking about like all of this like

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
weird biochemical shit one of the things

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
that they said was

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
both of them you know is they're going to bed

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
at night like

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
like when

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
when shit kicks in

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
literally overnight these changes are happening

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
and I think they said like if you were able

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
to somehow without being

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
a villain in a maybe

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
a D. L. I. Roth movie like

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
if you were able to like focus in on

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
like the leg bones of a kid at that age

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
you could see with

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
the naked eye the

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
like growth happening

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
it's how fast like like like bones are

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
lengthening and shit like

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
they wake up and they're like a quarter inch

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
taller

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I wonder if you could hear it does it sound like a tree

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
this this this is just

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
like I'm going to write a book about

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
you

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
haha

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
matter what Mike this is this your son

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
like listen to your music you play music

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
with him he used to like my music

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
haha

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
like your old shit well yeah he's

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
a hip he's a hip hip no he

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
we programmed him with all this

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
independent alt rap

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
shit and then he like

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Drake for the first time and now he wants

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
you lost him we lost him

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
I mean we lost him for a while this is his rebellion

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
he likes to he likes to hear the

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
hi-hats like that's that's what he's into

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
you know

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
that's amazing it's all about

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
is he musical or is he gonna

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
he raps he raps

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
he raps a lot he raps himself to sleep

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
every night is he right or freestyle only

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
freestyles he will not write a ramp or

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
oh shit we're gonna

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
ask is he good he is pretty

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
good he used to like not

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
use words so that was bad like he would just

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
that's cheating that's cheating

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
syllables yeah he would just make up enough

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
syllables

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Ella Fitzgerald had a career

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
that's true but those were

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
those were choices

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
he wasn't making choices

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
he's just fudging it

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
it's kind of like

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
oh that reminds me too he loves

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
to make fun of 80s rap

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
oh yeah just like that

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
right he'd be like what is 80s

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
rap sound he'd be like he would

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
he would die in a pop-a-dop-a-tah

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
and I'm like yeah you're right that's it

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
that's a little fast

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
that was a little fast does he know 80s

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
rap he knows run

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
look I've steeped him in rap

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
but so now he has these refined

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
tastes where he knows what to hate on

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
but you say now he's into more pop he

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
like bigger like produced

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
he likes relevance like most people

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
that's why it's called

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
pop it's popular what do we think Martin

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Luther King jr. would do we

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
think he would have been a hip hop

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
fan would he have been like

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
a crotchety would he have been like

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I have a dream that you're turning that down

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
who like or what

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
you know elephants Gerald

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
or would he be like

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
he would have been very disappointing yeah

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
he would have hated rap just because it's not

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
because you see you think he was probably

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
because it's like I mean

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
it because it's like oh you should

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
be the his definition

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
of like championship was like

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
you're going to a school that has music classes

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
and you're playing an instrument and

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
you're conquering the system

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
his idea of rebellious music

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
would be like blues music with

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
curse words you know what I mean

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
like rap would be just

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
straight obscene to him but also

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
at that time of his life

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
like up in Harlem like the jazz clubs

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
and stuff like that that's where like

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
that culture

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
that was the dangerous part of town when he played

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
an upright bass yeah

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
yeah he didn't actually I mean

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
he thought he always thought like oh

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
just keep moving forward keep moving forward

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
and he didn't know like

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
yeah god I mean he would have wept

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
had he known like

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
the Harlem Renaissance

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
and like the counter

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
targeting and what it resulted in

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I think if you explained it all to him then he would be

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
a hip-hop fan because he'd be like well

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
when you put it that way right because it's

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
basically like oh you can't have

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
you can't have music funding you can't have

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
an instrument you can't go to things and it's like well then

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
fuck you so

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
if he read the hip-hop Wikipedia page

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
right if he read as much about

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
hip-hop as I did about him an hour

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
ago I think he'd be a smart

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
enough guy to be like okay well then you gotta

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
like but I think he'd be really

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
I'm sorry Dan go ahead no I probably

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
don't have to finish all right I just thought

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I think he'd be really bummed out that there was

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
like this that it was like oh shit there

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
was a counter punch this wasn't there

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
there was a huge one I mean it was like

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
the 80s were like no fuck

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
it was like boom it like

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
right when I was a kid and I was not

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
conscious of it but then then

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
in the 2000s it's like then we're learning

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
about it like I mean I think it was really

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
in the 70s I think

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
if you look at Cointel Pro specifically

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
which was like an official FBI

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
program it was like sent to

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
destroy

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
black uprisings basically

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
and they a lot of it was with crack cocaine

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
right and with heroin and just stuff

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
that was funneled into communities

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
because they knew that it would like destroy

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
people and if nothing else if you

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
can just if you can attach a drug to a

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
population then there's always a reason

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
to throw them in jail whenever you see them

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
also yeah and you turn around and make the laws

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
that are more specifically punitive towards

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
the things you've introduced into

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
the community it's a lot

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
and it created a generation gap

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
and a lot of that is part of

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
why

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
the rudor parts of rap music are

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
like they are because like this is a generation

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
of people who lost parents

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
yeah like when you see a crack head

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
or hear about a crack head that's somebody's mom

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
yeah and they just weren't around because

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
crack was more important to

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
yeah when I was in high school it was like all of a sudden

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
all the white guys were in the locker room

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
we're like we're reciting the easy

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
lyrics it was like this thing was happening

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
it was the double irony of

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
oh hip-hop has gone full

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
nihilism but at the same

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
time now white people love it

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
so now it's worth money

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
so now etc like it was just

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
fucking weird let's solve it tonight

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
where do you think I sat now like

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
obviously like

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
let's see who we're gonna

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
where

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Mike when you're writing your music because like your stuff is

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
like poetic and funny

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
and

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
you just keep like I mean

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
from what I've heard like it's just like

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
you just keep moving and talking

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
are you talking to yourself are you talking to an audience

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
like when you're writing your stuff

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
are you writing just to get stuff

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
are you trying to

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
like are you trying to

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
tell a story to somebody else are you just talking about the stuff

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
in your head I think

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I am trying to

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
entertain

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
but like I'm starting with trying to entertain

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
myself so I think I'm filtering

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
what I want to say to other people

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
via what amuses me mostly

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
and I think that's cool

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
do you think like the emo rap thing

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
like we probably talked about this

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
last time maybe and I was black out drunk but

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
the like

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
to me it's like from what I hear I'm like

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
oh that's kind of cool at least

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
like

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
the like

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
rappers that are like grinding their jaws

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
and going like I'm so fucking high

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I'm pills and like no one's calling

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
me back

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
that it's like the more

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
like that's

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I smell it

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
the

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I don't know I was

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
like to me that

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I was like

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I was like oh good

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
that feels like not

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
that feels like not

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
like

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
that feels like one iteration less healthy

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
maybe than being like

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
here's how it is and I'm

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
resigned to like

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I don't know it's like I statements and like

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
exploring depression seems

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
like a

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
cooler

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
thing than being like

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
almost I like

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
tricked into

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
celebrating

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
criminalization

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
like exploring addiction

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
and codependence

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
and loneliness and alienation is like

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
oh we're starting to

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
meet in the middle here because

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
white America

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
is now all opiated out and

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
like at least we can all just

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
be like yo fuck that

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I wanna buy Nintendo

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
yeah and I think that's exactly

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
where it gets hazy right because

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
music is a huge business so

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
something it might be

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
might have genuine worth for us

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
psychologically or emotionally is

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
quickly co-opted

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and figured out like marketed

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
in a way that becomes dangerous so

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
like you don't necessarily

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
just get the benefit but I think that

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
you know like selling art

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
basically you just have to contend

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
with those sorts of things

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
when you're writing

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
when you're writing

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
like a writing question like when you're

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
making stuff are you

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
do you just sit down pen and paper and write

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
or type or are you just kind

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
of freestyling your head and say oh that's good

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I'm gonna put that in. No I write

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I write, I rewrite

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
all of that. So it's actually pen to paper

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
well it used to be pen to paper now I'm typing

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I hate it but I do it because I'm lazy

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
same thing yeah yeah

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
you gotta keep up with your kid too

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
if you use a pen he's gonna

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
fucking swallow you up

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
that's true

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
your son thinks you're a bear by the way

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
he does

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
we produce some stuff

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
because we

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
it started with

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
starburn's audio wanting to put out

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
like a tape of like

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
just the

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
the rapping. The rapping from the

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
podcast like just the raw

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
record just the clips which you can hear

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
for free if you just listen to the podcast and stuff

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
and the audio is whatever it is

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
and I think it was me

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
he's going like well could we if you're gonna

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
like sell it to people can we do

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
like a B side where we

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
bother to take the wraps

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and like

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
re-record them and then we had to have this whole

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
conversation where

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
is our job to

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
make them good

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
because then you change everything

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
or is it like

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
when you're restoring a painting

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
from the Renaissance but it ain't from the

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Renaissance it's from

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
a horrible show in Denver

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
but it's sort of like

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
we recorded

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
a bunch of stuff

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
a lot of you

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
what we decided to do

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
was kind of repeat your process

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
from here like you just

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
rap I guess what you do we don't need to sit

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
and try to craft a bunch

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
of perfect rap songs like the

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
essential Dan Harmon rap

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
experiences him just fucking rapping

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
right you guys have heard that I'm sure

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
it couldn't be more genuine

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
we heard it today

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
that's what I thought I heard a little bit of it

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
a little goes a long way

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I like it

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
so we have a bunch of songs

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
that we made you would

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
rap and rap and rap and rap

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
and we would kind of craft these songs

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
based off of

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
what you did and I did bring some to play

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
should we play some I think we should

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
because we haven't

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
like one of

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
like Simon Oré from Starburns

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
kind of went through initially like pulled out

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
all of the all of the times

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
like it was like rapping like there

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
the ones that stick out are like apologies to Denver

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
that's a good one

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
what is it

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
what's the one that's Funky Horns

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Funky Horns is dope

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Funky Horns

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I really like

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
the song

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
dedicated to Marc Maron

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
the Funky Horns that we have

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
the one we always play

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
oh you know the Horns

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I think the Horns were playing when I came out here

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I think

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Horns

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
you know what

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
we're going to play Funky Horns

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
we're going to play Dan Harmon's rap version

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
of Funky Horns

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
are you guys in studio or on stage during the show

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
this is a studio

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
this is a world premiere

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
this is deep in the lab

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
this is professional shit

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I don't think y'all's butt holes are clenched tight enough

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
they're not

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I can see

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
this is high stakes shit

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
this is like there's going to be beefs and feuds

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
well we're going to get to that

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
we're going to start with Funky Horns

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
oh yeah

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
then beefs and feuds

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
let's bring those Funky Horns

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Funky Horns is the name of this track

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
you named it once and you never look back

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Ryan Elder is the man put all this shit together

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
he's a genius on the couch

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
and a genius on the leather

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
now I'm going to use my privilege to rap

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I'm going to waste your time and rap just like that

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I'm going to be fat and 44 years old

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and I'm going to blow my ass into a microphone

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
record

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and fucking waste your time

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
just a fucking big fat white dude

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
fucking just talking shit into a microphone

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
because he can pay himself to do whatever the fuck he wants

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Rick and Morty

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I created

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
a million dollars a season

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
a million dollars a season

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
didn't earn it

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Funky Horns is the name of this track

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I'm going to make this rap up because

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
my crap is gold

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I don't do what I'm told

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I came, I saw, I fucked

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Vini Vini Vici, your mom said shucks

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
fucked your mama with my understanding

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
fucked your mama like it was not landing

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Funky Horns is the name of this track

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I'm going to do an improvised rap

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
but I'm going to be fat

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
blow hard with lots of privilege

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I fucked your mama so hard there was some

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
shrivelage of her vulva

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
but it was from pleasure I assure you

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
she wasn't going out

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
it hurt I was abused she was saying my pussy got

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
adequately used

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I got inside the depths I plumbed it inside

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
and out she needed a rest

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and she was having a tremendous amount

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
of satisfaction with my action

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
my rhymes can be predictable but so can you

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
if you don't like fucking my mama what you

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
gonna do you can't fuck my mama

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I fucked that up

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
my mama's dead why you bring her up

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
fucking insensitive prick

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
my mom's fucking dead breast cancer

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
number one killer of women piece of shit

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
light a candle

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
here we go

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Dan Harmon everybody

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
but that's really open

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
my eagle as

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
hip-hop producer because

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I mean the thing is like

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
it's like a different split between

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
like it's not

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I did a bunch of shit

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
you were like a genius

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
about it because it brought you in

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
it wasn't a job that you were like

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I have an idea

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
we were like what if we tried to do this

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
how would you do it and you're

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
you approached it like

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
oh well if you're making a statue

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
like get the slab of marble

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
in there I think kind of and you just did this

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
bare amount of like

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
like chiseling

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
it doesn't make me a good rapper

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
it's not like edited to the point of

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
anything

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I think you made some good songs though

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
a lot of people

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
that don't have any business

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
rapping make albums

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
but you actually

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
rap all the time

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
and so like you have this like

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
relationship to the craft of rapping

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
there's really uniquely interesting

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
and I think that like in everything

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
that we did we can kind of distill like

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
oh this is the

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
this is the painting you were painting

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
and we kind of like this you know this is the joint

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
yeah this is an interesting process

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
like talking about like whoa what

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
so you got drunk in Maryland

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
and you did this rap

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
but it like turned into like

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
apologies to Denver like I think is interesting

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
because

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
it's just a recreation

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
of a rap that happened in

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Denver and it was like

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
all we were really doing

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
is kind of reproducing it

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
word for word right

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
like it wasn't like we did more

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
with it we just produced it

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
but in the moment it was this odd

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
thing it's almost kind of like a weird

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
like more artistic

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
than anything I would do if you if you let

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
me think about it for any amount of time

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I got drunk and started doing this rap in Denver

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and I just kept saying

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
like oh it's about the apology like

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
you keep saying he's sorry I keep

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
cause I'm rapping about pussies and

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
stuff and I keep but I'm also like

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
what it means to fuck somebody's mama like

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
it was not slandering

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
that was a show it was a prime

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
time soap in the

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
80s

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I mean if you if you know

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Dan Harmon rapping we know that he likes

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
to spend a lot of time with your mom

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
while he's rapping

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
what else you got give us give us another track

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I mean you play your favorites

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
okay that puts you on the spot

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
but I was prepared

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
so that's that's not a problem for me at all

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I am really into this Mark

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Marin is he's got a this song

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
to Marc Maron

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
oh shit you got a beef with Marc Maron

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I'm really into this but it's based on the one where

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Marc Maron was when we came back

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
from the tour and we were at the Egyptian and

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Marc Maron was at the show and as he was coming

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
up to the stage I did like a Marc Maron

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
rap kind of

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
this is sort of like a yeah we

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
reproduced that

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I don't know about any real beef I just like this song

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
so this is from that show the Egyptian or it's a redo

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
like you did later on this is all studio

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
this is we did it in the studio but we're

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
that's a recreation of

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
we're a departure from

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
it's about to be the podcast beef of

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
2019

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
here we go

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Dan Harmon got beef with Mark

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Marin Dan Harmon got beef with

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Marc Maron Dan Harmon got

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
beef with Marc Maron

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
kind of on the no beef

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Marc Maron

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
M-A-R-O-N

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
fuck your mama's gonna do it again

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Marc Maron

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
when you interview comedy

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
people

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
it's enlightening

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Marc Maron while you staring

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
me is your mama rocking

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Sharon gonna fuck her like Sharon

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Stone I gave her

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
soup my bone

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
then I financed her house with

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
alone at the bottom of the

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
market she got robbed

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Marc Maron does that make your weenie

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
throb?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
probably not unless you're incestuous

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Marc Maron that

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
probably crossed a line but I don't care

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
because this is beef

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
but it was still consensual

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
call you out

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
on a separate dish from each other

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Marc Maron

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
remember Karen from

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Ancient Greek mythology

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
across the river sticks

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
and now I'm crossing your mama with a boat

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
made of dicks

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
MARC is the way to spell Mark

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000

Dan Harmon got beef with Marc Maron

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
had Obama on his show

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
who knows

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
they had used an algorithm

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
where everyone's new podcast is number one

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
for a week

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
to encourage people to be excited about free labor

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
he managed to get a dig

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
at capitalism

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
some dangerous shit

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
you crossed the river sticks

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
on a boat made of dicks

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
inspired

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and fucking inspired

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
alright well I mean

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I think it's time for some

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
like some freestyle

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
you guys gonna make some music together right

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
we need to play the thing that we

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
whatever came of the session where we did it

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
but I just wanted to mention the session that we did

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
because I kept talking about

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I want to do one of these like emo things

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
and you're like look man

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
are you just trying to do like a Yankee Vicky

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
like thing or do you want to like do it

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
is that there and I was like

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
you know I will do it

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
you have to get so high

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
and like I got really

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
higher than so high

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
and I was like in the booth

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I remember all I remember

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I swear to God all I remember is

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
you on the other side of the glass

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
and I was like this joint

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
and I remember you pressing the button going

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Dan what do you want

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
and I was like I want black people

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
to like me

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
why

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I don't know

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
hopefully with auto tune

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
this will be good I don't know

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
that part didn't make the cut

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
just

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
just know that

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
it's not in the final version

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I walked out of there and got into an Uber

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
and was like who am I

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
the song is tight

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I think this song is dope

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
wait do you have that one

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I have all of them

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
alright play one more of your favorites

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Mike and then

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
let's cut some new tracks

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
then let's replenish the well

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
yeah

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
you probably noticed

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
that since your appearance on the show

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I didn't exactly like

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
get better

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
like I had a

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
you know like a gymnast

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
coach coming out and like

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
no you're gonna do this and that

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
then I disappeared so you went back

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
to my mama fucking

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
you did

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I'm gonna play one of my

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
yeah

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
it's called smooth jazz

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I really like the song

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I fucking love this shit so much

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
so it's all the

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
harmontown tracks

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I don't even know if this was one

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I think this may have been just a straight studio original

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
to a standard

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
that encourages

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
vaginoplasty

scrambled eggs

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000

covered in pimples and zits

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
there is a difference

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
and you don't want to know what it is

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
that's what I look like

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
this is me realizing

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I should have let you hear that

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
that was a real toboggan ride

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
you're like this is my favorite

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
sorry I dehumanized you

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
it's okay

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I still feel human through it all

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
do you have the

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
the technology to

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
make a new one right now

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I got beads

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
so we can wrap for sure

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I think we have to

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I mean clearly

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I got the fire

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
this is maybe the most

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
fired up I've ever seen you

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I'm ready to cross

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
the river stakes on a boat made of dicks

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Dan's warming up

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Dan's harnesses minecraft t-shirt power

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
oh yeah

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
yeah right

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
should we have an objective

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
okay

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
objectives are good

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
what do we want to we want to solve racism

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
we said it earlier

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
yeah well it's MLK day

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
that's not why you have me here today

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
you ran into Jeff at the drying room

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
that's true

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
uh

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Mike your bandaid is coming off your face

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
bandaid

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
on your face

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
here with open mic

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
gonna solve race

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
race needs to be solved

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
racism

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
also needs to be solved

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
if you solve race you solve

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
racism

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
if you just mix everyone's jism

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
there won't be race so we can't

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
be racist but

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
you can't have a band without a

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
bassist

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
you can't have grapes without

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
raisins

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
you can't have cranberry without

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
raisins

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
and then racists like to

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
separate people by the colors of

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
their faces

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
they'd be mad if one person had

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
straight tooth and there was another

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
person wearing braces they'd be like

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
this is not amazing

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
because I hate this

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
every hateful person wants to be

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
better

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
everybody wishes they were born in a

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
sweater then they would never

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
be cold they wouldn't need pants

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
every racist has a

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
hypocritical dance

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
the hypocritical dance and the

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
stance that they wear but I'm happy

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
because I also like pants or

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
sweaters yes that's what

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I was born in if I didn't wear

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
a sweater I'd be like transforming

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
into something warm then

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
because I would feel left alone

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
like a fucking orphan

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
if I didn't have more

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
skin but that's like

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
a penis with a foreskin or

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
something

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
circumcision comes with a decision

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
but everything else

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
comes from derision

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I don't know what that means

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
but when you let your mind go

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
you start to wrap jelly beans

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
and then little kids start

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
to scream because circumcision

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
is a terrible scene

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
but that's just a parent's

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
decision usually

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
informed by some Judeo-Christian

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
religion.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Did the tortoise put the hair in his place

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
and isn't the whole asop myth

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
that the slow and steady wins the race

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
you gotta take it slow

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
you don't have to be the top

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
of the heap right you know

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
that you don't have to be

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
like it's me against you

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
it could be us together

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
right, not white

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
right doesn't make white

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
and white doesn't make might

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
might just be shit

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and the English call it shite

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
if I ruled the world

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
I'd get me a girl

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
yeah

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I love the ladies

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
ladies

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
ladies and I'm rapping for the 80s

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
just like my kid

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
cause I don't like a Mercedes

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
I'm rapping and I'm not a baby

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I'm singing lately and I like yes or no

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I don't fuck with new babies

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
yeah

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Koot Joe had rabies

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
foaming at the mouth and he didn't have

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
labies

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
he had a dog penis

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
a lipstick in a sheath of fur

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
sheath of fur

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
that was like a wolf

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
or a dog pretending to be

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
a bear to a female dog

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
he was deceiving her

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
oh shit and then it will be

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
a blur in my memory

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I'm cold as December B

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
intricately I rap and do my rhymes

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
all the time raw as rhyme

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
it's never overcooked or overlooked

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I forgot the fucking

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
symptoms or the direction that we were

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
going in so I'm flowing like

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
oceans then that's the way underground

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I bring the thunder down like

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
zoos do too beautiful

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
by janelle to get cuticles

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
take the medicine the shit is chillable

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
fruitful mission split

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
just like decisions I'm rippin

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
it's free style shit it's never written

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
yeah it's like thinning sky

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
with ribbons but that's just if you wonder

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
but that's the one song and I can come

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
strong I've never been sane

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
drag and punch just like I'm shanglong

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
ain't been in the ring long I beat

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
my chest like King Kong

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
can't go back and forth with mice

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
like it was ping pong

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
yeah I'm sorry

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
oh shit

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
like shenlong

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
no mama's got fucking that song

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
oh shit not one mom

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
not one mom

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
zero mama's

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
holy fucking shit

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
fucking did it

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
god damn it

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
all right go with the flow

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
that's fucking incredible

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
going back and forth with ping pong

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
we'll make history god damn it

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
yeah you did it Mike

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
no he did it he didn't rap about fucking mothers

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
that's the most

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
look I heard him presale a lot

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
a lot of moms got fucked

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
matter of fact I think at one point

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
we were like this whole project has to be about him

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
being somebody stepfather

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
because in that way

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
talking to you about how he's fucking your mother

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
makes sense

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
it's very Freudian I mean

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
it's literally Freudian

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Spencer you got some freestyle in you tonight

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I don't know

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I guess

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I would like to hear just like a very

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
you know like just a Spencer freestyle

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
eggs in the morning

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
eggs in the morning

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
scrambled or fried

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
you better decide

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
eggs in the morning

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
there's people in line behind you

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
fry them in a pan

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
put them in a skillet

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
stomachs empty fillet

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
breakfast I'm gonna kill it

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
yeah breakfast

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
eggs in the morning

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
coming from a chicken

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
yo

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
how they taste

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
delicious

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
my name is MC chicken

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I got a beak

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
and I've never licked because I don't

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
have a tongue and even if I did

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I don't think I know

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
what I bid in an auction

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
and I'm owned by the farming industry

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
so my poop is part of my pee

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
because a chicken butt is also a penis

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
don't have a penis because I'm a hen

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
sorry to get

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
heteronormative

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
non-binary MC chicken

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
yo

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I'm neither rooster nor hen

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
and I'm gonna tell it to you like I told you again

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I don't crow in the morning and I don't lay eggs

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
and I make my own decision

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
and I walk on my own legs

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I am autonomous I am neither

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
of anything I do what I do

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
and I have a song to sing

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
but I'm a butcher and I want to sell

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
chicken wings so that means

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
there's things that we have to do

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
that before I wasn't mentioning

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
that means that there are

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
things that are brought about you're my chicken

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I've grown you but it's time for the slaughterhouse

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
so here we go and I'm sorry

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
to be a punk and to take a dump

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
on your dreams but there's a stump over there

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
and that's how I have to do I bled you

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
to this spot here to grab this knife

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
and then behead you because I have to sell

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
this people shit that they're loving

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
and turn your entire body until

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
like nine nuggets and that's just all

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
we have and you had dream stuff

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
but now your body and flesh is turning

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
into pink stuff that I'm gonna deep

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
fry because I seem wise and it's

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
gonna sell you with a big

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
fucking box of these fries

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
and you like those too because that's what

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I feed you because farming is gross

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
but that's how we

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
freestyle to make it sound the most

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
worse

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
yo chicken

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
response

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
you're not blowing my mind

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
it's not your time to find the things that

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
make me surprised

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
that's my impression of you

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
my name is

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
mc non-binary chicken

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I didn't even need your opinion

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I already know you owe me and you're gonna

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
kill me I'm trying to explain

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
what happens to fulfill me before the

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
sun comes up on the end of my life

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
you're telling me about particulars that have

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
to do with your knife I know you have needs

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
you have labels and you have things

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
but I'm just telling you what makes me sing

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
and I'm trying to tell you about these wings

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
okay

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
that's the decision I've made because you're

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
delicious and that's how it goes

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
you have to follow me here

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
because you are the key to my personal economy

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I'm sorry it's pretty weird

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I don't want to have to beg but I need

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
your meat and your body and your head

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
listen rise up and I'll pick you to death

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
rise up

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
to stop you until you draw your last breath

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I'm mc non-binary chicken

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
now it's time I'm kicking

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I'm kicking down your door coming in your house

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
in the middle of the night and I'm creeping

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
like a mouse and I'm grabbing all your tools

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
and you put all these holes in my blouse

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
oh you have this sharpest mouth

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
the internet has created

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
a situation where

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
we're all satiated

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
with nightmares about predation

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
we don't want to lend

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
to a sterile nation

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
every time you think of sweets

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
predators wearing bibs

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
nerds

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
some turds

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
you can also have

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
a licorice

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
the doors lock from inside

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
with a button that I press

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
on the underside

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
of my Matlauer counter

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
and I can't let you leave until you pay your bill

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
and that's just standard

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
just gotta make sure you pay

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I'll take a credit card or cash

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
it's the usual way

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I used an expression when I said

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
it used to be a free lollipop

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I gave them to you

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
but the exchange of goods and services

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
would behoove you

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I jammed your cell signal

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
with my secret

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
candy man computer

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
it's in the basement made of pewter

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I'm a steampunk predatory

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
candy shop owner

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I jammed your cell signal

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
with my pewter

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
computer

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
I want a lollipop

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
and you're gonna have one

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
but you're gonna

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
not get a lollipop

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
well

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
no heroes in that story

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I mean I thought

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I did hear the guy in the beginning

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
he wanted out

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
he wanted out of the narrative

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
but then he got

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
he was kind of like McBeth

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
that sort of like

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
spends the first half of the play

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
going like I'm not a murderer

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
I'm not controlled by witches

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
and then the forest comes to Dunstan and he's like

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I want a lollipop

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
I'm gonna be singing that the whole night

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
it's so catchy

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
oh music is evil

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
there's a van driving on the street and there's a little boy

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
and the guy rolls the window down in the van

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
if you get in the van I'll give you a piece of candy

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
and the kid says if you give me the whole bag I'll suck your dick

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I want a lollipop

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I become you

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
more and more every day

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
every day

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I get closer to you

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
in every organic way

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
I watch my nuts

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
dragging down to my knees

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
please let me

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
fuck an old person

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
yo girl

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I like what they did

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
don't talk to me unless you got grandkids

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
yeah

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
busting nuts

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
busting nuts but a lot of them blank

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
about to turn the crank

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
on your eyes with your tang

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
let's drop this

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
come over here and get a piece of this

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
wrinkly ass

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
my nuts are so low they tell me when it's time to mow the grass

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
my fucking balls are getting

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
swiggy and low

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
yo you can

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
swing them to and fro I can throw them over my shoulder

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
and make a tie

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
look

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
you like my nutsack tie

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
show me more

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
plates that you ordered from the internet

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
show me

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
more plates that we can't

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
eat off of yet

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
princess die

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Davey Crockett

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
that's good shit

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
the opposite worked

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
that was good

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
he's just beer right

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
actually what was the thing I started with

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I never used the phrase gerontophile

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
someone was a gerontophile

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
in something I saw

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
what does that even mean

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
gerontology

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
people who are viscerally

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
and compulsively attracted to the elderly

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
do we

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
worship them as gods

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
in a world where we all agree

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
where we're like wow

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
pedophiles are the worst

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
thing you could be

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
do we therefore

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
start gerontophiles

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
should we build statues to them

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
it's more of a standard deviation

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
if you're on either extreme

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
it's probably frowned upon

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I think it's like

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
it's like vultures

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
where it's like but I mean it's gotta

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
happen right

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
it's like they're doing a service

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I'm not gonna do it

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.000
it looks horrible

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
they make a living off of it

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
oh they're paid

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
vultures they add their whole shtick

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
they love it they can't get enough

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
they circle their friends come

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
with friends come

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
yeah vultures

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
also vultures

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
solve a lot of crimes of missing bodies

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
because the police say oh there's some vultures over there

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
that's probably where the body is

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I thought that was

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
in reference to some like

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
80s vulture detective cartoon

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
that I forgot about

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I was trying to remember it

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
my ass doesn't let

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
I uh

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
hit a beat hit a beat

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I wasn't ready

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I don't think it's gonna

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
lend itself to a rap

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
just thinking about aging and I was like

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
you know what's the one thing that I really wish

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
you know I can cope with

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
a bald spot and like an even death

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
like I can't wait

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I can wait I love waiting

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I love playing Minecraft

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
and waiting to die but I

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
do you really play a lot of Minecraft

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
yeah really

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
wow so it's your kid that's why you're going

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
my kid played Minecraft

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
for like one year

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
he uses mods

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
mod packs you tell him to get the mods

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
we tried to do mods he've had it on

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
xbox where you couldn't do the mods

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
that's chump shit and then

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
well he was seven

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
at the time so

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
he was a chump

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
but then uh we didn't we couldn't

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
figure out how to make the mods work even if you did it like on a phone or whatever

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
we didn't know how like you have to do on a pc

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
it's hard yeah you gotta get

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
on a pc a real whip-ass

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
dell and spiron okay

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
and then you load it up

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
with a hundred and eighty mod packs

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
and say you can make like computers

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
and systems and that's just just give

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
me chaos and let me turn it into

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
order and then die like a cyber

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
christ

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
just put everything in order

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
slowly like create the system

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
do you ever stream you play in Minecraft

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
no I can't stream it because the whole point

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
is to hide

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I was gonna go watch you play Minecraft one day

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
no because if you watch it you'll just

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
be like what are you doing

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I'll just go to your house

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I'll just walk in circles for hours

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
just show me

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
just for hours

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
you want to watch me

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
just for as long as I want to

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
well I'll bring my laptop

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
it's great do we have a guest next week

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
maybe

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
we'll rebook them

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
what's that

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Steve's back there

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
well if you're available next week

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I'll play Minecraft

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
you can watch until you cry uncle

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
okay I don't want you to do it in front of

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
people if you don't want to

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
no I'll let them

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I'll show you my base

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
I'll show you my current base

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
like I have an elevator it's kind of cool

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I really want to see it

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
we can put like a slow jam beat on it

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
and then you and I can just kind of freestyle

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
across it in Spencer

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
we can narrate

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
I make bases that are hidden from nobody

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
is it

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
there's literally nobody in the universe but me

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
but I don't bother to disguise my bases

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
so I fly up to it

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
and then the mountainside turns into a doorway

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
and then you go into it

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
and still if you didn't know

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
you have to walk up to this wall and then they're fucking like

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I spent days making a piston powered

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
like thing it goes

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
and it pops out and there's a button

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
and you press it and the elevator goes down

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
I want to see this real bad

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
it's so satisfying

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
if I could have that in real life

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
like nobody would ever have any trouble for me

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
all you gotta do is be Batman

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
and just go down to the center of the earth

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
and there would be like three giant things

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
with lasers going into nothingness

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
and spewing out

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
into like an electrical

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
matrix

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
like tons of ore

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
that wasn't coming from anywhere

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
that was being hurt but it was my job

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
to categorize it and funnel it into systems

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
that allowed my base

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
to slowly expand

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I just, before I came here today

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I made a room that makes concrete

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
and I'm like

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
the day that you make a room that makes concrete

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I have a concrete factory

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
this is amazing

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
so it's sand and gravel

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
come out of this thing and then I took the sand and gravel

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
and I funnel it into this thing and I make

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
concrete powder and then it goes into this like

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
fluid transposer and it makes the concrete

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
so then I'm like now I have concrete

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I don't even like Minecraft

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
but I've never been so turned on in my life

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
I looked, I saw a thing

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
and I was like

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
what is that

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
there's like a guru guy

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
who's like a to-do guru

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
or something and he has a system

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
that's like get things done

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
or something like that, I said it

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
there's like a Larry the cable guy

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
yeah, get

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
it's done

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
get Erd done

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I saw his thing and I was like

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
oh shit that's me playing Minecraft

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
he sells this kind of principle

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
where he's like

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
you take chaos

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
and you go through this process

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
where you just take everything

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
it's all about actually licensing yourself

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
to live life

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
unless you're like me

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
but like if you felt like you could

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
walk around and anything that happened to you

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
was therefore valuable

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I think that's what hoarders are

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
thinking where they're like

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
when I watch hoarders

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I'm like I'm so close

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
to like I could see that

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
because it's like

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
imagine where you were so free

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
that every piece of garbage you saw was valuable

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
and then you'd be like let me grab that

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
and then like I'll save it for later

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
but there's like a kink in the system

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
where they're not able to

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
just put it into a thing where

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
there could be boxes within boxes

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
and you could just like go like

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
oh this is my whole life

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
every moment that I'm experiencing

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I'm in charge of it

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
and you're like I don't know

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
can you instead of like

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
you know like avoiding life

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
where you're just like oh I'm going to go back

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
to my laptop

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
sorry

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I hit it by accident

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
what do you think about that

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
don't you think that's deliberate

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
I'm here every week

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
I feel like it's deliberate

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I put my hand down on my iPad

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
and it made a thing happen

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I think he gets jealous and then he like throws these weird

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
they're probably unconscious

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
but it's like he

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
is there a room, is there a space between deliberate

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
but not jealous

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
I know I just actually

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
just put my hand down on the thing

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
alright these kids have school in the morning

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
