--> 01:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:27.000\nWe honor a man today\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:31.000\nwhose Wikipedia page is probably crippled\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nfor 24 hours.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nI know I was all over it in the green room\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:38.000\nso that I could learn the following.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nReally, interesting stuff.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:44.000\nI mean, some tidbits that I didn't know.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nHe invented the typewriter.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:52.000\nHe had suffered from depression when he was a kid.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:55.000\nThere's stories about, you know, that having causes.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:57.000\nObviously, that wasn't a big, you know,\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nmental fitness wasn't like a,\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:02.000\nit wasn't like an understood thing back then.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nI do think it was by the FBI.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nIt's fucking crazy if you knew,\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:09.000\nit's never a good idea for a government\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nto write a letter to a guy saying,\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:14.000\nwe have recordings of you fucking all these women.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nYou should save your, you know,\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:19.000\nthat letter that the FBI wrote to him in his adulthood\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nat the peak of him being targeted by Hoover.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nWhat I didn't know and what Hoover surely knew\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nwhen that letter was sent to him\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nis that he tried to jump out a window\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:29.000\nwhen he was 12 years old.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:30.000\nHe did jump out a window.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:31.000\nHe didn't try.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nHe tried to kill himself.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nAnd, you know, his dad was real hard on him physically.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nBut his dad was, you know, kind of an inspiration to him\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nin terms of like his dad's personality\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nbeing very uncompromising.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:52.000\nIt's a funny thing because here's his dad is like,\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.000\nkind of not afraid to take a stick to somebody,\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nbut at the same time,\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nprobably part and parcel of that persona\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:02.000\nis also why his dad would do these things like,\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nyou know, if somebody called him boy,\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nhe would, you know, he wouldn't lay down for it.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nHe would confront people or he'd walk out of a store\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.000\nthat asked him to go in the back and things like that.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:15.000\nSo he's watching these two things, you know,\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:18.000\nfrom this mythical father.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:23.000\nThat's like both the punisher and the,\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nI mean, it's like the devil and God,\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:26.000\nkind of at the same time.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nThat's kind of interesting.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:31.000\nSomebody should make a biopic about this guy.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:36.000\nWhat other tidbits did I learn?\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nI didn't know that he was born,\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:47.000\nbut his dad changed the names to Martin.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\nI think for him and his son,\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nafter he went in the 30s to Germany,\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nand he was so inspired by the story of Martin Luther,\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nthey actually had birth certificates changed.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:05.000\nTheir name was King, I don't know if it was,\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nbut Martin Luther King Jr. was born Michael\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nand then birth certificate was changed later to Martin,\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nI believe.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nWikipedia.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:18.000\nWikipedia facts about a guy.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nBut imagine, I was realizing,\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:25.000\nthis guy watched JFK get assassinated, right?\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nAnd there's lots of quotes.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nIf you go through the MLK quotes for your Instagram,\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nyou can see all the, you scroll down,\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:38.000\nyou see a fair share of real Christ-like,\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:42.000\ngoing to the spiritual mattress in terms of,\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:46.000\nunless you're willing to die for something,\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nit doesn't matter kind of stuff.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nMore than one quote about that,\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\nyou have to know that this guy,\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nmore than anybody ever,\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:00.000\nhe kind of had to make peace with that idea\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nand probably going to get,\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nI'm very likely to get assassinated.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:10.000\nThe president of the United States died,\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:14.000\nhe watched it happen during this turbulent time,\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:19.000\nand it's like, okay, so what am I going to hide behind?\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nJust imagine that, I can't even,\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:27.000\ndid who died first, RFK or MLK?\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nNo, RFK is on second.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:35.000\nI'm wondering if he also watched Bobby Kennedy get shot.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nOh yeah, I don't know what ordered Bobby and...\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nHonestly, once the president is just in a motorcade,\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nit's just like kaboom, and then you're like,\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nyou're a civil rights activist,\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nthe FBI is trying to make you kill yourself.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nI mean, you have to be just like,\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nthere must be almost maybe the only good news of that\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nis that maybe you get to wake up in the morning\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nso get over that or don't.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nIf I leave the house today,\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nit's because I got a mission,\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:05.000\nbecause if my objective is safety,\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nthen I guess I should shut the fuck up\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nand hide under a rock,\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nand they'll probably still find me.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nThis reminds me very much of Gethsemane\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nand that U2 song.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nAll right, so anyways, there's a...\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:23.000\nNothing should remind anybody of any U2 song.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nI fucking hate U2.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nWhy is there U2 on my...\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nI didn't download it, it's on my fucking...\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nOh yeah.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nI don't know how to get rid of it.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nIt's on there like a Sharpie written on your hand.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nYou have to wash it for the rest of your life.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nThat was like 15 years ago.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nI know.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nI just turned my music on in my car,\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nand I got...\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nI'm like, what the fuck did I do to U2?\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:53.000\nAll right, the latest...\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nNo, I'm not done, Dan.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nHow do you hijack my iPad?\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nSomebody's air-dropping...\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nOh, no.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nIt's a meme that says,\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\ntwo Jews, one brain.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nOh, no.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nMaybe the Jews aren't as smart as the whole person?\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nOr is it a reference to...\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nWas there air-dropping you?\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nYou know...\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nWas that person here?\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nLet's bring them up.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nWhy?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nIf you're here, I'm joking.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nOh, it's like...\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nWell, now I just promoted them,\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nbut also it might be worth noting that\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nit's a comedy podcast.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nOh.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nIt's a comedy podcast, two Jews, one brain.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nSo now...\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nWe assume that the titular Jews are probably\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nokay saying\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\ntwo Jews, one brain, if they're...\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nWe're...\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nI don't know.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nI'm not willing to get that comfortable yet.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nI'm still on edge.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nI saw a hand globe so they're here,\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nbut I'm not sure I'd want to fucking...\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nYeah, I don't think that's how you should get\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nyour podcast signal boosted.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nYou don't just get to be...\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nI think you should be targeted by the FBI\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nfor a while or something.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nI don't mind if it's a good podcast,\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nbut I don't want...\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nThere are people who are sitting in their seats going,\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nlike, oh, what do I got to do?\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nI feel like...\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nA dollar, right?\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nA dollar, you know?\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nLike, what is this world where\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nthe squeaky wheel gets the grease?\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nYeah, I don't know. I don't know nice people.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nI don't know what to tell you.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nSo there's a podcast...\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nI'm not going to promote this shit.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nThat's good. I believe...\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nI mean, the joke's on them.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nThey're never going to make any money in podcasting.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nIt might actually be their punishment\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nif we direct a little bit of traffic to them\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nenough to keep them from getting real jobs.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nAnd let's just remind everybody,\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nit's called Three Jews, Four Brains.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nSo go to ThreeJewsFourBrains.com\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nHashtag\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nThreeJewsFourBrains.com\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nI will signal boost a couple of things.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nThere's just Netflix things.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nThis is our next segment that we'll bring on our guests.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nThis is...\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nDan Harmon's life now\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:14.000\nis sitting in bed watching Netflix.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nAll right.

No, the camel's\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\ngoing through a needle.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nSo the camel doesn't get into heaven at all.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nThey just put through a needle. No, that's not on the table for the camel.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nCamels go to heaven, but they're just using\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\ncamels as a metaphor. Right.

It'd be like putting\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\na key on a key chain.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nThat's what they just didn't have key chains.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nThey're like, it's harder\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nfor a rich man to get into heaven than it is to put\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\na key in a new key chain. Yeah, it's harder\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nfor a rich man to get into heaven... If you don't have\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nfingernails.

True. The jars\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nkind of open though. They make goats like every day.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nThey make like new goats in a lab\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nevery day. They're doing that already.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nThey finally did some human cloning\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nin China, I think recently, which is\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\na benchmark I've always been watching because\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nI always wanted to be the first person to do\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\na human clone. Like, I'm not a scientist\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nor anything. I just wanted to.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nLike, accidentally? Well, no, on purpose.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nI always wanted to clone myself and just be like,\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nhey, I did it guys. I'm the clone guy.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nI'm the guy who cloned humans successfully.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nHa, ha, you know, like\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nan instant clone or would you just be like\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\n60 and there would be like a 30 year old Spencer\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nprobably that coming out of a Petri dish.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nNo, I'd give it a couple of years\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nand be like, check out this baby. That's\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nme. I bet you're wondering\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nhow I got here.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nAnd your baby's going to have the\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nunreliable narrator skill.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nThat would be nice.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nI don't, I don't want to, I don't want\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nto, I don't want to pick baby\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nbaby skills. I don't want either, but\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nsomebody will.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nIt's going to happen no matter what. It's inevitable.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nI'm kind of, I'm distracted by the thing\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nthat you, you brought up though, like this idea\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nof like being in heaven and then there's this\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nbutton and you go, this\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nidea of like getting to a point where\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nyou're like, I've done it all for real.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nLike there's nothing I can experience anymore.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nAnd then there's this button that says\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nstarted over.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nLet me, let me be, let me be honest here. This was\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\ninspired. I just\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nstarted watching The Good Place and I just got through the first\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nseason. So like that kind of happened in there\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\na little bit. That kind of, and, and you know,\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nso. But it's interesting because it's like a\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nsci-fi or even a sitcommy\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nlike way into like thinking about like, oh,\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nwell, what if the God that, that made\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nthe universe is just like kind of, yeah,\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nit's like, I mean, what's the difference, right?\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nIt's like you just, you're just doing this, this weird\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nthing where you're like, well, it's not going to be fun if I remember\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nanything. And then you're like,\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nwell, you're going to learn everything, right?\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nBecause it's heaven and it'll be great.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nLike you, if you're going to get fatigued, heaven fatigue,\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nyou taught me that.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nSo yeah, that's the cure to heaven fatigue\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nis you push the reset button.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nYeah. You're not tired anymore because\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nyou forgot you were tired. But in dog heaven,\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nyou're saying that dogs, it's just\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\ndogs, right? It's just dogs. They don't have\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nany buttons. But who's going to throw the ball\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nor, you know, do the thing?\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nThe ball gets thrown. The ball just, they\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\ndon't care who throws the dog. It could be\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nanother giant dog throwing the ball.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nThey don't care.

Yeah, they think\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nwe're, they think we're like bears, I think.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nI think dogs think we're bears.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nI think we're bears. I think\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\ndogs think that we're bears that think\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nthey're bears. Right. And they think\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nthey're the lucky dog who the bears think\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nthey're a bear too. Yeah. But they all,\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nthat's why dogs all get along, essentially.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nLike some of them are like, fuck you,\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nbut I think they're like, like, like,\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\ndon't tell them we're dogs! Right. That's it.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nYou're letting on! Yeah.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nBut most of them, like, when they're sniffing each other's\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nbutts, that's them going like, do they think\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nyou're a bear? Yeah, of course they do. Otherwise, they'd be\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nfeeding us. And they're like, this is what bears do, right?\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nThey sniff each other's butts, and it's just a show.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nBecause that's the thing in the wild that\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nlooks the most like, in a\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\ndog's, you know, it's like, they were\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nbig hairy, or like weird things\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nthat grow, like\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nwalk around on hind legs, and like,\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nif you fuck with our babies, we'll\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nkill you.

Yeah, if bears\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nstarted, if bears started feeding\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\ndogs first, we wouldn't even have dogs.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nWe wouldn't have dogs. Wait, wait.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nYeah.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nIf we, if we,\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nI missed the top of that.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nIf we weren't around, bears would\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nhave dogs? No, if bears started feeding\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\ndogs first, let's say, bears\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nstarted sharing your salmon with a dog.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nWe wouldn't even have dogs. Let's say\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nyou're walking your dog who thinks you're a bear\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nthat didn't\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\neat you because they thought\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nyou thought it was a bear too.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nLet's say you're walking through Yosemite National\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nPark and a bear goes by\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nand like, with your dog.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nYou're with your dog in Yosemite and a bear comes by.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nYeah, and the dog would be like\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nhey, like fucking, let's, let's hang out\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nwith that guy. Well, that's why in bear attacks\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nyou never, the dog never\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nprotects the person. They're like\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nshit, bear war.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nThere's only one loser\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nhere. I'm headed for them.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nI'm grabbing the marshmallows\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nand I'm out of here.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nThis is where my four legs come\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nin handy. I could leg it out of here.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nI just became an outdoors dog.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nCommence\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nworld's longest walk.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nRight.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nOkay, another scenario. You're walking your dog.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nDan, you're out in Yosemite National Park\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nand you're walking Harvey around.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nYou're golden doodle and\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nyou see a wolf. Yeah.\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nAnd what is\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nI don't know. I mean, you're poking holes at my theory.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nWhat about coyotes?\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nI mean, what are they\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:08.000\nsaying? We got coyotes right behind\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nmy back wall right now. They're just\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nlike right there. I still haven't seen\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\none. My dog sitter saw one\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nwhen we were out of town.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nThey cross my street all the time in a pack\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nand they come down two different streets\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nbecause they're surrounding\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nThey're like the sharks and the jets. They're going to have\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\na rumble. Yeah.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nYou're never alone. You're never disconnected.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nBut it's so cramped.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nIn my neighborhood, some of the coyotes\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nare Puerto Ricans\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nand some are just\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nsome coyotes are Puerto Ricans.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nI guess that's true.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nLike genetically and\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\ngeographically. I'm doing one\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nstory joke. Oh, I see.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nSondheim, remember?\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nBut they hunt\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nand patch and they all come down this\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\none street\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\ndown from the convent that I think Katy Perry bought\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nand\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nthey come down this one road\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nand then they all split up\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nand they all just fan out\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\nlike the blue angels.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nAnd then 10 minutes later\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nyou hear the sound of an animal dying\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nand then you hear a bunch of people\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nscreaming and then I open my window\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nand look out and you see people\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\njust throwing shit at these coyotes\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nwho were running off with their animal.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nYou can track it like this\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nevery time?

specifically\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nwhich was like an official FBI\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nprogram it was like sent to\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\ndestroy\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.000\nblack

you can attach a drug to a\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:54.000\npopulation then there's always a reason\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nto throw them in jail whenever you see them\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nalso yeah and you turn around and make the laws\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nthat are more specifically punitive towards\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nthe things you've introduced into\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nthe community it's a lot\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nand it created a generation gap\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nand a lot of that is part of\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nwhy\n\n59:10.000

--> 01:49:22.000\nmatrix\n\n01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000\nlike tons of ore\n\n01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000\nthat wasn't coming from anywhere\n\n01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000\nthat was being hurt but it was my job\n\n01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000\nto categorize it and funnel it into systems\n\n01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000\nthat allowed my base\n\n01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000\nto slowly expand\n\n01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000\nI just, before I came here today\n\n01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000\nI made a room that makes concrete\n\n01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nand I'm

funnel it into this thing and I make\n\n01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000\nconcrete powder and then it goes into this like\n\n01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000\nfluid transposer and it makes the concrete\n\n01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000\nso then I'm like now I have concrete\n\n01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000\nI don't even like Minecraft\n\n01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000\nbut I've never been so turned on in my life\n\n01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000\nI looked, I saw a thing\n\n01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000\nand I was like\n\n01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000\nwhat is that\n\n01:50:10.000 -->

thing where\n\n01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000\nthere could be boxes within boxes\n\n01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000\nand you could just like go like\n\n01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000\noh this is my whole
