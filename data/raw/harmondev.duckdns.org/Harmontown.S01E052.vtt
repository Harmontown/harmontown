{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.000\nHello everybody, welcome to Meltdown.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:33.000\nHarmontown is once again in session.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:37.000\nYou lucky little devils.\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:41.000\nOnce you welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown,\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:52.000\nDan Harmon.\n\n00:52.000 --> 01:00.000\nDan Harmon.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:03.000\nThank you. Where do we start?\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:05.000\nDan, where's your belt?\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:08.000\nI forgot to wear a belt because I've been off my diet for so long.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:12.000\nThe Easter thing, I don't know, there was some point where Aaron and I\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:16.000\nslipped off of the wagon and allowed ourselves to just start.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:21.000\nI've been cheating on my diet quote unquote for multiple days into weeks\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:25.000\nand this morning I put on a pair of pants and I was like, I don't need a belt.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:28.000\nThat bowl of Cheetos last night was your belt.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nYeah, exactly. Belts are for closers.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:36.000\nBut I forgot that jeans kind of, they expand over time.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:42.000\nSo if I dance too much, these will come right around my ankles.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nWe must enforce that then.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:52.000\nNo, no, no. And your little chicken dance is perfectly designed to me.\n\n01:52.000 --> 02:03.000\nAlso, my underwear also down around my ass.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:07.000\nSo these guys got an eye load.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:10.000\nCome on, let's bring them down.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:16.000\nWhoa.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:22.000\nFuck the queen.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\nYou mean the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher died?\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nDid she, you know who else died?\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.000\nAw, you don't give a fuck about Margaret Thatcher.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:34.000\nAw, no, you should care about Annette Putticello. She died.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nNow say aw.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:39.000\nYeah, Margaret Thatcher booed.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:41.000\nDon't boo a stroke. A stroke is a bummer.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:43.000\nRoger Ebert died.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nHey!\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nA guy who only got more and more awesome as he got older.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:50.000\nHe did, yeah.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nSo on one hand it was like Mission Accomplished.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:56.000\nHe really knocked it out of the park in terms of being a guy.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nI'm out of breath from making my pants fall down.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:04.000\nJust milestones. This is a show about milestones.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.000\nThat's how I feel about Roger Ebert. We kind of got to watch him die.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:13.000\nHe made no bones about that and kind of made it very enjoyable.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:18.000\nHe owned up to his role as a curmudgeon as he got older and older.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nHe became more and more of an expert in what he was talking about.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nHe got more and more bored with unremarkability.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:31.000\nBut stayed a civic-minded, progressive, interesting essayist.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:35.000\nI was constantly reading and filling his brain with stuff and filtering it\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nand giving it out to people who had totally seamlessly adapted his role\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nfrom a Chicago Sun-Times movie reviewer to an online presence.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:50.000\nHe was more facile than most 25-year-olds in terms of being out there and online.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nThen he died.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nHe kind of wrote a thing saying,\n\n03:54.000 --> 04:02.000\noh, I got cancer in my leg or whatever. I'm going to hang back for a second\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nand I'll see you guys in a couple of days and then he died.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:08.000\nIt's sad. I don't know. It's a bummer.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:11.000\nIt's weird because there's a million people die every day.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:16.000\nHorribly. By machete that are totally undeserving.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nHorrible, horrible, unjust deaths happen.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:24.000\nThen it's like, oh, Billy Crystal. We kind of look back on the life of a clown.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nIt's kind of dumb because it's like, well, fuck it, he died rich.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nBilly Crystal didn't die.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:37.000\nI think it's just because celebrities spend their lives as an antenna\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nand a frame drawing our attention.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nWe get to talk about them.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nIf you're a celebrity that's famous for being a slut,\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nwe get to talk about sluttiness.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nThat famous slut, it's like a tarot card, an archetype.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nIf you're famous for being funny and you're famous for it,\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\nand they tell little stories, oh, this guy was famous for being rich\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nand then he's famous for being poor, he's famous for fucking a dog,\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:02.000\nand they're non-people, they're ghosts.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nThen when they die, we go, oh, he died.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:10.000\nIt's kind of weird because we don't go, oh, Lebanon is on fire?\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nWe don't do that.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nIt's like when Patrick Swayze died. That was a bummer.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:18.000\nOh, man. Holy shit. Good segue, buddy.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nFrom death to Roadhouse.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:23.000\nOur assigned movie was Roadhouse.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:26.000\nAnybody watch Roadhouse this week?\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:27.000\nWell done.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nWell, you know my rule, Jeff, from doing a show.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:30.000\nYeah?\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:31.000\nBe nice.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nUntil...\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nIt's time not to be nice.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nIt's time to be not nice? How do they word that?\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nIt doesn't come off right. Roadhouse.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:41.000\nBe nice. Until it's time...\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:44.000\nRoadhouse, which I've never seen, is one of the few that's crazy.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nIt's weird that it slipped through my cracks,\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nbut I think the reason it did is the same reason it's so fascinating.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\nThere's still a couple of beavers, but it's chocolate.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nIt's slipping through my cracks.\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:01.000\nGet a hold of yourselves.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nI tried to push past it.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nYou guys got to help me out.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nThe show will be three hours long.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:13.000\nIt's a show that kind of falls between the quantum definitions\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nof a lot of the things that we use to define a movie.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nLike, is it a good movie or a bad movie?\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nIs it an action movie or a drama?\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nIt's very odd.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nThe only thing you know for sure is it's a vehicle\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:32.000\nfor this debonair young Starlet Patrick...\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nSwayzing.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nHe's a star.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nWell, I mean, it's a very...\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nHis hair says Starlet, but his muscles say star.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nOne of the things that's very charming about it is\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nit has this very, very kind of uplifting message to it.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nHe's a guy that likes to be nice, as he says.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nIt's also, as a 21st century progressive,\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nyou have to be behind the movie\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nbecause it's the gayest movie you've ever seen.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nBut it's kind of dishonestly gay, I guess,\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nbecause it's sort of saying,\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:07.000\nthis is a very manly movie.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nIt's not a gay movie at all.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:10.000\nSo is that a crime\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nor is that actually a heroic move?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:13.000\nI don't know.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nIt's kind of a motif, like in 80s films,\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nlike Top Guns, notoriously really fruity.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nYeah.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nAnd then the manliest stuff back then, I guess.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nYeah, she said like that.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nWho's the woman? Kelly?\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nWhat's her name? Kelly Lynch.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nWas it Chris McKenna who said last night?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nYeah, she's a vestigial...\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\nOh, it was at you.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nShe's a vestigial female character.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:33.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nShe's just there to go through the motions.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nIt's always like even the hair and makeup people\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\non the set of the movie were like,\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.000\nwell, whatever.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nLike, what are we doing here?\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nLet's talk about Patrick's peach,\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nAizad shirt, you know,\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nand how tucked in it should be.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nThere is a scene when, in Roadhouse,\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nif you guys will recall,\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nwhen Patrick Swayze is doing Tai Chi.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nI'm sitting in Tai Chi.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nI wanted to talk about this.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nHe's certainly doing kattas or whatever,\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nand he's there along the riverbank,\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nand he's moved in on a...\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nthe world's best apartment in a barn.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:13.000\nIt's a beautiful Soho loft in a barn in Kansas,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nso wherever they are.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nAnd, or Missouri?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nAre they Missouri?\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nKansas, somewhere outside Kansas.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nKansas City, Missouri?\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nYeah.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nYeah.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nKansas City is split.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nThat river might be the Mississippi.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nBetween the barn and Benzara's house\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nmight be the Mississippi.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nIt's a metaphorical river.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nI mean, it's...\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nBut I don't know what it's a metaphorical river.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nThe river Jordan.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nI think it's narrative laziness.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nIt's the old man river.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nHe goes to buy an apartment,\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nand he's driving down the road in his car,\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nand he buys a shitty car\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nbecause he doesn't want his Benz to get fucked up\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nbecause he knows his car will get fucked up.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:48.000\nAnd he buys a shitty car,\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nand there's a wistful drive down a country lane,\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nand it's just him going apartment shopping,\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nand it goes to a barn,\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nand it's this beautiful apartment inside\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nwith a great big window,\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nwhich, of course, someone's going to go through\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nbecause it's a roadhouse.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nThere's going to be a fire,\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nand every window must get gone through.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:09.000\nIt's fenestration at all times.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nAnd across the river is Bencazara's mansion,\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nwhich is hilarious.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nThat is the weirdest thing.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nHe moves in.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nIt's like if Luke Skywalker,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nafter Mos Eisley,\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nif Hansel is like,\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nwell, first thing's first.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nLet's find an apartment,\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nand they got one across from the Death Star.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nI'm like, what's that?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nWhat's that moon over there?\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nThat's no moon.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nThat's our neighbor.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nYou're Death Star adjacent.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nAnd so he's doing Tai Chi,\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nand he's well-oiled,\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nand it's either sunrise or sunset,\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:40.000\nbut the lighting is great.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nAnd then Bencazara goes by on an ATV,\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.000\nand he gets a smile like, hmm.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:48.000\nAnd who's the club owner\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nthat hires Dalton at the beginning?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nI don't know who that actor is,\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nbut anyone know the actor's name?\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nJohn Locke's dad from Lost.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nWow.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nJohn Locke's dad from Lost.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nJohn Locke's dad from Lost.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nThe stakes for that guy\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nis simply, can I have muscular men\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\naround me at all time?\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nHe loves Patrick Swayze.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nHe even loves some of the bad guys.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nHe's still conflicted, and like,\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nthere's so much gay energy,\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nbut it's not, it's proudly gay.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nAny time a girl gets up on the table\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nand starts taking her shirt off,\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nlike, hey, get out.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.000\nPatrick Swayze only drinks coffee,\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nand he just doesn't do

like...\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nIt's bad business.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nBut also, I don't think he gets it.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nHe's like, naked women, what?\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nWhat do they think of next?\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nOkay, but the scene that Jeff's describing,\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nI wanted to talk about this particularly.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:46.000\nIf we talk about nothing else,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nbecause you guys are majority of the audience,\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:50.000\nI want you to watch this movie\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nand get out your little GIF programs.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nI want to see somebody's going to make a GIF\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nof this, an animated GIF\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nof the part of a roadhouse,\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nwhere Patrick Swayze is doing Tai Chi in the morning\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nat the bank of the river\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nthat lies between him and the villain.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nAnd then it cuts to...\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nIt's just a lot of coverage\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nof Patrick Swayze doing Tai Chi.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nAnd then the villain is out drinking\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nlike mimosas or something,\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nand it's watching him.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nAnd the expression on his face is just like,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nhuh, I'll be done.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:24.000\nWhen he's doing Tai Chi,\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nhe's on the veranda watching him.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nAnd he's been watching,\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nwhen he's fucking Kelly Lynch,\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:30.000\nthat's when he's on the ATV.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nAnd he sees them, he pulls up,\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nand he's watching them fuck, right?\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nThe other way around.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nOh, the other way around.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nOkay, so Tai Chi, he's on the ATV.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nAnd when they're fucking, he's on the veranda.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:41.000\nOkay, so the bad guy's doing a drive-by\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:42.000\non his four-wheeler,\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nand he's watching his nemesis\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\ndo Tai Chi in his shirt off.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nAny time Patrick Swayze takes his shirt off,\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nthere's a guy regarding him.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nTwo guys in this case.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nThen it cuts to his landlord,\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nand it becomes like a he-haw sketch,\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nwhere his landlord is like watching him,\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\ngoing, huh, I'll be tired.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nIt's so weird and joyful.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nIt's got a very joyful energy.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nIt reminds me a lot of Xanadu.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:08.000\nWhat genre of movie is this?\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nAll you really know is that someone\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nsomewhere along this weird pipeline\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nwas having so much fun\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nthat it almost didn't get contaminated\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nby the entire movie-making process.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nBut of course, story structure,\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\ncharacter arcs, logic.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nNone of that's there,\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nbut the joy is still in the final cup\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nof what you drink.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nThis movie from the outset\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\ntakes place in a world where\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nbar bouncing is a high-stakes,\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\ndramatic business\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nwith all kinds of codes\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nand countercodes,\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:45.000\nand it's possible to be a sell-out bouncer,\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nor a bouncer with integrity.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nI guess in that age...\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nBut then we find out,\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nwe find that very subtly and very slowly,\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nthat the reason why he's all about being nice\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nand playing by the rules is because\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nhe ripped a man's throat out.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nHe had killed a man by ripping his throat out,\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nand then he does it again.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nAnd he almost does it a third time.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nAnd he does the three-finger claw thing,\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nand he's going to rip another throat out.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nThere's also a dead poet society moment\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nwith shotguns.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nIt's like, exactly...\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nIn the third act,\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nthere's a moment where it's identical\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nto the end of Dead Poets Society early.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nInstead of standing on desks,\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nwith shotguns.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nAnd then...\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nIt's a weird movie.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nIt takes place in a weird world,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nand I more than three times\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\ncalled out in a false set of ways,\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nI'm going to die!\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nWhich is a sign of a great movie experience.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nFor me, for my money,\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nI have to start with Sam Mele.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nBecause Sam Mele gets hair in this.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nSam Mele enters the movie\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nan hour into the movie,\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nor 45 minutes in. He comes in late.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nThat's when the movie begins.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nIs Jason McCarris here?\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nJason, can you come up for a second?\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nJason is a friend who came to the show tonight,\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nand he texted me.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nThat's a pretty...\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nPretty hesitant applause.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nJason McCarris, everybody.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nThank you.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nJason is a pedophile,\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nand he wants...\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nWhy did you applaud like that?\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nThat's one of the first round of applause.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nMaybe he's a pedophile, we don't know.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nThe...\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nYou texted me right before he came to the show.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nYou said that for some reason you were on the set of Rogue House.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nI was, I was.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nI just wanted to mention with the gay through line thing,\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nand you were mentioning the claw and ripping out the throat and everything,\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nthat the guy he's fighting with\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nactually says to him, I used to fuck guys like you in prison.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nYeah, that's the line.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nThat's called burying the lead.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nBecause that line happens almost\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\non the fifth to last page.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nI used to fuck\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nguys like you in prison.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nBut honestly,\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nI was like, Patrick Swayze,\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nhe's a very charming guy,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nbut he's not...\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nI didn't remember him as being like,\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nwe didn't go like, oh, that guy,\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nhe's...\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nI'm not even insinuating that Patrick Swayze,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nthe human being,\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nI don't care if he was in or out of the closet\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nor around it or whatever.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nActors are all crazy, whatever floats their boat.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nThey all fuck fish and children or whatever.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nIt's an insane job.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nThey lie for a living to themselves\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nand to God.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nSo the good ones are good and the bad ones are bad\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nand sometimes you find out, oh, he likes to\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nput his dick in a flower.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nWho cares?\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nBut I'm just saying the on-screen icon\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nthat is Patrick Swayze, he was...\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nIt didn't just take place because dirty dancing\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\ncame out like right before that.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nAnd we checked Ghost after we watched this\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nbecause we were like, is this a thing?\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nAnd I watched Ghost and he was like,\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nshot very differently and acting very differently.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nTo get into character, he kind of had a sort of\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nsachet to him and like...\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nI don't know, maybe that's the director's fault.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nI did say I was on the set.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nI just moved to California from\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nConnecticut and was movie nut.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nAnd it was the first time I ever saw a set.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nAnd I've never been on set before.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nAnd it was the double deuce.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nIt was a facade, complete facade.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nIt's not real?

Spencer my cake,\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nand then my cab driver immediately\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nmade a U-turn and got T-boned\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nby a car in the intersection.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nAnd Spencer was like, you couldn't tie.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:41.000\nNo, well, think about it this way.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nOh, stop, stop, stop,

23:51.000\nI was going to have him turn around,\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nbut I mean, if you wouldn't have been standing there...\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nSpencer, your alcoholism saved the day.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nYou may have saved my life\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nbecause I was like, oh, there's Spencer.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nI'll walk back with him instead of having that driver\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\npull back around.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nIt was pretty weird.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nOkay, before we bring up...\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nActually, I want to bring up Camille,\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nbecause maybe he might have something to say about this.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nLet's bring out Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nI don't know\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nif Camille has...\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nI want to talk about Skeletor.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nFrom the He-Man universe.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nI've got opinions.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nSkeletor...\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nI've...\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nI've been researching.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nBecause I always thought this was the case\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nwhen I was a kid.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nI would watch it as a rerun\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nor whatever, after school.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nIt would be like between Inspector Gadget\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nand Morgan Mindy or something like that.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nAnd I always thought this was the case,\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nbut as a 40-year-old, I recently looked back into this.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:52.000\nSkeletor from the He-Man universe.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nAntagonist.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nThe Antagonist, the Darth Vader of the He-Man universe.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nHe-Man, for those of you who don't know,\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nwas the alter ego of...\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nPrince Adam.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nOf an identical man\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nwith a shirt on named Prince Adam.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:07.000\nWho also had a very idiosyncratic looking.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nThey had the same animal also.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:12.000\nYeah, I mean, as if having the same head and body...\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nYeah, what could it be?\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nHe also accompanied the same...\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nThere's only one giant green cat\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nin this kingdom.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nYeah, Skeletor was the Darth Vader\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nto this character, this universe,\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nEternia, I think was the name of the world.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nYeah, I always...\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nRemember, Skeletor\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nlived in a place called Snake Mountain.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nThat's correct.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:36.000\nHe was obsessed with beating He-Man.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nYep.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nAnd He-Man's mentor or, you know...\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nThe sorceress.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nHis Athena, the sorceress,\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nwho had eagle hair\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nand a beak head or something.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nAnd she lived in a place called\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nCastle Grayskull.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nThat's correct.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nAnd Skeletor was always going on and on\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nabout how he wanted to be\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nin Castle Grayskull.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nWhich seemed appropriate.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nAnd I looked it up.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nBecause Snake Mountain sounds like a terrible place.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nLike, don't buy a house at Snake Mountain.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nSkeletor used to live\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nin Castle Grayskull\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\naccording to the mythology of the...\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nWait, he couldn't pay the rent?\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nWhat happened?\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nHe got, like, evicted.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nHe got, like...\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nHe got evicted from Castle Grayskull.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nYou're saying this is the origin story.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nHe didn't get, like, a slip on his door.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nYou have to pay the rent, but I can't pay the rent.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nHe used to live in Castle Grayskull.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nYeah.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nI guess I didn't know that.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nWell, speaking of, like...\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nIt's his rightful home.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nOh, he used to live there.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nHe didn't live there with them. He lived there on his own.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nIt was his place.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nIt's a skull.

moment.\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:54.000\nIt's fun guy.\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.000\nThat's me as Christopher\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nand Breffi.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nYou should dodge.\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\nYou do dodge.\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nYou feel something come\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nwithin inches of your face.\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nBut, uh,\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nI feel something come\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:12.000\nwithin inches of my face.\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nIs this still the black pillar?\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nSo I dodged\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:18.000\nI dodged whatever.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nNo, no, he dodged, uh,\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nChristopher.\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nYou got it right in your eye.\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nThat's not so.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nThat's not so.\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nAlright, so he's down here.\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nSo Breffi, what the fuck?\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:34.000\nWe are being attacked\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nright now!\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nWhat advice do you have to give us for the phantom fungus?\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nYou get hit in the face.\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nSee?\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nI dodged.\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nYou feel an invisible presence hit you in the face.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nI should have just stayed up on that column.\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:50.000\nThat's true.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nYou take six damage.\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nSharpie, do you have any ideas?\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nUh, yeah, I cast Mage Armor.\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nThat's a good idea.\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nOn everybody?\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:02.000\nNope.\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nIt only works on him.\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nIt increases your AC by four.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nThat makes you harder to hit.\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nAll of us?\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\nNope, just him.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nIt's an investment.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.000\nUh, I take\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nmy rope\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nand I\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:24.000\ntie the end\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:26.000\nto your feet.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:28.000\nI tie the end like a loop, like a lasso.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:30.000\nAnd I\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nget out of the way, everyone!\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.000\nMy friends get out of the way.\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\nAnd I start whipping it around in the circle.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:38.000\nWait, do you ever tell us how long the rope is?\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.000\nSo that we're out of the\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:42.000\nradius of it.\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.000\nIt's 12 feet.\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:46.000\nAlright, let's go 13 feet, everyone.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nCovered in column cum.\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:50.000\nI'll hold my hand.\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.000\nCareful, everyone.\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nI'll take care of this.\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\nI'm going to detect the phantom creatures with my\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.000\nrope tracker.\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.000\nWhy are you looking at me like that?\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.000\nNo, I'm watching.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nAnd I start whipping it\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:06.000\naround in a circle.\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:08.000\nAnd everyone thinks\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nI'm doing a good job.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nShe's doing great at that.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:14.000\nIs rope tracker a thing?\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:16.000\nNo, it's not.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:18.000\nThe premise is if there was\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:20.000\nan invisible entity in the way,\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nthe rope would interact with it.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\nSo I will know where the phantom\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:26.000\nfungi are.\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nBut she doesn't have a thing in her\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nsheet that says rope tracker.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nI'm calling it my rope tracker.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nOh, she's calling it.\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nThat's why I'm laughing.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nYou're making up\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.000\nyou're like a he-man.\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:42.000\nIt's just my rope, I'm naming it.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.000\nLike I named Coco.\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nYou feel your ropes slap against\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nsomething invisible.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nCan I do use\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.000\nrapid shot and fire an arrow?\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:54.000\nNo, don't just fire again.\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nWe're going to get out of this without fighting it.\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nBut these are fungi that are going to\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\neat her faces.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nHey, but look at the name.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nThey're attacking us.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nThey're funguses.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nAll right, funguses.\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nI\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\ntake out my poison dagger\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.000\nand I sniff it, which most people\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\ndon't know gets me slightly high, but also gives\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nme, I can see invisible things.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nYeah, you wish.\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nThat'd be cool. You can believe\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:24.000\nthat's true. Maybe, can he\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nsee where my rope tracker\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:28.000\nlanded? You can all see where it hit.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nSo you can see where it hit something.\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.000\nI hit right there. Yeah, I did.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:34.000\nI take out my poison dagger.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nThat's where it hit.\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nI can't\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nI can't detect sarcasm.\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:44.000\nAnd I hurl it at\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:46.000\nthe funguses.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nThe sarcasm?\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nNo. That is not a constructive thing\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nto use.\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nHe flips it around.\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nBy poison dagger.\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nOkay, so you're throwing the poison dagger.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nThrow that poison dagger?\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nOkay.\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nWhipping back quickly, you strike.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nYou fling the poison dagger\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nwith great grace and swift\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nmisalakrity. They're slightly\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nimpressed. Yeah.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nMore than slightly. They're fucking\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nimpressed. In the place that you think\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nthat the phantom fungus must be.\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nIt does not hit. Fuck.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nCan someone go get my dagger?\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nSpencer, what is weapon\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nfocus? Weapon focus\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nmakes you\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nbetter at hitting with the weapon that you have.\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nShit, I should have known that.\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nCan I still detect, even though I'm covered\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nin the fungus? You know where the rope\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nhit, whether or not the creature is still there\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nat this point. I don't think the thing is in your face\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nstill. I think it just hit you and moved on, right?\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nIs Mulrainee still swinging her\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nrope tracker?

Would it help with this?\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nThis is invisible.

01:07:22.000\nI get on the back of Coco.\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nI don't think that's a good idea.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nIt's like you feel like you've been there

01:07:36.000\nYeah, you can.\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nI can move...\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nI was gonna say I can move silently,\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nbut that won't make a difference to a fire, right?\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nIt certainly wouldn't.\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nI hide from the fire by closing my eyes.\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nAccording to Denial,\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nin Backdraft, it's a living thing.\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nAll right, well, I try and reason with it, then.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nYou form some compelling arguments,\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nbut it's not soaking in.\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nIs it good to flee these columns?\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nOr is there more to be gained from these columns?\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nWas anything ever gained from these columns?\n\n01:08:08.000 -->

01:08:24.000\nOkay, so there's nothing to be gained.\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nWell, Breffi, where should we...\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nWhere to?\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nWe should get away from the fire.\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nWho are you?\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nBreffi sounds like a character in an old CD-ROM game.\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nI feel like we should keep him around with us.\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nLike Oregon Trail?\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nI'd like to buy three pounds of bacon.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nI'd love to Oregon Trail.\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nMe too, great game.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nSo, can I also run with these guys?\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nOh, yeah, I'd recommend it.\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nI do it.\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nNice.\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nYou guys are fleeing the fire.\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nCan I go and get my dagger?\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nI get my dagger and then I run.\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nAll right, we flee.\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nHurriedly fleeing from the fire.\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nYou find yourself amidst something I'm going to read.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nSweet.\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nThe fire is far away now,\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nbut you're still within the thicket of columns.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nAnd as you can see,\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nthere are woven between the black shadowy trees,\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nsticky braid-like nets\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nand meshes of shivering white webbing,\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nwhich stands out in stark contrast\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nto the dull grays and blacks of the plain.\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nThe webbing envelops the entire forest\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nfrom this point on,\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nblanketing in thick, ropey strands of silk.\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nYou can see bubble-like pustules on the webby floor,\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nominously pulsing,\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nand the path that Breffi has been leading you down\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nis barred by webs and nets\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nstrung between the trees.\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nBe careful now.\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nWe don't want to disturb any FaZe spiders.\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nYeah, no shit.\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nWhat's their name? FaZe spiders?\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nFaZe spiders.\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nIsn't they FaZe?\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nFaZe.\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nNot like FaZe spiders.\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nOkay, good.\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000\nFaZe spiders sound scarier.\n\n01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nFaZe spiders.\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nOr the FaZe spiders.\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nGuys, I don't want to be a dick, but I don't like Breffi.\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nI don't know. He helps us.\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000\nWhat did he help us do?\n\n01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000\nCan we get rid of Breffi?\n\n01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nHe didn't really help us with the fungus.\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000\nIs he an ear shot of this discussion?\n\n01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000\nYeah, he is.\n\n01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nCan we whisper?\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nI take Breffi.\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nI make a loud sound while you guys discuss it,\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nso he can't hear.\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000\nI take Breffi in Roadhouse fashion.\n\n01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nLady in red.\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000\nI sing that.\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nI take Breffi by the collar\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nif he has a collar on, and I pin him up against\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nlike a tree.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nHis collar is vaguely sticky.\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nOkay, well, it helps me\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000\nhold on to him better.\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nIt definitely does, yeah.\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nI hold him up against the tree and I go, listen Breffi,\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nif you let us into a trap, so help me God,\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nI'll knee you in the nuts, Sam Elliott style.\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nDoes this\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nlook as adorable as I think it looks?\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nThat's\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nyour guys' call.\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nYou should knee him in the nuts just to be safe.\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nAll right, I'll good cop this.\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nHey, man, why would he...\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nNo, Sharpie, stand down!\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000\nWhy would he lead us into a trap by telling us\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nto be careful for phase spiders?\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nWe left the fire\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nand he took us into a phase spider nest.\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nNo, we just ran from the fire\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nand he's warning us about this.\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nWe just thought this was elegant white silk.\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nI mean, should we use\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nthe rope tracker?\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nWell, we know where this stuff is.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nI mean, it's a great invention, but I don't think\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nwe need it every step of the way.\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nIs there a way to get around the phase spider area?\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000\nI mean, why would we have to walk through this?\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nBecause you're getting...\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nHe's a fireman.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nI mean, you could, yeah, you could pick your way away from him.\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nCan I use...\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nIs there a magic beast\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nthat I could summon that could kind of\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nguide us through this area?\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000\nYou can summon nature's allies,\n\n01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nbut they wouldn't be, like, particularly great\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nat guiding you through because they're from a different plane.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nSo...
